                              <span>Hello,
 I just updated from 29.3 to 29.4, and I found out that &quot;M-x restart-emacs&quot; now no longer starts up emacs again after closing it. Has anyone experienced the same issue?

I created a document in Obsidian called &quot;to read&quot; where I store them with title, URL and a copy/pasted bit of text to jog my memory of its contents — but it&#x27;s getting a bit unwieldy and I wonder if there&#x27;s some better system.
I also keep a separate &quot;recreational reading&quot; list in NotePlan. How do you manage your list(s)?</span>

I&#x27;ve been using The Archive as my primary note-taking and knowledge-management tool for the last four years. It + the Zettelkasten method have been genuinely life-changing for me.
I wrote an essay on some of the specific reasons I love using The Archive so much. I&#x27;ve also shared some of the custom Alfred workflows and keyboard shortcuts I use to support The Archive, along with detailed examples.
I thought you all might enjoy the read!

Abusing Haskell: Executable Blog Posts by Sinan
I post my notes on my blog, Hashnode and dev.to, which require slightly different markdown formats. I have been doing the sane thing to fix formats so far. But it is a rainy Sunday and I am bored, so I decided to make this blog post an executable Haskell program to do the same.

                              <span>I&#x27;m writing a program where I have different kinds of events which share the same behavior and I&#x27;d like to store them together in a section with some other information . Is this possible to do in haskell or is there a better more idiomatic way to go about this? Here&#x27;s some pseudo code:
 data eventT1 … data eventT2 … class someClass where … instance someClass eventT1 where … instance someClass eventT2 where … data someData &#x3D; someData { foo :: int , bar :: [someClass] } main &#x3D; do let test &#x3D; someData { foo &#x3D; 1 , bar &#x3D; [eventT1, eventT2] } 
 The compiler complains the bar :: [someClass] part in the declaration of someData.

 I&#x27;ve seen people use a &#x60;--ghc-options&#x60; option when running &#x60;stack build&#x60;, but this same option does not work for me when I run &#x60;stack runghc --ghc-options -ddump-splices myfile.hs&#x60;. Anybody know the best way to achieve this?

                              <span>I have had an init file which I have been using for a few years now. Most of my custom configs are in an org file which is then tangled using org-babel. Up until today I though what happend was :
  
I start emacs, the init file runs 
 it gets to org-babel-load file (code below)
 init.el is generated from org
 init file gets evaluated
  
However, when I was installing on a new machine today, I noticed than not all of the lisp code from the org file was in the generated init.el. Did something change in the newer versions of emacs? (newest machine is 29.4)
 Or have I just been misunderstanding how it worked all this time?
 (org-babel-load-file
 (expand-file-name &quot;init.org&quot;
 &quot;~/.emacs.d/org&quot;)) 
 To resolve the issue I deleted the init.el file and restarted emacs, this time it generated and executed everything. Restarting alone made no difference.

 I&#x27;ve installed emacs-nox in my home directory using a combo of yum download, rpm2cpio and cpio.
 I can get it to start if I export EMACSDATA, EMACSLOADPATH and EMACSDIR, and it kinda works. It complains that it can&#x27;t find it&#x27;s arch-dependent data dir. I&#x27;ve looked for the environmental variable for this, but can&#x27;t find it. Does anyone know?

                              <span>Emacs makes use of a number of Linux-based command-line utilites, such as ls, grep, diff, and so on. However, recently I&#x27;ve started working for a company who has allowed me to have Emacs on my system, and have installed Ubuntu for Windows Subsystem for Linux on their Windows 10 systems.
 Unfortunately, sudo is not an option for my WSL instance, so there&#x27;s no way to add any components (including Emacs or any GUI functionality) to my WSL instance, so I can only download the native Windows portable version of Emacs.
 I know that you can use the WSL commands by prefacing them with bash -s, such as bash -s find -name filename.ext. However, I&#x27;m not sure where I can specify this to Emacs without going through the source to find all the variables containing the commands I need.
 To make this more complicated, I also make use of Vertico and consult (among the other components).
 Is there a single location where I can notify Emacs to add bash -s to the start of shell commands, or perhaps a list of variables that I can add to my .emacs.d tree?

                              <span>I am a newbie programmer and I am trying to get a good emacs config for Python. I am already pretty used to the key bindings and really like using emacs, however, I haven&#x27;t quite nailed down how to get a good linter and customize emacs for that purpose. Looking to see if anyone out there has a good setup and could give me some tips on where to start. I am mainly going to be running my scripts through a server so using the terminal version of emacs is where I have been spending most of my time. Any help would be appreciated !

                              <span>I am using emacs ver 29.4, org version 9.7.8.
 I am trying to export the matplotlib graphic to the same directory that the org files lives in:
 #+begin_src python :results graphics file output :file temp_plot_2.png import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt x &#x3D; np.linspace(0, 10, 100) y &#x3D; np.sin(x) fig, ax &#x3D; plt.subplots() ax.plot(x, y) #+end_src 
 The file is generated as expected, but ends up in the ~ directory.
 I checked the default-directory variable, and it is correctly set to the ~/images directory, where the org file lives, and where I want the graph (image) to go.
 When I use absolute paths in the :file argument (e.g., :file /home//images/temp_plot_2.png), it works as expected, but I don&#x27;t want to need to provide the absolute path every time.
 Anyone have any idea what&#x27;s going on, and why relative paths seem to not be working as expected?
 From the org manual, which seems to be in conflict with what I actually observe, since the directory associated with the current buffer is /home//images according to the local default-buffer variable, but file output is actually /home/:
  
The ‘dir’ header argument specifies the default directory during code block execution. If it is absent, then the directory associated with the current buffer is used.
 https://orgmode.org/manual/Environment-of-a-Code-Block.html
  
I tried specifying the dir header; didn&#x27;t work. I tried using M-x cd and navigating manually to the /home//images directory; didn&#x27;t work.
 Thanks

                              <span>I am new to emacs, i am using org agenda with org roam my main issue is when openning org agenda it creates many buffers that I can see and it annoys me i know i can kill all with x keybinding. However, I want to ask about how do emacs users deal with this ?! I would have preferred that org agenda open these buffers silently and only show me the buffer that contains the todo I have selected. Is there a way to enable such a behavior ? Thank you in advance.

                              <span>I have read a few threads about this warning, but no detailled answer about how to deal with it.
 Please, correct me if I am wrong, but I understand it is a change in &#x60;org-mode&#x60; version 9.7 which throws a warning when the function is used in a non Org buffer. So, chances are that when the warning pops up, it is from an external package that has not conformed yet to that new rule/convention.
 Anyway, I get this warning every time I open the agenda time-grid, tall other built-in or custom views are working fine. This is not a terrible thing, but warnings are designed to be annoying, so I would like to get rid of it.
 Is pinning &#x60;org-mode&#x60; to a previous version the best way to go ? Any recommendation as to which version I should downgrade to ?
 I am a Doom Emacs user if it is relevant. Thanks in advance for your help.

                              <span>Not sure if this issue is specific to Doom emacs. When scrolling past any inline displayed image, the screen shifts down until the image gets completely out of frame, this sudden snap can be very distracting, especially with larger images, so i am asking for some type of workaround to fix this.
 Google searches only suggested pixel-scrolling options, which i tried and have not worked.
 ChatGPT told me to stop using images altogether lol.
 My version of doom emacs is a fairly new install with not much going on inside the configuration or packaging.

                              <span>Hi, I need to put an email address inside a org file that will be exported in HTML with Hugo. For privacy reasons, I need to encode it with HTML entities (like o@ etc.), but the HTML output I get is encoded (so it becomes &amp;#111;&amp;#064;).
 I put it between @@html:...@@ and worked great with the link description, but didn&#x27;t work at all with the link URL. What else can I try?
 I think this is mainly an issue with Hugo, but I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s another way in org to set a string as literal.

                              <span>Hey everyone, in the recent months I got interested in Haskell and decided I&#x27;d start a small side project just to get the feeling of programming in Haskell.
 homodoro is what I came up with, a quite simple TUI program with some timers and an extremely simple task manager, I feel like I probably didn&#x27;t learn much about Haskell/FP in general while developing this but it was the most joy I ever felt while programming something and I&#x27;m quite happy with the result.
 All feedback is much appreciated.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been researching how to use optimal evaluation to optimize Discrete Program Search and, eventually, I arrived at a simple algorithm that seems to be really effective. Based on the following tests:
 f 1001101110 &#x3D; 1010100110 f 0100010100 &#x3D; 1001101001 
 Solving for &#x27;f&#x27; (by search), we find:
 xor_xnor (0:0:xs) &#x3D; 0 : 1 : xor_xnor xs xor_xnor (0:1:xs) &#x3D; 1 : 0 : xor_xnor xs xor_xnor (1:0:xs) &#x3D; 1 : 0 : xor_xnor xs xor_xnor (1:1:xs) &#x3D; 0 : 1 : xor_xnor xs 
 My best Haskell searcher, using the Omega Monad, takes 47m guesses, or about 2.8s. Meanwhile, the HVM searcher, using SUP Nodes, takes just 1.7m interactions, or about 0.0085s. More interestingly, it takes just 0.03 interactions per guess. This sounds like a huge speedup, so, it is very likely I&#x27;m doing something dumb. As such, I&#x27;d like to ask for validation.
 I&#x27;ve published the Haskell code (and the full story, for these interested) below. My question is: Am I missing something? Is there some obvious way to optimize this Haskell search without changing the algorithm? Of course, the algorithm is still exponential and not necessarily useful, but I&#x27;m specifically interested in determining whether the HVM version is actually faster than what can be done in Haskell.

                              <span>This has been bugging me for a while, which probably says more about the occupational hazards of translating for a living than anything else. Does anyone actively disagree that Luhmann&#x27;s &quot;Register&quot; and similar documents in modern zettelkästen would naturally be called indexes in the absence of interference from the German word? If you disagree, what does the English word &#x27;register&#x27; mean to you, and in a zettelkasten context, how does it differ from an index? (I&#x27;m aware that Luhmann explicitly said his Register wasn&#x27;t meant to be exhaustive, but in my understanding an index doesn&#x27;t have to be either.)</span>

                              <span>bit of a crapshoot here, but thought i’d ask.
 im trying to get erc in emacs to scrub out ?ex to the end of the line in messages recieved. (mainly cos i use bitlbee as a bouncer via emacs cos my internet is slow as shit &gt;! 10mbit on a good day !&lt;) I can get embeds with erc-image. but not when they dont end in a normal image extension. 
 with all the tracking discord attachments have, i lose this.
 (use-package erc :init (defun erc-mention (match-type nickuserhost msg) (when (and (eq match-type &#x27;current-nick) (not (string-match &quot;^\\*\\*\\*&quot; msg))) (notify-send &quot;(IRC)&quot; (format &quot;PING! %s&quot; msg)))) (defun erc-clean-url (proc parsed) &quot;Clean trackers with ?ex from discord so enbeds properly work&quot; (save-excursion (goto-char (point-min)) (when (re-search-forward &quot;\\?ex.*$&quot; nil t) (replace-match &quot;&quot;)))) :hook (erc-text-matched-hook . erc-mention) (erc-insert-modify-hook . erc-clean-url)) 
 This is what i&#x27;ve got and it doesnt seem to work, any ideas?

                              <span>I really like an emacs theme that I use, but in diff mode it is totally unreadable. I was wondering what the usual way of correcting this would be. Perhaps I could modify the overall theme but I&#x27;d be worried that it would ruin the aesthetics of the theme in other modes.

                              <span>This is kinda antithetical to the minimalist nature of nano but I still wanna try it. I want to replace the GNU Emacs / N Λ N O text with an ASCII art. I wonder if this is plausible since ASCII is technically just text. For reference, this is the ASCII art I want to use (specifically Lucy as the &#x27;doctor&#x27;).
 If this is simply not plausible in nano then I&#x27;m also up for alternative splash screen that can do this.

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to get my Outlook work calendar accessible in emacs to escape the mess that is the outlook web interface, and came across excorporate. huge props to the author for getting an Exchange interface working! After a bit of trying out different configs I got it working with the OAuth 2.0 setup of my employer. 
 Now I&#x27;m trying to actually use it, but I find it somewhat unexpected; perhaps that&#x27;s because I have used org-gcal for a while and was expecting something similar, i.e. synchronizing of the calendar entries into an org file which can be linked to my org-agenda (and calfw).
 For example, a very frequent occurrence is to schedule meetings with other people (in person). This generally works by everybody looking at their calendar to find a spot in e.g. the next week where all of us are available. Is this possible with Excorporate? To me it seems it&#x27;s only possible to check the calendar entries for a given day (via M-x calendar, moving to the date, pressing d or e), but not get a list of all the events, or all the events in a week/month. 
 Furthermore, creating events seems to be possible via the API (https://github.com/emacsmirror/excorporate/blob/master/excorporate.info, chapter 6 API Usage), but this functionality is not exposed as an interactive function. Does that mean I have to write my own helper functions here? Has anybody done so already?
 Does anybody have experiences with excorporate for these use cases?

                              <span>I primarily do scientific work in python with code-cells.el and the ipython REPL. I like this workflow but, since I&#x27;m a subpar programmer, I often end up with giant and disorganized scripts which are difficult to navigate. I eventually delete the cruft and refactor but I still end up spending a lot of time in this disorganized state. To improve navigation through the spaghetti, I thought maybe a table of contents could be made from the code-cell headers (i.e. &quot;# %% Imports&quot;). Does something like this already exist? Is there some other quick solution involving, e.g., code folding, bookmarks, imenu, etc.? 
 If there&#x27;s no easy solution I thought this might be a good excuse to start playing with elisp and try implementing it myself. Any suggestions with respect to how to begin would be much appreciated.

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently working on taking more effective notes using the Zettelkasten method and have encountered a challenge when dealing with claims attributed to secondary sources.
For example, academic articles typically contain numerous references to outside sources. Many of the claims discussed are not original but rather derived from these secondary sources.
My struggle is with how to properly document these secondary claims in my notes when I&#x27;m unfamiliar with the sources being referenced. I feel uncomfortable directly citing them. However, these claims are often relevant and interesting, and I want to include them in my Zettelkasten for future reference.
Here are some questions I have:
How do you approach taking notes on claims that are attributed to secondary sources when using the Zettelkasten method?
Do you cite the original source, the secondary source, or both in your notes?
How do you ensure accuracy and avoid misinterpretation when you&#x27;re not directly familiar with the primary source?
Any strategies for efficiently exploring the primary sources when they seem particularly crucial to your understanding of the topic?
I’d appreciate any advice or strategies that have worked for you when navigating this aspect of academic note-taking. Thanks in advance!</span>

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m reading  book on Manning MEAP website and have difficulties in understanding its chapter 21, titled &quot;Hello World! - introducing IO types&quot;. In my opinion, it seems to give wrong information. Below is an example:
 &quot;If main isn&#x27;t a function, it should follow that neither is putStrLn. ... As you can see, the return type of putStrLn is IO(). Like main, putStrLn is an IO action because it violates our rule that function must return values.&quot;
 The author seemed to think &quot;IO ()&quot; isn&#x27;t a value, which I don&#x27;t agree with. So I googled and found the following on Haskell wiki https://wiki.haskell.org/Introduction_to_Haskell_IO/Actions:
 &quot;PutStrLn takes an argument, but it is not an action. It is a function that takes one argument (a string) and returns an action of type IO (). So putStrLn is not an action, but putStrLn &quot;hello&quot; is.&quot;
 So I think the author is completely wrong on that, isn&#x27;t it? On the other hand, however, I read lots of good reviews on the book on Amazon website. Am I misunderstanding something? Thanks for any confirmation or explanation.

                              <span>Howdy. 
 I&#x27;m trying to write a util function to clean up org-agenda items. Specifically, if an agenda item has a SCHEDULED and DEADLINE with matching date+time I would like to remove the SCHEDULED property. Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve come up with but though the messages indicate my logic is fine the changes are not being reflected in org-agenda view nor in the file where an item lives. Perhaps there&#x27;s some save function I&#x27;m not calling to persist the changes?
 (defun local/org-remove-schedule-if-deadline-matches () &quot;Remove SCHEDULED from agenda item if DEADLINE exists and matches.&quot; (interactive) (org-map-entries (lambda () (let ((scheduled (org-entry-get nil &quot;SCHEDULED&quot;)) (deadline (org-entry-get nil &quot;DEADLINE&quot;))) (when (and deadline scheduled) (let ((scheduled-day (org-time-string-to-absolute scheduled)) (deadline-day (org-time-string-to-absolute deadline))) (when (&#x3D; scheduled-day deadline-day) (message &quot;removing SCHEDULED from task: \&quot;%s\&quot; in file %s&quot; (org-get-heading t t t t) buffer-file-name) (org-entry-delete nil &quot;SCHEDULED&quot;) (save-buffer)))))) nil &#x27;agenda))

                              <span>Is it possible to automatically sync org files via Git similar to how it can be done via Dropbox. I can&#x27;t use dropbox in work laptop and I only have access to Git. I need to access files on Orgzly mobile app which does automatic sync even from Git.
 Possible options
  
Purely dropbox like which means it can sync files even if I open the files or not.
 Pull/merge when I open the file.

                              <span>I never touched emacs but want to start using it as a note-taking tool. I used a lot of zim wiki, it&#x27;s great but also very limiting and has all the cons of a retained-mode user interface.
 My question is what &quot;flavor&quot; of emacs should i use that best fits my needs?
 All i ask is rich text, image viewing support, linking to other notes/files, hierarchical notes and optionally a GUI.
 I don&#x27;t mind steep learning curves nor the specific type of rich text.

                              <span>Hello fellow Emacs enthusiasts!
 I&#x27;ve noticed an interesting behavior difference between fill-paragraph in text-mode and org-fill-paragraph in org-mode, particularly when working with selected regions.
 Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve observed:
  
In text-mode, fill-paragraph respects the selected region and only operates within it.
 In org-mode, org-fill-paragraph doesn&#x27;t seem to respect the selected region and operates on the entire paragraph.
  
I&#x27;ve created a GIF to illustrate this difference:
 https://i.redd.it/7trbpcthrqgd1.gif
 I initially thought this was a bug and submitted a report, but it was determined not to be one.
 I&#x27;d like to open this up for community discussion to get your thoughts and insights.
 In org-mode, the behavior remains the same whether a region is selected or not. When no region is selected, I believe this behavior is appropriate.
 However, the issue arises when a user explicitly selects a region, expecting the fill operation to be limited to that selection.
 I think org-fill-paragraph should respect the selected region, similar to how fill-paragraph works in text-mode.
 What do you think about this behavior?
  
Update: Now that I&#x27;ve reviewed the org-fill-paragraph function documentation again, I understand the current behavior.
  
The REGION argument is non-nil if called interactively; in that
 case, if Transient Mark mode is enabled and the mark is active,
 fill each of the elements in the active region, instead of just
 filling the current element.&quot;
  
Unlike text-mode&#x27;s fill-paragraph, org-fill-paragraph is designed to &quot;fill each of the elements in the active region.&quot;
 The current behavior seems to be explained by this information.
 Thank you for your opinions!

                              <span>Apologies for the spam, but the sonatype API recently changed in a subtle way (it started erroring on &#x60;//&#x60;s in the URL which it previously ignored), and as a result all Mill builds publishing to Sonatype are failing. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s getting fixed on the sonatype side, so I released a new Mill version that people will have to update to unblock themselves to continue publishing to sonatype:

 Trying to blast it broadly to reach the folks who are affected, sorry for the spam

                              <span>I gathered some popular Scala libraries into OSGi bundles. 
 https://gitlab.com/perikov/scala-bundles
 I tried this before ( https://github.com/p-pavel/osgi-scala ) wrapping every jar into a bundle, but I finally gave up.
 Everything is badly broken (split packages is the main problem).
 So I just taken a route on bundling releases (&quot;everything related to org.typelevel/cats/n&quot;).
 I also have Karaf features with dependencies. 
 For it lets me to just type &#x60;feature:install myApp&#x60; and have relevant libraries from cats ecosystem (and also elastic4s and others) just install transparently from maven. 
 and &#x60;feature:uninstall&#x60; just unloads everything.
 I&#x27;m not sure if I have to put all this on maven (maven central requires packaging sources with jars, and my jars are just bundles containing relevant libs).
 Is there any interest on this topic?

                              <span>In Scala 2.13, and play-json, I used the following pattern to serialize/de-serialize between case classes and Json:
 import play.api.libs.json.{Format, Json} object WelcomeResult { implicit val format &#x3D; Json.format[WelcomeResult] } case class WelcomeResult(service: String) 
 defining implicit formatin the companion object of the case class, made it easily visible from outside, so the following code worked without even requiring an extra import:
 val welcome &#x3D; WelcomeResult(&quot;test&quot;) val json &#x3D; Json.toJson(welcome) 
 In Scala 3 I saw the type class derivation feature and though I could take advantage of it by a. making the code more compact. b. defining such a default formatting only once in a generic way in the type class.
 This is the implementation I have in mind:
 case class WelcomeResult(service: String) derives JsonFormat
 And then something like this in JsonFormat:
 import play.api.libs.json.{Format, Json} trait JsonFormat[T] { val format: Format[T] } object JsonFormat { def derived[T](using scala.deriving.Mirror.Of[T]): JsonFormat[T] &#x3D; { new JsonFormat[T]: override val format: Format[T] &#x3D; Json.format[T] } } 
 But Json.format[T] fails with some &quot;Instance not found: &#x27;Conversion[T, _ &lt;: Product]&#x27;&quot; error. I guess, from other examples that I need a macro to implement the desired behavior, but not sure how.
 Any help appreciated.

                              <span>I read the following statement in this article - Direct-style Effects Explained. Does it mean one can accomplish the effect of e.g. ZIO, Cats without using those library? If so, apart from the examples Print, Raise/ Error, provided in the article. Any more examples that can be referred? Thanks
  
So direct-style effects and monad effects can be seen as just two different syntaxes for writing the same thing.

I have number values as properties and need to compare them: Is this value larger than 500, is it larger than 1400? But I cannot find a way to do this.
 I would be very grateful for any suggestions on how to find a solution path.

                              <span>I&#x27;m untrained in music, but every bit of music theory I learn really increases my enjoyment of it. I wanted to learn to compose a bit, and the traditional method is counterpoint. So I did what any barely musically literate nerd would do: I started to write a program to verify that a counterpoint composition follows the rules when played against a given melody. Frankly it was an uphill battle. But finally, this weekend, I got it working.
 https://github.com/ludflu/counterpointer-report
 The main thing that stymied my earlier efforts was that I didn&#x27;t understand the nature of musical intervals in a formal way. Every explanation I learned described it as a mathematically naive music student might require, which makes sense if I were trying to play the oboe or whatnot. Or, things would be explained in DSP terms, explaining how overtones work, etc. And that also makes sense, but....
 But what I really needed, was for someone to tell me that musical intervals are calculated using integers mod 12. Which actually makes a ton of sense when you think about how human&#x27;s perceive relative pitch. Did you know that humans are the only animals we know of that perceive relative pitch? I&#x27;m pretty sure I learned that from David Huron&#x27;s excellent book.
 Eventually I thought to ask someone over in /r/musictheory and things mostly worked out from there since I could use the Haskell modular-arithmetic library for the intervals, and Euterpea for representing notes and playing them via MIDI.
 Finally I had to hack around some broken stuff because Euterpea, though its a marvelous library, is not actively maintained and so needed some work to get it to run with modern Cabal. AND PortMIDI-haskell doesn&#x27;t agree with Clang on OSX. But I was able to patch all those things locally to get everything running, and I submitted PRs to try and fix them up for everyone else.

I find myself caught in what seems to be a cyclical dilemma in the world of personal knowledge management, and I&#x27;m curious if others are experiencing the same.
My journey began with enthusiasm for local-first environments like Obsidian and Logseq. The promise of data ownership and flexibility was alluring. However, as time passed, I found myself gravitating back to cloud-based solutions.
Now, I&#x27;m feeling the pull towards local files and Markdown again. It&#x27;s as if I&#x27;m caught in a perpetual swing between the convenience of the cloud and the freedom of local storage.
This pattern has me wondering:
Is this back-and-forth between local-first and cloud-based systems common in the PKM community?
For those who&#x27;ve made multiple switches, what ultimately made you settle on one approach (if you have)?
Are there solutions that effectively bridge this gap, offering the best of both worlds?
How do others manage the trade-offs between sync convenience and data sovereignty?
I&#x27;m starting to think this isn&#x27;t just a fleeting concern, but a fundamental tension in how we approach PKM. The desire for true ownership of our data and the freedom to use multiple tools seems to persist, even after trying various solutions.
Has anyone else found themselves in this PKM pendulum? How have you reconciled these competing needs in your own systems?</span>

                              <span>Hi everyone, sorry I couldn&#x27;t find a proper title for what I was looking for. what I want is a way for consult completion candidates to show a certain string when I&#x27;m selecting from the minibuffer but when the candidate is selected it should be the original form string.
 for example:
 ;; I have this list of paths that I want to select from (defvar paths &#x27;(&quot;/dir1/dir2/p1&quot; &quot;dir1/dir2/p2&quot; &quot;/dir1/dir2/p3&quot;)) ;; I want to parse those paths to only show the filename ;; in the minibuffer (consult--read (--map (file-name-nondirectory it) paths)) ;; the completion is supposed to be p1, p2, p3 ;; but when when I select I want the original path to be selected ;; for example /dir1/dir2/p1 
 I would do it using a hashmap or alist to map between the candidates and the selection.
 is there an easier way around this without using annotate function or marginalia ??

 I am tinkering with the github repo to make it a little bit more customized for my needs but other than that I praise its puristic and minimalistic ways. Its written in c and works smoothly over ssh (without tramp or sth.)

 How can I enable copy/yank from some text from my Mac browser into emacs buffer on the terminal and also vice versa. 
 I tried clipetty and it works when I yank something from emacs buffer and paste on Mac but not the other way around. Also it does not work at all when using tmux. 
 Appreciate any suggestions!!

                              <span>This question is mostly to those of you, who love or enjoy Scala (or not, but still visit this sub) but don&#x27;t get to use it at work, or use it only for Spark.
 Imagine that you&#x27;re given a task of creating a mission critical component of your company&#x27;s product. It would have to be a project deployed to the cloud, scalable, reliable, performant (but not extremely performant - jvm performance is fine). It will have to be maintained for years to come - by you, your team and your successors.
 Whatever you choose, you will have to recruit a team or train your coworkers - let&#x27;s assume that they are mostly java users, good old spring booters, but they are not against the idea of learning a new language and paradigm.
 Would you choose Scala for such a project if given a choice? Do you feel confident that you&#x27;d be able to sell this idea to your manager? Do you believe that with Scala it would be cheaper to maintain or more profitable than with other languages? When would it become profitable - the recruitment / trainings would be more expensive surely, so would benefits of Scala become visible after weeks, months, years of maintaining the product, or never at all?

                              <span>I stumbled upon a very toxic comment in this subreddit that somehow racked up 20 upvotes, and honestly, I was appalled by the sheer negativity of it.
 I get that everyone has their own opinions about coding, but flinging insults like that? That’s just not right.
 Can we please cut the negative rhetoric and start being more welcoming to EVERYONE, regardless of their skill level or coding style?
 The /r/scala subreddit should be a safe space for every Scala user. Labeling other people&#x27;s code as &quot;trash&quot; is not okay.
 That comment also fails to meet this community&#x27;s rules of &quot;decency&quot; and &quot;politeness.&quot; I&#x27;m very surprised that it received 20 upvotes.
 And can we please make full use of all the tools that reddit puts at our disposal? And let’s not turn a blind eye to this kind of behavior, we need to call it out. We can definitely do better. Thanks.

                              <span>Two dummy examples, both Scala 2.12. 
 First example - sequence of Foo[t &lt;: T], and I want some function to use that t somehow. Pseudocode-ish:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; type A &lt;: T type B &lt;: T
 trait Foo[t &lt;: T]
 object Foo1 extends Foo[A]
 objet Foo2 extends Foo[B]
 def someFunc[t &lt;: T](foo: Foo[t]): Unit &#x3D; { somethingThatKnowsHowToTakeTypes[t].foobar }
 Seq( Foo1, Foo2 ).map(someFunc) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 This leads to type erasure concerns, even though to me it seems obvious that that Sequence is of a type where each object inside is a Foo of some concrete type that fits the constraints. I can get around it by introducing some wrapper case class that I can stick Foo1 and Foo2 into, which retains it&#x27;s type as an explicit member. And then inside someFunc I have to manually use that type member explicitly. Feels clunky and it feels like something I&#x27;m tricking the compiler into doing. Not to mention at some point I did get it to compile, only to fail at runtime if I didn&#x27;t create the correct implicit typetag in scope.
 Second example:
 Sequence of (Foo[t &lt;: T], Bar[t &lt;: T]), and Bar/Foo have methods that operate on or return t &lt;: T. I store in a 2-tuple because inside a lambda I want to do something like Foo.read(...).map(Bar.transform) where Foo.read returns something typed by t and Bar.transform takes something subtyped by t. I assume since I pair them up in a 2-tuple, the Seq of these such objects could recognize that it&#x27;s some paired object, but instead the compiler complains about expected vs supplied types.

                              <span>Hey all, this is a follow up post to this post with an amazing title.
 I am writing this so it doesn&#x27;t just exist on my laptop and is documented somewhere. Maybe this is common knowledge, I did not find it anywhere.
 Basically, update from my end on the direction Monoidal -&gt; Traversing is that there&#x27;s a way to write
 monoidalToTraversing :: (Choice p, Monoidal p, Traversable f) &#x3D;&gt; p a b -&gt; p (f a) (f b) 
 we use a variation of Alexis King&#x27;s construction
 data Traversal a r b &#x3D; Done b | Yield a !(Traversal a r (r -&gt; b)) deriving Functor instance Applicative (Traversal a r) where pure &#x3D; Done Done f  a &#x3D; f  a Yield a rToTf  ta &#x3D; Yield a ((\ f b x -&gt; f x b)  rToTf  ta) traversal :: Traversable t &#x3D;&gt; t a -&gt; Traversal a b (t b) traversal &#x3D; traverse (\ a -&gt; Yield a (Done id)) unTraversal :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; Traversal a b tb -&gt; tb unTraversal _ (Done tb) &#x3D; tb unTraversal morph (Yield a fab) &#x3D; unTraversal morph (fmap ($ morph a) fab) traversalP :: (Choice p, Monoidal p) &#x3D;&gt; p a b -&gt; p (Traversal a b x) (Traversal b b x) traversalP &#x3D; dimap toEither fromEither . right&#x27; . (both  id  traversalP) where toEither :: Traversal a r b -&gt; Either b (a, Traversal a r (r -&gt; b)) toEither (Done x ) &#x3D; Left x toEither (Yield a resume) &#x3D; Right (a, resume) fromEither :: Either b (a, Traversal a r (r -&gt; b)) -&gt; Traversal a r b fromEither (Left x ) &#x3D; Done x fromEither (Right (a, resume)) &#x3D; Yield a resume monoidalToTraversing :: (Choice p, Monoidal p, Traversable f) &#x3D;&gt; p a b -&gt; p (f a) (f b) monoidalToTraversing &#x3D; dimap traversal (unTraversal id) . traversalP 
 (I call both :: p a b -&gt; p c d -&gt; p (a,c) (b,d) to Monoidal&#x27;s idiomatic class function) the other direction (Traversing -&gt; Monoidal) needs some other kind of ideas which I am not having so far.
 Remaining questions:
  
What about the other direction?
 How to do this for Traversing1? It shouldn&#x27;t use Choice, because Either a is not a Traversable1
 What are the implications?

                              <span>I mostly run Emacs 29.4 (from source) but on some machines I run Emacs 28.2 (Debian 12) and Emacs 27.1 (Debian 11). I&#x27;ve recently started seeing errors on Emacs 27.1 with consult-buffer and consult-ripgrep among others in Git repositories:
 No applicable method: project-roots, (projectile . &quot;/full/path/to/git/root&quot;) 
 and the commands no longer work. I don&#x27;t see these errors in newer Emacs versions.
 Am I out of luck trying to run modern packages on Emacs 27 or is it possible that I&#x27;ve got something configured incorrectly?
 Thanks.

 if I have #+title: python:getting command in ubuntu then org-roam-find-node can list it
 if I have #+title:python:getting command in ubuntu then org-roam-find-node cannot list it
 Both ways, the python:getting command in ubuntu are highlighted with org-document-title face, so I think (I could be wrong) that org-mode parses both way alright(or is it font-lock and parser behave differently?). but the space will make that huge difference to org-roam-find-node
 Why?

                              <span>My main gripe are
  
I&#x27;m not always logged into reddit, and when I click a reddit link, it produces some fake security error, and tells me I&#x27;m not logged in or I should use my developer token. I&#x27;m not sure why reddit has started to do this, but does it have something to do a desire to monetize it it more, and may even have something to do with AI. It seems reddit has also signed some exclusive deal with Google allowing only Google to index it.
 
The way Reddit know handles blocking by other users. Sometime ago I began to notice that so many responses had some error like deleted and unavailable. Something I remarked on in this thread - Why do some reddit users especially on r/emacs keep messing up threads their involved by deleting their posts or making them unavailable? I don&#x27;t see why some people should disrupt a technical discussion by blocking some participants who can&#x27;t see what is going. It is not as though this Twitter or Facebook, this is simply a technical forum and the discussions don&#x27;t often veer into the political. What kind of mindset does it take to block someone because you don&#x27;t want them to read your views on technical issues, and it is not as though the person blocked cannot login using another account to see the thread?
 
 These two issues are making this forum less appealing. Perhaps I should use stackexchange more instead.

                              <span>Hello,
 I need to find the nth prime number. This is what I have so far:
 module Prime (nth) where nth :: Int -&gt; Maybe Integer nth n | n  Bool isPrime 2 &#x3D; True isPrime n | n  n &#x60;mod&#x60; x /&#x3D; 0)) [2..root] where root &#x3D; (floor . sqrt . fromIntegral) n 
 Some of the errors I get are (seems that both functions are wrong):
 Couldn&#x27;t match expected type ‘Integer’ with actual type ‘Int’ • In the expression: x In the first argument of ‘(!!)’, namely ‘[x | x  Bool Actual: [Int] -&gt; [Bool] • In the first argument of ‘all’, namely ‘(map (\ x -&gt; n &#x60;mod&#x60; x /&#x3D; 0))’Couldn&#x27;t match type ‘[Bool]’ with ‘Bool’ Expected: [Int] -&gt; Bool Actual: [Int] -&gt; [Bool] • In the first argument of ‘all’, namely ‘(map (\ x -&gt; n &#x60;mod&#x60; x /&#x3D; 0))’ 
 The second error is not really clear for me, I thought that all returns Bool (a -&gt; Bool) -&gt; [a] -&gt; Bool), why would it be [Bool]? Also, any hint for the first function? Thank you.
 EDIT:
 Correct solution:
 module Prime (nth) where nth :: Int -&gt; Maybe Integer nth n | n  Bool isPrime n &#x3D; null [x | x &lt;- [2..n-1], n &#x60;mod&#x60; x &#x3D;&#x3D; 0]

                              <span>Almost any resource I read recently says that GHCI should show &quot;Prelude&gt;&quot; as prompt after start. And the prompt should change e.g. to &quot;*Main&gt;&quot; after loading a .hs file.
 In my case GHCi only shows &quot;ghci&gt;&quot; as prompt. Has this changed recently or am I doing something wrong here?

 val foo1 &#x3D; bar[TypeA]() val foo2 &#x3D; bar[TypeB]() val foo3 &#x3D; bar[TypeC]() def bar[T:AContextBound](): String &#x3D; ??? 
 I wonder - is there way to write it as something like
 val fooList:List[String] &#x3D; forAllTypes( ???[TypeI] &#x3D;&gt; bar[TypeI]()) 
 I have not a clue how the function definition would even look like. It would only save few lines, but it got me fascinated if there is some deeper scala magic I&#x27;m not aware of yet.

 .catchAllCause(e &#x3D;&gt; ZIO.logError(e.toString) *&gt; ZIO.fail(e.toString)) 
 Is there a better way to do this without manually adding this to every line?

I am attempting to use org-ql-defpred with org-ql-query, and because I do not quite have a handle on what I am doing yet (I am far from an elisp expert, but don&#x27;t mind stretching my boundaries), I am trying to stick pretty close to the Org QL Custom Predicates Tutorial for now.
 Something that works exactly as I want, but lacks the flexibility of the predicate-based approach, is the following (with org-super-agenda):
  (setq org-agenda-custom-commands &#x27;((&quot;A&quot; . &quot;Agendas&quot;) (&quot;Aj&quot; &quot;John&quot; ((org-ql-block &#x27;(tags &quot;#John&quot;) ((org-ql-block-header &quot;John&quot;)))))

 Successfully starts and connects to a local pylsp when editing a local file - but is unsuccessful in starting a remote pylsp when TRAMPing a remote file. Exits with error: (:message &quot;Connection state changed&quot; :change &quot;exited abnormally with code 127\n&quot;)
  
 Local machine is windows running putty - TRAMP connection /plink:server:/temp/test.py
 Remote machine is FreeBSD 13.2 running sshd and samba.
 
&quot;Local&quot; editing (and pylsp) via samba share works, but with pylsp running on the local windows machine and test.py on the remote samba share editing is slow and is not optimal.
  
Any suggestions on having option 3. work for both local and remote pylsp?

                              <span>I have been messing around with the LaTeX export system and have been able to get my shell blocks to export to latex w/ this formatting, including automatically adding the \StartConsole command to any first line in a command. It would be nice to have the results and the shell commands joined in the output so that it looks exactly like a command and its output looks like in a terminal. I am not sure how to go about merging them in the latex output though and whether it should be done as pre- or post- processing. Any help figuring this out would be very appreciated. Thank you.
 In case anybody is interested, I did this using the org-9.8pre version with its new export features and used the following relevant code...

                              <span>Hey everyone,
 recently I&#x27;ve had some trouble with Doom Emacs crashing unexpectedly and I&#x27;ve been trying to troubleshoot today with research and chatgpt.
 I found on r/DoomEmacs a similar thread where an Arch user was experiencing the same thing while editing C++ files while mine was mostly happening when editing Rust files. I don&#x27;t have much to go on but my assumption was that when the rust-analyzer was working or Rust LSP was communicating it was causing it to panic and crash but this was just an assumption and I was having trouble getting much out of --debug-init. This user was able to downgrade to version 29.3 and it solved their problems.
 Recently I&#x27;ve completely uninstalled rust, emacs and doom emacs and found wayland-emacs on the aur which I didn&#x27;t notice last time. I&#x27;ve reinstalled Rust and now I&#x27;m going to attempt to install this AUR package and go from there. Another issue I was having was opening Fish shell in Doom Emacs with Term which wasn&#x27;t an issue before until installing Rust.
 It&#x27;s also important to note that I&#x27;ve had this Arch + Hyprland install for about 2 weeks and Doom Emacs hasn&#x27;t given any issues what so ever until installing rust and rust-analyzer but also I upgraded around the same time and I know there was an upgrade 2 days ago. Thanks for reading, I wanted to try and be thorough so I apologize for the length of this.
 P.S The user on Arch I was talking about with a similar issue was using X11
 EDIT: solved, I use the pacaman package manager to uninstall emacs-wayland and installed emacs instead. So far rust hasn&#x27;t crashed when editing or coding rs files in doom and rust-analayzer is working. Must install with rustup component add rust-analyzer though, not your package manager. and using vterm this time with no issues.. yet ;)

If you want to replace a piece of text without writing the deleted text to the register (in other words, you only want to delete the text, not cut it), so that you can continuously replace a piece of text in multiple places. If you don&#x27;t want to use any plugins and want to solve this directly through vim commands, the method is to first select the text and then enter the command &quot;ay, which copies this text to the a register. Then, for the text you want to replace, first select it and then enter &quot;ap, which replaces the selected text with the text in register a.
 The above operation is obviously cumbersome. Previously, I used the evil-replace-with-register plugin to solve this problem. This plugin provides a command bo…</span>

I run my own little branding &amp; design agency, and when I decided to start writing blog posts I found myself falling down rabbit holes of psychology, Jung, archetypes, consciousness, and on. I realized that I needed a better way to hold on to and integrate all the new ideas I was finding — which led me to a new rabbit hole of Zettelkasten and trying to understand the philosophies and processes behind it.
Many of my web searches would lead me to thoughtful discussions on this forum, so I thought I&#x27;d tag along and try to absorb your collective knowledge!
I&#x27;d already been using Obsidian, but I recently started a new vault so I could use it more correcter.</span>

                              <span>And here is the second, about Purity. This is not really a structure note. It has been produced as a flow of ideas, some familiar, some new. The core applies the importance of purity in modernity to historic buildings. The purpose is to explore the topic for a possible journal article. I suppose my question (leaving content aside) is what you would do next.

This is the first of (likely) two SNs; both are works in progress. This SN relates to processing a particular book chapter which I find an important reference point to return to.

                              <span>Yet another wasm question!
 I&#x27;m trying to compile a cabal project using the ghc-wasm-meta 9.8 compiler, but I&#x27;m getting the following error:
 wasm-ld: error: unable to find library -lHSrts-1.0.2_thr 
 my cabal.project and each name.cabal have the following ghc-options:
 program options/library ghc-options: -no-hs-main -optl-mexec-model&#x3D;reactor &quot;-optl-Wl&quot; 
 something I noticed is that if I run build using --verbose , the call to wasm32-wasi-ghc doesn&#x27;t have any of the ghc-options I&#x27;ve set. Maybe it&#x27;s got something to do with the &#x60;Setup.hs&#x60;? but that file just has the usual:
 import Distribution.Simple main &#x3D; defaultMain 
 Anybody got an idea of what might be happening?

                              <span>For years (I use AoC as way to get familiar with new languages I add to my trophy collection), I&#x27;ve been used to that naive solutions for AoC2015/4 (iterate over numbers, conver to string, concatenate with prefix, hash, convert to hex, check n zero prefix, repeat) take &#x27;too long&#x27;.
 The first optimization was to figure out how to pre-hash the prefix (in some languages/libs, copying the state is not as straightforward as calling a method).
 Second was not converting a number to string, but incrementing a byte array (or mutable string) representation of the number.
 The last is to re-use a buffer for the resulting hash, ideally not converted to hex, and to directly check the first few bytes (and perhaps 4 bits) to be zero.
 Usually, all this got me a speed-up of at least 10x.
 What totally shocked me was that the naive implementation finished in less then five seconds (I expected roughly a minute), and that further optimizations got it down only to under three seconds.

                              <span>Hi there,
 I&#x27;d like to invite all of you to another episode of the Scala Space Podcast. Today my guests will be:
  
Matthieu Baechler, french Scala engineer and freelancer who worked on the migration of rudder.io software
 Łukasz Krenski, polish Scala engineer working at MeWe, responsible for migration of their stack to Scala 3
  
Our topics will include the difficult parts of the migration, the ways to deal with them, what to pay attention to when migrating to Scala 3 and finally - whether it&#x27;s worth it!
 The podcast will be happening, as usual, live on Twitch and Scala Space Youtube channel today at 14:00 CEST so feel free to join the chat and ask questions. Links:

                              <span>I&#x27;m new to Scala. I&#x27;m writing some performance-sensitive code for processing objects on several axes. My actual code is more complicated and handles more axes, but it&#x27;s structured like this:
 class Processor: xData: Data yData: Data zData: Data def process(axis: Axis) &#x3D; axis match case X &#x3D;&gt; doStuff(xData) case Y &#x3D;&gt; doStuff(yData) case Z &#x3D;&gt; doStuff(zData) 
 But it is a bit repetitive, and it&#x27;s easy to make a typo and use the wrong data object. Ideally, I&#x27;d like to write something like this
 class Processor: data: HashMap[Axis, Data] def process(axis: Axis) &#x3D; doStuff(data(axis)) 
 Unfortunately, this code has different performance and correctness characteristics:
  
It&#x27;s possible for me to forget to initialize Data for some of the axes. In a language like TypeScript I could type the field as Record, which would check at compile time that keys for all axes are initialized. But I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s possible in Scala.
 Accessing the map requires some hashing and dispatching. However fast they may be, my code runs millions of times per second, so I want to avoid this and really get the same performance as accessing the field directly.
  
Is it possible to do something like this in Scala?
 Thanks!

Boon pays attention to ergonomics though, which according to this, isn&#x27;t something that any of the example Meow layouts do. I guess I&#x27;ll try to create an ergonomic layout for Meow in the future.

                              <span>This was useful for a few people I work with, so I&#x27;m posting it here for posterity. My job involves switching computers pretty frequently, and so I have everything set up with use-package&#x27;s :ensure keyword so I can just clone my init.el to a new machine, and Emacs will download all my packages automatically. In general, this works great; the exception is org. 
 Any kind of :ensure form doesn&#x27;t work with installing the latest revision of org (afaik), because the pre-installed version shadows it; use-package uses package-installed-p to decide if a package isn&#x27;t installed and needs to be downloaded, and since org is always installed, no download will ever trigger. This is fine, up until you want something from a later version of org.
 A while back, I reported a bug that interfered with my org…</span>

                              <span>So someone at my company years ago decided it was a good idea to create a company internal package format, say &quot;yuppie&quot; for yunified package. And that can randomly be tgz or zip archives. Don&#x27;t ask.
 Now I need some &#x27;yuppie-mode&#x27; function that dispatches to either archive-mode or jka-compr and then tar-mode.
 Any ideas? suggestions how to solve this?
 currently I&#x27;m creating symlinks from file --mime-type output and then open the file, but that is a hack, not a solution :-/

                              <span>I have been scratching my head for a while now about how to handle task dependencies in Orgmode.
 First off, I am aware of &#x60;org-depend&#x60; and &#x60;org-edna&#x60; as well as the &#x60;ORDERED&#x60; property. I am trying to find a way to make them work for a common, but specific type of dependency.
 Task Dependencies
 As defined in this [blog page][1] from the &#x27;projectmanager.com&#x27; website, a Gantt chart will define 4 types of dependency. I find two of them essential in my task management workflow.
 Finish to finish
 The first one, and most commn I think, is the **finish-to-finish dependency** which is the one I believe is covered by org-mode; this is also the easiest to enforce (again imho) programatically with orgmode tools. Task A cannot be marked as &#x60;DONE&#x60; before task B and C are.
 It is what &#x60;org-enforce-tod…</span>

 what I would like to have is something like this:
 (evil-global-set-key &#x27;normal (kbd &quot;C-bC-b&quot;) &#x27;my-func)
 Is that possible? If so how? I&#x27;ve noticed that  would trigger my-func after the first C-b, and if I change the third prefix to something else the issue persists. I&#x27;d like to have it triggered after the second C-b.

lsp-mode
 lsp-ui
 company-mode

As you understand above, I use only company for autocomplete. I want to provide in my emacs yasnippet, mostly because of latex. But for some reason, firstly, it wasn&#x27;t working with company-mode: in company-autocomplete-box i didn&#x27;t have any of my snippets, but autocomplete by keybinding, which I provide in yasnippet config part, have been working. It was in all modes which I using. I research all internet, and just find config in this discussion, which really help me. And all is working fine in c-mode and c++-mode, but not for latex.

                              <span>Whenever I build a new version of Emacs from source, I generate PDFs from the texinfo files located in the source repository&#x27;s doc directory to have up-to-date documentation that I can easily read from tablet or smartphone. I find it more convenient than the HTML versions.
 This is done by running make pdf.
 However, these PDFs don&#x27;t have hyperlinks or clickable TOC.
 Only the major manuals released here, like the GNU Emacs Manual, the GNU Emacs Lisp Reference Manual and An Introduction to Programming in Emacs Lisp seem to offer that functionality.
 Any idea how to get it done for all the other manuals?
 EDIT:
 Problem solved. I overlooked that the hyperlinks work fine. They&#x27;re just not highlighted.

                              <span>During the closing of bug#71801 a Windows build was uploaded to the GNU FTP which was shipped with libgccjit-0.dll. If that DLL is present, then Emacs will try to native compile the 3rd party packages. If it fails to do so then it will throw an error, and it will stop loading the 3rd party packages. One user complained on the mailing list about this, and a new release was uploaded to the GNU FTP without this DLL.
 The issue is that the Windows package managers already downloaded and hashed the build with libgccjit-0.dll the first time it was uploaded. Winget had a hash mismatch, but should be fixed since then. Chocolatey does not know about the new file, and it will download the build with libgccjit-0.dll in it.

 I started a business a couple of months ago, and using a spreadsheet as a crm + sales pipeline wasn&#x27;t very satisfactory. I needed a CRM system that can basically do the following:
  
Maintain a list of companies and the contacts in each of them
 Maintain a list of ongoing leads and opportunities, and qualify each one as the deal state changes
 Keep email communications for each opportunity attached to the lead and the company / contact
 Maintain a list of upcoming tasks related to each opportunity
  
I looked into a few CRMs and found most to be quite expensive. I didn&#x27;t want to spend on yet another subscription this early in the business. Some free ones like Hubspot that are too complex for my needs. S…</span>

                              <span>So I&#x27;ve been diving into the world of algebraic effects systems as an alternative to mtl-style classes for granular effect tracking. One thing I haven&#x27;t quite figured out yet is how to handle errors in the middle of a computation that uses a custom effect type. For example, let&#x27;s say I have an effect for talking to the database:
  data DB :: Effect where DBWrite :: Item -&gt; DB m () DBRead :: Key -&gt; DB m (Maybe Item) 
 and types for errors and the database environment
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; data DBError &#x3D; DeadLockError | ConnectionError
 data DBEnv &#x3D; DBEnv Connection &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 and let&#x27;s say I have the interpreter:
  runDBIO :: (IOE :&gt; es, Error DBError :&gt; es) &#x3D;&gt; DBEnv -&gt; Eff (DB : es) a -&gt; Eff es a runDBIO env &#x3D; interpret \_ -&gt; \case ... do handling here ... 
 Now the recommended way to instrument all of this is to wire up all of your effect handlers at the start of your program:
  main &#x3D; do env  ... do something ... Right -&gt; ... do something ... 
 This all makes sense. But what if I want to handle the error at a deeper level in the program and not at the very top level? The Error DBError effect doesn&#x27;t manifest in the type list until the runDBIO interpreter is applied. For example,
  tryWriteDBOrSendEmailPage :: Item -&gt; Eff [Email, DB] () tryWriteDBOrSendEmailPage item &#x3D; do catchError (dbWrite item) $ \_ e -&gt; emailPage $ &quot;Something went wrong: &quot; ++ (show e) return () 
 This doesn&#x27;t work here because the type signature doesn&#x27;t contain Error DBError, but the underlying implementation of DB uses it. If I add Error DBError to the effect list, wouldn&#x27;t that be a totally separate effect from DB, so it wouldn&#x27;t be able to throw and catch in the same context? Should I manually expose effects for TryDBWrite and TryDBRead that return an Either? Not exactly sure what to do here.

I think that data Expr &#x3D; Const a has type * and data Expr a &#x3D; Const a has type * -&gt; *, but I don‘t understand the deeper meaning behind it. Is it just to show how many datatype-parameters a datatype has? Please help, as you might imagine I don‘t have a lot of time 😅
 (I hope this isn’t considered a „homework question“)

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I am trying to learn Slick in Play,
 I was making a toy application, But I am not getting code generation support while writing queries in Slick,
 For details, I am using metals in VS code, Intellij is working better but takes up whole resources in WSL 10 gigs
 My code is something like this
 @Singleton class SessionStoreDao @Inject()(protected val dbConfigProvider: DatabaseConfigProvider)(implicit executionContext: ExecutionContext) { val dbConfig &#x3D; dbConfigProvider.get[PostgresProfile] import dbConfig._ import profile.api._ val sessionStore &#x3D; TableQuery[SessionStore] } 
 for an example: when I type
 sessionStore dot it doesn&#x27;t show available methods, I need it as I am new to slick
 I am clueless why is it so? I tried searching everything.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve worked on many systems built with all sorts of languages from Python and Scala, at the end of the day, they kinda of have the same level of bugs in production. Given that to release something to production we write lots of tests, these tests catch the problems, hopefully, before they hit production. What is your experience with that? My main concern behind this question is if it&#x27;s worth to pursue a more strict style of Scala with FP given the complexity and time to onboard new hires.

                              <span>Hi Everyone l,
 I have a somewhat weird scenario. I have been invited for a code review interview round with a company that works primarily on scala and a bit on Java. I am a Java resource and have never worked on scala before but they have told me that they are okay to hire people with Java knowledge as they have a pretty decent upskilling plan. However the code review is on a scala code. My question is as a senior Java dev how can I deal with this. I was thinking I will brush up on a few core concepts of functional programming and monads. Anything else you guys suggest. The recruiter said that they ofcourse know that I have never worked on scala so I will be judged accordingly but I am sure there will still be some stuff that I can do.

                              <span>SOLVED: eshell-highlight-prompt being set to nil caused the behavior. Setting to true fixes the issue, which makes me wonder why the setting is used in the repository at all.
 I am excited to start using Eshell after reading about it on Mastering Emacs. Since I wasn&#x27;t happy with default prompt, I installed the eshell-prompt-extras package like the article recommended. However, if I continue pressing backspace, my prompt and previous shell output can be deleted, which is not the correct behavior.
 I understand eshell-prompt-regexp has to match the prompt and I think it does because C-a takes me to the correct place after the prompt. Since Eshell doesn&#x27;t use comint-mode, I don&#x27;t know of a function to make the prompt read-only. Is there any way to achieve the desired behavior?
 My Eshell prompt customization settings are copied and pasted from https://github.com/zwild/eshell-prompt-extras:
 (with-eval-after-load &quot;esh-opt&quot; (autoload &#x27;epe-theme-lambda &quot;eshell-prompt-extras&quot;) (setq eshell-highlight-prompt nil eshell-prompt-function &#x27;epe-theme-lambda))

                              <span>I recently started playing around with stuff to figure out how loading libraries/autoloading works (so this isn&#x27;t for any practical purpose, just didactic), and I&#x27;m at the end of my rope trying to figure out where some documentation is coming from. For some reason, no matter what source files I change, inspecting autoloads with symbol-function returns documentation that seemingly isn&#x27;t on my system anymore.
 Here&#x27;s the setup: start emacs with emacs -Q, and then immediately run:
 (setq help-enable-completion-autoload nil help-enable-autoload nil) 
 If you do C-h f org-agenda, you get the documentation for org-agenda, but if you then inspect C-h v load-history, you can see that nothing org-related has been loaded yet. Evaluating (symbol-function &#x27;org-agenda) reveals how the documentation can…</span>

                              <span>I was wondering if there&#x27;s a plugin which can do similar job like vs code file explorer where it automatically detects the depth of a file and shortens it to a single level.For example if we have com/example/activity it won&#x27;t show the tree but it will shorten it to one level.

                              <span>Given a frame with various windows in it, I want to be able to write text into them without them being associated with a file, and I don&#x27;t want to spam buffers into the buffer list. I was thinking that having a single &quot;log buffer&quot; into which the messages would be written would prevent buffer spamming, and then I could just show the operator a different particular message in each window. Playing around with different things, trying to use indirect buffers with some sort of region narrowing seemed to be a good possible option.
 I didn&#x27;t have much luck with this though:
  (let ((org-dates (list &quot;2020-04-05&quot; &quot;2023-08-02&quot; &quot;2021-09-08&quot; &quot;2019-08-04&quot;))) (delete-other-windows) (split-window-right) (split-window-right) (split-window-right) (balance-windows) (dolist (earlier-journal-entry org-dates) (pop-to-buffer (make-indirect-buffer (get-buffer-create &quot;*Org Roam Daily Reflection Log*&quot;) (generate-new-buffer-name &quot;*indirect*&quot;))) (let* ((start (point)) (org-msg (concat &quot;\n\n* No daily journal entry for &quot; earlier-journal-entry &quot;.&quot;))) (insert org-msg) ;; (org-mode) (narrow-to-region start (point))))) 
 In particular, the narrowing doesn&#x27;t seem to work right. How should I be doing narrowing?
 (If this is at all the right sort of approach to this task.)

 hunspell, ispell, aspell, nuspell, enchant, and the duck knows what else is out there for this shit.
 So, I&#x27;m using minad/jinx, which is absolutely excellent, and if you&#x27;re not using it, you&#x27;re such a schlub, drop whatever you&#x27;re doing right now and try it. 
 Now, jinx uses enchant, okay? And on my Linux machine it works beautifully. I don&#x27;t remember how I did it, what exactly have I installed, but it just works.

I&#x27;m not actually sure how the popularity metric is derived, but I think it&#x27;s based on users who indicated that they had &quot;done extensive development work in over the past year&quot;. Scala is at 2.6% of all respondents, slightly down from 2.77% last year. Among respondents who are professional developers it&#x27;s 2.9%, down from 3.21% last year. Among those still learning to code it&#x27;s 1.7%, way up from 0.77% last year.
 If I had to put some flavor on these numbers I&#x27;d say Scala is still at the top of the long tail of languages. It comes in about 20th among programming languages (ie. I ignored SQL, HTML, bash, etc.) so certainly still relevant. Movement from last year is negligible except for new developers, which is very cool.

                              <span>So I am mainly a C# and python guy and I would like to know how much in demand is scala, now I know it is not gonna be JS-levels of demand, but my mindset is to pick a lang that both is niche not to have a lot of competition but still have some tangible demand not to be completely irrelevant. How does scala fare in that department?
 Thanks in advance for your response.

Before I read a new book, I&#x27;m interested in how it relates to the books I&#x27;ve read so far. To get an initial overview, I simply create a new Reference Note for the book in my Zettelkasten. It consists of a brief description of the book and a few references to existing notes.
When I quickly look through the bibliography, I find these references. They are links to books that I have already read or to books that are on my reading list. These are simply added to link the Reference Note. The graphical overview is generated automatically by the Zettelkasten tool.

The resulting literature map helps to provide an initial overview. By adding a few details, the map becomes somewhat easier to read as a concept map.

The concept map will be refined further. Quotations and ideas from the existing &#x27;Reference Notes&#x27; make the &#x27;Bibliographic Map&#x27; easier to read. It now offers a good overview that facilitates the overall understanding of this bibliographic network.

My learning: The notes in my Zettelkasten benefit from being reduced in size (digital: 500 words or analogue: 5x7&quot; paper size). One note, one idea. But all the connections of my networked notes remain invisible. They are represented by simple hyperlinks on each note. Understanding context means having visibility of these networks. Using Concept Maps with an infinite canvas size is a great help.

                              <span>Hey everybody, just wanted to bring some attention to a library I am working on.
 https://hackage.haskell.org/package/htmx
 This is roughly based on &#x60;lucid-htmx&#x60;, but is different enough that I think it can be considered stand alone and not a fork. Notable differences:
  
Not using the old &#x60;data&#x60; based tags
 New type-safe interfaces for various htmx enumerations
 Module structure tries to follow some htmx concepts (like core and extra attributes)
 Significant documentation
 Additional attributes that didn&#x27;t exist in &#x60;lucid-htmx&#x60;
  
I am going to try and stay active on the issue tracker, and keep this package up to date with new GHC indexes. Hope this is useful to some of you.

 More or less satisfied so far, but may be there are some tips i just don&#x27;t know about.
 What i really want is ability to verically align &quot;::&quot; and &quot;&#x3D;&quot; on function declaration, like in snippet below (dots mean spaces). Or at least vertically align on &quot;&#x3D;&quot;
 func .......:: Int -&gt; Int -&gt; Int
 func 1 y ....&#x3D; 10 + y
 func 100 yyy &#x3D; 1000 + yyy
 funv _ _ ....&#x3D; -1

 How can I use orgmode to get citations in the form
 Smith, Wu, …, Miller (2023) Nature
 i.e. First Author, Second Author, ..., Last Author (year) Journal
 (This is my preferred form to cite things in presentations in life science field.)
 I am having a hard time reading the corresponding section in the manual trying to extract the necessary information.
 Ideally, I could dynamically decide on how many authors to cite &#x27;at each end&#x27;.
 Any solution using CSL or biblatex as drivers would be highly appreciated!

                              <span>In my notes collection I use org-publish to create a nice personal website out of org-roam files. I have an index file that programmatically lists posts in categories, with tags, or in alphabetical indices. I do this via macros that expand into dynamic blocks and run all dynamic blocks during export via a source block near the bottom of the page.
 It&#x27;s slow. Real slow. I do all the post link lookups using org-roam, so I assume that&#x27;s just sqlite db queries. Then I use very minimal org syntax to turn it into links.
 I realised recently that I could probably do the same thing via exported source code block results, since I only need all this stuff during export.
 Is there a noticeable performance difference between org-babel exporting the results of some Lisp code, and that same Lisp code being used via dynamic blocks?

                              <span>I want to rebind &#x27;q&#x27; (normal-state) in org-agenda. The actual keybind that is finally applied seems to be defined by evil-org-agenda minor mode (how do I tell?).
 I tried:
 (map!
 :mode org-agenda-mode
 :map general-override-mode-map
 :n
 &quot;q&quot; &#x27;org-agenda-exit)
 The idea being &quot;:mode org-agenda-mode&quot; will make sure that the keybind is set only in that mode and &quot;map general-override-mode-map&quot; should override any possible high priority keymap.
 This does not work.

                              <span>I have tried doing
 (setq-default indent-tabs-mode t)
 (setq-default tab-width 4)
 (defvaralias &#x27;c-basic-offset &#x27;tab-width)
 (setq ruby-indent-tabs-mode t)
 (defvaralias &#x27;ruby-indent-level &#x27;tab-width)
 (defvaralias &#x27;sgml-basic-offset &#x27;tab-width)
 But it doesn&#x27;t work. This leads to tabs just being composed of 4 spaces, not one tab. Similar to the neovim editor, I want tabs to be just tabs. One large block, instead of being packed with several tiny spaces. I need this for indentation. Relying on tabs to be just full of spaces is impossible for me. Can anyone help. I have tried several solutions, but they all are just solutions which means tabs will be filled with &#x27;x&#x27; no of spaces. not tabs with TABS. I am new to Emacs, and I have heard this whole tab business is not very straightforward. So please do explain if I got something wrong
 EDIT - I got the solution from this kind soul on stackoverflow https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6471803/making-emacs-tabs-behave-exactly-like-vims
 (eval-after-load &quot;cc-mode&quot; &#x27;(define-key c-mode-map (kbd &quot;TAB&quot;) &#x27;self-insert-command)) (global-set-key (kbd &quot;DEL&quot;) &#x27;backward-delete-char) (setq c-backspace-function &#x27;backward-delete-char) 
 This treats tabs as one large tab. You can have the same control as neovim. It also deletes the entire tabs via the single backspace. I am not sure if this is gonna work with javascript. But I hope this post will help others
 This is all I have put in my init.el file related to tabs
 (setq-default indent-tabs-mode t) (setq-default tab-width 4) (defvaralias &#x27;c-basic-offset &#x27;tab-width) (setq ruby-indent-tabs-mode t) (defvaralias &#x27;ruby-indent-level &#x27;tab-width) (defvaralias &#x27;sgml-basic-offset &#x27;tab-width) (eval-after-load &quot;cc-mode&quot; &#x27;(define-key c-mode-map (kbd &quot;TAB&quot;) &#x27;self-insert-command)) (global-set-key (kbd &quot;DEL&quot;) &#x27;backward-delete-char) (setq c-backspace-function &#x27;backward-delete-char)

I&#x27;m sure I can convert it manually, but just want to check that it isn&#x27;t listed as something odd in the existing set of Info pages.

                              <span>Hello.
 During upgrade to scala 3, a code involving reads/writes to json, raises a &quot;Ambiguous given instances&quot; error which I&#x27;m not sure how to solve.
 It only happens when trying to serialize a Seq of a type, not the type itself.
 Here&#x27;s a Scastie to demonstrate:

                              <span>Hi Everyone, I got a staff offer but my past experience is more on C# and Azure, the new team is full stack Scala and GCP. I’m nervous about the swift change, and really appreciate any advice and suggestions how to ramp up them quickly. Thanks!

                              <span>Me again! after removing some libraries, my project now depends on:
  
containers
 mtl
 transformers
 singletons
 singletons-base
 parsec
  
Nevertheless, since I&#x27;m using ghc-wasm-meta, I cannot really include the singletons-base package (since it depends on th-orphans and the WASM backend doesn&#x27;t support TH yet).
 I might be able to patch things up, if I can just expand the TH definitions in the singletons-base package, but I don&#x27;t really know how to do this without just forking the repo, running cabal build with -ddump-splices -ddump-to-file flags, and manually deleting the _XXXX identifiers.
 Is there a better way to do this?

                              <span>I&#x27;m not new to emacs but I&#x27;ll confess I look under the hood much less than I think I should, so bear with me if I&#x27;m not giving enough details yet.
 I&#x27;m connecting to a remote machine via SSH and Tramp, and I can edit files normally. But when I try to stage a file, emacs just hangs until I press Ctrl+G. If I stage through the command line and try to commit, *Messages* displays &quot;condition-case: Wrong number of arguments: transient--emergency-exit, 1&quot; and nothing happens in Magit.
 How do I start debugging this one?

                              <span>Quick question, before I dive head first into tree sitter land.
 I have a 2400loc file which is super laggy
 Turning off font locking removes my performance issues, so I know it&#x27;s an issue of font locking
 Is switching to tree-sitter likely to fix my perf issues?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve seen some pretty and complex large code bases written in C++ for image manipulation and color space conversions and to the untrained eye they look like having a set of unrelated bunch of source code with same functionality spread between different files, but usually it makes sense due to the chosen of a complex architecture fitting to critical processing and low level access. It can take months to understand what its being done and the process usually feels like trying to take some random file reading it, trying to look its dependencies back and forth until you finally make some sense out of those. Could this process be eased if every file was accompanied by some org file? And could a master org file tell &quot;Hey this is how you should begin reading the source code&quot;

 Let&#x27;s say, will it be possible to do the same with another interpreter? Something like a Lua interpreter and build everything on top of it with pure Lua or a Java&#x27;s JVM and build something on top? Was this tried before?

                              <span>I have quite a few projects and meeting and i keep track of them by using columnview dynamic block to show them in the project (each meeting has a property which points to the project and :match searches for the property). Columview has an option to add Links (so i just need to click on it and see what has been discussed). But this link feature doesnt work if the item are in a different file. 
 So when capturing a meeting with org-capture i just created another property like:
 :LINK: [[file:~/org/meetings.org::*%\1][%\1]]
 which is essentially a link to itself, where %\1 is the Meeting Title and the org headline and add this Property to the columnview. That way i can click on it form a project and see what the meeting was about.
 Now the Problem: the headline might not be unique (e.g. weekly repeating meeting) and there for i thought it might be a better idea to use a custom_id for example. So i tried to use a capture template like this:
 * %^{Meeting}
 :PROPERTIES:
 :PROJECT:
 :ATTENDEE:
 :LINK: [[file:~/org/meetings.org::*%\1][%\1]
 :CUSTOM_ID: %-%(string-replace &quot; &quot; &quot;-&quot; &quot;%\\1&quot;)
 :LINK2: [[id:%-%(replace-regexp-in-string &quot;\s&quot; &quot;-&quot; &quot;%\\1&quot;)][%\1]]
 :ID: %(org-id-new)
 :END:
 I try to replace the whitespace in the headline as this would be no valid ID. But that doesnt work it gets evaluated but the whitespaces are not replaced. i could reuse :ID: aswell but dont know how in a capture template. Ideas??

                              <span>Hi everyone, I have to locate lines in a text file, where an opening double quote is followed exclusively by a lowercase letter
 I have tried in my terminal and did a grep search grep &#x27;&quot;[a-z] my file.txt it worked fine.
 But in emacs, I have been trying with grep, rg, occur... I get text with uppercase letters... like &quot;Find or &quot;Cut... Since I have more than 2000 entries to possibly fix, I want to do it within emacs .
 How shall I proceed in emacs to have it work? Why isn&#x27;t it working like it should?
 thanks for your help

                              <span>So I have set a background transparency in gui emacs according to this guide https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/TransparentEmacs . And everything seems fine except one annoying thing, which I at least can&#x27;t set or understand, is it possible to have a solid color on modeline in emacs when you have set background transparency? I want to use packages like https://github.com/dbordak/telephone-line or https://github.com/tarsius/moody . And they look ugly without solid color on modeline, is it possible to do this in emacs?

Inspired by @ZettelDistraction, I&#x27;ve developed my own Custom Note Critic GPT, which I&#x27;ll share if you are interested. He focuses more on the formatting of the note, and I&#x27;ve made mine a writing tutor, pointing out areas where I can be more concise and more engaging and explain my ideas with confidence and clarity.


@ZettelDistraction said,

  
I would like to see this. In the spirit of the Paris Olympics, we could have a &quot;GPT-off&quot; to compare GPT output, Zettel by Zettel.


Here ya go! There is no guarantee that once you see this, you won&#x27;t puke.

I&#x27;ll have to run the same note through both GPTs and compare the results. This could be a big project.</span>

This is yet another opportunity to share with your friends what you are working on. Add to this discussion by telling us about your zettelkasten journey. Share with us what you&#x27;re learning. Sharing helps me and, hopefully, you, too. It helps us clarify our goals and visualize our thinking. And sometimes, a conversation sparks a magical moment where we can dive into an idea worth exploring. I&#x27;d love to hear more from you.   🫵🏼
Here is my report on why I&#x27;m here and my current ZK work themes/ideas:
I&#x27;m writing this report to give a snapshot of my recent accomplishments and what&#x27;s coming next in my ZK journey. Wow! I had a mind-blitzing Zoom chat with @ZettelDistraction.

                              <span>Greetings,
 I am trying to make use of the &quot;wuss&quot; secure websockets library, at https://hackage.haskell.org/package/wuss. This adds TLS to the underlying websockets library.
 I can build and install the library fine with GHC 9.8.2, and the sample client at https://github.com/tfausak/wuss also builds fine. However, when I go to run it, it fails as follows:
 dyld[44192]: missing symbol called
 In this case, 44192 is just the PID. I tried using otool to see if there is a missing dynamic library, but I believe this shows that there is no missing library as such. Most likely, the &quot;missing symbol&quot; means that the library that is used, doesn&#x27;t have something that is called. However, the error doesn&#x27;t specify the issue there.
 otool -L ./dist-newstyle/build/aarch64-osx/ghc-9.8.2/wussTest-0.1.0.0/x/wussTest/build/wussTest/wussTest
 ./dist-newstyle/build/aarch64-osx/ghc-9.8.2/wussTest-0.1.0.0/x/wussTest/build/wussTest/wussTest:
 /usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1345.100.2) /opt/local/lib/libz.1.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1.2.11) /opt/local/lib/libffi.8.dylib (compatibility version 10.0.0, current version 10.0.0) 
 Any thoughts on how to resolve?

                              <span>Dear Haskellers
 I&#x27;ve been struggling with a strictness/laziness issue in a recursive mini-language I&#x27;ve been trying to define. I&#x27;ll present a pruned version here to narrow the code to the focus of my issue. 
 I can encode my problem with 5 combinators:
 haskell data Recur t a &#x3D; Val a -- ^ A stored value | Hop t -- ^ A jump-to-binding statement | Seq [Recur t a] -- ^ A sequence of &#x27;Recur&#x27; statements | Opt [Recur t a] -- ^ A choice of &#x27;Recur&#x27; statements | Bnd t (Recur t a) (Recur t a) -- ^ An introduce-binding statement deriving Eq makeBaseFunctor &#x27;&#x27;Recur 
 Then I can define recursive sequences like this:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;haskell type R &#x3D; Recur Text Int
 x12, x34 :: R x12 &#x3D; Seq [Val 1, Val 2] x34 &#x3D; Seq [Val 3, Val 4]
 n1, n2, n3 :: R n1 &#x3D; Opt [x12, x34] n2 &#x3D; Seq [n1, n1] n3 &#x3D; Bnd &quot;x&quot; n1 (Seq [Hop &quot;x&quot;, H…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking for project ideas for a final assignment in a college course using a functional language. We primarily used Haskell, but we&#x27;re open to other functional languages if the project is interesting.
 The project should take around two weeks for two advanced software engineering students, so it should have some complexity (but not too much). Preferably it should use a monadic strategy to solve a problem.
 I&#x27;ve already built a compiler in a previous course, so I&#x27;d prefer not to go that route again. I was considering creating a SAT solver, but one of our teachers mentioned it involves a lot of state management, so I&#x27;m unsure if it&#x27;s the best fit.
 Any suggestions or advice would be greatly appreciated!

                              <span>Streamly is a concurrent stream and array library supporting a wide range of functionality.
 Important features in the new release include: (1) fast binary serialization to arrays with an option to serialize record field names; (2) the array type can now represent pinned as well unpinned memory, unifying the representations used by bytestring, text and vector; and (3) concurrency support for folds.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been working on a project, and I&#x27;ve recently hit a devops-ish kind of issue: after getting ghc-wasm through nix flakes, I&#x27;m trying to compile the project by: wasm32-wasi-cabal build WASM --flags&#x3D;&quot;wasm&quot;, but I get errors building happy and th-orphans.
 happy error:
  Configuring executable &#x27;happy&#x27; for happy-1.20.1.1... Preprocessing executable &#x27;happy&#x27; for happy-1.20.1.1...

 th-orphans error:

 Regarding the happy error, although there is no unlit executable in that folder, there is one called wasm32-wasi-unlit, so I believe some sort of symlink can solve this, but I have no idea on how to include this in the flakes.nix file.
 Regarding the th-orphans error, I&#x27;m totally clueless.
 P.D: don&#x27;t mind too much about stack in the flakes, it&#x27;s there because I wanted to make sure that the other executable compiles normally.

                              <span>I&#x27;m finding the &#x60;._&#x60; import so confusing and this is heavily used by the Scala community. My main issue is, given that you have multiple &#x60;._&#x60; imports it&#x27;s difficult to reason about the origin of the thing you&#x27;re using or what is available to be used.
 For those that have been using Scala for a long time, this improves over time and do you have this same feeling?

                              <span>ok right out of the game i&#x27;m using doom emacs, aside from the org plugins that comes with it i&#x27;m using org-auto-tangle (not the case for this file) and org-modern. now onto the issue.
 I have a very long list, with many subnested lists (think of it as a tree), and as of now it&#x27;s currently 6000 ish elements.
 before you say why such a big list it&#x27;s stuff I want to buy, it&#x27;s a way to autocontrol..
 whenever I C-c C-c on anything, that be a checkbox or a counting box (the [/], idk the proper name), it takes a lot, like a good two minutes at least.
 i tried to profiling, and it seems taht org-element--list-struct in memory section is the biggest one, with match-data in cpu, but the latter it&#x27;s only a 6%. I can post the full profiling if it can help, but from my (poor) understanding of the profiling reoprt, these two are what takes longer. is there a way i can improve the performance? or do I have to split it down into smaller lists? i have such giant single list because I like to have at the top two boxes that one is the percentage and the other one is the counting one. if there is a way to divide the list into the various categories, maybe with *s, while keeping an overall &quot;completion&quot; on the top, that would solve the issue.
 tl;dr i have a giant list. can i improve the performance? I just chronometered it, and it clocked it at around five minutes. or, if I break it down to more smaller lists, is there a way I can keep track of the overall progress?

 Release notes:
  
The change in major version from 2.x to 3.1 marks the dropping of support for versions of GHC before 8.4, deprecated in Stack 2.15.1.
  
Changes since v2.15.7:
 Behavior changes:
  
Stack uses the version of the Cabal package that comes with the specified version of GHC. Stack no longer supports such Cabal versions before 2.2, which came with versions of GHC before 8.4. Consequently, the init command will not try LTS Haskell before 12.0.
 The init command initialises stack.yaml with a snapshot key rather than a resolver key.
 After installing GHC or another tool, Stack deletes the archive file which provided the tool.
 Remove hidden flag --skip-intermediate-deps, effectively deprecated since Stack 1…</span>

                              <span>Hi,
 I am struggling to find the relevant documentation to get emacs to work with debugpy remotely.
 I have an app locally in docker, debug server running inside the docker, exposing port for connection.
 It seems I need to set up an lsp-docker.yml file but I cannot find a single reference specific to debugpy (which is a relatively common debugger - it&#x27;s a ms product designed for vscode - I would change it to pdb but team project and not possible)
 Anyone has experience working with this?
 Thanks!

                              <span>I create a new Scala project placing the content below by following its doc here and here
 # project/plugins.sbt addSbtPlugin(&quot;org.scalameta&quot; % &quot;sbt-scalafmt&quot; % &quot;2.5.2&quot;) # .scalafmt.conf version &#x3D; &quot;3.8.3&quot; runner.dialect &#x3D; scala3 
 But when hovering over .scalafmt.conf, the vscode hints with the message below, though sbt package doesn&#x27;t throw any error.
 Invalid config: Default dialect is deprecated; use explicit: [sbt0137,sbt1,scala211,scala212,scala212source3,scala213,scala213source3,scala3,scala3future] Also see https://scalameta.org/scalafmt/docs/configuration.html#scala-dialects&quot; 
 What is the right way to configure scalafmt, allowing the vscode to format my code automatically?
 My environment
  
Scala: 3.4.0
 Java: 21.0.4
 sbt: 1.9.8
 vscode: 1.91.1
  
Thanks

 One question I had was, how can I get the date to display on the search screen. There are a lot of images of the elfeed search screen that show the date listed. I have posted an image below. 
 Elfeed with date column
 However, when I run my elfeed search screen in Spacemacs, I don&#x27;t see the date listed.
 Elfeed without date column
 Is there a specific configuration variable that I need to change? I looked through the elfeed docs, but I did not find any references to this.

                              <span>So I have a pretty good working setup for completions, but there is one annoyance that I haven&#x27;t figured out how to change. I&#x27;m writing both python and rust, and my issue is that when I select a completion for a function name or class, it always puts opening and closing parenthesis after it, automatically. Meaning, I type:
 my_obj.beginning_of_metho
 and it (corfu) gives me the option:
 beginning_of_method
 I select it, and what it inserts is:
 my_obj.beginning_of_method(argname1, argname2)
 Which is right 80% of the time, and infuriating that 20% of the time that I needed to pass that bare function somewhere. Its more annoying with class names, it puts parens in when I&#x27;m just trying to make a type hint. 
 I&#x27;ve seen this behavior with rust-analyzer, jedi-language-server and pyright, so I don&#x27;t think its server specific, and I&#x27;ve seen it with lsp-mode and eglot so I don&#x27;t think its specific to those modes. I&#x27;m using corfu, but I haven&#x27;t figured out a switch in corfu to change this behavior.
 The ideal behavior in my opinion would be when I select the method name, it inserts just that:
 my_obj.beginning_of_method
 And then if I type an open paren
 my_obj.beginning_of_method(
 At that point it would insert the args with the closing paren.
 my_obj.beginning_of_method(argname1, argname2)
 Has anyone else figured out how to do this? I can&#x27;t be the only person annoyed by this behavior.

 When I try same with &#x60;git worktree add -f ../new-work-tree main&#x60; is it able to create directory and checkout just fine.
 Am I missing anything here? 
 Also side-note: I see these &quot;file missing&quot; errors also when using other modes. Wondering if there any variables I can set to make it default behavior everywhere. 
 Thanks in advance :)

                              <span>I know this may be the wrong place to ask… but let’s give a try. I have some complex objects in my code, by complex I mean that they describe “actions” and they have an impact, may have preconditions, and may have incompatibilities. All these elements are maps from the same set of keys to to integer values. And these values may be 0, 1… or max-1, max (where max is maximum value) They are now described in my Scala code, but would like to give some SME, non programmers, the ability to modify them. I must say that the I find the Scala code reasonably easy to read, but probably will be error prone. From a usability perspective do you have any experience on what would work better? - Teach some Scala (case classes mostly) - Build a DSL - Provide a GUI
 Thanks!

I am currently a senior backend engineer and got an offer for a lead software engineer where the company used Scala. Although the role and compensation is good I am thinking if it will be a wise move to Scala from Java in terms of future scope and opportunities. Can someone who have similar experience share some thoughts, it will be helpful

                              <span>I tried solving https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/5 in Haskell because it looked like a good problem to use the State monad.
 However, there was no need to use the State monad. Just mconcating endomorphisms s -&gt; s is the appropriate way to solve the problem https://stackoverflow.com/a/3411461.
 Can someone suggest a toy programming puzzle where you actually need to use the computation result a in the State monad s -&gt; (s, a)

I am finishing my processing of the third part on how to read the various genres of non-fiction.
It seems to me that this section should be retitled as &quot;Our basic view on the philosophy of XY (social science, history etc.)&quot; I can&#x27;t get anything out of the whole part.
Did you get something out of the third part?
Live long and prosper

 I enjoyed this variant the most in neovim: https://github.com/echasnovski/mini.nvim/blob/main/readmes/mini-files.md

                              <span>I am relatively new to using &#x60;elfeed&#x60;. I used it years ago, then I forgot about it for a while, and recently came back.
 So I was wondering about the current best way to filter the posts by tags, so that I can focus on specific groups of posts instead of the entire stream. I was looking at Mike Zemansky&#x27;s approach to filter the posts using a hydra and a macro. It looks pretty good, and I was working towards that. However, I realized that this approach was 7 years old. 
 Hence, I was wondering if there are any better or improved ways to filter posts today, that were not referenced in Mike Zemansky&#x27;s post? I believe in his code, emacs looks for all unique tags in the total feed, defines shortcut or hydra keys, and finally creates a hydra that the user can use to search for those posts. So it seems simple and nice. 
 But as I said, I was not sure if there was a package to do this now, or do I have to write that code myself in my &#x60;.spacemacs&#x60; file. Any suggestions are welcome.

                              <span>I frequently use magit refs buffer to switch between branches. However, for a large repository that I am currently using, switching between branches or refreshing the magit refs buffer takes a minute or more on a modern macbook, and emacs gets hung up for a long time. The output after magit-toggle-verbose-refresh shows the largest time consuming operation
 magit-insert-tags 50.73 
 I tried to disable it with
 (remove-hook &#x27;magit-status-sections-hook &#x27;magit-insert-tags) 
 in init.el however I get a completely blank magit refs buffer after that, and plus I don&#x27;t want to disable it for all repositories. I also tried including
 ((magit-status-mode . ((eval . (magit-disable-section-inserter &#x27;magit-insert-tags))))) ((magit-refs-mode . ((eval . (magit-disable-section-inserter &#x27;magit-insert-tags))))) 
 in the .dir-locals.el file but that didn&#x27;t have any effect.
 I am wondering how I could disable magit-insert-tags while also displaying the branches. I am inclined towards repository specific rather than an init.el solution.

 I have this route with zio-http, but the page is returning a 500 with an error that doesn&#x27;t make sense: Validation failed for header &#x27;warning&#x27;
 How would you debug cases like this? 
 Typically, in java, I just add a breakpoint or at least add logs. I&#x27;m not sure how to do this in scala.

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to move away from using bespoke query building logic in a Haskell service at work. My impression from surveying some of the popular options (Beam, Persistent, Opaleye...) is that while they have tools to pull schemas and synchronize with your database, they still require you to manually declare types corresponding to tables. 
 This Haskell service is however one of many accessing the database and the schema changes somewhat frequently, so manually keeping types in sync isn&#x27;t ideal. In the parts of our codebase that are written in TypeScript we use libraries like prisma and prisma-kysely to generate type definitions and the experience has been pretty good. 
 Is there anything like this in the Haskell space? My hope is that I wouldn&#x27;t need to manually edit type definitions if someone else at the company adds a table or changes a column somewhere in the DB.

                              <span>I&#x27;m pretty new to Haskell, enjoying developing a web app using Scotty, but I&#x27;m struggling to figure out how I can launch (background) async IO operations.
 For example, let&#x27;s say I have a handle function:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;haskell longBackgroundIOStuff :: IO () ...
 handleSomething :: ActionM () handleSomething conn &#x3D; do my_param :: String  { longAsyncIOFunction(); res.redirect(&#x27;/&#x27;) }); 
 What would be the best way to accomplish this with Scotty? Thanks so much and sorry if this isn&#x27;t the best forum for these kinds of questions.

                              <span>Hello,
 I was wondering if it is possible to achieve the following:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; class C t where type D t transform :: t -&gt; D t -&gt; [D t]
 funGeneric :: (C t) &#x3D;&gt; t -&gt; D t -&gt; [D t] funGeneric t initial &#x3D; _ {-# NOINLINE funGeneric #-}
 funSpecialized :: (C t, Int ~ D t) &#x3D;&gt; t -&gt; Int -&gt; [Int] funSpecialized t initial &#x3D; _
 instance C () where type D () &#x3D; Int transform _ i &#x3D; _
 {-# RULES &quot;specialize\Int&quot; forall x y. funGeneric x y &#x3D; funSpecialized x y #-} &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 and then, for instance:
  someFun :: Int -&gt; IO () someFun initial &#x3D; print $ funGeneric () initial 
 where I&#x27;d expect funGeneric to be re-written to funSpecialized The rule itself type-checks, but no matter what I try, it never fires due to:
  
&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; Rule check &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; 
 Rule check results: 
 Expression: funGeneric
 ($ctransform &#x60;cast&#x60;  :: (() -&gt; D () -&gt; [D ()]) ~R# C ()) () (initial &#x60;cast&#x60;  :: Int ~R# D ()) 
 Rule &quot;specialize\Int&quot;: arguments [4] do not match (1-indexing)

                              <span>So I&#x27;m still studying at college but this being my last year I have a lot of free time to get real world experience. I can do a little of everything, I can code with SpringBoot, .NET, NodeJS or Django. Also React and Angular, and SQL databases. I already know Git too.
 If these skills are not enough I can still learn a lot by myself in my free time and catch up to your required skill set.
 If you are interested please send me a DM and let&#x27;s talk!

                              <span>Basically, I&#x27;ve stayed at my job for 6 years. In my country there were at some point max 3 - 4 companies using Scala, even not full time, and now it is even rarer. When I got my first interview for a international remote job I had about 1.5 years of Scala experience, but 4 years total experience. I went pretty far but didn&#x27;t get it because lack of experience. After that, I&#x27;ve had up to a dozen of these kinds of interviews, for a remote international team, but I never managed to get a job. Now finally I have found a new job but it is not a great project and not what I want.
 I am not the most enthusiastic person when it comes always being up to date and reading blogs and stuff and also for the past years, I have not been a person who got assigned to the more complex stuff in my company. Otherwise I have a pretty good basis for algorithms and coding challenges (although I failed the last one which was live coding using lots of Scala generics).
 Now, it seems to me that when recruiting for a remote team, especially for a senior position, the stands for a Scala developer are pretty high and the projects are not simple (relatively, like more distributed stuff).
 Does anyone have more insights how this compares to other languages. A lot of people that I know which I wold think were at my level as a developer or even sub, got remote jobs or jobs away from my country, and I am feeling stuck. I keep wondering if it would have been easier to find this kind of remote job if i stayed with C# or moved to Java, and not due to lack of opportunities in the Scala world....

                              <span>I&#x27;m coming from a lower level kind of languages and I&#x27;m wondering how using this an effect system can impact performance. For example, what is the performance impact of using a HTTP server in ZIO or Cats Effect instead of a plain Java one. It&#x27;s likely that Scala will be slower, that is the expected, but what I&#x27;m wondering is how slow.

                              <span>Hello.
 In Scala 2.13 we were using the TypeCase from Shapeless library to overcome type erasure in pattern matching. demonstration:
 private val &#x60;Seq[AlertEntity]&#x60; &#x3D; TypeCase[Seq[AlertEntity]] def onGetAlerts(arg: Any): Unit &#x3D; arg match { case &#x60;Seq[AlertEntity]&#x60;(alerts) &#x3D;&gt; () } 
 It was pretty convenient.
 Now upgrading to Scala 3 and checking if there a new canonical way to do it or if I should best stay with the current implementation.
 Saw TypeTest but wasn&#x27;t sure how to use it even for this simple example.

                              <span>I really like the indicators (specifically for headings) provided by org-margin, but it does not work with org-indent-mode. Is there a way to get these two to work together or to possibly do something similar to org-margin? Thanks.
 Update...
 I ended up just overriding the function org-margin-mode-on by removing the piece that threw the error. Not sure if this is a particularly good idea, but everything seems fine for now.

                              <span>I&#x27;m using emacs to write Common Lisp code, and paredit doesn&#x27;t respect the syntax of read macros. So, for example, when I write #P or #C or any other dispatch read macro(like my lovely home-brew λ)and open parenthesis or double quotes, it will insert a space before inserting the pair, and I have to double back to erase it. It&#x27;s a really minor inconvenience, but I&#x27;m wondering if there&#x27;s already a good solution to this problem or if anyone would be interested in improvement to paredit to correct this.
 You can just disable the behavior by adding to your .emacs, or whenever after paredit is loaded, 
 (defun paredit-space-for-delimiter-p (endp delimiter) nil) 
 But obviously this is a bit of a hack, and though I might try this out for now because I haven&#x27;t ever noticed the space-adding behavior to be useful, I might find I&#x27;ll miss it when it&#x27;s gone, and want a more syntax aware paredit. 
 I noticed there&#x27;s also a paredit-space-for-delimiter-predicates variable which you could use(or just use to disable the behavior in a less hacky way), but I would need to somehow query slime/swank to to robustly find out what the active read macros are(and I don&#x27;t know how to do that at the moment), as well as actually parse them(which is messy but doable).

                              <span>Hi folks,
 This is a package (early WIP, but usable for now) that enables formatting code in buffers via text properties.
 Long story short, it allows you to use any formatting function/command (like format-all-buffer or apheleia-format-buffer) to visually format the code in the buffer without actually modifying it. This is acheived by changing the text properties of the code with the spaces taken from the formatted code.
 This can be useful when working in a team and the codebase is poorly formatted, or when you don&#x27;t like the coding style and you want to view the code in the style you like.
 This can be seen as an ~equivalent~ to Resharper&#x27;s Virtual Formatter, which I just heard about when I started working on this package, but never used it actually.
 The current implementation requires treesit, so you will need Emacs 29+ with Tree Sitter support.

Announcing ghciwatch 1.0 by Rebecca Turner
At Mercury, we’ve developed a file-watching recompiler for Haskell projects called ghciwatch, which loads a GHCi session (a Haskell REPL) and instructs it to reload or add modules when files in your project change. Ghciwatch is very similar in design to Neil Mitchell’s excellent ghcid, but with a few new tricks up its sleeve.

                              <span>I think I&#x27;ve realized that I don&#x27;t like that my habits are bunched together at the bottom of my agenda&#x27;s day view. Since I give my habits specific time slots during a day (I&#x27;m trying to be consistent of WHEN I do my habits), it would be nice to have them show up in relation to the current time.
 So I&#x27;m considering just removing the habit style and just setting them up as recurring scheduled TODOs but I want to confirm there aren&#x27;t other beneficial features to keeping it as a habit that I might not be aware of.
 Thanks

                              <span>I&#x27;m using the completion feature of HLS provided by ghcide in VS code (I&#x27;m getting the same behavior on Mac and Windows).
 If I start typing, it gives me autocomplete options for all functions from any package it knows about -- awesome.
 But if I do
 import qualified Data.ByteString as B B.p 
 The B.p will give completion options for all functions starting with the letter p from any package, rather than only showing functions from Data.ByteString.
 Is this how it&#x27;s supposed to work? Are there any workarounds/customizations that will make it useable? There&#x27;s no point in autocomplete if I have to type out the whole function name to eliminate irrelevant functions.

I tried by downloading and installing the necessary eMacs packages from mobaxterm package list and then in the terminal when I’m trying to invoke eMacs or even emacs —version it say that I should use install emacs and is opening the moba text editor instead. And when I’m trying to install emacs (with the apt-get..command)…it says the package already exits. How can I rectify this issue ? Any help is highly appreciated

                              <span>I run many Elisp scripts on my org-node zettelkasten, which is 2000+ Org files. So I&#x27;ve had plenty of situations where I hit this old nugget:
  File mode specification error: (file-error Cannot open load file Too many open files debug) 
 Now I&#x27;m wondering why. I take care to kill the buffer on each iteration, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to matter. But! If I let a function process only 500 files, then finish, then run it again for the next 500 and so on, it works out. Is the call stack holding on to all file descriptors opened by children?
 Anyway, a problem I cannot solve: I have no insight into the org-publish codebase, and recently I found that the count of files I want to publish has exceeded 1024. So now I cannot publish. Has anyone worked around that? My publish code.
 Root of the issue 
 On Linux you might think the issue is ulimit -n which defaults to 1024 (on Debian at least), but it turns out that even if you increase that then Emacs will just die. The base problem sounds like a compiled-in FD_SETSIZE value of 1024.
 Last year it seems someone tried to patch it: https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2022-05/msg00115.html but this person says it just made Emacs unresponsive.

                              <span>I have just had this idea and I think it&#x27;d be pretty useful. Knowing emacs, there&#x27;s a good change that either it&#x27;s already a package or a snippet exists online. 
 The idea is this. After entering a command, say M-x compile , I decide that I want it to be easily repeatable. So I then invoke a hypothetical M-x bind-last-command-to and it prompts for a key, say I now press . Now that compile command is bound to .
 I guess this is kind of like macros, but you bind it after the fact. And it is for a single command (even if it only worked for the last M-x compile it&#x27;d still be useful).
 Anyone know if it exists before I start trying to implement it myself? Thanks.

 Would that be an acceptable email to send there or is there maybe somewhere else I can put the message out to?

 i still don&#x27;t get it. how do i rewrite

                              <span>When I use M-. to go to definition (e.g. with ctags or eglot), often multiple options are shown if the declaration is a header file and source file, e.g.:
 src/foo.c 226:void foo(struct bar *bar) src/foo.h 1:void foo(struct bar *bar); 
 Are there any elisp magicians who know how to make it automatically prefer the C file in this case and jump to it directly without opening a buffer with the choices, and maybe also display a message &quot;both .c and .h files found; using the .c&quot; or similar?
 Or anyone could point me to the docs for this kind of thing, I&#x27;m a bit lost.
 Thanks!

                              <span>I’m trying to get a C# environment up and running in Doom Emacs that can replace Rider. 
 I’ve managed to setup lsp-mode with Omnisharp and enabled decompilation, so I am able to use “go to definition” on .NET system types and external class libraries that are referred to in my project as nuget packages. 
 However if I have a class A in an external nuget package, and let’s say it refers to another type in another nuget package or a .NET system type, then I can’t go to definition from within class A to these types. 
 Rider allows me to do this, but Omnisharp can’t and this is one of the most useful features I use in Rider when debugging or trying to understand the code, and is the one thing that prevents me from going full Emacs for my C# development. 
 Is this a limitation in Omnisharp or can somebody share how to set this up, so I can decompile also referenced code from within a referenced nuget package?

                              <span>Basically, i&#x27;m working on moving the final pieces to org note taking. Many people recommend using git for notes. And on the surface this makes sense. It&#x27;s easy to use, automatic history and off device. But how do you deal with Personal Information in your Notes? Some of it might not be particularly interesting, but when you start using Due Dates and make Tasks on where to go, or whome you interact with, this could be different. Maybe you take a reminder to pick up some medication specific to a Illness you have.
 This might be even more of a problem if you use Org notes at work. Certainly most companies wouldn&#x27;t want you to commit customer data to github/lab.
 So, how do you deal with this? So far the obvious thing is to keep Notes that are work related in their own folder and either not sync that or keep it on our own hosted gitlab instance.
 With personal notes this is a tougher call. I want them on two PCs and my phone. My experience with Syncthing over three devices in the past has been less than stelar. Any other recommendations that work reliably so i can finally leave google keep and todoist behind? (And yes, i know it&#x27;s a bit ironic to care about personal information in org files in a git repo, when it&#x27;s currently all on google and todoist servers. But i want to improve things ;) )

 i am curious is there a way to get vb.net lsp support or in general support in Emacs? I wasn&#x27;t able to find any package whichs helps with that. 
 At work i have to use ALOT of Vb.net in the next weeks, i consider getting a Jetbrains Rider License, but i would prefer to use Emacs for that too.

                              <span>Hi,
A while ago I was reading the following post:
https://forum.zettelkasten.de/discussion/1574/just-started-already-lost-in-clutter-how-do-you-prevent-to-get-lost-in-so-many-notes-and-links/p1
From the feedback it is clear that you should split your note taking into different steps, by using some sort of workflow.
I&#x27;m not arguing against this, but I would like to know how this community spreads this over time. Like for example do you have daily or weekly reviews or something entirely different?
The reason I ask is because most of the time at work, like most of you :-), my day is pretty full and I&#x27;m trying to figure out how to organize my day and/or week to incorporate this workflow.
Thank you</span>

                              <span>Hello! I am retouching my section on the Zettelkasten (within my Zettelkasten), and I am having a hard time finding the source for the following claim, which is that Luhmann stopped using his Zettelkasten in his late years and instead focused on churning out manuscripts as fast as he could, perhaps given that he knew his life was coming to an end due to his illnesses. I cannot for the life of me find the source to this claim (which conveys my inability to properly execute the ZK method, as the claim, without its source, is noted down in one of my notes). But, anyway, I would really appreciate it if someone familiar with this could point me to a direction. I am also starting to believe that I made this up in my mind and convinced myself that I heard or read it somewhere, haha, even though I find it more probable that I heard about this in a podcast.
Thanks in advance!</span>

                              <span>Several months ago, ruff (An extremely fast Python linter and code formatter, written in Rust) introduced a Python LSP written in Rust. Check here. This is NOT the same as ruff-lsp, which is currently supported by Eglot and lsp-mode. Recently in version 0.5.3, they marked it as stable. Several of the other editors, including vscode, vim and helix, already support this LSP.
 Is anyone using this lsp with Eglot?

I figured emacs would be the best place to ask as it&#x27;s proximity to GNU, and also because that&#x27;s where I would want to use said linter anyways. Any help is greatly appreciated. 
 PS: Yes i know the format is ugly :)

                              <span>I have two Linux computers and a Windows computer. I use Emacs on all of them. 
 I&#x27;ve been looking for at handy way to share the Emacs configuration file between the computers. The basic step consists in letting the .emacs file on each computer load a common configuration file from a shared directory in Dropbox. With this in place, if I make a customization change on one computer, it is automatically available to the others.
 At least in theory.
 The challenge is that this sharing of a configuration file causes a lot of problems, because in many cases I want different configurations on the three computers. For example:
  
Path names to files will be different on my Linux and Windows computer.
 Font names are different.
 I have some project-specific configuration for a project that exists on one computer, but not on the others.
  
Also, if I install a new Emacs package on one computer, it will not get automatically installed on the others, and this may cause configuration problems.
 All of this can be solved by a very strict discipline about what goes where in various configuration files. But what I&#x27;d really like to know is this: Has any of you successfully created such a setup that actually works very well? If so, what insight can you share?

I find a lot of answers related to ibuffer etc. but I would like to have that for the normal buffer functionality please

                              <span>I recently built Emacs from scratch and have been using Xwidgets. However, I can’t get edit mode or videos to work. 
 I have tried “e” to enable it, as well as M-x xwidget-webkit-edit-mode, as well as (add-hook ‘xwidget-webkit-mode ‘xwidget-webkit-edit-mode). Nothing seems to work; none of my key presses register and they seem to still execute commands. I thought it might be evil-mode, but disabling that doesn’t help (now everything echoes  is undefined). Does anyone know what the problem might be?
 As well, videos infinitely load. I know this is a known bug but it seemed as though it might have gotten fixed; I’m wondering if I’m missing some packages, I’m on alpine so a relatively minimal set of packages out of the box. 
 Thank you!

                              <span>I am still using it. 
 But nowadays editors have line/word wrapping, including Emacs. My colleagues always use long lines when writing documents but I like using auto-fill-mode to keep lines short.
 I am thinking of giving up auto-fill-mode, but I can&#x27;t help pressing M-q time and time again :D

                              <span>Disclaimer: noob. I use org-mode and evil-mode extensively for notes and generally want text to wrapped at say 80 lines (easier readability, better use of screen-real estate when you&#x27;re using a tiling window manager or a terminal multiplexer). For those who do something similar, looking for some advice:
  
For wrapping text, can someone share a binding to toggle using text width of 80 and/off? Also useful to visually select text and set that to wrap at text width of 80 if you don&#x27;t want the all text wrapped in the file. For the latter, I often visually select the text and use a binding for fill-region-as-paragraph but this joins paragraphs separated by a line. 
 
This:
  
This is some notes blah blah blah
 
  
looks better than this
 - This is some notes blah blah blah 
 , right? I find myself needing to manually adjust for the former--how to have it be done automatically?
  
Do you have wrap at column 80 for everything? I feel like if you have text at several indents deep, those lines are too short because they still get wrapped at column 80. I&#x27;m wondering if perhaps wrapping at 80 characters starting from first non-space character to the last character on the line might be better, but I&#x27;m not sure of any editors that allow for this behavior by default and in this case it would be better to stick with consistent behavior vs. some custom solution that might not cover all edge cases.
  
Much appreciated.

 I&#x27;m trying to export org files to pdf using LaTeX&#x27;s beamer presentation. I&#x27;d like to use the async option to export my presentation but I get the error &#x60;Initializing asynchronous export process Process &#x27;org-export-process&#x27; exited abnormally&#x27; I read the [documentation](https://orgmode.org/manual/The-Export-Dispatcher.html) and says I should configure an init file and set the variable &#x60;org-export-async-init-file&#x27;. I don&#x27;t have much expirience with lisp-emacs and would appreciate your help.
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>Hello, I&#x27;m upgrading a project from Scala 2.13 to Scala 3.
 In the project we have many enums implemented using traits and case objects such as:
 sealed trait ClientRole object ClientRole extends EnumExtender[ClientRole] { case object User extends ClientRole case object Device extends ClientRole } 
 in the base class, EnumExtender, the values method is implemented using TypeTag in the following way:
 abstract class EnumExtender[ENUM_BASE: TypeTag : ClassTag] { ... private val typesMap &#x3D; allTypes final def values: List[ENUM_BASE] &#x3D; typesMap.values.toList private def allTypes &#x3D; { val tpe &#x3D; ru.typeOf[ENUM_BASE] val clazz &#x3D; tpe.typeSymbol.asClass val mirror &#x3D; runtimeMirror(classTag[ENUM_BASE].runtimeClass.getClassLoader) if (!clazz.isSealed || (!clazz.isTrait &amp;&amp; !clazz.isAbstract)) { throw new NoSuchElementException(...) } getSubclasses(clazz).filter(_.isModuleClass).map(t &#x3D;&gt; { val module &#x3D; mirror.staticModule(t.fullName) val i &#x3D; mirror.reflectModule(module).instance.asInstanceOf[ENUM_BASE] i.toString -&gt; i }).toMap } private def getSubclasses(symbol: Symbol): Seq[Symbol] &#x3D; { def children &#x3D; symbol.asClass.knownDirectSubclasses.flatMap(getSubclasses) symbol match { case s if s.isModuleClass &#x3D;&gt; Seq(s) case s if s.isClass &#x3D;&gt; Seq(s) ++ children } } } 
 TypeTag is no longer supported, so I&#x27;m looking for a way to achieve the same functionality, i.e. implementation for the values method.
 I can freely make changes to the EnumExtender base class, but I would like to avoid forcing changes on the actual enum subclasses.

                              <span>Hi everyone!
 I am looking for inspiration/ideas for my master&#x27;s thesis. I will have a year to do it and I am familiar with Haskell, FP and PL theory (with a little bit of language-based security). I don&#x27;t mind doing front-end GUI stuff either.
 I would love to pick your brains&#x27; imagination on something that would be interesting and useful to work on (implementation in Haskell of course :)). Or if you could point me to papers that contain ideas that can be explored in a Master&#x27;s thesis.

                              <span>Im working on a C project, and it would be pretty redundant to put #include 
 #include  .. in multiple codeblocks just so they can tangle to seperate files? is there a way to tangle 1 codeblock into 2 files like#+BEGIN_SRC c :tangle server.c client.c
 #include 
 #include 
 #include 
 #include 
 #include  
 #+END_SRC

                              <span>Hi
 I have many org mode files with lines beginning with dash.
 I want to export these to .html, but org mode process those lines as comments, and they are absent from the HTML exported file.
 I googled this but couldn&#x27;t find any working solution...
 Thanks for your help.
 org mode example : 
  * title1 # some text here is my text code example : #+BEGIN_SRC bash # search for recent files find . -type f -mtime -1 #+END_SRC 
 HTML : 
  title1 here is my text code example : # search for recent files find . -type f -mtime -1 
 What I want :
  title1 # some text here is my text code example : # search for recent files find . -type f -mtime -1

                              <span>Hi
 I ran into a problem with configuration, caused by a malformed database path for a certain package. This causes a problem in emacsql, because it tries to treat the folder name as a file, but the error message is not descriptive at all.
 The more generic question is, how exactly should the user configuration be validated, i.e. I can of course add a check at the beginning of a function that uses it and it works fine, but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m not the first one who thinks about it and there is likely a more elegant/standard way of doing it and maybe some guidelines?
 Current, not very informative error:
 ⛔ Error (use-package): org-roam/:init: EmacSQL had an unhandled condition: sqlitep, nil
 A primitive check:
 (if (file-directory-p org-roam-db-location) (error (format &quot;org-roam-db-location %S should be file, not folder &quot; org-roam-db-location)))

 How can I make the cursor aligned to texts also the same size after increasing the line space
 I increased the line-spacing by adding this in my init.el file 
 (setq-default line-spacing 5)

                              <span>Hello! I am running Spacemacs on Emacs 29.4 and Ubuntu 24.04. I installed elcord, but the thing in the title keeps happening.
 Two people have already reported issues on Windows on the repo, but the difference is that they were on the native build (which works perfectly fine for me w.r.t. elcord). I made an issue, but I suppose the owner abandoned the repo, so I am asking the community for some help. Is anyone in my situation?
 My suspicion is that the sock isn&#x27;t being created properly and as such elcord keeps trying to reconnect, which it will never success because the sock won&#x27;t be created.

                              <span>I am new to programming, Linux, and text editors like Neovim and Emacs. I was looking for tutorials to learn Emacs, but decided to learn Neovim first because it has easy-to-follow tutorials on YouTube. Although Emacs has the best beginner-friendly documentation, it is extensive and overwhelming. I need guidance on how to navigate these documents and where to start. I found a YouTuber with an Emacs playlist, but I have trouble understanding his content. 
 I only have an hour a day to learn, but I need to get my work done. Please advise on how to learn Org mode to start taking notes.

 But when I C-w or M-w text from emacs, I can&#x27;t paste it into Windows apps. Content FROM Windows TO emacs works fine (C-c the text in Windows, C-y in emacs), just not from emacs to windows.
 Any thoughts on what I&#x27;ve done to screw this up, and/or how to fix it?
 If it&#x27;s working for you, do you have your compilation settings handy?

                              <span>Back in my neovim config, i had something set up similar to project-find-file. It would allow me to hit &quot;RET&quot; on the selected entry to open the file in the current window and &quot;C-RET&quot; to open it in a new window.
 Can this be done in emacs? I know that i could write a new function that makes the new window for me before running find-file, but that way i&#x27;d have two &quot;find-file&quot; functions depending on wether i want a new window or not, which is more mental overhead. I also couldn&#x27;t figure out what function is run when hitting Return on a find-file entry in the minibuffer.
 Any way to set up a bind/function that does what i&#x27;m looking for?

                              <span>Hi! persp-project bridges perspective mode to the built-in project.el library. The idea is to create a separate perspective when switching projects. A perspective is an independent workspace for Emacs, similar to multiple desktops in Gnome and MacOS. This integration allows you to easily know which project you&#x27;re currently in, and focus on files that only belong to the current project when switching buffers.
 ⚠️ NOTE: This package has come to life adapting the great package persp-projectile by Bozhidar Batsov with ChatGPT. I didn&#x27;t write a single line of code. What inspired me to create this package is my recent effort to avoid most third party packages, specially if they prefer a newly defined interface over the built-in Emacs interface.
 Also special shutout to Natalie Weizenbaum for making such a great package!
 I would appreciate any feedback, I&#x27;ll try to submit the package to MELPA next.

 Usually when I get a void function error I find something got out of sync in package updates, but I&#x27;ve gone through a complete rebuild (deleting all under elpa/, straight/ and transient/) to no avail--this is with emacs 29.4. I have another machine with emacs 29.3 and same dotfiles and the function works fine.
 Any suggestions on how to fix or where to look next? The function isn&#x27;t loaded--I get nothing when using C-h, f.

                              <span>Hi, I just started using emacs a few days ago and tried to get auto-completion to work for c/c++ so I decided to use company (because a guy on YT called Uncle Dave said it was cool). Unfortunately I get this very strange error in the minibuffer saying:
 Symbol&#x27;s function definition is void: pos-bol
 And no completions show up.
 Auto-completion works with elisp (which comes by default I suppose), but not with c/c++.
 Also when I do M-x company-diag It says:
 Used backend: company-irony Major mode: c++-mode Prefix: &quot;inc&quot; Completions: none(error fetching) 
 (I tried to type #include)
 I am using Linux Mint with Emacs version 27.1. I also tried to use Emacs 29 but it doesn&#x27;t work there either, It gives an error saying:
 Irony server is broken! ... error status 127
 Did anyone have this issue and is it worth solving it or should I just use auto-complete?

                              <span>Hi there, i work in IT for 20 years, first as developer then as sysadmin.
 I worked in win, mac, gentoo, debian, redhat and for every circumstance i used different prebuilt ide like eclipse, visual studio and jetbrains, and vim with minimum knowledge for server management (copy, delete, regex replace... and i really hate counting!!!!)
 Now i use VSCode that is perfect for all my needs : project managements, rust developing, integrated terminal, docker and k8s integration.
 The only problem is that it becomes a ram eating machine and since i am non confident with websites like &quot;downloadmoreram.com&quot;, i would like to switch to another editor.
 The lack of an integrated terminal will not be a problem but a tree on the side is fundamental.
 Did you suggest me to start from scratch with the emacs manual or a prebuilt env like doom?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve posted about the ekg notetaking app for emacs before. After a brief hiatus, I&#x27;m back working on it, and I&#x27;m pretty excited about the latest changes.
 A few weeks ago I also put out a new version of llm with a new module, llm-prompt, which allows templatized prompts that have easy and effective context filling, something that hasn&#x27;t existed yet in any emacs module, AFAIK. The new version of ekg uses this new feature.
 Previously, the ekg-llm library would send the contents of the note, along with instructions to the LLM, which would then append to the note. Now, we also send the latest notes with the same tags, and similar notes, as part of the llm request context. This turns out to be a really important enhancement to the quality of the llm responses, and now using ekg is, IMHO, the best way to interact with LLMs. You can also edit the responses before you save them into a note (or just not save them at all). This is something else that can help improve the response quality. At times, the responses I&#x27;m getting are really magical - it really is what many people call a &quot;second brain&quot;, but for real. I find myself using it constantly as a default way to interact with LLMs.
 I give an intro to ekg and talk about using it as a &quot;second brain&quot; in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;HC_h3syRKro
 The other improvements to this version of ekg are primarily Markdown improvements (using markdown instead of org-mode is kind of necessary if you are using it to talk to llms), fixing issues and getting inline links to work.

 Have you experimented with it? If so, what are your thoughts about it? In which things do you think Lean4 can not overpass Haskell?

                              <span>I&#x27;m at a bit of a loss here as I have been trying to find a way to create context entries for custom servant combinators inside other combinators (I do authentication, then various authorisations, for example).
 There are various ways to frame this problem:
  
finding a way to &quot;compose&quot; serveWithContext
 passing data from one combinator to another
 and probably others
  
Does anyone know if it is actually possible as I&#x27;ve run into a bit of a wall.

 What do folks here consider the better way to manage packages?
 Here&#x27;s my package-related init mess accumulated over a decade or so:

                              <span>I recently installed emacs 29.1 on my Windows machine from this repo:
 https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/windows/emacs-29/
 I started configuring it and the first thing I did is install evil-mode, so I can have nice Vim keybindings.
 I installed it with ELPA, and the installation seemed to work without any issues. The error shows up when I try to use the evil-mode package, with:
 M-x evil-mode
 , or with:
 (require &#x27;evil) (evil-mode 1) 
 directly in my config file.
 This is the error Emacs prompts me:
 Warning (comp): evil-vars.el:561:25: Warning: the function &#x60;evil-delete-backward-word&#x27; is not known to be defined. 
 This seems to be an error from the evil package source code, as it is referring to the file evil-vars.el which can be found in the following directory:
 ~/.emacs.d/elpa/evil-20240…</span>

                              <span>I have no idea how difficult something like that would be to implement, and I am already more than grateful to the people that develop Emacs.
 Some fonts have alternative characters behind character variants (cv), stylistic sets (ss), or other (onum, zero), and it would be very nice not to have to use an external tool to modify the fonts by hand to use them.
 It is almost a requirement to use certain fonts: their g and r are just weird, but FiraCode with the default @ and &amp; is unusable :P
 It is supported in LaTeX (maybe only LuaLaTeX&#x27;s fontspec?), and by the enemy...

                              <span>Hello guys! I&#x27;m new to Emacs, came from VSCode + Vim.
 I&#x27;m working with C#, TypeScript (nodejs, react, etc), Python.
 It seems that TypeScript support is enabled gracefully with js and lsp module in init.el
 But C#... I can&#x27;t understand. Anyone been able to enable it?
 EDIT: for people coming here in the future: (csharp +lsp) in init.el will enable lsp auto start in csharp files. BUT you need a language server. First time opening .cs file do M-x lsp, it will suggest you to install language server. Roslyn (csharp-roslyn) did NOT work for me, so I installed omnisharp. It worked :D

                              <span>Hi all. I’m just starting with Typelevel stack and I also have only a little bit of experience with JVM ecosystem. Is there any consensus in community how to tackle problem of auth? I found some abandoned JWT libs, and the ones that are maintained are fairly unpopular. I guess this is the problem when you want to use well known and battle tested solution so using some Java libs seems like a no brainer. On the other hand using Java libs sacrifices a little bit of pure FP approach. What are you using on production with Typelevel stack to implement auth these days?

                              <span>Hello,
 I wish to sort directories before files, within the Completions buffer. This buffer is shown when executing C-x C-f TAB TAB, and should be done within a directory that contains directories and folders.
 The ls command has the option --group-directories-first, which is the behaviour I would like to achieve within the Completions buffer.
 Any insight is appreciated.

                              <span>I&#x27;m encountering a peculiar issue with cursor behavior in Emacs, and I&#x27;m hoping someone can help me resolve it:
  
When the cursor is on Hebrew text, it becomes completely invisible.
 This only occurs with the cursor type set to &#x27;bar&#x27;.
 The &#x27;box&#x27; cursor type works without issues.
 There&#x27;s a similar, but slightly different issue with Arabic text.
  
I use Emacs 29.3 for Mac. Changing font and bidi settings haven&#x27;t solved the issue. Now I have no clue where to look for solution 
 Here is a short video to illustrate the problem.

                              <span>So i asked chatGPT
 &quot;doom eamcs recent files when i change dir of my file i want recent file to remove the old location entry&quot;
 chatGPT gave me the code
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 ;; Function to remove old file path from recentf list (defun remove-recentf-entry-if-moved (oldpath newpath) &quot;Remove OLD-PATH from recentf-list if file is moved to NEWPATH.&quot; (recentf-edit-list) (setq recentf-list (cl-delete-if (lambda (path) (string-equal path oldpath)) recentf-list)) (recentf-save-list))
 ;; Hook the function to after-save-hook to update recentf list after saving a file (add-hook &#x27;after-save-hook (lambda () (let ((buffer-file-name (buffer-file-name))) (when buffer-file-name (remove-recentf-entry-if-moved buffer-file-name (file-truename buffer-file-name))))))
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 adding this code to me config file gave me the following unneeded behaviour
  
whenever i try to quit recentf-edit-list opens
 whenever i save a file the saved file is removed from recent file
  
I didn&#x27;t want that so i just removed the code ran doom/reload yet the issue remained. The config file is clearly devoid of the code provided to me by chatGPT .
 After that failed i ran doom sync and then doom/reload still no change.
 I thought f#ck it and just reverted back to my previous commit and the issue still remains.
 Now i dont know what to do anymore.
 Please help as i just started getting into emacs 3 days ago and not good enough yet to deal with this myself.
 This is the value of my after-save-hook
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 (diff-hl-update +emacs-lisp-non-package-mode flycheck-handle-save t ws-butler-after-save) Original value was nil Local in buffer config.el; global value is (doom-modeline-update-vcs doom-modeline-update-buffer-file-name #f(compiled-function () #) +evil-display-vimlike-save-message-h doom-auto-revert-buffers-h doom-guess-mode-h)
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 ANY HELP IS VERY MUCH APPRECIATED

                              <span>I am starting the handmade hero series and he is using Emacs. For the intro to C series I was using Visual Studio 19. But Emacs having that command line type aesthetic intrigued me and I thought I would try it. So in the handmade project, Casey says something to the tune of he has setup a .Emacs file in the misc folder in the main handmade directory.
 What I can&#x27;t wrap my head around is how is he accessing those custom settings he setup for Emacs from any directory? Also how does Emacs know to use those settings? Also how to do all this?
 I&#x27;m sorry if you can&#x27;t understand what I am asking because even I don&#x27;t understand what I am missing.

I mean, I have a ultra wide monitor and lots of blank space it would really make more sense to see files across width rather than height

                              <span>Is there a way to copy something to clipboard directly from an org file that has images so that it can be pasted in a browser ?
 Im using doom and it has +org/export-to-clipboard-as-rich-text almost does this but when pasting into a browser ( such as a jira comment and confluence) the image doesn&#x27;t get pasted.
 I&#x27;ve also tried ox-clip and the solution described here : https://speechcode.com/blog/org-to-clipboard
 I&#x27;m using doom emacs 29.4 on Mac if that is necessary info.

                              <span>I appreciate all the dev work that&#x27;s gone into making HLS possible. It&#x27;s capabilities are way beyond what I experienced back when I was last writing Haskell and has made it so much easier to quickly look up documentation and get autocomplete without having to scroll through hackage documentation for all of the functions and types that I forget.
 However, my experience using it with neovim has been less than stellar. I seem to have nothing but issues with it, and I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s a neovim problem or an HLS problem. I&#x27;m using the haskell-tools.nvim plugin with the standard nvim-cmp and lspconfig plugins. Most other language servers work reasonably well, but this one seems particularly finicky and I can&#x27;t figure out why.
 I&#x27;m currently having an issue where if I type anything for about 4-6 seconds after opening the first haskell file in the editor (while the language server is starting) it causes HLS to completely hang and become unresponsive. I&#x27;m also having issues with nvim-cmp screaming at me about misplaced dollar signs in snippets (I&#x27;m assuming because the haskell suggestions contain things like $ and $!).
 I decided to temporarily install vscode to see if that would do it. Everything worked completely flawlessly out of the box, absolutely no issues. The problem is, I would really rather not use vscode if I don&#x27;t absolutely have to.
 Has anyone been able to get a working config for haskell in neovim that plays nice? I&#x27;m thinking of maybe scrapping haskell-tools and configuring things directly to see if that helps, otherwise I&#x27;ve spent so much time fiddling with the editor that I may have to leave it and come back later when things improve.

A decade ago, I didn&#x27;t like the book too much because it seemed to be just another reading formula (similar to SQ3) that doesn&#x27;t get applied by the very people recommending them (e.g. my professors). This judgement still holds true to some extent. But perhaps, I am failing again a principle that I myself recommend adhering to, when you learn something: Shuhari
But there is a very specific obstacle in entering the Shu-stage that is encapsulated by this quote (rough translation):

  
This principled appreciation and the ideal of the educated person are precursors of ideological stubbornness and have failed in their claims: Intelligentsia has become a derogatory term because words t…</span>

With this forum substantial exchanges happen within comment threads, and I thought it would be nice to be able to follow them with a feed reader.

                              <span>Hello, I have recently started learning Haskell and I am finding it incredibly interesting. This coming year, I will have to complete a programming project as part of my qualification as a student. I have taken to the idea of using Haskell for this task, but I have gotten stuck on any ideas for the project. I&#x27;m aware of the nature of Haskell and how it&#x27;s used in production, but am still stuck for ideas. Could anyone give me any project ideas? What have you personally developed in Haskell? What other Haskell projects do you use/find interesting? What aspects of Haskell do you find interesting to work with yourself? What sort of projects should I avoid?
 I am sorry if you have seen these types of posts frequently, but I could not find anything that was particularly useful to me. 
 Thanks.

                              <span>So my understanding of how API calls work in Haskell is something like this — The API request data that comes over the network is just a string(correct me if I&#x27;m wrong) and it gets converted into haskell record types by Aeson, that we can use in our applications.
 Now, Aeson uses instance declarations like below to convert the data to the record types.
 instance FromJSON MyType where parseJSON &#x3D; ... 
 I can see from hoogle that the type of parseJSON is parseJSON :: Value -&gt; Parser a, so the string that came over the network seems to have already been converted into a Value type.
 My question is how does the string type gets converted into Value type and where? If I want to do some transformation or validation on this string value, how can I go about it?

                              <span>Hello! I’ve started work on a QML library for Haskell!
 I had this idea of a kind of MVVC interface for a UI library in Haskell. A very very terribly written alpha is now here:
 https://github.com/yobson/qml-hs
 Is definitely isn’t fully implemented, and probably has memory leaks
 But it would be great if I could get feedback on the interface. There are no docs, so you will find the interface in the example (test/Main.hs)

                              <span>What is effect? I asked ChatGPT and it gave me various answers:
  
Effect types are any types of kind Type -&gt; Type.
 Effect types are types of kind Type -&gt; Type that have an instance of Functor.
 Effect types are types of kind Type -&gt; Type that have an instance of Applicative.
  
Sometimes it insists that a computation f a (where f is a functor) does not have an effect, only a context. To have a computational effect, there must be function application involved, so it uses terms like functorial context, applicative effect and monadic effect. However, it confuses me because the functor (-&gt;) a represents function application, as with State s and Reader r.

                              <span>So, I&#x27;ve been playing a bit with the ideas from the trees that grow paper, and I&#x27;ve stumbled into something I don&#x27;t quite get.
 Consider the following silly existential:
 type family SomeX (tag :: Type ) (x :: Type) :: Type data Some tag x where Some :: SomeX tag x -&gt; x -&gt; Some tag () 
 If we let:
 -- Proof carries a prof for &#x60;psi a&#x60; data Proof (psi :: k -&gt; Constraint) (a :: k) where P :: psi a &#x3D;&gt; Proof psi a 
 Then we can &quot;inject&quot; constraints by:
 data Foo type instance SomeX Foo x &#x3D; (Proof Show x) 
 But, if I try to make a pattern, it throws a compilation error:
 -- Doesn&#x27;t work &#x27;x&#x27; does not unify with &#x27;x1&#x27; pattern SomeFoo :: (Show x) &#x3D;&gt; x -&gt; Some Foo () pattern SomeFoo x &#x3D; Some P x 
 I thought that this unidirectional pattern is supposed to work as an ordinary (possibly smart) constructor. If i &quot;downgrade&quot; it to an ordinary function, it compiles as expected:
 someFoo :: (Show x) &#x3D;&gt; x -&gt; Some Foo () someFoo x &#x3D; Some P x

                              <span>Hi everyone. I&#x27;ve generally been happy with treesitter&#x27;s cpp indentation, but there is a situation i run into often where I can&#x27;t get it to behave the way I want it to:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; FrontendServer::FrontendServer(int port, std::shared_ptr state_updater, bool replay_mode) : m_http_port(port), m_exit(false), m_thread(nullptr), m_state_updater(state_updater), m_replay_mode(replay_mode), m_jsonrpc_handler(state_updater) { // it wants to put things here }
 FrontendServer::FrontendServer(int port, std::shared_ptr state_updater, bool replay_mode) : m_http_port(port), m_exit(false), m_thread(nullptr), m_state_updater(state_updater), m_replay_mode(replay_mode), m_jsonrpc_handler(state_updater) { // but i want it to do this instead } &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 any thoughts on how to achieve this? my current indentation setup:

                              <span>If you&#x27;re interested in using Hugo for a static blog, and want to post from Org-mode I&#x27;ve just uploaded a blog post you&#x27;ll probably find useful.
 For folks who are already using ox-hugo, it includes code for creating two new org links so that you can insert ref and relref shortcode links using the standard C-c C-l and navigating to the file so that you don&#x27;t make typos.

                              <span>Hello I am trying to write my emacs config from scratch. It is going well so far i have been able to set the font and the sizes of org mode headers. But I feel like font size proportion to each other is not pleasing like default font size, the headers font size, the tabs titles and the status line. I want to know if you have a method or a plug-in to harmonize all proportions maybe even introduce a golden ratio to make everything pleasing to the eye. Thank you.

 Im using doom and it has +org/export-to-clipboard-as-rich-text almost does this but when pasting into a browser ( such as a jira comment and confluence) the image doesn&#x27;t get pasted.
 I&#x27;ve also tried ox-clip and the solution described here : https://speechcode.com/blog/org-to-clipboard 
 I&#x27;m using doom emacs 29.4 on Mac if that is necessary info.

                              <span>I am using doom-shades-of-purple theme, which visually indicates source blocks in org-mode with a left bracket on the left side.
 render src-block
 However, when I switch to fullscreen mode, the left bracket moves along with the stretched window edge, losing its visual representation of the block.
 left bracket stretched
 How can I prevent the bracket from stretching along with the window edges, leave it to original place when maximize the window?

                              <span>I am trying to use completing-read inside a function, but it gives errors. I have the following code that works fine.
 (setq first-alist &#x27;((one . two) (three . four) (five . six))) (completing-read &quot;Prompt: &quot; (lambda (input predicate action) (if (eq action &#x27;metadata) &#x60;(metadata (annotation-function . (lambda (str) (concat &quot; : &quot; (cdr (assoc str first-alist)))))) (complete-with-action action (mapcar &#x27;car first-alist) input predicate)))) 
 If I put that completing-read function in another function to which I pass an alist, it gives an error which says (void-variable some-alist). Is completing-read not supposed to be used in functions? If it is, then what changes can I make to use it correctly. Thanks.
 (setq second-alist &#x27;((a . b) (c . d) (e . f))) (defun blahblah (some-alist) (completing-read &quot;Prompt: &quot; (lambda (input predicate action) (if (eq action &#x27;metadata) &#x60;(metadata (annotation-function . (lambda (str) (concat &quot; : &quot; (cdr (assoc str some-alist)))))) (complete-with-action action (mapcar &#x27;car some-alist) input predicate))))) (blahblah second-alist)

                              <span>In the trend of recent posts on this sub I want to where the myth about setting the value of gc-cons-threshold high to improve performance came from. (I feel fairly confident in calling the idea that this improves performance a myth given that Emacs maintainers have frowned upon this practice on this sub)
 Also, are there any other common emacs myths that still go around that should be debunked? I think the idea that using tool-bar-mode or menu-bar-mode hampers your learning of the keyboard shortcuts is unfair and fewer &quot;Intro to Emacs&quot; guides should ask newcomers to turn them off.

 I&#x27;m happy to announce the new cognitive-complexity package, it is basically a port of codemetrics (based on tree-sitter) to the built-in treesit in Emacs 29+.
 https://github.com/abougouffa/cognitive-complexity
 The package implements the Cognitive Complexity metric for code, allowing it to calculate a score that describes the understandability of a piece of code.
 It is basically an implementation of Cognitive Complexity - A new way of measuring understandability.
 The original codemetrics package is based on the tree-sitter library, I forked it to port it to treesit so it can be used with Emacs 29+. I tried also to simplify the fork by removing some dependencies like dash and s.
 Looking forward for your feedback!

                              <span>Hi,
 I am trying to open erc with M-x &quot;erc&quot;. I give it the default options and get the following error: Wrong type argument: stringp, (&quot;name&quot;)
 The function definition of erc is: 
 (cl-defun erc (&amp;key (server (erc-compute-server)) (port (erc-compute-port)) (nick (erc-compute-nick)) (user (erc-compute-user)) password (full-name (erc-compute-full-name)) id) 
 erc-compute-user above has red underlining with the error message &quot;You should depend on (emacs &quot;29.1&quot;) if you need &#x60;erc-compute-user&#x27;. I am using Doom Emacs with emacs version 29.3. Do I need to downgrade to get erc working, or is there some other solution? I haven&#x27;t found anyone else with this issue.

                              <span>I have this weird, mildly annoying problem. 
 Whenever I star Emacs and open any org-file with #+startup: overview for the first time, I can&#x27;t expand any headings. And I can&#x27;t figure out why. Executing normal-mode or org-mode with the same buffer has no effect. I have to close it and re-open it again. 
 I&#x27;m using Doom, but I rolled my own module, I&#x27;m not using the &quot;official&quot; Org module. Maybe this is an issue with straight.el? I don&#x27;t know, I&#x27;m trying to manually call the commands - org-fold-reveal, org-cycle, and even org-reload (that reloads all of org.el Lisp files) etc. Nothing&#x27;s working.
 Does anyone else have the same problem? Can anyone give any suggestions how to troubleshoot this?

 I would like to run a function that goes through the whole file and creates a new table with:
  
A column of Table Names
 A column of the net difference of highest number and lowest number
  
How would I approach this?

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to figure out how to start Emacs with a default window layout that sticks, and I got lost in the weeds of trying different packages recommended by several articles:
 https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/demystifying-emacs-window-manager
 https://karthinks.com/software/emacs-window-management-almanac/
 I&#x27;d like the layout to look something like this: https://imgur.com/a/5NS7Es4
 But I&#x27;m completely lost.
 I understand that I need to set dedicated windows, but I am unable to figure out how Treemacs fits into that.
 If someone could help with the basic layout, I can probably figure out the dedicated buffers/windows configuration. Please help!
 Edited to add: After reading Micky Peterson&#x27;s guide &quot;Demystifying Emacs&#x27; Window Manager&quot; I think I understand the display-buffer-alist better now. I also tried saving a layout to .emacs.desktop and I&#x27;m reading through that, too. I think what is causing issues for me is the Treemacs sidebar window is special and doesn&#x27;t use a window. This is definitely a big ol&#x27; can of worms!

                              <span>Hi, my emacs hangs a lot more often for a few days. I do not exclude an error from my part (config). Is there a kind of logger to monitor everything I do with emacs and what emacs does so that I can see what it was doing or trying to do as it hung? I know the debug-on-error function, but here, nothing comes out .. it hangs but does not report any error.
 Sometimes it hangs when creating a new roam note (org-roam-node-find) or when I try to insert an org-roam link ...
 Any tip is welcome, thanks

I didn&#x27;t know with which tool I had installed specific parts of the Haskell tool chain (Haskell-plattform, Chocolatte, ghcup, ... etc)
  
So how it went:
  
uninstallation of stack went smooth
 uninstallation of ghcup went smooth
 uninstallation of chocolatte went smooth
  
remark: I allso purged the env-variables of stack/ghcup/chocolatte
  
I&#x27;m not sure how I get rid of cabal/ghc(i) whenn using cabal --version in terminal the output is:cabal --versioncabal-install version 3.4.0.0 compiled using version 3.4.0.0 of the Cabal library
  
when using ghc --version in terminal the output is:
 ghc --version //ghci --version has the same output The Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compilation System, version 8.10.7 
 using where.exe in power shell yields:
 where.exe ghci C:\tools\ghc-8.10.7\bin\ghci.exe C:\ProgramData\chocolatey\bin\ghci.exe C:\tools\ghc-9.2.1\bin\ghci.exe where.exe ghc C:\tools\ghc-8.10.7\bin\ghc.exe C:\ProgramData\chocolatey\bin\ghc.exe C:\tools\ghc-9.2.1\bin\ghc.exe where.exe cabal C:\Users\ -censored- \AppData\Roaming\cabal\bin\cabal.exe 
 So:
 would it be sufficient to just simply purge those folders?

 Was it removed altogether ? Or is it available somewhere on the website and I am unable to see it.

                              <span>Hey guys, I&#x27;ve been a pure Scala engineer for around 6 years now. The stack I&#x27;ve been working with was the typelevel with tagless final so 90% of our code was in the functional style. I got an offer from one of my previous employers for a Senior Java role and as usual they are using the Java Spring enterprise stack. 
 I&#x27;m considering the switch because of the better work-life balance, increased pay and more remote friendly. But what&#x27;s making me doubt is Java. I haven&#x27;t used Java (or any OOP language) in an production setting before and mainly throughout my career only used functional languages. Has anyone done a similar shift? Like moving from purely functional scala to Java EE style? And if so how was the adjustment? 
 I did a quick read through some Spring code bases and it just seems like most of the work is just using the spring annotations correctly, which I don&#x27;t really like since it&#x27;s seems like doing &quot;config&quot; instead of actual coding.
 So anyone with any experience on making a similar switch and how that went?

Competitive Programming in Haskell: tree path decomposition, part I by Brent Yorgey
In a previous post I challenged you to solve Factor-Full Tree. In this problem, we are given an unlabelled rooted tree, and asked to create a divisor labelling. That is, we must label the vertices with positive integers in such a way that v is an ancestor of u if and only if v’s label evenly divides u’s label.

                              <span>Greetings, I&#x27;m working on my computer science master&#x27;s thesis and I&#x27;m having trouble finding open-source standalone tools or Intellij/VS code plugins that would provide me with code quality metrics through static analysis on package, class, and/or method levels. Most of what I&#x27;ve found were refactoring or lining tools, and a few paid tools/services that would give me somewhat useful metrics. 
 I reckon I could cobble something together that I could use but it would be a significant time investment. So, I figured I could ask the Scala community for recommendations before I start doing it myself. Any suggestions?
 P.S. The list of metrics that I&#x27;m interested in isn&#x27;t that strict, but generally, it should be at least one of these metric sets: Maintainability Index, Halstead metrics, QMOOD metrics, MOOD metrics, and a few others.
 P.P.S. &quot;MetricsTree&quot; would be an ideal tool if it weren&#x27;t capable of handling only Java source code. I thought about compiling scala code and then decompiling class files into Java source code but that can skew the metrics too much.

                              <span>The other day, while still struggling to learn how mu4e works, I have noticed execute-extended-command suggest a faster way to get a command: for mu4e-update-index it suggested using mu-u-i.
 As I&#x27;m using Ivy, I thought, and somehow expected, to be able to achieve the same result. So I tried mu u i. Ivy suggested many mu4e commands, but mu4e-update-index was not near the top.
 As I&#x27;ve learned since, completion-styles, set to (basic partial-completion emacs22), explains how mu-u-i matches.
 Ivy uses its own &quot;completion styles&quot; that are different from the default ones. The default is ivy--regex-plus.
 Now, it&#x27;s not like Ivy is not matching the command, but it&#x27;s definitely not in the top results. Thus, using it requires more keys.
 Question: Is it possible to make Ivy matcher work closer to partial-completion or initials completion styles?

                              <span>In the thread &quot;Emacs too slow&quot;, there are lots of people saying that Emacs is always slow on MS Windows. There are some people saying that Emacs is always slow in general regardless of the OS.
 Now, Emacs is never going to be as fast as simpler editors. However, most of the time you shouldn&#x27;t be able to notice any slowness. All this suggests to me that lots of people are doing things sub-optimally. I have used Emacs for more a very long time. Here I&#x27;ll give some advice on speed. I haven&#x27;t deliberately optimized my Emacs setup for speed, but I have avoided things that make it slow.
 Firstly, there are some things that you can&#x27;t really change....
  
The speed of external programs like Git.
  
People often say that Git related packages are slow on Windows. This is true because Git is slow on …</span>

The program that causing all this is emacs-wayland on my wayland session and emacs-gtk on my x11 session. Here is what I am getting when I run ps aux: /usr/bin/emacs -no-comp-spawn -Q --batch --eval (setq w32-disable-abort-dialog t) -1 /tmp/emacs-async-comp-org.el. Kindly help me solve this problem.

                              <span>Hej fellows,
 I work as a sysadmin and it is a common occurrence that I have to execute a command on a number of hosts (or a number of files) simultanously. What I currently do is have several buffers open at once and then switch to each buffer, make my change, go to the next buffer -- which, you can guess, is very tedious.
 After searching for a bit, I found the wonderful BROADCAST-MODE which allows you to do this for visible buffers. And indeed, it works just fine for regular text buffers. However, I was saddened to find out it doesn&#x27;t seem to work with VTERM, my terminal emulator of choice within emacs.
 Is there another mode I have failed to find? Is there a configuration settings I forgot to tweak? I&#x27;d love to hear your suggestions.
 Have a good day, fellows :)

                              <span>I am making this post for anyone else who might get stuck and need some help.
 I cloned the Emacs and Tree-sitter repos and decided to build the latest version of each on Fedora 37. While attempting to compile Emacs, I ran into several very frustrating build issues.
 My first issue was that while running ./configure --with-tree-sitter --with-native-compilation I kept getting an error saying that tree-sitter could not be found. The version that was available from dnf was too old, so I decided to clone the tree-sitter repo and compile it myself. In spite of tree-sitter building without issue, it was still failing to register with the Emacs configure script.
 The solution ended up being to first runldconfig after tree-sitter is done compiling:
 sudo ldconfig /usr/local/lib
 Then, to ensure that the emacs configure script finds it, export the path:
 export PKG_CONFIG_PATH&#x3D;/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig
 Then you can runmake &amp;&amp; sudo make installand everything should work.

                              <span>Working with my Zettelkasten constantly evolves, as my needs change over time. It seems to be an endless journey to improve my personal knowledge management system. By chance, I discovered &quot;Wardley Mapping&quot; by Simon Wardley [1]. It&#x27;s a method for understanding how to develop your strategies. My first idea to learn more about this visual tool was to apply it to my Zettelkasten strategy.
Let&#x27;s take a closer look. A Wardley map allows us to visualize the **Evolution **of business components over time. It starts from the unstable beginnings to more stable, standardized components. These components fall into four stages: genesis, custom, product, and commodity.
First: Genesis components are novel and new. Second: Custom components exist for a specific use case with some proof of value. Third: P…</span>

                              <span>Developing a Wardley Map for using a Zettelkasten in my personal knowledge management involves outlining several components to understand and strategize my approach effectively:
Purpose: Efficiently manage and leverage personal knowledge for continuous learning and productivity.
Scope: Digital note-taking, linking ideas, research support, excluding team collaboration.
User: Primarily self.
User Needs: Quick note capture, efficient organization with tagging and linking, easy retrieval.
Value Chain: From user to Zettelkasten.
Wardley Map: Helps to visualize the different components and their current state in the evolution, guiding where to focus efforts to improve my personal knowledge management system.
And here is my story: I started my changes to improve my personal knowledge management system by moving from OneNote to Obsidian two years ago (1). The major change was my first contact with the Zettelkasten framework (2). It was hard for me to change my personal organization from thinking in &quot;folders&quot; to &quot;tagging&quot; (3). My current challenge is to use analytical reading to improve my notes (4).
What will the next steps be? What are your recommendations?

                              <span>Hi everyone! Struggled as to what category to put this under - I guess it pertains to workflow, writing and the zettelkasten method more broadly...
I&#x27;m a PhD candidate and (inconsistently) use techniques shared here to organise my notes and ideas. It&#x27;s been a slow burn for me, but more and more I&#x27;m seeing the potential benefits of the zettelkasten approach. But I had a question about dealing with the messiness of writing over the long term alongside note-taking in the zettelkasten.
I&#x27;ll try and give a specific example. I&#x27;m currently working on one chapter of my thesis. I&#x27;m going through a literature note for something that I read for this chapter, and I&#x27;m seeing ideas that could be worthy to turn into their own seperate notes/zettels, and I could see potential use for them in a specific ch…</span>

This is yet another opportunity to share with your friends what you are working on. Add to this discussion by telling us about your zettelkasten journey. Share with us what you&#x27;re learning. Sharing helps me and, hopefully, you, too. It helps us clarify our goals and visualize our thinking. And sometimes, a conversation sparks a magical moment where we can dive into an idea worth exploring. I&#x27;d love to hear more from you.   🫵🏼

Lately, I&#x27;ve been making notes on thinking skills, reading for knowledge, and organic idea development. Some of my notes have more developed ideas than others—the value of a note is directly related to the time and attention I give it. When I refactored my note on Samu Practic…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to figure out a nice way to express arrays of composite values, like (a, b, c). For a variety of reasons I want to represent this with a composite of simple arrays, so for example an array of (a, b, c) would actually be structured as (array a, array b, array c). This is nice because zip- and unzip- like operations essentially become free. As I understand it, Data.Vector.Unboxed does something like this, although I don&#x27;t get quite how it works. For this particular application Data.Vector.Unboxed is not suitable however as I&#x27;m making this array library specifically for an FFI which requires pinned memory.
 What I want to do is define composite types in a simliar way to how a value level list might be,
 comp &#x3D; a:b:c:[] 
 so that it can be transformed by applying a type level function to each element
 map f (a:b:c:[]) &#x3D;&#x3D; f a:f b:f c:[] 
 My current thinking is that it might be possible to express this type of transform on the type level somehow, but It&#x27;s not clear to me how.
 The purpose of this would be to have a neat way to relate the element type to the array type, so I&#x27;d have something like
 CompArray (a  b  c  ()) ~ Array a  Array b  Array c  () 
 Any ideas on how to express this, or is it not possible to do this kind of type level programming in Haskell?

                              <span>So my employer is forcing us to not use Intellij, we HAVE to use VS Code now. They will even scan our computers to make sure we don&#x27;t have intellij installed... yeah. 
 So thing is that we are on sbt 13.18. We got a lot going on right now and upgrading sbt is not something we want to do in the next month (we have 2 months to transition to VS Code). 
 From what I understand, to get any kind of useful IDE features in VS Code, you need to use Scala Metals, but Scala metals only works with sbt 1.0+? 
 I tried running some basic metals commands and they don&#x27;t seem to exist for my version of sbt. Is there any sub 1.0+ version that supports metals? What is my best option here? 
 Or am I just making stuff up and I have no idea what I&#x27;m talking about?

                              <span>Recently I switched from vim to emacs, and I&#x27;m building my configuration as I go. I configured most of the editor as I needed it. but there are some custom actions that I don&#x27;t know how to achieve in emacs. 
 Basically I had custom functions for fuzzy finder (in my case it was fzf) to call an external program for list of data (i.e. the stdout lines) and select the line using the fuzzy finder then pass it to another external program which returned the path of the file and then I could use edit command to open that file in a new buffer.
 I want to do the same thing in emacs mini-buffer but I don&#x27;t know where to start. I&#x27;ve read the chapter about completion in the emacs manual but could not understand anything...
 It worth mentioning that I use vertico, marginalia and ordderless packages and It would be nice to use the marginalia to show more information about the items / files.

 Any ideas on how to resolve? Google/ChatGPT came up short.

                              <span>Hi all,
 Started getting into emacs, and trying to get mu4e to work nicely with my university email, which unfortunately is provided by google. So far I&#x27;ve managed to get the receiving part working by invoking oama, but I can&#x27;t get the smtp part working. Using this configuration:
  (make-mu4e-context :name &quot;EMTA&quot; :match-func (lambda (msg) (when msg (string-prefix-p &quot;/emta&quot;(mu4e-message-field msg :maildir)))) :vars &#x27;((user-mail-address . &quot;myemail@uni.ee&quot;) (user-full-name . &quot;Kenneth Flak&quot;) (smtpmail-smtp-server . &quot;smtp.gmail.com&quot;) (smtpmail-auth-credentials . (secrets-get-secret &quot;Default keyring&quot; &quot;oama - myemail@gmail.com&quot;)) (smtpmail-stream-type . ssl) (smtpmail-smtp-service . 465) ... etc...  I am pretty sure the culprit is the smtpmail-auth-credentials part, but I don&#x27;t know enough elisp yet to debug.
 Any help much appreciated!

                              <span>Hello, I have been learning Emacs for a couple months now, and I am getting used to the Emacs shortcuts (or mayhaps more specifically the readline shortcuts). 
 If you found a way to modify the shortcuts on applications (maybe through the OS itself), I&#x27;d love to hear about it!
 I am using KDE6 and Tumbleweed as my Distro!

                              <span>I have built emacs from git before. I want to build it from master with the same options I used last time. The variable system-configuration-options has the value &quot;--with-json --with-xwidgets --with-tree-sitter&quot;. So I pulled from the repo, and checked out master (I checked this had worked and the last commit in my local repo is from three hours ago). I ran make clean to clean the repo, then ./autogen.sh, and then ./configure --with-json --with-xwidgets --with-tree-sitter, literally just copying in the flags that my current emacs tells me I used to configure the build last time. ./configure runs, but the first and lines of the output say configure: WARNING: unrecognized options: --with-json.
 I&#x27;m not sure what to do about this. I want to build with proper json support like I currently have. I can&#x27;t find anything in NEWS or the changelogs about this build option being deprecated, and searching the devel list archives doesn&#x27;t bring up anything.
 Questions: - why is this option not recogized? - how should I configure my build to get proper json support?
 TIA!

                              <span>Discovering the (org--insert-structure-template-unique-keys KEYS) function leads me to believe that 2 key is the maximum.
 Can&#x27;t the code be adapted to support more keys? 3 would be nice.
 Make a list of unique, two characters long elements from KEYS. Elements of length one have a tab appended. Elements of length two are kept as is. Longer elements are truncated to length two. If an element cannot be made unique, an error is raised.

                              <span>I often work with a remote emacs over X11 and ssh, and for the most part the lag is tolerable. Apart from took tips. When I click a mouse on the frame, or switch frames, the tooltip either pops up, or displays in the echo area. And stays there far longer than the tooltip-hide-delay (set to one second,). Emacs accepts no inputs for as long as ten seconds unless I aggressively pound Ctrl-g. At this point I am almost at the point of patching tooltips out on the source. 
 Help?
 I am running emacs from git, if that makes a difference.

I&#x27;ve been using Emacs and web-mode since 2020, and have never experienced any issues; however just recently I found that whenever I open a PHP file, web-mode will highlight the syntax of whatever HTML is in the file, but completely ignore PHP code.

                              <span>Hey everyone, a few weeks ago I already posted about a new Haskell Meetup in the SF Bay area. We have the location and speakers finally figured out, so I thought I&#x27;ll post again with all the new details.
 We&#x27;re hosted at Groq in Mountain View. Groq is making the LPU AI Inference Engine and they&#x27;re using Haskell for their Compiler. We will have Tim Sears, VP Systems &amp; Application Engineering at Groq tell us about Groq and how they use Haskell.
 After that we will have Avi Press, Founder of Scarf and Boardmember of the Haskell Foundation share his experience of using Haskell at a Startup.
 Location: Groq HQ, 301 Castro St., Suite 200. Mountain View, CA 94041
 Date &amp; Time: July 19, 2024 (this friday), 6pm PT
 Signup Link: https://partiful.com/e/McHtTURDtf4kLfIVhnif 
 Website: https://www.sv-haskellers.com/
 See you Friday!

                              <span>This weekend I built a tool for rendering go game diagrams using Diagrams.
 The Diagrams library has the most elegant API I&#x27;ve ever worked with. A bunch of years ago I went to a Haskell hackathon, and Brent Yorgey very patiently helped me make a PR for a simple feature, explained to me about affine transformations, partial vs total functions and the like. It left a lasting impression, really made me want to do more FP. Thanks Brent, whereever you are!

 I don&#x27;t have the time or the skill to build this myself, but if someone starts up on it, I will test and submit bug reports/PRs where possible. I would love the ability to pop open a collab session with anyone regardless of what IDE they use. Feels like LSP for collab.

                              <span>I&#x27;m using flatpak emacs and every time I drag and drop a file it causes a new window to spawn.
 How can I fix this?
 Here is a gif of new window being opened.

 Too many actions just hang the ui. I am on windows. Are people just used to it?

                              <span>So I&#x27;m trying to build a major mode, the functionality is not really that important for the question, but for the curious it is something akin to org-roam.
 I&#x27;m not new to programming, or even lisp, but new to emacs lisp.
 I&#x27;m not sure how to approach a first working prototype, as the resources I found seem to focus only on syntax highlighting and indentation, but I would like to prototype something like when I open a file of this new major mode, that two windows open side by side, one with the source file and another one with a graphical representation based on the contents of the file.
 If anyone can point me in the right direction I would greatly appreciate it. Thanks!
 PD: To anyone who might say it might be silly to start on this if I&#x27;m new to elisp, it&#x27;s the way I like to learn, doing and improving as I go, most often times it works pretty well, but in this case I&#x27;m lost as to where to start.
 Edit: I&#x27;m looking for resources, other than the Elisp manual, which is the only thing I&#x27;m currently reading but I don&#x27;t know if reading the manual top to bottom will point me in the right direction, thanks!

                              <span>Hi,
 I have been trying, and so far not completely succeeding, in setting up mu4e to access Outlook365 email. This setup involves:
  
davmail
 mbsync
 mu/mu4e
  
As I don&#x27;t want to litter the initial message with a ton of configuration, which I can provide later when needed, I will jump to questions.
 Reading the mu4e manual I have learned about the 2 operations: move and refile.
  
Is it correct to think of Refile as what is currently found in email services like Gmail or Outlook365 under the name Archive?
 
what configuration is needed or what actions do I need to apply for email to be actually moved to the target mailbox when using move or refile?
 
 With my current setup, I have noticed the emails being copied (or duplicated) to the target directory while they continue to appear in the Inbox when using the Outlook app. On mu4e, the initial emails are not available anymore (as I was thinking that maybe I could delete them).
 This behavior is surprising to me and I&#x27;m thinking that 1) either it is a misconfiguration; or 2) it involves a different set of actions to lead to the result I intend.
 thank you for helping a mu4e newbie

                              <span>This question can be worded a lot better but I&#x27;m honestly drawing a blank. The premise is this, I&#x27;m thinking of building an upgraded GUI for Emacs (for no reason other than fun). I have two options: 1. building the GUI from scratch and bridging to the Emacs functionality then have the custom GUI render all the events from Emacs OR 2. maybe I can just edit the already existing source code for the GUI and add features or change it entirely. I just want to know what files to start digging. I could be going about this all wrong entirely, but that&#x27;s my plan so far. I know frame.c and window.c manages outputs and stuff I&#x27;m just trying to be thorough and see if there is maybe something else I can look at in the source code.

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to build emacs 29 from source and no matter how I configure, it won&#x27;t build with svg support.
 here are steps I did to build emacs maybe there is something wrong with them:
  
clone emacs from github 
 
take a snapshot of emacs 29 using: archive origin/emacs-29 | tar -x -C ../emacs-29
 
go to emacs-29 dir and run autogen[.]sh 
 
run ./configure --with-gif --with-gnutls&#x3D;ifavailable --with-json --with-modules --with-xwidgets --with-rsvg it only complains about mail being unecrypted no warning or anything about svg.
 
make &amp;&amp; sudo make install
 
run emacs 
 
 when finished I run (image-type-available-p &#x27;svg) it returns nil (also tested with emacs -Q ).
 I tried this multiple times no matter how I did it, it won&#x27;t build with svg.
 I also tried to build with native compilation but gcc failed to compile the test ( when I tested the test file it resulted in an error with segmentation fault )
 my system:
 os: ubuntu-18.04( I know it is old but I have a gpu problem that prevent any recent version to run properly)
 gcc: gcc (Ubuntu 7.5.0-3ubuntu1~18.04) 7.5.0

                              <span>Despite my best efforts, I haven&#x27;t been able to get my normal emacs configuration to render the left and right quotes (u+201C and u+201d: &quot;“”&quot;). Instead, I just the get the ASCII quote symbols highlighted in blue to indicate that they&#x27;re actually not the ASCII quote character. The same applies to left and right single quotes.
 As implied by my post title, this problem only applies when running emacs in daemon mode. if instead of launching emacsclient I run /usr/bin/emacs from a graphical environment, I get a frame where the quote characters work fine. I&#x27;m inferring that there&#x27;s some variable somewhere that determines whether or not quote characters should be substituted, and it&#x27;s being set to false when emacs runs daemonized because there&#x27;s no graphical environment, but I&#x27;m unsure what variable that would be and where it would be set.
 I am using emacs 29.4 with pgtk enabled, on Arch Linux. My WM is Sway, which means I am running under wayland. The font I am using is Terminus 16.

 I have an org file that tangle to a Bash shell script. In the resulting tangled file, I was to add comment lines at the top. Inserted of just including these comment lines in the org file source blocks, I want to write the comments in a text file and include the file so that when the org file is tangled, the comment file is pretended to the tangled file.
 I tried to use the following:
 #+INCLUDE: &quot;~/comments&quot;
 #+BEGIN_SRC sh
 #!/usr/bin/env bash
 ...do something
 #+END_SRC
 But, the contents of the comments file is not showing up in the tangled file. 
 Any ideas are welcome.

                              <span>Hi,
New member here, hello :-)
I&#x27;ve been reading a lot about Zettelkasten lately and I would like to try it out.
The site https://zettelkasten.de/ has been a great place to start. I still have a couple of questions, but most of them will become clear while I&#x27;m using ZK I guess.
Still 1 thing is not very clear to me. I know a note initially starts as a concept, but I&#x27;m wondering when you add more context to your existing note, what do you do with the original text, do you keep it or rewrite the whole note into something new?
Sorry if my question is not clear.
Thank you</span>

How do I change the theme? Settings sets the default theme for light and dark but I don&#x27;t see any setting to choose or change the theme.</span>

Semantic chunking
 Hybrid search
 Optional reranker
 Implement collections
 Web search
 Search in local files
 Fix async manuals parsing
  
If you want to chat with your own local knowledge base you can try elisa. By default all works locally, except web search.
 If you have already installed elisa you need to check install instructions and reparse info manuals because of internal changes.

                              <span>Emacs fellows, I just created a tool to wrap command lines into Emacs commands so that I can use M-x to call them without leaving Emacs. I did this because I&#x27;m tired of repeatedly typing those start/stop/build commands.
 Hope you guys find it useful.

                              <span>I have created an Emacs package gemini-code-completion to get assisted code with Google Gemini !
 https://github.com/shishimaru/gemini-code-completion.el
 On Google Colabo, Gemini suggests code and the experience was awesome because my development got more efficient and faster, and I could sometimes learn new things with the suggested code.
 I have sent PR to Melpa and hope it will be approved soon so that other Emacsen can easily try this package and make their life a better place.

                              <span>Hey there, I know that when using LSPs there are ways to get documentation to show up when you get a suggested autocomplete, or if you hover your cursor over a symbol. Is there anything like that that works with Sly / Common Lisp?
 I&#x27;m thinking of some kind of popup like you&#x27;d see in another IDE. In Emacs I think it would be a child-frame?

                              <span>This is a deploy service, so its 95% side effects. I&#x27;m going through this code, that has grown over the last 7 years to a consistently working tool, via CI and humans. 
 There are a handful of &#x60;main&#x60; programs, so am working thought converting them to be wrapped in IO. and called within each main. Its a fail fast program, but feel the control given with IO, may make it better. 
 I know that is fairly vague. It was written for Ammonite, and have moved it all to Mill and pure scala. The concept of if its worth it, keeps crossing my mind.

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to figure out the recommend workflow for writing a standalone haskell program. Say I want to write a single program in a file &#x27;test.hs&#x27; that depends on modules not in the prelude. And I want to compile this into an executable. So I cannot simply complie this with &#x60;ghc test.hs&#x60;, since I will get the complaint that ghc cannot find the module I need.
 So what is the recommended work around? I know you can use cabal or stack to build a project and the specify dependencies in the .cabal file. But this seems heavy duty for a single haskell file. Specifically, using &#x60;cabal init&#x60; will create a directory &#x60;app&#x60;, the file &#x60;CHANGELOG.md&#x60;, and the .cabal file, just for this single haskell file. Further &#x60;cabal init&#x60; asks quite a lot, including asking about which license to use, leading me to believe &#x60;cabal init&#x60; is meant for much more heavy duty projects.
 Using stack has a similar amount of, if not more, overhead.
 tldr; Is using &#x60;cabal init&#x60; or &#x60;stack new&#x60; the best way to create a stand alone &#x60;.hs&#x60; file depend on hidden packages? What is the recommended way?

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to find some YT videos I&#x27;ve seen before, on writing technical docs using org-mode. I already have some System Crafters ones, and also those from spudlyo but while useful, they&#x27;re not the specific one(s) I&#x27;m thinking of. I think the presenter had either an Australian (or maybe Kiwi/Tassie) or South African accent.
 Any suggestions?
 Incidentally, I did ask ChatGPT for its input. And while I have to acknowledge that accent is not a perfect predictor of nationality, I reckon it&#x27;s still often a good one. And so I have my doubts over ChatGPT&#x27;s three suggestions. The first was David Wilson, who doesn&#x27;t sound very Australian. The second was System Crafters, but that Just Is David Wilson. The third reply was the charm though, and makes me think ChatGPT must be having a particularly bad day, hallucinations-wise, because it said:
  
...another prominent Australian YouTuber who focuses on Emacs and Org mode is &#x27;Protesilaos Stavrou&#x27;
  
Again, I know accent doesn&#x27;t map perfectly to nationality, but clearly Prot doesn&#x27;t sound remotely Australian. Thing is, ChatGPT actually seemed to be &quot;aware&quot; of the issue, because it went on to say:
  
While not exclusively Australian, his content is highly relevant and valuable for Emacs and Org mode users.
  
So there you go, Prot. If you&#x27;re reading this you&#x27;ll be glad to know that ChatGPT acknowledges that you are not &quot;exclusively&quot; Australian. Fair dinkum.

                              <span>I need to change the color of the modified lines in my git-gutter. I found this code online and I put it in my config.el
  (custom-set-faces &#x60;(git-gutter-fr:added ((t (:foreground &quot;#00ff00&quot;)))) ;; green &#x60;(git-gutter-fr:modified ((t (:foreground &quot;#ffff00&quot;)))) ;; yellow &#x60;(git-gutter-fr:deleted ((t (:foreground &quot;#ff0000&quot;)))) ;; red ) ) 
 But it doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything and there are no errors.
 I need to change the color of git blame line (from why-this package). The README file says I need to add:
 (set-face-background &#x27;why-this-annotate-heat-map-cold &quot;#203448&quot;) (set-face-background &#x27;why-this-annotate-heat-map-warm &quot;#382f27&quot;) 
 I put this also in my config.el and this no effect at all either. I have already tried restarting Emacs and everything and none of my settings have any effect.
 Is it just me or did everyone else also start with so much of frustration when they got started with Emacs? I did not expect something like just changing a color to be so complicated.
 UPDATE:
 Fixed the first issue based on this thread: https://github.com/doomemacs/themes/issues/268
 (custom-set-faces
 &#x27;(diff-hl-insert ((t (:foreground &quot;#00ff00&quot;))))
 &#x27;(diff-hl-change ((t (:foreground &quot;#ffff00&quot;))))
 &#x27;(diff-hl-delete ((t (:foreground &quot;#ff0000&quot;))))
 )
 Still struggling with the why-this package.

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m trying to setup emacs for python. Here is my current configuration:
 (setq major-mode-remap-alist &#x27;((python-mode . python-ts-mode))) (use-package eglot :ensure t :hook (python-mode . eglot-ensure) :config (add-to-list &#x27;eglot-server-programs &#x27;(python-mode . (&quot;pyright-langserver&quot; &quot;--stdio&quot;)))) (use-package company :ensure t :init (global-company-mode)) :config (setq company-minimum-prefix-length 0) (setq company-idle-delay 0.0) (use-package cape :ensure t) 
 This has multiple problems. First, when writing import ... I don&#x27;t get completions. Second, if I have import numpy as np then later np. doesn&#x27;t get completed to anything correct. I&#x27;m not sure which package is in charged of this and would love help in this regard.

                              <span>I’m on a bit of an FFI discovery journey, trying to make some bindings to openCV (it’s mostly to get better at FFI writing, less for publishing)
 OpenCV is a really interesting library because it’s Mat data type handles memory really well.
 It reference counts the actual matrix data. You can have several openCV transformations that use several Mats, but open CV will maybe do everything in place.
 The question is, how best to do this in Haskell? It feels like a job for the ST monad?
 So my questions: Is there a way of using c++ class destructors in Haskell? Calling them when values go out of scope? I worry about this because using Cont would lead to space leaks with loops(?)
 Even though I have storable instances, I seem to only be able to work with pointers to Mats, not the types themselves
 Can I use the ST monad? Is there any reason I shouldn’t?

                              <span>Last 3 releases of jsoniter-scala were focused on improving performance in Scala.js:
 https://github.com/plokhotnyuk/jsoniter-scala/compare/v2.30.3...v2.30.6
 The main operations that contributed on time/battery spends happened to be divisions of &#x60;Long&#x60; values on some constants during serialization of &#x60;BigDecimal&#x60;, &#x60;BigInt&#x60;, &#x60;Long&#x60;, &#x60;Float&#x60;, &#x60;Double&#x60;, &#x60;java.time.Duration&#x60; and &#x60;java.time.Instant&#x60; values.
 Here are final results measured on different browsers:

                              <span>I&#x27;m actively debugging a recurring crash (in garbage collection sweep) with Emacs 30.x. While I have a crashed Emacs locked up in gdb, what do y&#x27;all recommend for backup editor? 
  
Another Emacs server session with another name? (ex: --daemon&#x3D;) 
 
Zile? mg? Neither of those seem to share all of the common key bindings with actual Emacs nor do they seem to have readline on Debian 12.

                              <span>So I keep reading about how Emacs (Doom Emacs) has great support for LSPs, etc. I can see that pyright is running, but it keeps saying my imports could not be resolved and my code is full of warnings.
 I tried MyPy and it creates a .mypy directory all over the place so I deleted it.
 Is there a Python LSP that actually works with Emacs?

                              <span>Stumbled over interesting keyboard-macro-terminates-prematurely issue. I love keyboard macros, I love the odd puzzler, this one I’m at a loss, and maybe someone can send me off in an orthogonal direction that’ll get me using some new feature…
 I want to keyboard-macro search in dired buffer for a file name of the form ‘fuu[0-9]’. When playing macro, As long as there is a file name in the dired buffer of the form fuu[0-9]+, I’m good, keyboard macro continues playing after finding the file name. However, if dired buffer only contains file name ‘fuu’, macro terminates prematurely with failed regexp search when ‘]’ char is played, before ‘’ char is played. Any ideas?

                              <span>Few days ago I happened to stumble upon an interesting read and link on SX, about a calendar library in Common Lisp. I actually ordered a book to the local library (we can distance-borrow in Sweden), and I found an interesting statement in Preface:
 &quot;Our initial motivation was an effort by one of us (E.M.R.) to create Emacs-Lisp code that would provide calendar and diary features for GNU Emacs ( ... ) A deluge of inquiries from around the globe soon made it clear to us that there was keen interest in an explanation that would go beyond the code itself&quot;
 Ha! Looking at the calendar.el, indeed, the author is one of the authors of the book in question (Calendrical Calculations).
 Basically, what they say, Emacs and Emacs community inspired them to gather together information and write probably the most authoritative book on the subject yet. How cool is that!

 Is there a way to implement something like this? I want the keymap to be repeatable but I want a key to exit the keymap.
 I tried to use &quot;q&quot; #&#x27;ignore :repeat (:exit (&quot;ignore&quot;)), but that did not work.

                              <span>I have the following load/config of Flycheck in my init.el:
 (use-package flycheck ;; Flycheck base package :ensure t :commands global-flycheck-mode :config (setq flycheck-global-modes &#x27;(not org-mode)) :init (setq flycheck-emacs-lisp-load-path &#x27;inherit) (add-hook &#x27;after-init-hook #&#x27;global-flycheck-mode)) 
 Note the sixth line, it tells global-flycheck-mode not to apply in org.
 On my Linux machine, this works. On my MacOS MacBook, it doesn&#x27;t. Both machines use the same config files (managed in a GitHub repo), and both are running Emacs 29.4 (Linux is custom-built, Mac is a Homebrew cask).
 Yesterday (when I noticed this while doing some heavy editing of an org file on the Mac) I tried a number of different things to get FC to not be on for org, but every time I restarted Emacs the org buffers had FC enabled.
 Does this sound familiar to anyone here?

                              <span>Hi,
 I use the &quot;src&quot; block and it is very good but how I can use the tab to indent like a normal file or how I can format the code in the &quot;src&quot; block ?
 The  is binding to the org-cycle what is good but how I can bind it to the indentation ?
 thanks in advance!

                              <span>I am entering my senior year of my BSc. in Data Science (primarily use R and python). I first learned about Emacs my freshman year and was intrigued by the potential -- keyboard-focused, modularity, customization, etc. I started using and configuring vanilla Emacs as my &quot;daily driver&quot; about 18mo ago. Within the last 6mo I have used &#x60;org-agenda&#x60; to organize my schedule, Jupyter notebooks for class assignments, and record most* of my notes using &#x60;denote&#x60; (*need to spend some time configuring latex for math notes). 
 This summer, I completed a Data Science internship at a medium-ish sized tech company. Although most of my classwork is in Jupyter notebooks, the dev team discourages the use of notebooks. Experiments are mostly organized in python files but it does seem that others still use Jupyter notebooks to tinker with code snippets or intermediate plotting. All development is done remotely across a number of servers and docker containers.
 Needless to say, my &quot;little&quot; Emacs configuration was not up to the task. The jump from using Emacs for my homework assignments to fleshing out a reliable IDE that I can be used on the job is overwhelming. I struggle to envision how I would make that jump. I am aware of &#x60;tramp&#x60; and &#x60;lsp-bridge&#x60;, for example, but have read a lot of complaints about latency or &#x60;magit&#x60; being slow. Alternatively, one could install Emacs on given server ... but how common is it that companies allow you to do that? 
 For those that use Emacs professionally: How do you use Emacs at your company? Do you run Emacs locally but develop over tramp, what is that experience like? If not, does your company allow you to install Emacs on a server?

 I have all-the-icons installed, and ivy icons and so on, on my config file All-The-Icons under &quot;All The Icons&quot; title, and Ivy under &quot;Ivy&quot; title, but when icons must be shown, when trying to open a file for example or M x for a command, icons are not shown and I have no idea why.

I have re-implemented a part of expand-region for the new tree-sitter modes, using only a few lines of elisp and built-in packages. This is probably already in Mickey Peterson&#x27;s excellent combobulate package.
 To use it, open a treesitter enabled buffer (say with python-ts-mode) and then hit . Repeat invocations of  will expand the region, - will contract and C-g will reset and exit.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been having this issue for going on about a year. It&#x27;s pretty regular. Several times a week, when I unlock my screen (regolith3/X11/i3) Emacs will die immediately or as soon as it gets focus. It doesn&#x27;t seem to dump a core file anywhere obvious and even if it did I&#x27;d have to learn how to debug a core file for Emacs.
 Anybody have any advice on how to debug this?
  
EDIT1: This Emacs is 30.x from the Guix emacs-next pacakge. TIL that you can guix install emacs-next --with-debug-info&#x3D;emacs-next and Guix will recompile the package with debug symbols. Now how long is THAT going to take? ;)
  
EDIT2: So I was able to get a backtrace and it looks like I&#x27;ve got something odd going on during garbage collection. I had a backtrace but reddit&#x27;s editing environment chokes on it.

                              <span>I&#x27;m working my way through the excellent Crafting Interpreters book and decided to do the first part in Haskell instead of Java. Everything has been going swimmingly until we got to closures, which introduced a subtle problem involving variable shadowing. To fix this, the book introduces a semantic analysis pass where all the variables get resolved to their proper scope before any actual interpreting happens.
 This analysis pass uses a Map Expression Int, mapping from an expression to a location in the stack of scopes of the program where the variable can be found. In Java, because &#x60;Expression&#x60; is a separate object with its own object ID, this works out fine. In my Haskell version I have implemented Expression something like the following:
 data Expression &#x3D; Grouping Expression
 | Unary UnaryOperation Expression
 | Binary BinaryOperation Expression Expression
 | Literal LiteralContents
 | Variable String
 | Assignment String Expression
 -- etc
 deriving (Show,Eq,Ord)
 This has worked very well so far, however it does introduce a problem with regards to the Map Expression Int: Any Variable &quot;abc&quot; will be considered equal, even if they come from very different nodes in the AST. The derived functions for Eq will not do here.
 What is the recommended way to solve this? So far I&#x27;ve come up with:
  
Try and fake the Java way of object equality by using &#x60;StablePtr&#x60; and friends, though that may not work too well with the (hash)map.
 Add a unique integer to every node in the AST to disambiguate them.
 Add the original source location to every Expression, so that different references to the same variable would be disambiguated by their source location. This feels a bit dirty though, since it would bleed implementation details from the scanner/parser into the interpreter.

                              <span>Is there a neat way of handling configuration data in Haskell that doesn&#x27;t involve threading the configuration all the way through the compution?
 What I mean by &quot;constant&quot; configuration is stuff that will not change throughout the lifetime of the program, so you could embed it in code as a simple function, but where it would be generally good software engineering practice to keep it in an updatable file, rather than embdedding it in code.
 A few examples of what I mean:
  
A collection of units and their conversions, it would be useful to have a file of this data and have it read when the program starts, so that additional units can be added or values corrected without recompiling, plus some functions to get units by name, etc.
 Calendars giving things like the (notoriously difficult) dates of Easter
 Message files
 Locale information, such as Basque days of the week
  
The default, as far as I can see, is to embed the data directly into the program, possibly using template haskell or just as code. For example, I can see how Yesod handles messages and keeps type safety. But not being able to add a new language or reword things without recompilng is more than a bit meh to my eye.
 In my current application, I&#x27;m looking at calendar definitions. I&#x27;d like to be able to have a file saying &quot;Pentecost is the 50th day after Easter Sunday. Easter Sunday is supposed to have a definition but it got messed up and it&#x27;s now effectively an arbitary list of dates. Australia Day is on the 26th of January.&quot; etc. etc. and then, if I&#x27;m reading JSON and there is a named calendar, just get the calendar defintiion. Threading stuff through the compution looks both incredibly awkward and just a bit tacky.
 Does anyone have any pointers to a good technique?

                              <span>Consider the following:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; type role M nominal data M a -- .. a has a nominal role
 type role N representational data N a where N :: (Coercible b a) &#x3D;&gt; M b -&gt; N a &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Now if M is a functor, N is a functor, like so:
  instance Functor N where fmap f (N m) &#x3D; N (fmap (f . coerce) m) 
 But less say I have: 
  class MakeM a where makeM :: M a 
 Then I can&#x27;t say:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; class MakeM a where makeM :: M a
 newtype MyM a &#x3D; MyM a deriving newtype (MakeM) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Because a has a nominal role in M.
 But I can say: 
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; class MakeN a where makeN :: N a
 newtype MyN a &#x3D; MyN a deriving newtype (MakeN) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Because a has a representative role in N.
 But it&#x27;s my understanding that the Coercible dictionary is still included in the datatype as a field at runtime (see here and here): 
 Why?
 Is this just an optimisation GHC could make but it hasn&#x27;t got around to?
 It seems to me if that any calls to coerce are eliminated at runtime, you should be able to drop the pointer to the Coercible dictionary. You&#x27;re never going to use it anyway.
 Furthermore, in this particular case, I can&#x27;t see why we just make N a newtype of M:
  newtype N a where N :: (Coercible b a) &#x3D;&gt; M b -&gt; N a 
 As once we get rid of the dictionary we&#x27;ve just got an indirection, could we just get rid of it (I&#x27;m not as sure about this though).

Any advice on how I can best render it in org-mode syntax (it doesn&#x27;t have to be exact)? Because I&#x27;ve been scratching my head for a bit. Thanks!

                              <span>Choosing Haskell as the primary language for a startup product is not an easy decision, but there are those who do it anyway, like Avi from Scarf. If you haven&#x27;t read the blog post &quot;12 Reasons Why Haskell is a Terrible Choice for Startups (and why we picked it anyway),&quot; I encourage you to do so.

                              <span>I have installed Haskell on Ubuntu 22.04 via ghcup (curl command).
 Everything is installed and seems to work, at least as far as I tested. But in the ghcup tui all tools are marked with a grey check mark (with a little &quot;1&quot;), if I try to set a tool as default. I would expect two green check marks.
 On my Laptop everything works as expected. I don&#x27;t know why it in not working on my PC. Any idea?
 Edit: I completely removed .ghcup and .cabal folders from my home directory and installed everything from scratch. With the same result.
 I can install everything and get a green check mark, but if I try to set it with &quot;s&quot; I get the single grey check mark with a &quot;1&quot;
 I think I found the answer. The problem is the font I use in the terminal. The check marks change depending on the font I use. If I use DejaVu Sans Mono I see two green check marks. Some other fonts show two grey check marks. I assume that what I thought was a &quot;1&quot; is actually a cut-off second hook.

 This is from an advent of code problem (2020, day 1). The goal is to take a list of integers and find a pair that sums to 2020. If no such pair exists, return &#x27;Nothing&#x27;. If the pair is (x , y), return &#x60;Just (x , y)&#x60;. Here is the fuction I came up with:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 search_sum_to_2020 :: [Int] -&gt; Maybe (Int , Int)
 search_sum_to_2020 [] &#x3D; Nothing
 search_sum_to_2020 (x : []) &#x3D; Nothing
 search_sum_to_2020 (x : y : xs) &#x3D;

                              <span>So I was recently fiddling with programmed completion and want to document it for posterity. There&#x27;s no example snippet like this in the manual, and it&#x27;d have got me started much more easily.
 (defvar my-coll &#x27;(&quot;foo&quot; &quot;fnord&quot; &quot;baz&quot;)) (defun my-programmable-coll (str pred flag) (let ((coll my-coll)) (cond ((eq flag nil) (try-completion str coll pred)) ((eq flag t) (all-completions str coll pred)) ((eq flag &#x27;lambda) (test-completion str coll pred)) ((consp flag) (completion-boundaries str coll pred (cdr flag))) ((eq flag &#x27;metadata) (completion-metadata str coll pred))))) ;; These are equivalent! (completing-read &quot;Pick: &quot; my-coll) (completing-read &quot;Pick: &quot; #&#x27;my-programmable-coll) 
 My use-case: now I can hardcode an affixation-function in the metadata, so that I do not need to let-bind completion-extra-properties every time I write a call to completing-read.

                              <span>Hello. I recently got a new PC (ASUS NUC 14 box) and Ubuntu 24.04 LTS with Cinnamon interface was installed. Now, when I installed the default version of GNU emacs (v29.3) via sudo apt install emacs, I got a peculiar problem. When I run emacs as the end user, I got the following error shown in the minibuffer:
 Symbol’s function definition is void: eieio-defclass
 When I run it with -q option, it works, but clearly my ~/.emacs.d/init.el file is not loaded. So, when I run: emacs -q --load ~/.emacs.d/init.el it works as usual. So, what is wrong here? Does GNU emacs by default first load and check some files before loading my ~/.emacs.d/init.el file? Thanks a lot for your help!!

 I remember once coming across a short 3 panel comic where someone&#x27;s boss is marveling &quot;How are you so productive? It must be a gift, it must be a superpower&quot; and the person is saying &quot;It&#x27;s just emacs&quot; over and over.
 I need this jpeg and I know it&#x27;s out there somewhere but I can&#x27;t find it. Do you any of you freaks have this thing in your ~/Downloads? Pls resyndicate for me.
 TY!

                              <span>Recently I found out that Emacs can deal with so-called noncontiguous regions. I cannot find very much information about these on the internet, the Emacs manual or the Emacs help system. But I&#x27;m curious about these noncontiguous regions and want to see if I can use them for something. As an example, something I want to do is to narrow to a noncontiguous region. But to be clear, narrowing to a noncontiguous region is not the problem I want solved here. I just want to learn how to use noncontiguous regions. 
 I&#x27;ll try to define a clear question. If I want to create a noncontiguous region that contains the columns 4 to 7 on rows 1 and 2 then I can do this using a rectangular region(at least interactively, but I imagine I can recreate that in elisp too). But what if I want to create a noncontiguous region containing columns 4 to 7 on lines 1 and 3 but not line 2. Then I cannot use rectangular regions(as far as I know). Is there a way to do this? I&#x27;m not necessarily asking for an interactive way to do it. An elisp solution is fine and even prefered. 
 I&#x27;ve found the variable region-extract-function that perhaps could be useful, but I&#x27;m not sure how to use it. In particular, I don&#x27;t know when the function that this variable is bound to is called. 
 I also found the library zones.el. But from the documentation it seems like it doesn&#x27;t actually define noncontiguous regions, just something that looks and feels like noncontiguous regions. So this doesn&#x27;t really satisfy my curiosity. And I&#x27;m mainly interested in learning the builtin functionality, so a third party package like this isn&#x27;t really what I&#x27;m looking for.

                              <span>I understand the title may be vague or nonsensical. But I had to make one, and that was the best I could come up with. A longer version of my question follows.
 I am an amateur Emacsist. I&#x27;ve got a solid understanding of all things *nix, lisp, and configuring a text editor (from prior vim experience). I&#x27;ve been eagerly building up a very comfortable .emacs for the past few months, and have been loving the experience in general. However, there is one thing that bothers me which I don&#x27;t believe bothers others as much, if not at all: When I try to use some package that adds to or modifies the fundamental Emacs experience — something that modifies things like buffer management, text editing or whatnot — it often clashes with my own previous customizations or even default Emacs behavior. 
 For instance, If I were to use a modal editing package like Evil mode, I&#x27;d need to rebind keys to work correctly for every package I added. Think Magit for instance. Another time I faced a similar issue was when I tried popper.el. It&#x27;s a great package, but It&#x27;s job is to augment default buffer-handing behavior. I often ran into issues where a buffer created by a function from one package ended up in the wrong place due to popper. This is not a devastating problem as I could always just place the buffer where I want it manually, but that&#x27;s the point, sort of. 
 I have a very large config, and adding anything that changes the fundamental experience of Emacs becomes a software project of its own with the involvement of design, and large refactors and whatnot. I wonder if that&#x27;s the case with you guys.
 Does anyone else have the same experience? Is this something I just have to settle for and solve bottom-up by solving the problems as they arise? Am I holding it wrong? I&#x27;d love to know you guys&#x27; thoughts

 But there is no chat support so I started to write it. After some days of work, here is the result : https://github.com/chep/copilot-chat.el
 I need help to maintain and improve it. Feel free to submit issues and pull requests.

                              <span>Hey everyone,
 I spent about an hour trying a myriad of things to get this to work. It seems like it should be a fairly straightforward thing for Magit yet I couldn&#x27;t seem to get it to work. 
 I tried the -- flag on checkout and no matter what I tried, it would either only check a single file out or the entire branch. 
 Is it possibly a conflict with Evil, Vertico, etc? I&#x27;m grasping at straws here.

                              <span>This idea has been festering since February when @Andy brought up @Philaquino post1. It&#x27;s a prime example of refactoring a large collection of notes collected during my reading. 2
Let&#x27;s examine the format, process, or content of this note. How does it fit into the ZKM scheme? Is this approach even appropriate?
First, I owe some shout-outs.
@Andy — A big thank you for suggesting this book and hinting that IBIS has some use in research and note-taking. Your suggestion started me documenting questions each idea asks or solves.
@ZettelDistraction — Your thoughts on building the &quot;Zettel Critique GPT&quot; sparked some ideas. Specifically, the concept of a section called SEE ALSO and a footnote link in the body of the note keeps the flow of the text smooth without the distribution of interspersed wik…</span>

                              <span>The Archive has a couple of settings that you cannot change from the graphical user interface.
https://zettelkasten.de/the-archive/help/#hidden-preferences
If you want to create a simple settings dashboard, you can use the thearchive:// URL scheme in one of your notes inside of The Archive. There, you can click the links to change settings -- no terminal needed.
For example, try to paste these into a note:
Pasted image filename without spaces: thearchive://preference/pastedImageFilename/set/yyyyMMdd&#x27;_image&#x27;
Pasted image filename without date: thearchive://preference/pastedImageFilename/set/&#x27;pasted-image&#x27;
Pasted image filename reset: thearchive://preference/pastedImageFilename/delete

ID&#x27;s accurate to seconds: thearchive://preference/identifierDateFormat/set/yyyyMMddHHmmss
ID&#x27;s accurate to minutes: thearchive://preference/identifierDateFormat/set/yyyyMMddHHmm  (original)
ID&#x27;s accurate to days: thearchive://preference/identifierDateFormat/set/yyyyMMdd
ID reset: thearchive://preference/identifierDateFormat/delete


Then you can play around with different formats.
Note: Most of these settings don&#x27;t actually require a relaunch of the app, but if something doesn&#x27;t work, quit and open the app again if in doubt.</span>

                              <span>Not the type system extensions, not 3 new kinds of metaprogramming apis, not givens, but braceless syntax is the most noticeable thing in everyday codewriting and codereading. 
 It is with great pleasure to realise we won war against begin-end style boilerplate and &quot;you can&#x27;t use braceless with lambdas&quot; pointless prejudices and now most of }}}}}}} alike eyesores can be purged with single scalafmt setting. 
 I cannot understand why &quot;reviewing MR with braceless&quot; is &quot;harder&quot; i mean, most of diff visualisers were able to provide unreadable diffs that would make you open both versions and compare them by eye, but aren&#x27;t you review diff by imaging code which was there and how it changed? To add, diffs show spaces and, its like mostly obvious which indentation level it is. If it isn&#x27;t, you have indent rainbow, which trivializes tracking.
 Same story with merge conflicts - sometimes you would be able to get braces mismatch regardless, and its harder to fix than indentation mismatch. 
 Well, now we have (), that are the second source of unpronouceable clutter, and [] which are, as well, in some places, yet not as common. I hope someday these would be optional as well.

Haskell is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what’s going on in its community.

Announcing opt-env-conf by Tom Sydney Kerckhove
This post announces opt-env-conf, a new settings parsing library for Haskell. This library combines the best of optparse-applicative, envparse, and autodocodec, together with the colours from safe-coloured-text to provide all your apps’ runtime settings.
Building a data compression utility in Haskell using Huffman codes by Marcelo Lazaroni
In this post we will implement a data compression program in about 150 lines of Haskell. It will use Huffman coding and handle arbitrary binary files using constant memory for encoding and decoding.

                              <span>Is there additional configuration needed when setting up lsp-mode with respect to the tab key for indenting?
 I&#x27;ve noticed that my indentations are always inconsistent. For example, when editing a React typescript component, if i just hit , or create a new line, it indents 4 spaces from the last line. But if I highlight the region and hit  then it seems to indent based on LSP rules and indents it by 2.
 The same is true when I&#x27;m in C++ mode. While writing, and hitting tab when I&#x27;m on the line, I get the following header:
 #pragma once namespace some_name_space { class SomeClass { public: SomeClass() private: int someMember; } } 
 But if I highlight the buffer and hit , or call lsp-format-region, then I end up with:
 #pragma once namespace some_name_space { class SomeClass { public: SomeClass(); private: int someMember; } } // namespace some_name_space 
 Which i assume is different because when I do that, it&#x27;s calling clang-format (based on the fact that the endspace ending comment get added.)
 Is there a way to make it so that indentations will use lsp to formatting rules if lsp mode is enabled?

 But, in the help doc, those symbols seem to be hidden, and you can see highlights and blocks, but without special characters/lines.

 Is it possible to do that in my org docs, so it looks like in the help example?

 I have a hook for dired and I changed the auto-revert-interval to 1

 (setq-default auto-revert-interval 1) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Is there any advantage to setting global-auto-revert-non-file-buffers to t, when all I am interested in is keeping my dired buffers up to date? Also is there any significant performance penalty to keeping the auto-revert-internal lower than the default of 5?

 I am attempting to parse a NATS protocol message. I have two variants of the &quot;message&quot; one that indicates a reply subject and one that doesn&#x27;t.
 With reply:
 MSG target.subject 1 reply.subject 500\r\n
 Without reply:
 MSG target.subject 1 500\r\n
 And now here are my parser functions. The problem I&#x27;m having is that no matter what I do, I can _either_ get it to parse the first form or the second form, but I can&#x27;t get it to properly &quot;fall back&quot; to one or the other.
 pMsgMessage :: Parser ProtocolMessage pMsgMessage &#x3D; do msgMessageWithReply  msgMessageWithoutReply msgMessageWithReply :: Parser ProtocolMessage msgMessageWithReply &#x3D; do _  parseTest parseMessage &quot;MSG this.subject 1 120\r\n&quot; 2:1: | 2 |  | ^ unexpected end of input expecting numeric character or white space 
 I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ve just forgotten something dumb, but I can&#x27;t for the life of me get these alternatives working and I&#x27;ve re-read &quot;the&quot; megaparsec tutorial over and over until it hurt.

                              <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;m trying to learn &#x60;haxl&#x60; library with servant. I&#x27;m having a custom reader monad stack which contains &#x60;Env&#x60;. Right now, I am using &#x60;runHaxl&#x60; function in the handler function to fetch the data. Something like this:
  
fetchUsersH :: (MonadIO m) &#x3D;&gt; AppT m [Int] [User]
 fetchUsersH &#x3D; do
 (env0 :: Env () [Int])  String -&gt; ID -&gt; GenHaxl u w ID
 addTimeline name aid &#x3D;
 unCacheArticle aid $ unCacheCount (&quot;timeline:&quot; ++ name) $ RawAPI.addTimeline name aid
  
And it was getting converted into IO like this:
  
scottyOptsT opts (runIO u state) $ application [logStdout]
 where runIO :: (HasPSQL u, HasOtherEnv C.Cache u) &#x3D;&gt; u -&gt; StateStore -&gt; GenHaxl u w b -&gt; IO b
 runIO env s m &#x3D; do
 env0 &lt;- initEnv s env
 runHaxl env0 m
  
I want to do similar thing with servant, but I didn&#x27;t find any example.
 Also, I want to know what would be the best practice for handling haxl
 data fetching? getting the env from the reader and calling runHaxl within
 the handler function or runHaxl should be called at the &#x60;hoistServer&#x60; level?

 I was in search for a light weight system for contact management and customer relation management. The main purpose for me is to have all address/telephone numbers/emails available at hand and easy to search. Another aspect is, that I would like to use this in conjunction with org-mode of Emacs, where I do all my business administration things.
