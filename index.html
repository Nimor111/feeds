                              <span>For anyone that does PHP development in emacs: what are you using? php-mode, phps-mode, web-mode? Are you using an LSP of sorts, or ctags or nothing at all? And do you mostly edit templates/wordpress sites or are you working with more software engineering oriented frameworks like Symfony or Laravel?
 Is there anything you wish to see improved when using emacs for development of PHP applications? A feature you&#x27;re missing?

                              <span>After I invoke org capture to create a journal entry, the cursor is position at the start of the entry, prior to the timestamp, instead of after it. In other words, as soon as the capture is done, I cannot start writing the entry, but have to move the cursor to the end of the line before I can start typing. Why does it happen?
 The following is what I have in my configuration for org-capture-templates.
  (&quot;j&quot; &quot;Journal entry&quot; plain (function org-journal-find-location) &quot;** %(format-time-string org-journal-time-format)\n%?&quot; :empty-lines 2 :jump-to-captured t :immediate-finish t) 
 where org-journal-find-location is defined as follows.
  (defun org-journal-find-location () ;; Open today&#x27;s journal, but specify a non-nil prefix argument in order to ;; inhibit inserting the heading; org-capture will insert the heading. (org-journal-new-entry t) (unless (eq org-journal-file-type &#x27;daily) (org-narrow-to-subtree)) (goto-char (point-max))) 
 These are based on the example snippets from org-journal repository.
 I thought the use of &quot;%?&quot; following the newline should force the cursor to be placed after the headline (containing the timestamp), but it does not. What am I overlooking?

                              <span>So there&#x27;s like 3-4 emacs based LLMs modes that are pretty good.
 But recently zed and cursor have gotten upgrades to their LLM integration.
 I don&#x27;t think LLMs will replace software engineers anytime sooner than like 30 years out.
 but they are clearly useful for
  
mocking out boilerplates for simple stuff
 
learning new areas / tools that previously you&#x27;d have to ask a frontend/UI or an infra specialist to really make a reasonable MVP, but now you can chain a few artifacts in claude and then pass it off to a specialist for them to productionize.
 
 Basically it makes easy stuff trivial, and medium stuff easy.
 But hard stuff is still hard.
 I think something like https://github.com/yetone/avante.nvim
 shows how LLMs have evolved since liek a year ago when they seemed novel and cool but …</span>

 Is it possible to rename a file in the buffer menu only?
 So instead of having default.rb and default.rb it would be like default.rb default.rb

 My eshell completion does not work when ivy-mode is enabled. It finds the good completion but removes prefixes like / or ~/
 Does something know why ?
 Here is how I configure ivy :
 (use-package ivy
  :straight t :init (ivy-mode t) :bind (&quot;C-x b&quot; . ivy-switch-buffer) (:map ivy-minibuffer-map (&quot;C-J&quot; . ivy-done) (&quot;RET&quot; . ivy-alt-done)) ;config (setq ivy-re-builders-alist &#x27;((t . ivy--regex-ignore-order)))) 
 Thanks.
 Here is demo without ivy-mode and then with ivy-mode enabled :

                              <span>I&#x27;ve now been trying for quite some time to make emacs work for me and use packages and the fact i can program it to my personal taste to it&#x27;s full extend. But, again and again, i feel like my Emacs configuration reaches a point where it starts to feel &quot;fragile&quot;. I&#x27;ve been working on mine on and off for some time now and, in general, i really like where i&#x27;m at.
 But the i try adding in Treemacs and it&#x27;s a hassle to make that change. Just adding it in with use-package results in &quot;treemacs loaded before elpaca&quot;. So, &#x60;:ensure (:wait t)&#x60; seems to solve that. Now treemacs works. As soon as i add a &#x60;:bind&#x60; to the setup, the treemacs buffer opens empty and i get &#x60;Error in post-command-hook (treemacs--post-command): (wrong-type-argument markerp nil)&#x60;. Without keybind it&#x27;s fine. This is just one example.
 I look around and see really elaborate configurations with major customizations that seem to work flawlessly for those people. But for me, it quickly reaches a point where things start behaving differently from what i would expect.
 I&#x27;m close to starting over (again) as i feel that i&#x27;ve lost control over that configuration. And i don&#x27;t even know why.

 I have global-auto-revert-mode enabled in &#x60;init.el&#x60;, evaluating M-: confirms that.
 When I M-: evaluating auto-revert-mode it is &#x27;nil&#x27;
 When I change outside of Emacs a file which is visted by an Emacs buffer, the file is not auto-reverted. When I try to edit that buffer, Emacs warns that the file has been changed outside of Emacs, so I don&#x27;t lose content. However the buffer is not visually updated.
 How can I check if reverting should actually work? Or do I missunderstand auto-reverting of buffers in Emacs?

                              <span>I have a program that monitors our CI/CD machines and will start and stop depending on activity, they are the bulkiest machines we have. I have a Cats IOApp that monitors this. With a run method very similar to below.
 It does need to evaluate each time, but this may be a very naieve way of approaching it. I&#x27;ve been learning a lot of this alone, so looking for opinions.
 Thanks

                              <span>As part of a project I am revisiting some old code. I intend to bring it up to current standards (ie Scala 3) and a small part of this project, geometry and geography related, may be useful to other people so I am thinking of publishing in GitHub.
 Would this be the right place to get feedback on the style of the code? I am kind of shy about showing my code to the world without feedback.

                              <span>In the following code, I get a &quot;deferred inline method zipTagged in trait ZipTag cannot be invoked&quot; error on the last line:
 case class Tagged[Tag, Value](value: Value) type ZipTagged[Tags  EmptyTuple case (tagType *: tagTailType, valueType *: valueTailType) &#x3D;&gt; Tagged[tagType, valueType] *: ZipTagged[tagTailType, valueTailType] trait ZipTag[Tags  Tagged[Tag, Value](value) *: zipTag.zipTagged(valueTail) def test &#x3D; summon[ZipTag[(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;), (Int, Boolean)]].zipTagged((1, true)) 
 If I don&#x27;t mark the methods in ZipTag inline, it works, but then I suppose the tuple is traversed at runtime. Is this a fundamental limitation, or can it be worked around? It seems like it should be possible in theory, since all the information is available compile-time.

                              <span>So, I&#x27;m trying to build a chess engine with Haskell as a capstone project for my undergrad degree. Is it feasible to learn how to build a chess engine that can at least be 2200 Elo and learn Haskell at the same time in 4 months?. Can i get some guidance on where to start?

                              <span>Dear all,
 I&#x27;m really excited to announce the release of Dunai 0.13.1 and Bearriver 0.14.10!
 Dunai is a reactive programming library structured around a notion of Monadic Stream Functions. Dunai can be used to implement other reactive and FRP frameworks on top, including Classic FRP and Arrowized FRP variants.
 Dunai comes with:
  
bearriver: API-compatible implementation of Yampa. (The Bear River is a tributary to the Yampa river.)
 
dunai-test: QuickCheck-based temporal testing library that can be connected with the testing system haskell-titan.
 
 See https://github.com/ivanperez-keera/dunai#features for details on Dunai&#x27;s features.
 This release fixes an issue with the dependency on the list-transformer library as an alternative to transformers. Thanks to @ tomsmeding for the contribu…</span>

                              <span>One core value of Tweag is its dedication to the open-source community. Although
our interests and expertise have become significantly broader over the years, our love
for immutable, composable and typed architecture have made functional
programming and programming languages in general an important part of our DNA.
This long-standing activity was formalized last year as the Programming
Languages &amp; Compilers Group. The PL&amp;C group has been busy in the
second quarter of 2024, and this post is a summary of what we’ve been doing.
Our involvement varies depending on the availability of each team member and
client engagements; if some projects might seem idle, this is usually just
temporary. All projects appearing below are actively developed.

 This is a freshly compiled Emacs, ran with -Q and rust-mode + eglot, nothing more. You can see on the screenshot that the minibuffer shows only the first line of eldoc (C-h .) - it cuts the rest off even though max-mini-window-height isn&#x27;t the problem. I want it to also include the second line with the type information (I want it because I hate inlay-hints and I turn them off). I spent some time doing research and I found this package https://github.com/emacsmirror/eglot-signature-eldoc-talkative that seems to be related but it didn&#x27;t do what I wanted. Based on it I tried to do some things but honestly I&#x27;m a pretty bad Emacs user and I have no idea what I&#x27;m doing.

                              <span>Hi,
 Is there a way to highlight the active window by coloring the border like in many tilling window managers (here i3 from a random video on yt)
 All the solutions I found are about changing the color of the background / modeline. I don&#x27;t want to change the background (auto-dim-other-buffers.el do the job) and I already have a dynamic modeline color but it&#x27;s not enough for me to quickly see where i am.
 (I use Doom emacs with default doom-theme if it can help)

                              <span>I used chatgpt to try to get me started with auctex and LMTX ConTeXT support and this is what it suggested that seemed to work
 1. Install Emacs and AUCTeX
  
Emacs: Download and install Emacs from [GNU Emacs]() or use your package manager if you&#x27;re on Linux.
 AUCTeX: Install AUCTeX through Emacs&#x27; package manager: 
 Open Emacs and type M-x package-refresh-contents RET.
 Then, install AUCTeX with M-x package-install RET auctex RET.
 
  
2. Install ConTeXt LMTX
  
Download ConTeXt LMTX from the [Pragma ADE website]().
 Extract the archive and place the folder in a location of your choice.
  
This is what I did and it seems that AUCTex is installed.
 however, I dont know where to go from here, do i need anything else? is there a way to get started with making ConTeXt work on emacs? I have the context-win64 folder in C:\ConTeXt\context-win64 as I was instructed in the directions to make a folder for win64

                              <span>First of all comint infrastructure is a thing that powers M-x shell and M-x run-python and probably other things that im not aware of.
 Its a nice thing because you can use it as a framework to make your shell or repl or interpreter more interactive in very standard emacsy way, by communicating with external processes.
 It gives you code completion (using *Completions* buffer), syntax highlighting (according to the article below), and it can pass those code completion candidates to normal emacs buffer.
 Run M-x run-python, create a new buffer with python-mode, AND you will have context aware code completion in your buffer (try it)
 BUT it does NOT give you code navigation, cause it doesn&#x27;t integrate with xref, and it&#x27;s not a full terminal emulator.
 I read the source code of comint.el, python.el, shell.el and found this brilliant article: https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/comint-writing-command-interpreter
 Main problem (besides xref), that i have with comint is that it is dumb terminal (as opposed to xterm-256color terminal), meaning it isn&#x27;t a full terminal emulator.
 It doesn&#x27;t interpret ANSI escape sequences, essentially only supporting raw input and output.
 So my question is: Why is that? And how do i fix that?
 To be clear emacs does have full terminal emulators like vterm or ansi-term.
 But i think it would be awesome to have those advantages that comint already has and also have a perfect development environment for creating tui programs.
 I hope this post doesn&#x27;t feel like a rant or is unclear. I&#x27;m interested in emacs architecture design, and want to learn from it.

                              <span>Edit: as u/mickeyp pointed out, inhibiting annotations for remote files is the solution. Luckily, this is the default in marginalia, so no manual advices are needed if I use that :)
 Sorry for bad formatting, I&#x27;m blaming the android app.
 I&#x27;ve recently had the pain of working with tramp over a slow connection and noticed that minibuffer completion during find-file on a remote path was painfully slow, constanly freezing, and sometimes triggered forbidden reentrant calls.
 I put my poor emacs debugging skills to the task and noticed a large number of test -e ... commands going through tramp, coming from a large number of calls to file-exists-p on remote paths triggered by the completion (was using fido at the time). This seems to hurt other completion packages that are based around completing-read from what I could tell (tested a bit with vertico).
 I tried ido instead and it was blazingly fast in comparison. I couldn&#x27;t find anything about this through basic googling so thought I&#x27;d ask here: I see vertico and friends being recommended here a lot, and while I generally prefer these alternatives over ido, not playing nice with tramp is a pretty big pain point. Anyone has any workaround or config tips to tackle this that don&#x27;t involve applying super deep advices?

                              <span>My understanding of lock files is that they are useful only when two Emacs processes try to modify the same file, and since I always run a single Emacs process, I can disable them without risks. Is that correct? Thanks.
 EDIT: I have asked because I thought that lock files were a legacy feature from a time when more than one user ran Emacs on a shared server, but according to an answer, that&#x27;s not the case.

                              <span>Hello! I&#x27;ve been recently trying to get more intentional about treating Emacs Lisp like &#x27;any other programming language&#x27; and so I have a question about package development.
 Let&#x27;s say that you are developing two packages that depend on different versions of the same package. You are using Eask/Cask/Eldev/Keg/etc and so you have two projects: foo and bar that both depend on some third package baz, but one of them is &#x27;stuck&#x27; at an earlier version. The packages are otherwise unrelated. For the argument&#x27;s sake, you cannot upgrade. How do you get completion, documentation, jump to definition etc pointing at the correct version of baz? Do you clear up your load path every time you switch between the projects?
 Or to put question differently, when you develop foo.el, how do you get elisp completion and documentation relevant only to what foo.el should be able to access and not to anything defined in your configuration? Right now if I open any .el file elisp-completion-at-point will happily suggest any function or variable that I ever defined in init.el. I can of course start a new session and load only foo.el . But then I lose all my customization to get accurate completions.
 This is a pretty common scenario within the larger programming ecosystem and most languages/tools handle it without the developer ever thinking about it, but I have not seen anything on the topic in Emacs Lisp specifically. Any pointers would be appreciated.
 Edit: Some clunky wording in 3rd paragraph.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been on a journey to improve my reading and note-taking process, and I wanted to share my experience and get your thoughts.
 As a long-time note-taking enthusiast and writer, I found myself drowning in a sea of information. My Emacs was filled with org files containing highlights, bookmarks, and copied passages, yet I often struggled to recall or effectively use this information when I needed it. I realized I wasn&#x27;t truly engaging with what I read.
 I stumbled upon Niklas Luhmann&#x27;s Zettelkasten method and was intrigued. The idea of summarizing in my own words and connecting ideas across different sources resonated with me. I started experimenting with this method manually and found that I was remembering more and understanding deeper.
 My Solution
 Being an Emacs user, I thought, &quot;Why not create a tool to streamline this process?&quot; That&#x27;s how I started working on org-zettel-ref-mode.
 Here&#x27;s what it does:
  
Automatically extracts comments and summaries from the text you&#x27;re reading.
 Creates an overview window for quick reference.
 Saves literature notes to custom folders.
 Enables quick commenting with a simple command.
 Allows easy navigation between notes and source material.
  
Here&#x27;s what it looks like:

 I&#x27;m curious:
  
Have you ever created tools to enhance your learning process? How did it go?
 How do you manage the balance between efficient reading and deep understanding?
 Do you think automating parts of the note-taking process could be counterproductive to learning?
  
I&#x27;d love to hear your thoughts, experiences, or critiques.

                              <span>It was research for a business-related blog that led me to recently discovering the ZK method, and I am very excited to watch this web grow.
But this journey also became one of very personal development as I continue to find additional productivity techniques, psychological insights, etc. that are helping me be a better me. And the ZK method seems well suited for also keeping track of those things.
Is there some wisdom in keeping the things separate? Or do you just let it all live together?
What about journaling? I ask that because my &quot;personal development&quot; stuff can veer closer to &quot;journaling&quot; than &quot;business research,&quot; but journaling (and dream journaling) feels like it shouldn&#x27;t be anywhere near my ZK.</span>

Share with us what you&#x27;re learning. Sharing helps us clarify our goals and visualize our thinking. And sometimes, a conversation sparks a magical moment where we can dive into an idea worth exploring. I&#x27;d love to hear more from you.   🫵🏼
Here is my report on why I&#x27;m here and my current ZK work themes and ideas:
Exploring feminism as a man.
Working on the concept of creating thinking canvases.
I&#x27;m thinking a lot about automation.
I&#x27;m back in university for the semester and taking a journalism writing class with a bunch of young people.
Thinking about the &quot;Theory of Maximum Taste&quot; and how to apply it to note-taking.
My reading is very much related to reading and writing.

                              <span>Graphs
In abstract graphs, you can remove edges connecting notes via contraction. Illustrated below you see that the highlighted edge $e$ is removed in such a way that the node $y$ is removed as well. To not destroy the path from $x$ via $y$ to $z$, the formerly indirect connection becomes a direct one:

Applied to Zettelkasten
Imagine each node in the graph is a note in your Zettelkasten.
Imagine each edge in the graph is a link from one note to another. (We actually would need arrows/directed connections)
Then the operation above could be applied to e.g. export a sub-network of your notes while skipping some notes in the process.
Say you want to share your Zettelkasten department on backyard gardening with your neighbor Phil, but you also have notes on Phil, ridiculing his short cucumber…</span>

 Currently I just do sbt run.

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to zip a tuple of type-level tags with a tuple of values into a tuple of tagged values, but this code doesn&#x27;t compile:
 import scala.compiletime.erasedValue case class Tagged[Tag, Value](value: Value) type ZipTagged[Tags  EmptyTuple case (tagType *: tagTailType, valueType *: valueTailType) &#x3D;&gt; Tagged[tagType, valueType] *: ZipTagged[tagTailType, valueTailType] inline def zipTagged[Tags  // Found: EmptyTuple.type, Required: ZipTagged[Tags, Values] EmptyTuple case (_: (tagType *: tagTailType), value *: valueTail: (valueType *: valueTailType)) &#x3D;&gt; // Found: Tagged[tagType, valueType] *: ZipTagged[tagTailType, valueTailType], Required: ZipTagged[Tags, Values] Tagged[tagType, valueType](value) *: zipTagged[tagTailType, valueTailType](valueTail) 
 There&#x27;s also a warning about &quot;type ascriptions after pattern&quot;, so I&#x27;m clearly doing something wrong, but at the same time it seems close to working. What am I missing?

 F restoreth my referential transparency: F leadeth me in the paths of multiple implementations for F’s name&#x27;s sake.
 Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of null, I will fear no throw: for Sync[F] art with me; thy delay and thy recover they comfort me.
 F preparest a table before me in the presence of mine complexities: F anointest my constructors with dependencies; my context parameters runneth over.
 Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of F[_] for ever.

                              <span>Hello everyone, I&#x27;d like to invite you all to next episode of Scala Space Podcast on Friday 23rd at 2PM CEST. My guest this time will be the creator of Scala himself - Martin Odersky. We will try to discuss and explain all the whats and whys of Lean Scala, of Scala features and how things could look like in the future. The podcast will be streamed live on YouTube and Twitch so you can join and comment or ask questions in the chat, as usual.

 P.S.: I&#x27;m trying to figure out RSS (this is a bit simpler) and Apple podcasts + Spotify podcasts by popular demand, it&#x27;s just painfully slow due to everything being very legalese.
 P.S.2: I got rid of the boom arm and my microphone will be positioned centrally so there should be no more issues with my audio being skewed towards the left channel (I do read YouTube comments!).
 P.S.3: you can also write your questions about Lean Scala down here in comments and I&#x27;ll try to discuss them with Martin on the podcast!

                              <span>Hi, I sometimes I want to add a year to dates in emacs. For instance:
 replace-regexp \([[:digit:]][[:digit:]]\) \1/2024
 Then, sometimes I want to make that into a custom function defined in a dotfile.
 (defun complete-dates ()
 (interactive)
 (replace-regexp &quot;\([[:digit:]][[:digit:]]\)&quot; &quot;\1/2024&quot;)
 (replace-regexp &quot;YEAR&quot; &quot;2024&quot;)
 ) 
 What that does is replace YEAR with 2024 but not seem to execute the first replacement, or the first replacement fails. 
 What do you think? Do I need more backslashes?

                              <span>Hey, i&#x27;m a very newbie guy on elisp and emacs, and i was mixing up into the xml-print function from the emacs sgml-mode. 
 (xml-print &#x27;((ul ((class . &quot;bg-red-400&quot;)) &quot;Hello&quot;)) ) ;; Writes on the cursor: ;; 
Hello
 
 The thing is, i don&#x27;t want to insert/write those values, i just want to print(return as string) them. I was looking at the xml.el from the emacs source, and that thing is huge, so even if a replace all the inserts to quotes that might break something. What i did was the following function:
  (defun xml-print-string () (interactive) (let ( (dummy (generate-new-buffer &quot;Dummy Buffer&quot;) ) (formated-xml-string &quot;&quot;) ) (switch-to-buffer dummy) (xml-print &#x27;((ul ((class . &quot;bg-red-400&quot;)) &quot;Hello&quot;)) ) (setq formated-xml-string (buffer-string)) (kill-buffer dummy) formated-xml-string )) (xml-print-string) 
 Using C-X and C-E it evaluates to:
 
Hello
 
 It works...But i don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the best way to handle this problem. Can this function escale if i use it a lot? (As it&#x27;s creating and deleting a buffer)

I have almost customized it to meet my basic needs, but one things i am unable to do as now if to set it up for web development. Some things like when i do div*3 it creates 3 divs in codium and when i do div#main it creates a div with id main plus may other things like emmets and code completion and linting in css and js. Any help is highly appreciable. Also if possible please share your setup if you code in C++/C/web development (PS I will learn vanilla emacs later after a month or so as i currently dont have the time to do so)

                              <span>I am trying to customize dired. I am using the breadcrumbs that are offered by dired+, so I really do not need the first line of the dired buffer, which shows the current folder path. Does anyone know if there is a way to hide that information or remove it from the dired buffer?
 Thanks in advance for all your help.

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I was playing around a bit with SVG in emacs, and changed the way posframes look like. I also have a semi-working version of the frames being animated (sliding from the side, popping from the middle, etc.) - not shown in the screen capture (wouldn&#x27;t look good in the gif).
 As you can see, I have it working with vertico (+ Marginilia, etc.), regular posframes (like the LLM summary examples), lsp-doc-ui (and eldoc-box), and for FZF.
 I am wondering if there is enough interest in packaging/cleaning up the code and releasing it as a package.
 Note: for some reason, the gif on reddit cuts off a little of the top of lsp-ui-doc, but in my emacs it works great. Had to degrade the size/quality a bit, it looks much better in real use

                              <span>Hello! I&#x27;d like to know if you use any package to show a directory tree listing on the left sidebar?
 I tried Treemacs but I see that it doesn&#x27;t work very well with project.el. Like when I start Treemacs for the first time I get a blank sidebar. Yes, I can add a project manually to it using C-c C-p a but it is rather inconvenient to do this for every project I work with. Ideally I&#x27;d like something that automatically uses the current Git project as the project tree automatically (like how project.el detects current project from .git folders).
 Is there any package that does something like this? If not, a plain tree-format directory tree browser would also be okay for me. Let me know if you have some recommendations.

                              <span>So I&#x27;ve been getting more use out of Org and Agenda now that I have some nice little capture templates setup and a file that it gets stuffed into. However I&#x27;ve now run across something kind of weird.
 I had two meetings yesterday that I had scheduled and they did show up in the Agenda day view, however now they&#x27;re showing up again today with the marker &quot;1x&quot;. However I did not mark them as repeating. 
 So for instance I have:
 * Appointments ** NAO Meeting at HQ Auditorium SCHEDULED: -- ** Appt w/ Optometrist SCHEDULED: -- ** 1-on-1 Meeting w/ Michael SCHEDULED:  
 Both the NAO and 1-on-1 meeting were yesterday. Today I&#x27;m seeing in agenda:
 Week-agenda (W34): Monday 19 August 2024 W34 notes: 8:30 ┄┄┄┄┄ Scheduled: NAO Meeting at HQ Auditorium notes: 8:30-13:00 NAO Meeting at HQ Auditorium notes: 14:00 ┄┄┄┄┄ Scheduled: 1-on-1 Meeting w/ Michael notes: 16:00 ┄┄┄┄┄ Scheduled: DONE Enroll in Benefits Tuesday 20 August 2024 notes: Sched. 1x: NAO Meeting at HQ Auditorium &lt;------ These two seem notes: Sched. 1x: 1-on-1 Meeting w/ Michael &lt;------ weird 
 Why is it showing up again? As far as I can tell from the Org docs and the Agenda docs, I created the timestamp correctly. In the first instance I put in a duration (it was a long block of time) and the second does repeat, but once a week. 
 If I start to accumulate a lot of old entries this is going to get really problematic after a week or two. Any ideas on what I did wrong?
 SOLVED: Took a bit to actually get the RIGHT search engine terms because most things were just pointing back to Org Agenda docs. However the FAQ at this location (https://orgmode.org/worg/org-faq.html#scheduled-vs-deadline-vs-timestamp) seems to have answered it. I just want a timestamp, not a scheduled for most things I think.

                              <span>I am trying to set up a system to get Emacs to profile the total time it takes to do a build. I have come up with the following:
 (global-set-key (kbd &quot;&quot;) (lambda () (interactive) (my/refresh-all-file-buffers) (let ((project-directory (locate-dominating-file default-directory my/buildfile))) (when project-directory (with-temp-buffer (cd project-directory) (let ((elapsed (benchmark-elapse (compile (concat &quot;python &quot; my/buildfile))))) (read-only-mode -1) (insert (format &quot;%.6f seconds&quot; elapsed)) (read-only-mode 1))))))) 
 However, the &quot;%.6f seconds&quot; text does not appear in the buffer. Instead, I get the following message:
 Compilation finished Refreshed open files. 
 I am not sure what the issue is or if the above approach is even correct. Any help in how to get that format text to appear at the end of the buffer?
 EDIT:
 Fixed thanks to /u/arthurno1. Following is the final code, for future reference. I had to save the start time in a variable because the compile function works asynchronously.
 (defvar *last-compile-start-time*) (global-set-key (kbd &quot;&quot;) (lambda () (interactive) (setq *last-compile-start-time* (float-time)) (my/refresh-all-file-buffers) (let ((project-directory (locate-dominating-file default-directory my/buildfile))) (when project-directory (with-temp-buffer (cd project-directory) (compile (concat &quot;python &quot; my/buildfile))))))) (defun my/compilation-finish-function (buffer desc) (with-current-buffer &quot;*compilation*&quot; (save-excursion (let ((inhibit-read-only t)) (goto-char (point-max)) (insert (format &quot;Compilation took %f seconds&quot; (- (float-time) *last-compile-start-time*))))))) (add-hook &#x27;compilation-finish-functions &#x27;my/compilation-finish-function)

 I&#x27;ve installed the language grammar for C++ with treesit-install-language-grammar and I can enable c++-ts-mode but syntax highlighting isn&#x27;t working, only #include gets highlighted rest is all plain.
 https://preview.redd.it/eoglirodjsjd1.jpg?width&#x3D;1153&amp;format&#x3D;pjpg&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;21c8be6b94e28f655e6f2f6faf08ad6be21acfc6
 I also installed treesit-auto just to be sure but it&#x27;s still the same. How can I get the proper syntax highlighting?
 Edit: More details about the issue:
 My emacs version is 29.4 and tree-sitter version is 0.22.6_1*, both are installed from official voidlinux repository.*
 Following is my \Messages* buffer when I open c++ file:*
 [yas] Prepared just-in-time loading of snippets (but no snippets found). Starting Emacs daemon.

 After making this post I tried several different older versions of the tree-sitter-cpp language but it didn&#x27;t work.
 
 Solution: I installed tree-sitter-cpp grammar version v0.21.0 after reading it in the comments and it worked. Seems I was using wrong versions so far.

 I expect Ascii movies to be AI generated in short, but meanwhile maybe I can paint the frames via artist mode, or transcode them from common video using libcaca/ffmpeg.

 Basically, long story short, Im using Emacs at work and home (for some obscure language called Magik). At work, the laptop install checkpoint as per company policy. Recently, some recent changes, have me struggling with Emacs Python Mode. Im not interested in using Python in Emacs (in PyCharm is fine). But If I turn on python-mode, or insert a python code block into my org files. The software quits Emacs. I want it to enable it minimally, if thats possible, without triggering.

                              <span>I have plans to test using Emacs more, but as a Windows user, i can set Copy/Paste buttons as Windows, witch make it easy but, it&#x27;s not Emacs standard.
 So if you are working om Emacs under Windows how do you do/think about this?

                              <span>I&#x27;m working on a minor mode for Emacs, and I want to create a global version of this mode. However, I&#x27;m unsure about the naming conventions. Would it be appropriate to name the global mode:
 - packagename-mode,
 - Or global-packagename-mode?
 - Or packagename-global-mode? 
 I would appreciate any guidance or best practices for naming global modes in Emacs.

                              <span>I have an elisp package that:
  
starts a java binary + a python program
 
sends queries to that python program via POST to localhost
 
uses the outputs of the python program to update the editor&#x27;s behavior.
 
 the code relies heavily on the python program, and it&#x27;s the python program that does all the heavy lifting.
 I want to make it easy for people to install and use my package. How do I install all the python dependencies and make sure they&#x27;re available inside of a MELPA recipe?
 i.e. can i do something like:
 pip install numpy
 inside of my MELPA package definition? is there documentation for this? I wasn&#x27;t able to find instructions for it

 I love how things work well together, that everything is a buffer (best search and replace experience), the perfect balance between terminal look and GUI features.
 But... it is just too slow, I spent years hoping native compilation will help, hoping version 29+ will fix things, even tried emacs-lsp-booster. I&#x27;ve read countless blog posts, forums, chats where people with the same issues is always challenged with &quot;something in the config must be wrong&quot;, &quot;can you debug what happens when you do that&quot;, &quot;do you have native compilation on&quot;, etc. I tried many tricks and recommended settings, many different distros, use emacs …</span>

 This is a &quot;working&quot; but still highly experimental transient for ffmpeg I&#x27;ve begun work on. It&#x27;s currently capable of very basic conversion semantics on 1 infile and 1 outfile per interaction.
 Improvements I hope to complete:
  
Multiple infiles and outfiles per conversion; I won&#x27;t consider the project complete without this
 Stream selection options on the basic conversion options
 Dedicated transient prefix for A/V filter construction and other complex directives
 Support for most of the available infile/outfile commands
  
Many of these improvements (especially the first one) require more thought than went into the prototype, so I expect progress be slow. Transients are a deep but rewarding rabbit-hole to enter. In the meantime, I don&#x27;t consider the code fit for public consumption; I look forward to this changing in the future.

 I wanted to write about why I use Emacs and why I recommend it.
 There might be some factually wrong information, tried my best to fact check. Feel free to correct me or tell me what you are thinking.

                              <span>I am generating an org file with links to all the files in a directory, and using those links in the usual org manner... reorganizing them, categorizing them, inserting text in between, some might be headings, etc.
 Now, just checking before reinventing the wheel... I need a function that updates the content of the file/buffer with any changes that have occurred in the directory. It doesn&#x27;t need to be immediate, it&#x27;s fine if it does so when called, and it should just notify me which files have been renamed, deleted, or changed names (using the ID of each referenced file).
 Is there any package that already implements this kind of functions / commands?

Now, the command respects the active region, wrapping its contents in the chosen directive. It&#x27;s now easier to go from:
 Halle[C]lujah, Halle[Em]lujah, Halle[C]lujah, Halle[G]lu-[D]u-[G]jah[D] 
 to

                              <span>Whenever I have to use Windows, I&#x27;ve been using Emacs v27.2 on MSys2. That works fine but now I feel the need to upgrade it so I can use the latest features such as libgccjit&#x27;s.
 Then I encountered one little problem; it seems that with Emasc 29, I&#x27;m no longer able to run Emacs on MSys2 with:
 # not really working well $ emacs-29 -nw 
 whilst with v27.2, I can:
 # working okay $ /usr/bin/emacs -nw 
 The problem doesn&#x27;t disappear in either the one provided by the package manager or the fresh local Emacs that I built from scratch in MSys2.
 Yes, I know that a workaround would be to use something like:
 # possible workaround with poor user experience $ winpty emacs -nw 
 This is weird though. How does the older package (v27.2) not require winpty, but does the new one (v29 above) now?

                              <span>There is an API out of my control, so I&#x27;ve written a few tests for it in a ZIO test suite to make sure it works as intended.
 I want to ignore these tests if the API server is down, so I&#x27;ve also written a ZIO effect that checks for connectivity. It was like this:
 object ApiTests extends ZIOSpecDefault { override def spec &#x3D; suite(&quot;test api&quot;)( ... // tests ).whenZIO(checkConnectivity) .provideShared(ZLayer.fromZIO(ApiService.create)) private def checkConnectivity: ZIO[ApiService, Nothing, Boolean] &#x3D; ... } 
 But checkConnectivity takes time to run especially if the server is down, so I want to run it only once, whereas with whenZIO on the test suite it&#x27;s run once for every test in the suite. So at the moment the best I&#x27;ve got is this:
 import zio.test.TestAspect.beforeAll object ApiTests extends ZIOSpecDefault { override def spec &#x3D; { suite(&quot;test api&quot;)( ... // tests ).whenZIO(isAlive) @@ beforeAll(checkConnectivityV2) }.provideShared(ZLayer.fromZIO(ApiService.create)) private var isAlive &#x3D; true private def checkConnectivityV2: ZIO[ApiService, Nothing, Unit] &#x3D; { ... // overwrites &#x60;isAlive&#x60; accordingly } } 
 I can&#x27;t help but feel it&#x27;s not the best practice to use a loose var here. Is there a more idiomatic way to achieve this?

 I&#x27;ve a project that contains several subdirectories, one of which is shown as foo. The build.sc is as follows:
 import mill._, scalalib._, scalafmt._ trait MyModule extends SbtModule with ScalafmtModule { def scalaVersion &#x3D; &quot;3.4.2&quot; def scalacOptions: T[Seq[String]] &#x3D; Seq( &quot;-encoding&quot;, &quot;UTF-8&quot;, &quot;-feature&quot;, &quot;-Werror&quot;, &quot;-explain&quot;, &quot;-deprecation&quot;, &quot;-unchecked&quot;, &quot;-Wunused:all&quot;, &quot;-rewrite&quot;, &quot;-indent&quot;, &quot;-source&quot;, &quot;future&quot;, ) trait MyTestModule extends SbtTests with TestModule.ScalaTest { def scalatestVersion &#x3D; &quot;3.2.19&quot; def scalacOptions: T[Seq[String]] &#x3D; Seq(&quot;-encoding&quot;, &quot;UTF-8&quot;) def ivyDeps &#x3D; Agg( ivy&quot;org.scalactic::scalactic:$scalatestVersion&quot;, ivy&quot;org.scalatest::scalatest:$scalatestVersion&quot;, ) } } object foo extends MyModule { object test extends MyTestModule } 
 Questions:
  
I want to apply the scalacOptions to only the main source, not test. Currently I achieve this by overriding the scalacOptions in the MyTestModule, but it&#x27;d be nice to be able to specify the target specifically instead of declaring globally and then overriding.
 Instead of having to list each submodule foo, bar, ..., it&#x27;d be nice to be able to add them dynamically. For this project, all subdirectories that don&#x27;t start with a period can be considered as a submodule.

                              <span>Is there a book that teaches writing a compiler in Haskell? I looked around and couldn&#x27;t find any.
 Please note that I am not looking for books that teach writing interpreters or VMs, or books that use languages other than Haskell, or Github projects of compilers written in Haskell.

                              <span>I want to begin learning functional programming. I have no prior programming knowledge or experience. I am comfortable with spreadsheet formula though and to my understanding spreadsheets are a form of functional reactive programming. 
 Are there any courses or learning resources out there for beginner programmers coming from spreadsheets seeking to learn Haskell (or other functional first languages)?

                              <span>I got into functional programming a few years back and was then introduced to category theory, specifically Bartosz&#x27;s book and video series (link). I read it during my spare time for a span of around 2 years and just finished the last page. Despite having little math background other than the few math classes that are typical for a computer science major, and not being able to come up with many relevant examples, I enjoyed reading through the book and tried my best to follow along every part, except coends.
 However, I struggled with the challenges in the book. I had to look up for solutions, or just failed to understand them at all, for more than half of them. I also didn&#x27;t realize until the last few chapters that I kind of got natural transformations wrong. I thought it&#x27;s a morphism of F a -&gt; G a, but really it maps any object a to a morphism F a -&gt; G a. I noticed that my retention for the knowledge is low. In other words, I forget the details of concepts in the book pretty fast. I tried to explain to myself verbally the concepts I learned, but I can feel it&#x27;s wonky sometimes.
 I&#x27;d like to ask what are the next steps for me? Should I go through a different text, maybe &quot;Category Theory for the Working Mathematicians&quot;, or others like &quot;Category Theory in Contexts&quot;, hoping that maybe they&#x27;ll solidify and expand my learning from a different aspect? Or should I learn a few other branches of math that I&#x27;m interested, and come back to category theory and see how they relate? Or?

                              <span>Hello Org community,
 I&#x27;m looking to create a custom agenda command that filters all entries associated with the categories work and business. I already have separate files named ~/org/work.org and ~/org/business.org, and from what I understand from documentation, entries in these files automatically and implicitly receive the corresponding categories.
 However, while I don&#x27;t often do this, it&#x27;s possible that I might explicitly set a :CATEGORY: work property somewhere else in my org files. Given this, I need a command that will capture all entries either from the ~/org/work.org and ~/org/business.org files OR with :CATEGORY: work, OR :CATEGORY: business set explicitly.
 Below I will give examples of records that I would like to filter in this way:
 ~/org/misc.org (by property)

My question is do I need to give reference notes an alphanumeric ID? Because I did find it difficult to locate a single source card in the pile of cards from one book, but because my main notes are in Obsidian, I’m not sure how to deal with the IDs at two places without breaking continuity</span>

                              <span>I have an enterprise CRUD appliaction, consisting of multiple services such as equipment, tasks, clients, eployees etc. They&#x27;re not microservices at all, but rather modules within the mononlith Scala app.
 At first every service had its own algebra, e.g.:
  trait Employees[F[_]]: def addEmployee(person: Person): F[Unit] def vacation(employeeId: UUID): F[Unit] def findByDepartment(departmentId: UUID): F[Option[Employee]] 
 Basically a DAO. Sometimes it also does some authorization checks, but mostly its about communicating with the storage. It was cool at first:
  
Different implementations for different storage targets
 I see dependencies of every function e.g. def findEquipment[F[_]: Equipment: Employees]
 Additional type-safety - it&#x27;s nice to see that a particular function works with Employees only
 Testing
  
However, after some time:
  
We&#x27;ve picked a single storage target
 There&#x27;s no big difference in terms of dependencies with def findEquipment(equipment: Equipment[IO], employees: Employees[IO])
 Type-safety is a win in 10-20% of functions because many have 4+ algebras or even Async
 For testing I just use the same implementations with empty DB - DB is an important aspect of behavior that I need to carefully duplicate for each testing implementation
  
Tagless Final is advertised for DAO in almost every tutorial, but does it really make any sense? I switched to more concrete services and hardly going to regret. I still have TF, but for much lower-level things: Logging, Tracing, Queing etc. What is your experience? To me it looks like TF make sense in DAO only in educational materials.

                              <span>Hi there! 
 I&#x27;m a very inexperienced programmer, and I&#x27;m planning on buying a surface pro 11. I have haskell in my upcoming classes, but I&#x27;ve heard people saying it&#x27;s more complicated since its a windows arm based system. I&#x27;ve programmed a little haskell on my home pc (not ARM based) and the downloading process was fairly straightforward. So I&#x27;m wondering whether it&#x27;s possible to program haskell on a new surface pro without jumping through a lot of hoops, or if it&#x27;s close to the experience on a PC.

                              <span>A minimal example of what I&#x27;m trying to do would go something like this. Say I want to write a class for &quot;wrapper&quot; types, like so:
 class Wrapper t where wrap :: a -&gt; t a unwrap :: t a -&gt; a 
 Now, of course, I could write:
 newtype Box a &#x3D; Box a instance Wrapper Box where wrap &#x3D; Box unwrap (Box x) &#x3D; x 
 But I&#x27;m wondering if it&#x27;s possible to provide a way for Wrapper to become stock-derivable so that I can write the more concise newtype Box a &#x3D; Box a deriving Wrapper. 
 I&#x27;ve tried searching for info on this, but I&#x27;ve only been able to find information about, just, how to use deriving in general.

                              <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;ve two small snippets, where I&#x27;m trying to expand one snippet inside another. As the snippet that gets expanded is always the same one, and it&#x27;s always expanded I&#x27;ve been trying to use yas-expand-snippet and yas-lookup-snippet in a transform on the field...
 My first snippet is something like,
 # key: CMakeVersion # name: CMakeVersion # type: snippet # -- ${1:Major}.${2:Minor}${3:.${4:Patch}${5:.${6:Tweak}}}$0 
 While the second snippet, that I want to expand the first into is,
 # key: cmake_minimum_required # name: cmake_minimum_required # type: snippet # -- cmake_minimum_required(VERSION ${1:Minimum$(yas-expand-snippet (yas-lookup-snippet &#x27;CMakeVersion))}${2:...${3:PolicyMax}}${4: FATAL_ERROR})$0 
 The transform seems to replace the $1 field with just a t (maybe like this?) and I&#x27;m not sure I follow why this is happening? I&#x27;ve tried with and without yas-triggers-in-field in the snippets and my config, but I&#x27;m unable to get it to play...
 Am I going about this the wrong way? Is there a better approach? Or can someone spot my mistake?!?
 Thanks, IGS.

                              <span>I may have asked this before when it was hypothetical, but: I have a new M3 mac coming next week; my first non-linux laptop in over 20 years. I know there are a bunch of ways to install emacs on Mac. I&#x27;d like to choose something fairly simple if possible. I&#x27;d like to run stable releases rather than git dailies (mostly to avoid recompiling all packages on a daily basis). I&#x27;ll be using elpaca with a pretty extensive config. 
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Hey people, I thought it could be interesting to share my hack to get heading-local variables in org-mode. They are actually buffer-local variables, but since I spend most of my time in narrowed org buffers, I decided to hook the modification of the local variables to the narrowing and widening of the buffer. I&#x27;m sure it has a lot of room for improvement, but so far it has worked well for me.
 The function hack-local-variables-property-drawer is the one to run when an org buffer is interactively narrowed or widened. Why interactively: you don&#x27;t want it to run 50 times in a row when calling org-agenda, for example. If it&#x27;s not the first time it runs in a buffer, it first restores the original values of the variables it changed last time. Then it reads the new variables from the &quot;LOCAL_VARIA…</span>

                              <span>I tried to make Emacs use the “Monaspace” font for proportional text. I really love this font, but it does not get rendered properly (refer to the attached screenshot). If you look at the text against the highlight line, you can see that there is lot more space below the baseline than there is above the median. Should I tweak the &#x60;line-spacing&#x60; or some other size to get rid of this problem? Any pointers are grealy appreciated!

 lisp (general-create-definer local-leader :states &#x27;(normal visual motion) :prefix &quot;,&quot;) 
 Using this like (local-leader :keymaps &#x27;org-mode-map &quot;o&quot; &#x27;hydra-org/body) works just fine, as long as the keymap in question belongs to a major mode (at least I think that&#x27;s the issue here). I&#x27;ve created a custom minor mode (the major mode that&#x27;ll be active is always lisp-mode, if that matters) and defined something in its keymap like so:
 lisp (local-leader :keymaps &#x27;my-mode-map &quot;l&quot; &#x27;my-function) 
 I can see the bindings for the default evil modes in my-mode-map just fine, enabled my-mode, but they don&#x27;t work as , still seems to be bound to the default evil/vim motion.
 What can I do to make , work as a prefix in this situation?

                              <span>I posted about the crashing of Emacs by xwidget-webkit-browse-url here.
 Traversing through threads on Emacs bugs, I found this chain that describes how one can avoid a crash. Namely, run
 emacs -q --xrm &quot;emacs.synchronous: true&quot; 
 (it has to be -q rather than -Q, as the latter ignores all X resources).
 This is fine for one-off uses of the xwidget-webkit browser, but I use Emacs in daemon mode, and
 emacs --init-directory&#x3D;~/my-init-dir --daemon --xrm &quot;emacs.synchronous: true&quot; 
 continues to crash (I specify the init-directory as I have it in a different location, the problem arises even without it).
 Has anyone found a way around this yet? FWIW, I&#x27;m still using Emacs 29.1, will upgrade soon to 29.4.

                              <span>SOLVED: Doesn&#x27;t have to do with Emacs.
 I have (setq-default delete-by-moving-to-trash t). When I delete a file in dired, it is afterwards shown in the system trash. But when I try to open it there, I get the error /run/user/1000/kio-fuse-edvbfm/trash/FILENAME doesn&#x27;t exist.
 How can a file be moved by emacs and correctly be shown by the system, but not exist afterwards? Do any of you experience the same problem?
 I use Kubuntu 24.04 and Emacs 30.0.50.

                              <span>My team is using notion for shared docs. I tried writing directly on notion but 1. the subpage system is driving me crazy (a page can be a link, or can be a whole line! and if you delete the whole line one, the page will be deleted, and sometimes you don&#x27;t need whole line one; let alone the subpage being attached to parent so moving things around is another hassle) 2. It looks ugly compared to my emacs theme or website theme. 
 The pain plus the bliss of writting in org-mode made me wonder if there&#x27;s a way to write in org-mode and export it to notion. I guess if I have the bulk of the doc done at some permanent form(don&#x27;t need to edit much) I don&#x27;t care where it is on anyway. So what I&#x27;m looking for is a solution to 1. write a lot of stuffs in org-mode(possibly from lots of files linked together with org-id or file link) 2. slide them into notion as a cluster of pages. 
 I&#x27;m currently trying notion&#x27;s builtin import function https://www.notion.so/help/import-data-into-notion So far html is not working(failed with no error message), and I&#x27;m trying others, but I wonder if there&#x27;s others have done this before?
 Currently my solution is to 1. write my stuff with org-mode and publish to my personal website (e.g. https://hermanhel.codeberg.page/braindump-ui/#f351ae9c-c280-4c71-9b12-1b8ba4a4200d this some doc I wrote about using huggingface) 2. make a page on notion and stick link to my website there. But this way other&#x27;s cannot edit it.

                              <span>When I run org-ql-search and have a nice overview of findings in an org-ql-view-buffer, and then jump from there using RET on a line, the buffer changes to the jumped-to-buffer. I would prefer it to stay as the org-ql-view-list and open the jumped-to-buffer side-by-side to it, so I can jump to the findings one after the other and view them.
 Now, this works well by running toggle-window-dedicated after the org-ql-view-buffer is made up.
 How can I make this the preferred behavior? Would be great if there were an org-ql-view-after-show-hook I could bind it to, but there seems to be none. Is there another way to program &quot;toggle-window-dedicated should be run every time after I called org-ql-search&quot;?

But in Obsidian, I could write as many words as I want or even worse directly copy and paste and thus never think more deeply before taking notes
I’d like to know how you guys avoid quoting or simply paraphrasing and put the idea into your own words as a reminder or your own thought on others idea</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m going through the book Writing a C Compiler. The book uses pseudo code and it only recommends using a language with pattern matching since the pseudo code relies heavily on it. The reference implementation by the author is in ocaml. 
 I want to do this in Haskell but have no knowledge of writing compilers. I&#x27;m looking for advice on some libraries that might be useful for this and any other tips that might be helpful. 
 I consider myself an intermediate haskeller. I&#x27;ve gone through most of &quot;Haskell from first principles&quot; and have written a few simple backend services in it.

 Hi there!
 I recently started learning Haskell to gain a better understanding of functional programming. One of the things that caught my attention was raytracing, which is both fun and interesting.
 Haskell is a truly delightful language. Every time I solve a problem or learn a new approach or concept, using monads in real-life scenarios brings me immense joy. One of the most challenging tasks at the beginning was generating random numbers. I had to do a lot of reading and learning before I could efficiently generate them. The difference between Haskell and other languages is significant, and it takes some time to get used to it.
 I would really appreciate some feedback from experienced Haskellers. Please let me know what I&#x27;m doing wrong or inefficiently.
 Current result

                              <span>Yesterday, inspired by the post A tutorial quantum interpreter in 150 lines of Lisp I decided to write something similar in Haskell. Is not the best implementation but for me was fun because I had the opportunity to write some Haskell after a long time. So, I decided to post the package (hqcsim) on hackage.
 The package dependencies are hmatrix and random and currently it contains a library and an executable. I plan to maintain the package and write tests.
 A difference between the implementation presented in the article and hqcsim is that in the my implementation the measurement is implicit. In the article, there is a &quot;Measurement&quot; operator, as seen in the syntax definition:
  program :&#x3D; ( instruction* ) instruction :&#x3D; ( GATE matrix qubit+ ) | ( MEASURE ) matrix :&#x3D; a complex matrix #2A( … ) qubit :&#x3D; a non-negative integer 
 In my implementation, there is not MEASURE instruction, that being implicit at the end of the program.

                              <span>In the context of Direct-style syntax (Ox/Gears), I am curious if people have found a way to make it visible for devs that a method/def is doing some effect. Should we use annotations that are checked by the compiler?
 In functions as values, there is a syntax coming for pure functions: https://dotty.epfl.ch/docs/reference/experimental/purefuns.html, is there anything for methods?

                              <span>I know this is one of those &quot;easier said than done&quot; sorts of questions, and I&#x27;m not sure if this was discussed before. But is there any reason why plugins like those found in SBT don&#x27;t have a &quot;standard&quot; by which other build systems can use to interoperate?
 I ask this mainly because it seems like there is a good chunk of the Scala community that isn&#x27;t satisfied with SBT, but the main hurdle to any other competition seems to be the ecosystem of plugins that would be lost, or would require separate maintenance by OSS maintainers. Given that there are now several build tools, SBT, Mill, Bleep, Scala-Cli (sorta), Bazel, Gradle, and Maven, that can be used to compile and build Scala code, maybe there is enough examples to figure out a portable standard?

                              <span>Does anyone know if there&#x27;s a way to make a table of contents in org-mode whose links work with the Github renderer?
 I&#x27;ve tried both toc-org and org-make-toc packages, which claim to support GitHub. But something must have changed. 
 Each anchor that GitHub generates for a section header is preceded by the number of that header. So instead of github.com/me/bla.org#introduction it&#x27;s github.com/me/bla.org#1-introduction. Likewise for a sub-header it would be #12-nameofsubheader instead of just nameofsubheader.
 Neither TOC libraries seem to support this format, and I can&#x27;t find an easy org-mode function that will give me the proper number for a given section, that can work with the TOC stuff.
 I&#x27;m wondering: * Could I be doing something weird in my org-mode file that is making GitHub add the numbers to the anchors? * If not, are there any TOC packages that will generate the proper GitHub links?

                              <span>I want to run some code after any arbitrary elispf function finishes.
 The question may seem odd, since elisp is synchronous, but it can call async processes. For instance, it may call a compilation process. The elisp function would then continue as normal without waiting for the compilation buffer to finish.
 I know compilation mode has hooks to handle this, but I need to generalize this, not only for compilation mode.
 What is the use case? I am the author of conner. With it, you can define arbitrary commands that can be ran with arbitrary &quot;runners&quot;, such as compilation mode, various built-in terminals, or have the command be interpreted as elisp code.
 I would like to have the option of running hooks after a command finishes, but since the runners are interchangeable, and can be defined by users, I would need a generalized way to achieve this.
 Is it possible to run the function that runs the commands in a separate process, and wait for all child processes to finish or something like that? Although that would most certainly open a separate emacs instance or something, and I would like it to run in the current one.
 Thanks.

                              <span>How can I make occurrences of a word, say banana, link to one specific occurrence of that word. So my org document would contain several instances of banana, and clicking on it would take me to the designated occurrence of banana. A few days ago I got something like that to work, but unable to find how to do it for the life of me. It’s like the [[banana]] linking, but that simply refers to a heading, and requires the brackets. I recall having it work without the brackets and all instances of banana turning into links.

 I&#x27;m seeing lots of errors with inline errors in Emacs. While I&#x27;m typing, they get on the way, block me from navigating in the code. 
 I did not experience this behavior until recently upgrading packages. 
 Any ideas what might be causing this and how I can fix it ?

                              <span>Per previous post about using Org and Agenda, I&#x27;ve gotten things setup pretty well so far. However I&#x27;ve run into a very weird issue that I cannot figure out what&#x27;s going on. 
 I have two machines that both have access to a home network drive. On that drive, I&#x27;ve got a folder called Notes and that&#x27;s got notes.org and a bunch of Denote files. So far so good. 
 On one machine (the laptop) I can launch Emacs and do org-agenda n and it&#x27;ll pull up the day&#x27;s schedule and current TODO list. On the desktop machine, if I do the same, it seems to just hang. There are no error messages, just silence. I&#x27;ve had to process kill Emacs a few times now to try different things.
 Any idea what org-agenda is doing that would cause it to hang?
 UPDATE: I went into .emacs.d and deleted everything pertaining to org-mode persistence, history, and things like that. That seems to have solved the issue for now. I guess between the two Emacs sessions, something got out of sync. Wish I knew what though, or how to avoid it in the future.

                              <span>Is there a way to ignore dollar-sign when using calc to grab a rectangle?
 The specific case is using emacs to edit ledger-cli entries, and I want to total the values in a split-transaction. Here&#x27;s an example:
 2001-01-04 * (797) City of Austin Assets:Checking:UFCU:Bjorg -$59.62 Expenses:Util/Austin:Electric $23.29 Expenses:Util/Austin:Water $4.23 Expenses:Util/Austin:Water $5.48 Expenses:Util/Austin:Solid Waste $17.91 Expenses:Util/Austin:Water $8.71 
 So if I want to total all the entries using rectangle command and copy into calc like: C-x * r and then execute calc-vector-sum (or &quot;u +&quot; inside calc), I can&#x27;t select a rectangle with &quot;$&quot; in it. Otherwise, I get an error like:
 calc-do-grab-rectangle: $’s not allowed in this context
 I understand I could reformat the text so the &quot;$&quot; won&#x27;t get selected, for example adding spaces between &quot;$&quot; and the amount like this:
 2001-01-04 * (797) City of Austin Assets:Checking:UFCU:Bjorg -$59.62 Expenses:Util/Austin:Electric $23.29 Expenses:Util/Austin:Water $ 4.23 Expenses:Util/Austin:Water $ 5.48 Expenses:Util/Austin:Solid Waste $17.91 Expenses:Util/Austin:Water $ 8.71 
 I can then make sure I select the rectangle without the &quot;$&quot; before using C-x * :
 It&#x27;d be nice if I can tell emacs calc to ignore &quot;$&quot;, but I&#x27;m not that conversant with elisp. As far as I can tell, the &quot;not allowed in this context&quot; error is throwing an exception in calc-aent.el when it&#x27;s checking something with a defvar &quot;calc-dollar-values&quot;? Is that something I can customize in .emacs or init.el?

                              <span>I see that Emacs has many superfluous key bindings, especially C-f, C-b, C-p, C-n, C-a, C-e, C-d, C-v, M-v, which are for functions with already dedicated keys on the keyboard. The dedicated keys are easily accessible on my custom keyboards, so these default bindings do not benefit me at all, and they occupy convenient places for some more useful functions.
 Is there a keymap for Emacs designed to override these bindings with some functions which are useful and by default less easily accessible?
 A naive idea would be to replace the bindings with whatever I want. But that would not be optimal because that would free some slightly less convenient key combinations which could be taken by some slightly less useful functions, &amp; c., so an optimal result would move many functions from less convenient key combinations to more convenient key combinations. So it would have generally simpler key bindings maybe very different from the default ones. That design requires some serious thought, so reinventing this would be difficult, so I would rather look if someone has already done something like that.

 Cancelling with C-g does nothing and I just have to wait for the force close popup from my OS. (kill doesn&#x27;t even work!)
 It&#x27;s been an issue since I started using Emacs, but it&#x27;s been happening more often recently, probably because of more config?
 How on Earth do I even start to debug this?

                              <span>I primarily am a Java developer, and at the same time I want to stick with some java ideas, I want to try something cleaner and more functional, but I don&#x27;t want to change completely the way I think, yeah I want to use Scala features in a deep way, and don&#x27;t get me wrong, Scala looks a pretty different and cool language, but I really don&#x27;t want to fully quit the Java mindset. Yes, I know there is probably a &quot;better&quot; option, like Kotlin, but I don&#x27;t want to use it. TL;DR, at the same time I want to use some of Java frameworks/libraries (including the standard one) and features (annotations, enums, good concurrency, static typing, etc...), I want some of Scala goodies, should I use Scala?
 EDIT (please read): I think i have to add some context here, because maybe some people have understood me wrong... maybe because i didn&#x27;t explained properly. NO, I do not want to use bad practices from Java, and of course I will use Scala good practices, like I said, I want to use the features, frameworks/libraries and some code ideas, not the entire mindset or bad things from the language. If I wanted to use Java code entirely, I would use Java.

                              <span>Does anybody have experience parsing JSON in a UDF in aws glue? I need a scala json parsing lib.. ideally one that&#x27;s easy to use in glue.
 I know how to load a json file into a dataframe, but I cannot do this. The file is jsonlines and each row has an entirely different schema.
 So I have this:
 sc.textFile(args(&quot;input_path&quot;)).flatMap(x &#x3D;&gt; x.split(&quot;\n&quot;)).map(do_stuff) 
 ..but then no idea what to do inside do_stuff.

                              <span>Hello everyone! We are hosting a Haskell meetup in Vienna on the 26th of September! The location will be at TU Vienna Treitlstraße 3, Seminarraum DE0110. The room will open at 18:00.
 We plan to have 1-2 short talks starting at 19:00 (topics to be announced). Depending on interest there might also be a short Show &amp; Tell session giving people the opportunity to show off or talk about something they work(ed) on for 5-10 Minutes each.
 There will be time to discuss the presentations with some snacks and non-alcoholic drinks being provided afterwards with an option to acquire beer for a reasonable price.
 The meetup is open ended but we might have to relocate to a nearby bar as a group if it goes very late.. There is no entrance fee or mandatory registration, but to help with planning we ask you to let us know in advance if you plan to attend here https://forms.gle/Paiw6D4QJzTKzcmM6 or per email at haskellvienna.meetup@gmail.com. 
 We especially encourage you to reach out if you would like to participate in the show&amp;tell or to give a full talk so that we can ensure there is enough time for you to present your topic.
 We hope to welcome everyone soon, your organizers: Andreas(Andreas PK), Benny, Chris, fendor, VeryMilkyJoe, Samuel

Recently, I discovered the forum and your software, which I find excellent! It is exactly what I was looking for.

                              <span>In the context of my final year internship at Tweag, I’ve had the opportunity to work on the Glasgow Haskell Compiler
(GHC), in an attempt to speed up compile times.
GHC is renowned for many things, but compilation speed isn’t one of them.
One specific problem exposed in issue #20264 is that in Core,
GHC’s intermediate representation, types are systematically inlined, resulting in large type trees having to be
traversed and transformed along the pipeline.
This blog post aims to explain why this is the case, in which situations it can result in slow compile times and large
memory usage, and what we can do about it.

The problem
Let’s take the example from the motivating issue #20264.

 I&#x27;ve tried to put the &quot;glut32.dll&quot; file everywhere (in the .exe dir, in the cabal dir, in the .hs dir etc etc) but I can&#x27;t get it to work
 What can I do?

 I have dira/some.txt open in one buffer. In the other of 2 buffers, I used dired to load dirb/some.txt. Emacs then replaces the other buffers so both have dirb/some.txt open. How can I prevent that, so I can compare the 2 different files?

                              <span>My eww is slow with port 443 for all websites.
 I found a previous message here from 5 years ago stating this was a tls 1.3 issue.
  
I don&#x27;t know how to disable it and my searching hasn&#x27;t found any realistic ways
 
I don&#x27;t think it is smart to disable tls 1.3 as that sounds unsecure
 
 My eww settings are vanilla - nothing changed. I can get to https urls via firefox without any delay.
 Thoughts?
 I am using: GNU Emacs 28.2 (build 1, x86_64-pc-linux-gnu, GTK+ Version 3.24.38, cairo version 1.16.0)

 any solution for this behavior?

 &quot;(set-face-italic &#x27;font-lock-comment-face nil)&quot; does not work.
 Neither does wrapping the specific text in code or verbatim.

                              <span>I am excited to finally announce the release of Forge version 0.4.0, consisting of 699 commits since the last release two years ago. It was actually released six days ago, at the same time as Magit and nine other packages, which all had to be released at the same time.
 To avoid getting myself into a similar situation again, I intend to release much more frequently going forward. So it is with delight, that I can report, that today I have already released version 0.4.1.
 More information can be found in the release announcement.

 So I find output of &#x60;xref&#x60; a bit unreadable, esp if a symbol is being referred in multiple files. So, I wanted to specify different color/font attributes for lines that contain name of the file where symbols are defined. 
 I noticed that - file name line although doesn&#x27;t have a different face, it does have a text-property called &#x60;xref-group&#x60;. Is there a way to colorize and specify some font attributes(such as bold) based on text-property.

                              <span>So I&#x27;m trying to learn elisp (bit by bit), and solving some problems on online website. I&#x27;m encountered following syntax couple of times.
 lisp (equal :sublist (list-classify &#x27;() &#x27;(1 2 3))) (equal :equal (list-classify &#x27;() &#x27;())) (equal :superlist (list-classify &#x27;(1 2 3) &#x27;())) 
 The task is to implement function list-classify that checks whether 2 list are equal or unequal or superlist or sublist (of one other). 
 I&#x27;m not asking how to implement it (please don&#x27;t tell me the solution). Just asking what does : represents. I don&#x27;t know what it&#x27;s called, (and more importantly what to search about on internet) where to read only about this part. 
 Currently I&#x27;m just lost directionless in the sea of elisp-manual. Don&#x27;t even know what to search in it.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been using Scala for many years. When I first started, Scala IDE (on Eclipse) was the only real IDE available, and it was terrible. Things have gotten a lot better since then with IntelliJ. However, in the past year or two, IntelliJ has become extremely unreliable for Scala. What do you all use for Scala editing these days?

                              <span>Is it possible to translate this contrived Haskell code to Scala 3?
 class Capture a where name :: Text instance Capture Int where name &#x3D; &quot;int&quot; instance Capture Bool where name &#x3D; &quot;bool&quot; data Captured &#x3D; forall a. Capture a &#x3D;&gt; Captured nameOf :: Captured -&gt; Text nameOf &#x3D; \case Captured @a -&gt; name @a 
 I assume &quot;Captured&quot; has to be a case class, but I struggle with the forall part. I&#x27;ve tried various permutations that contain &quot;using&quot; and/or &quot;[A]&quot;, but so far they&#x27;ve all resulted in &quot;polymorphic function types must have a value parameter&quot; errors.

                              <span>I have a org-mode file that is tangled to create various userconfigs. Given that the emacs-android package is pretty stable (and works great with e.g. texlive from termux), i want to tangle sourceblocks from the file. I am thinking of maybe adding tags like &quot;android&quot;, &quot;notebook&quot;, &quot;server&quot; and the like. I then want to call e.g. org-tangle-mobile to create files from all blocks with this respective tag. My brain is telling me i saw something like this before but i cant find the reference again or figure out how to so just by reading the Manual. Any experience?

It has been two years since I started Zettelkasten. Thanks @Sascha and @ctietze 
But I ran into one problem.
GIGO; I think that if you do Zettelkasten with bias, your wrong beliefs will become stronger.
How can I solve this?

                              <span>I have several org-capture files and sometimes I want to open one quickly so I created a keybinding to org-capture-goto-target:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;elisp (use-package org :bind ((&quot;C-c t&quot; . org-capture-goto-target)))
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; But I got the following error: Autoloading file /usr/local/share/emacs/29.2/lisp/cus-start.elc failed to define function org-capture-goto-target.
 Why is this the case?

                              <span>I tried the built-in one. Wasn&#x27;t very impressed. It doesn&#x27;t show all files in the same tab bar by default? (I can get having tab groups, but I don&#x27;t really want it to assume that.)
 And the tab bar is... bad. Small, hard-to use, and very ugly.
 Is there something better I should try?

                              <span>Hey guys, I have been wanting some emacs-like mindmap app for a very long time, and all the while I&#x27;m thinking of implementing a lisp myself in a similar way. 
 It just downed on me that as complete emacs is already as a lisp machine it probably just lacks builtin API for a canvas, so I can probably fork the C part, keep only the language core and runtime(and keybinding system, I don&#x27;t know where it is yet), ditch the text-editor part, add canvas support with qt or something, then build a mindmap API in elisp.
 How doable do you think this is? Will emacs source be too tangled with the text-editor part for such thing, or is there some obviously better way to build a lisp mindmap app?
 ps: for reference, the mindmap app I&#x27;m thinking about is one with emacs-like lisp runtime and keybinidng system. That along I think will be enough for most things to be built on top off.

                              <span>I have ~/.config/emacs, with the usual init.el and early-init.el. I just learned about the no-littering package which looks great. I use elpaca for my package loader/manager. I&#x27;ve run through the migration process, all works OK when I do (use-package no-littering :ensure t) near the top of my init.el. But to really clean up, I want it to handle my eln cache, which I think means I need to load it in my early-init.el so I can call startup-redirect-eln-cache on it. But of course elpaca isn&#x27;t set up there. If you have a similar config to mine, how do you handle this case?
 Same question for &#x60;elpa&#x60; and &#x60;elpaca&#x60;: I&#x27;d like those to go into &#x60;var/&#x60; but there&#x27;s a chicken-and-egg problem. What do you do?

                              <span>In a new job I have vowed to take better notes and I like the general Denote philosophy. So it&#x27;s installed, I&#x27;ve created a note, and so forth. 
 Does anyone have suggestions on the best way to set these things up? If I put a TODO in a note, it would be nice to be able to see an agenda view of uncompleted notes and links to where it was generated. I&#x27;ve read through the Agenda section in the Org manual but I&#x27;ll be honest, it was kind of long on detail and short on practicalities. I think I managed to get it work if I had a single agenda file in the ~/.emacs.d directory but what I&#x27;d like is something more comprehensive.
 I know it&#x27;s sort of a personal thing how people set it up, but I&#x27;m kind of starting from scratch on this and some models would be good. Thanks!

                              <span>Hey folks,
 I feel quite frustrated with the instability of counsel-projectile. I trigger &#x60;counsel-projectile-find-file&#x60; and it randomly opens switch-project instead. The repository looks like not maintained anymore.
 I&#x27;m looking for a package that;
  
Allows me to switch projects easily
 
find files within project
 
Switching to other buffers in project
 
Search for code within the project.
  
And I&#x27;m looking for a fast UX. Any suggestions? 
 Here&#x27;s my current keybindings:
 (define-key projectile-mode-map (kbd &quot;M-p f&quot;) &#x27;counsel-projectile-find-file)
 (define-key projectile-mode-map (kbd &quot;M-p p&quot;) &#x27;counsel-projectile-switch-project)
 (define-key projectile-mode-map (kbd &quot;M-p b&quot;) &#x27;counsel-projectile-switch-to-buffer)
 (define-key projectile-mode-map (kbd &quot;M-p s&quot;) &#x27;counsel-projectile-rg)
 (define-key projectile-mode-map (kbd &quot;M-p r&quot;) &#x27;projectile-replace-regexp)

                              <span>A few days ago I found out about Open RSS. So far I only use it to get beautifully crafted feeds of YouTube channels and playlists with video descriptions and thumbnails. 
 I could have just used the feeds provided by YouTube instead, only if entries would have thumbnails and video descriptions.
 I could have just used an “intelligent” reader like Feedly. But I don’t like proprietary garbage with integrated AI that just ends up making my life harder. And also it’s not Emacs. 
 I could have just an alternative frontend like Invidious. But playlist feeds don’t have thumbnails and videos, entries obviously link to invidious instances and not to YouTube directly and these public instances are slow. I didn’t have the resources to selfhost my own instance and just wanted a convenient, performant solution. 
 I could have just used Elfeed in conjunction with Elfeed-tube. These packages are actually great, but I’m a Gnus user. 
 For anyone with similar opinions and experiences Open RSS might be very well worth a try. For me it hits a perfect sweet spot. It’s also privacy-friendly and is developed in a transparent fashion. Although the source code is not publicly available, at least as far as I know. But that’s understandable as they’re kept alive by their user’s donations.
 Mark, the developer of Open RSS, is quick to reply if one encounters any issues and already helped me out once.

                              <span>Hi every, I am reading the book &quot;Thinking with types&quot; and I get confused about implicitly universally quantified. Sorry if this question is silly because English is not my first language.
 In the book, the author says that
 broken :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; a -&gt; b broken f a &#x3D; apply where apply :: b apply &#x3D; f a 
  
This code fails to compile because type variables have no notion of scope. The Haskell Report provides us with no means of referencing type variables outside of the contexts in which they’re declared.
  
Question: Do type variables have no scope or they are scoped within &quot;the contexts in which they’re declared&quot; (type signatures if I am not mistaken).
 My understanding is that type variables in type signature are automatically universally quantified, so
 broken :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; a -&gt; b 
 is equivalent to
 broken :: forall a b. (a -&gt; b) -&gt; a -&gt; b 
 forall a b. introduces a type scope. However, without the ScopedTypeVariables extension, the scope of a and b is the type signature where they are declared, but not the whole definition of broken.
 This quantification is to ensure that a and b in the type signature are consistent, that is, both occurrences of a refer to the same a, and both occurrences of b refer to the same b.
 Question: Is my understanding correct?
 Thanks.

 Safe resource management is impossible, every transitive mechanism is exposed, tracing dependency graph is impossible, async initialization of certain components is convoluted as fuck.
 So let&#x27;s move it.
 Where do I start? How do I trace components without dependencies? How can I make PRs that are as little disruptive as possible?

                              <span>I see a lot of different systems for numbering cards.
It seems to me that using a three- letter alphabetical code at the beginning would help organize better.
For instance LOG is Logic PHI is Philosophy.
Instead of having arbitrary numbers that have to be remembered, a three-letter code could kind of be like an airport code where it makes it really easy to remember, and of course they would be filed alphabetically and then numerically.
Why not?</span>

                              <span>As of what I&#x27;ve encountered so far, lists can be like:
 1) One
 2) Two
 3) Three
 So there cannot be any space in between because if so inserting a new element will restart the count
 1) One
 2) Two
 1) One
 Is there a way to avoid so?

First it was /u/danielciocirlan with /u/odersky and this video https://old.reddit.com/r/scala/comments/1eksdo2/automatic_dependency_injection_in_pure_scala/
 Then /u/jivesishungry (and then /u/dgolubets ) with this post https://old.reddit.com/r/scala/comments/1eo3lc3/automatic_dependency_injection_using_implicits/
  
I think we can do it even simpler. Relying just on Scala&#x27;s implicit mechanism:
  
for components that are to be wired together, use case classes, so that Scala generates apply method to construct it
 use a helper method, which will call this apply, but fetch the arguments from the implicit context; we can call this method fromContext, more on it later
 have all the components …</span>

                              <span>Hello, I&#x27;d like to experiment with Scala.js but I found it quite cumbersome to install a specific npm package: tonejs. My &#x60;Main.scala&#x60; file looks as follows:
 @JSExportTopLevel(&quot;Main&quot;) object Main { def main(args: Array[String]): Unit &#x3D; { println(&quot;Hello, Scala.js!&quot;) val Tone &#x3D; global.require(&quot;tone&quot;).asInstanceOf[js.Dynamic] val synth &#x3D; Tone.Synth().toDestination() synth.triggerAttackRelease(&quot;C4&quot;, &quot;8n&quot;) } } 
 And my build.sc:
 import mill._ import mill.api.Result import mill.scalajslib._ import mill.scalajslib.api._ import mill.scalalib._ import mill.scalalib.scalafmt.ScalafmtModule import mill.scalanativelib._ import mill.scalanativelib.api._ object tone extends ScalaJSModule { val platform &#x3D; &quot;js&quot; def moduleKind &#x3D; T { ModuleKind.ESModule } def scalaVersion &#x3D; &quot;3.3.1&quot; def scalaJSVersion &#x3D; &quot;1.16.0&quot; def ivyDeps &#x3D; Agg( ivy&quot;org.scala-js::scalajs-dom::2.8.0&quot; ) def npmDeps &#x3D; T{ Seq( &quot;tone&quot; -&gt; &quot;latest&quot; ) } } 
 However, when runnin &#x60;node out/tone/fastOpt.dest/out.js&#x60;, the compiler complains with:
 export { $e_Main as Main }; ^^^^^^ SyntaxError: Unexpected token &#x27;export&#x27; 
 Am I missing any extra configuration? I kindly appreciate any suggestion.

                              <span>[solved]
 the issue was rustic getting uninstalled but its unneeded dependencies not having been cleaned, so rust-mode was viewed as an orphaned dependency and not listed 
 im currently trying to install Rust-Mode but it i keep getting the message that it cant be found and looking at the package list there is no rust mode to be found https://imgur.com/a/tnbLKCl, i tried package refresh but it hasnt fxed the issue either

                              <span>Looking into the git repo of eglot the project seems a bit inactive. Last commit is 8 months ago.
 There are some old PRs just fixing typos in the README.md that never got merged. I am concerned.
 The README itself doesn&#x27;t give any news about the status or plans. Does anyone knows more?

                              <span>I&#x27;m getting some awkward behavior with multi-select checkboxes in the customize interface (i.e. custom variables with :type &#x27;(set...)). I originally was experimenting with erc-modules, but it&#x27;s demonstrated equally well with this defcustom:
 (defcustom my-test-customization &#x27;(one) &quot;Let&#x27;s test customization!&quot; :type &#x27;(set (const one) (const two) (const three) (const four))) 
 If you evaluate this and try to change it through customize-option, there are a few bits of surprising behavior:
  
When you first open the customize interface, one is checked by default, but the &quot;state&quot; widget says that the variable is edited, and the shown value isn&#x27;t in effect. If you C-c C-c nothing seems to change--one is still checked--but a describe-variable on my-test-customization says the value is now nil! Wit…</span>

 But when I&#x27;m on *eat* or *vterm* buffer, it prompts me for a Git repository to open, like it doesn&#x27;t know the current directory is already a Git repository.
 How to make the behavior of M-x magit-status on *eat* and *vterm* buffers the same as the one on *ansi-term* buffer?

 I am currently editing legacy code base that suffers from non-consistent code formatting rules. 
 Instead of having Emacs automatically format all source code automatically, which I normally do, I&#x27;d like to know if you guys found a way to format only the lines you have changed in your daily work? Maybe even in a automatic on-save -way?

 i wanna open two side by side windows and start two different modes on them on startup. i&#x27;m familiar with hooks and opening two windows next to each other, but not sure how to write a function that I can run via cli -f flag that&#x27;ll open a specific mode in each window. any chance somebody can give me an example function def that I can build on?

                              <span>Hey Haskell enthusiasts!
 I just published a new blog post that dives deep into the Maybe Monad, exploring not just its theoretical underpinnings, but also its real-world applications. If you’ve ever wondered how this seemingly abstract concept can solve real-world problems, from handling uncertainty in finance to ensuring data integrity in cybersecurity, this post is for you!
 Check it out here: Unlocking Real-World Power of Monads: A Deep Dive into the Maybe Monad
 I’d love to hear your thoughts and any insights you have on applying monads to practical problems. Let’s discuss!

                              <span>Hello,
 I have dabbled with org-mode a bit in the past and then kind of stopped using it. In the meantime I switched to Colemak-DHm and an ortho split Miryoku keyboard so I feel like I will be starting from scratch again essentially.
 I am interested in using both org-roam and org-mode and I would like some guidance on how to get started. Besides the general advice, I have some specific questions.
  
Is there a recommended order in which to learn them?
 
Is org-roam just some extra commands on top of org-mode?
 
Do I need to adapt something (i.e. change location of keys) because of Colemak?
 
My use cases include notes for work and learning and I would also like to start keeping a personal diary. Shall these go to separate knowledge bases or in the same?
  
Thanks for all the answers in advance and have a nice day/night (wherever you are in the world :p)

                              <span>Minimal Emacs
 An Emacs modular template for early-init.el &amp; init.el as a kick starter to a custom Vanilla Emacs configuration that is optimized for performance and sensible settings.
 Author: James Cherti
 Github: https://github.com/jamescherti/minimal-emacs.d
 This is a base starter kit for vanilla Emacs. It&#x27;s really just an optimized early-init.el and an init.el that strives for fast startup times and sensible default settings. All the magic that is necessary is included. This is really nice because there&#x27;s a lot of conflicting information online about the best way to optimize GC, etc. in early-init.el and this project does it for you. I&#x27;ve seen similar settings but I also saw some new stuff I didn&#x27;t know about. 
 It is designed to keep those two files in git so you can update Minimal-Emacs. Setup additional modules for user customization in pre-early-init.el, post-early-init.el and pre/post for init.el as well. 
 It&#x27;s up to the user to add to the base. If you start with this kit then proceed to watch System Crafters Emacs from Scratch series, it will get you up and running very quickly. 
 James put a lot of effort into this base starter kit and I am digging it, no cap FR as the whippersnappers are accustomed to proclaiming. ;-)

                              <span>I recently switched to swaywm from gnome. I configured the org-download as follows
 #+begin_src emacs-lisp (use-package org-download :config (add-hook &#x27;dired-mode-hook &#x27;org-download-enable) (setq-default org-download-heading-lvl nil) (setq-default org-download-image-dir &quot;~/ko-pa-ni/images&quot;) (setq org-download-screenshot-method &quot;~/.scripts/sway-contrib/grimshot savecopy area&quot;) :bind ((&quot;C-c d s&quot; . org-download-screenshot) (&quot;C-c d y&quot; . org-download-yank))) #+end_src 
 Whenever I use org-download-screenshot, the grimshot kicks in and I can draw a rectangle to capture the area I want on the screen, but then emacs freezes and there is no image found under the org-download-image-dir. I think it has to do with grimshot and org-download not communicating. Having no image in the directory tells me that org-download takes care of pushing the image to the configured directory but grimshot usually saves to ~/Pictures/screenshots but even there I cannot find the screenshots.

                              <span>I do get this error (Emacs 29 from Debian 12 backports) after updating all my packages after a long while:
 File mode specification error: (void-variable ) 
 I am not sure but I think I identified the error causing lines (see :hook) in the init.el.
  (use-package python :ensure nil ; in-build! :hook (python-mode . (lambda () (if (not (string-equal (system-name) &quot;quark&quot;)) (eglot-ensure))) ) (python-mode . ws-butler-mode) (python-mode . hs-minor-mode) :custom (python-shell-interpreter &quot;python3&quot;) ) 
 The intention of that hook is to start &quot;eglot&quot; only if the current systems name is not &quot;quark&quot;. I do share this init.el between several machines and &quot;quark&quot; is a RaspberryPi4 not able to run eglot and its backend in a performant way.

I&#x27;m trying to migrate from obsidian to org-roam, because of keybindings. But I have one problem: latex parts renders in org-file very bad (image). How to solve this problem and how you think: take math notes in separate pdf-files which linked with org-roam or to take all notes in org-files?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been following along Real World Haskell, and getting the indentation right while following their style is infuriating.
 E.g,
 -- file: ch03/Lending.hs lend amount balance &#x3D; let reserve &#x3D; 100 newBalance &#x3D; balance - amount in if balance &lt; reserve then Nothing else Just newBalance 
 I find myself Pressing &quot;tab&quot; to overshoot the appropriate column, then hitting &quot;backspace&quot; in my editor to delete 4 spaces at a time (too many), then repeatedly smacking &quot;space&quot;, overshooting again, deleting 4 spaces again, etc....
 Since the appropriate number of spaces to indent changes expression to expression, are there any editor/plugins/etc. that would allow for &quot;contextual&quot; tab stops, so that &quot;tab&quot; and &quot;backspace&quot; simply add and remove the right amount of spaces relevant to the expression I&#x27;m currently editing? I&#x27;m currently using vscode with haskell-language-server.
 Or would it be better to simply adopt a style that ignores this problem entirely? I.e., Google leads me to https://kowainik.github.io/posts/2019-02-06-style-guide
  
The indentation of a line should not depend on the length of any identifier in preceding lines.

I&#x27;m new to haskell, and I&#x27;ve already set up vs codium with the official package, which installs a lot of stuff for you. I would love recommendations for vs codium extensions too, as I haven&#x27;t programmed since college (CS) and I&#x27;m very rusty. I&#x27;m learning it strictly for fun, btw, to solve challenges, for example.

                              <span>Hi, I was reading &quot;A System for Writing&quot; by Bob Doto and in the book, he specifically introduce the Folgezettel system.
I totally understand it was probably another name for sequence notes in Zettel, my question is, if I were to do this, and how do I know if the number I give to a note is occupied? He wrote in the book that &quot;There are no “occupied slots,” because there is no prescribed order.&quot; but if that&#x27;s the case, does it mean I can have two note share the same number , say &quot;1.1 apple is edible&quot; and &quot;1.1 Elephant is large mammal&quot;? My current thought on a work around is to put that number after a UID, say yyyyMMddHHmmss and a &quot;-&quot; and after that begin the number sequence.
Not sure If I explain my question properly, wish you all good luck.</span>

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I&#x27;m very happy to announce the release of Yampa 0.14.10 and yampa-test 0.14.10.
 Yampa is a fast, elegant Functional Reactive Programming implementation. Yampa prides itself in being a long-standing community project. It has now been around for 20 years!!! See https://github.com/ivanperez-keera/yampa#features for details on Yampa&#x27;s features.
 This new release introduces a new type of integral that implements the trapezoid integration rule. Simulations executed at low sampling rates can behave in ways that violate expected physical laws (e.g., systems may gain energy over time due to inaccuracies in the calculation of positions and velocities). This new integral behaves in a more stable way in such cases. Thanks to Github users idontgetoutmuch , miguel-negrao and thalerjonatha…</span>

                              <span>This subreddit seems to be one of the places where people might be able to help, so I hope this is appropriate here.
 I&#x27;m trying to use Magit a bit more instead of command line git invocations. But I seem to be unable to successfully commit changes from Magit, and I can&#x27;t figure out where the problem is. I&#x27;m hoping someone here will be able to point me in the right direction, maybe giving some more suggestions for debugging the issue.
 The Symptoms
  
I open a file in Emacs from a directory with a Git repository
 I press C-x g to open Magit
 I move the point to an unstaged file and press s to stage its changes
 I press c c to try to commit the changes
 The line at the top of the Magit buffer changes to &quot;GitError! Git failed [Type &#x60;$&#x27; for details]&quot;
 I press $
 
A new buffer opens containing…</span>

                              <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;m a CS graduate eager to create something meaningful for the developer community. I&#x27;m planning to build a non-trivial Emacs package (or a similar project) that could take months to develop and would be truly helpful to others.
 Do you have any ideas or unmet needs that you&#x27;d like to see addressed?
 Thanks!

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been having this issue for a while and couldn&#x27;t find anything on it online, including the vterm GitHub repos. I figure if it&#x27;s a known issue someone here will have also experienced it.
 This seems to persist between Emacs versions, and it only happens when I open a vterm shell while using TRAMP in a remote server. If I instead open a vterm shell on my local computer first and then ssh into the remote server, it doesn&#x27;t have this issue.

                              <span>I have a workspace structured as:
 /workspace/x/a/very/long/path/.../foo_a.c /workspace/x/b/another/very/long/path/.../foo_b.c /workspace/x/ya/very/long/path/.../foo_a.c ... 
 Right now I&#x27;m using my own adhoc/hackish command (plugged into capf@vertico) to complete with &quot;foo&quot;.
 Vertico would show: (/workspace/x is the git repo&#x27;s top-level)
 Open File: foo foo_a.c in a/very/long/path/.../foo_a.c at /workspace/x foo_a.c in ya/very/long/path/.../foo_a.c at /workspace/x foo_b.c in b/another/very/long/path/.../foo_a.c at /workspace/x 
 Is there any melpa/elpa/buitin package/solution that does file-name completion while ignoring the dir? especially ones that let vertico clearly show the filename sans-directory in the completion list.

Nothing seems to be working. Eg, &quot;Go to definition&quot; etc.
 
After I open my project and run &#x27;lsp-describe-session&#x27;, I get empty &#x27;capabilities&#x27;.

                              <span>I have an org directory that I use primarily at work where I use Emacs 29.4 on WSL2 on Windows 11. I have a few additional computers at home, including a web server. I don&#x27;t really use org on mobile devices. I want to be able to put my org files on my own server and read them primarily from off-network.
 Currently I&#x27;m syncing my org files through OneDrive, which works for the most part. I only rarely use my personal computers for org, but would like to be able to reference them, esp. from the server for automations.
 It occurred to me that this could be done reasonably easily through WebDAV. I&#x27;m literate enough to set up the technical stuff myself, but realize I may be overlooking other options. Really, I&#x27;m less literate in Emacs/org, so I&#x27;d ask the community - is there anything wrong with using a WebDAV mount for org files? In terms of use, security, whatever. Is there some better way to share org files on my home server that can be mounted to a directory in linux?
 (for what it&#x27;s worth: I cannot use a VPN at work but can use an SSH tunnel)

I&#x27;ve been writing notes about passion&#x27;s relationship to serendipity. This relationship is directly proportional to our passions combined with how public we are about those passions and our abilities to communicate our passions.

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m using vertico and marginalia in my emacs setup. I was following System Crafters video to set up and configure org-roam. I&#x27;m not seeing tags in my results when I search for nodes. For example, I have #+filetags: project in some of my nodes. But I don&#x27;t see them in the results when I run org-roam-node-find. I&#x27;m unable to filter by them.
 I&#x27;m not sure if this is related to marginalia or vertico. But here are my configs for both.
 Marginalia config
  (use-package marginalia :after vertico :custom (marginalia-annotators &#x27;(marginalia-annotators-heavy marginalia-annotators-light nil)) (marginalia-align &#x27;right) (marginalia-align-offset -5) :init (marginalia-mode)) 
 Vertico config
  (use-package vertico :bind (:map minibuffer-local-map (&quot;&quot; . rr/minibuffer-backward-kill)) :custom (vertico-cycle t) :init (vertico-mode +1) (setq completion-styles &#x27;(flex partial-completion) completion-ignore-case t completion-category-defaults nil completion-category-overrides nil)) 
 Also, here&#x27;s one of my roam nodes:
 :PROPERTIES: :ID: AFD9D19B-00AC-477C-95CE-7F02BA88D527 :END: #+title: Foo #+category: Foo #+filetags: project * Tasks * TODO Test task SCHEDULED:  
 Am I missing any config? Any help would be appreciated.
 EDIT: I had to set the following line while setting up org-roam.
 (setq org-roam-node-display-template (concat &quot;${title:*} &quot; (propertize &quot;${tags:10}&quot; &#x27;face &#x27;org-tag)))

 for example, the above thing is supposed to be an equation environment with \int xdx inside, but it is instead displayed with the ∫ character. How do I make org roam ui render the latex code?

                              <span>I am using org 9.8-pre. The preview system is great, except for the fact that I am left with a ton of org-tex-** files scattered around whatever directory I am editing files in. Can this be fixed by me, or is this currently a bug? Thanks.

                              <span>I just discovered a &quot;bug&quot; (it wasn&#x27;t a bug in magit, but a change in Git itself) in magit when I switched to a newer version of Git. After googling I found out that the problem has already been solved in magit over a year ago. Because I&#x27;m updating the Emacs packages once in a month, I was wondering why it is still in my local magit installation.
 The reason is that the release versions on NonGNU Elpa and Melpa Stable are still version 3.3.0, which was released on Oct 4, 2021. Does somebody know the reason why there are no new releases on those archives?
 Yes, I know I could use Melpa Unstable, but I don&#x27;t want it, because I&#x27;m serving a lot of my colleagues with an Emacs configuration and I don&#x27;t want to use unstable package versions.
 Yes, I know I could ask directly on GitHub, but I don&#x27;t want to create an account for just one question.

                              <span>Hello,
 I am developing the major and minor modes for Gobra, a Go verifier. When annotating a go program with specification, we use //@ or // @, and Gobra parses these lines as logic instead of just comments (we also have the multiline variant but let&#x27;s keep this as simple as possible).
 I have a minor mode for Go buffers to be able to interact with Gobra and I also want to add syntax highlighting for Gobra&#x27;s specification language. This means I have to override the default syntactic-face-function to work differently for these special comments.
 What I have is this until now:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; (defconst gobra-comment-regexp-prefixes &#x27;(&quot;// ?@&quot; &quot;/* ?@&quot;))
 (defun gobra-update-nth (l n i) &quot;Return a copy of the list L with the Nth element updated to I.&quot; (append (cl-subseq l 0 n) (list i) (nthcdr (1+ n) l)))…</span>

                              <span>We have a small team of &quot;algorithms engineers&quot; who, as most of the &quot;data science&quot; / &quot;ML&quot; sector, use python. Pandas, numpy, scipy, etc.: all have been very helpful for their explorations. We have been going through an exercise of improving the quality of their code because these algorithms will be used in production systems once they are integrated into our core services: correctness and maintainability are important.
 Ideally, these codebases would be written in Haskell for those reasons (not the topic I&#x27;m here to debate), but I don&#x27;t want to hamstring their ability to explore or build (we have done a lot of research to get to the point where we have things we want to get into production).
 Does anyone have professional experience doing ML / data-science / algorithms engineering in the Haskell ecosystem, and could you tell me what that experience was like? Especially wrt Haskell alternatives to pandas / numpy / various ML libraries / matplotlib.

                              <span>This is a bit of a follow-up from this post. I have two related problems, I&#x27;m at my wits-end and I was hoping for some advice.
 The problem basically boils down to injecting context into an Aeson FromJSON parser. If I wish to read a file of JSON objects that refer to each other, I would like to be able to replace an identifier reference with the actual object when it is read. For example
  data Region &#x3D; Region { regionID :: Text , regionName :: Text , regionType :: RegionType , regionParent :: Maybe Region , regionLocale :: Maybe Locale } 
 with data like
  [ { &quot;id&quot;: &quot;ES&quot;, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Spain&quot;, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;Country&quot;, &quot;locale&quot;: &quot;es&quot; }, { &quot;id&quot;: &quot;ES-CL&quot;, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Castille and León&quot;, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;Subnational&quot;, &quot;parent&quot;: &quot;ES&quot; } { &quot;id&quot;: &quot;ES-GA&quot;, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Galicia&quot;, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;Subnational&quot;, &quot;parent&quot;: &quot;ES&quot;, &quot;locale&quot;: &quot;ga&quot; } ] 
 I have an elaborate system of placeholders and normalisation at the moment to sort out the parent references to &quot;ES&quot; and I was wondering if there was something, a la Jackson, that would handle references naturally.
 I have lots and lots of other examples of this sort of need to reference other items.
 The other aspect of this in injecting this information, hopefully using the ReaderT pattern, into another parser that will use this data. As an example,
  data Location &#x3D; Location { locationID :: Text , locationName :: Text, , locationRegion :: Region } 
 and 
  [ { &quot;id&quot;: &quot;S&quot;, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Santiago de Compostella&quot;, &quot;region&quot;: &quot;ES-GA&quot; } ] 
 where the Galicia data, with all its useful information such as locales and holidays, replaces the &quot;ES-GA&quot; reference.
 I have wasted waaay to much time trying to figure out how to achive this and would appreciate any useful* advice.
 * With the caveat that I do not regard &quot;embed it into code&quot; as &quot;useful&quot;. The idea that I can&#x27;t give users control over their configuration makes my skin crawl.

                              <span>Daniel Ciocîrlan recently posted a video showcasing a dependency-injection (DI) approach developed by Martin Odersky that uses Scala&#x27;s implicit resolution to wire dependencies.
 As  indicated in a comment, however, this approach makes it awkward to separate the DI framework from service definitions. It occurred to me it would be easier to do so with an approach modeled on ZIO&#x27;s ZLayer. I&#x27;ve provided a POC along with a discussion in a gist:

                              <span>I&#x27;m upgrading an app from 2.12 to 2.13 and there&#x27;s a variable declaration with an arrow function that doesn&#x27;t throw an error but also isn&#x27;t getting called and I&#x27;m trying to understand what&#x27;s wrong with it, but my googling skills are failing me. Here&#x27;s is a pseudocode version of it:
  class { function(&quot;/route&quot;)(SourceParamsReads(Reads)) { println(&quot;a log here prints successfully&quot;) Params &#x3D;&gt; println(&quot;no logs here or beyond print successfully&quot;) function(Params.session) { id &#x3D;&gt; val source &#x3D; Params.source val user &#x3D; ( groupId &#x3D; Params.groupId userId &#x3D; Params.userId ) val future &#x3D; ... future.map {...} } } 
 There&#x27;s more in the ellipses but hopefully this is enough information. the Params variable has no references anywhere else in the application, just before the arrow and inside it.

                              <span>I am a Doom Emacs user. I am trying to hide the habits consistency graph from a custom agenda view.
 I tried a few variations of the following to try to only affect this custom view (works for agenda-groups):
 lisp (agenda &quot;&quot; ( (org-habit-graph-column 0) (+org-habit-min-width 0) (org-agenda-span &#x27;day) (org-agenda-start-day &quot;.&quot;) (org-super-agenda-groups nil) )) 
 Then I tried setting some variables globally hoping to suppress it:
 lisp (after! (org org-agenda) (setq! org-habit-graph-column 1 +org-habit-min-width 10 org-habit-preceding-days 1 org-habit-following-days 1 org-habit-show-habits-only-for-today t )) 
 Every time, the graph shows in agenda. When I check the variables while in the agenda view the values are not the ones I set in the config; org-habit-graph-column (which I was the most hopeful about if set below the value of +org-habit-min-width) for example is always set to 99.
 Thanks for your help.

                              <span>Hey Everyone,
I’ve done a scrappy demo for an application that allows you to publish your notes and actually build a following and income around them. If anyone has the time could you please take a look and fill out the form? The whole thing will take 5-10m. The link is - https://tally.so/r/3x2Do9
By the way, the video is made for people with no prior experience with note taking apps, so parts of it may be information you already know.
Thanks!</span>

 I just updated from 29.3 to 29.4, and I found out that &quot;M-x restart-emacs&quot; now no longer starts up emacs again after closing it. Has anyone experienced the same issue?

I created a document in Obsidian called &quot;to read&quot; where I store them with title, URL and a copy/pasted bit of text to jog my memory of its contents — but it&#x27;s getting a bit unwieldy and I wonder if there&#x27;s some better system.
I also keep a separate &quot;recreational reading&quot; list in NotePlan. How do you manage your list(s)?</span>

I&#x27;ve been using The Archive as my primary note-taking and knowledge-management tool for the last four years. It + the Zettelkasten method have been genuinely life-changing for me.
I wrote an essay on some of the specific reasons I love using The Archive so much. I&#x27;ve also shared some of the custom Alfred workflows and keyboard shortcuts I use to support The Archive, along with detailed examples.
I thought you all might enjoy the read!

Abusing Haskell: Executable Blog Posts by Sinan
I post my notes on my blog, Hashnode and dev.to, which require slightly different markdown formats. I have been doing the sane thing to fix formats so far. But it is a rainy Sunday and I am bored, so I decided to make this blog post an executable Haskell program to do the same.

                              <span>I&#x27;m writing a program where I have different kinds of events which share the same behavior and I&#x27;d like to store them together in a section with some other information . Is this possible to do in haskell or is there a better more idiomatic way to go about this? Here&#x27;s some pseudo code:
 data eventT1 … data eventT2 … class someClass where … instance someClass eventT1 where … instance someClass eventT2 where … data someData &#x3D; someData { foo :: int , bar :: [someClass] } main &#x3D; do let test &#x3D; someData { foo &#x3D; 1 , bar &#x3D; [eventT1, eventT2] } 
 The compiler complains the bar :: [someClass] part in the declaration of someData.

                              <span>I have had an init file which I have been using for a few years now. Most of my custom configs are in an org file which is then tangled using org-babel. Up until today I though what happend was :
  
I start emacs, the init file runs 
 it gets to org-babel-load file (code below)
 init.el is generated from org
 init file gets evaluated
  
However, when I was installing on a new machine today, I noticed than not all of the lisp code from the org file was in the generated init.el. Did something change in the newer versions of emacs? (newest machine is 29.4)
 Or have I just been misunderstanding how it worked all this time?
 (org-babel-load-file
 (expand-file-name &quot;init.org&quot;
 &quot;~/.emacs.d/org&quot;)) 
 To resolve the issue I deleted the init.el file and restarted emacs, this time it generated and executed everything. Restarting alone made no difference.

 I&#x27;ve installed emacs-nox in my home directory using a combo of yum download, rpm2cpio and cpio.
 I can get it to start if I export EMACSDATA, EMACSLOADPATH and EMACSDIR, and it kinda works. It complains that it can&#x27;t find it&#x27;s arch-dependent data dir. I&#x27;ve looked for the environmental variable for this, but can&#x27;t find it. Does anyone know?

                              <span>Emacs makes use of a number of Linux-based command-line utilites, such as ls, grep, diff, and so on. However, recently I&#x27;ve started working for a company who has allowed me to have Emacs on my system, and have installed Ubuntu for Windows Subsystem for Linux on their Windows 10 systems.
 Unfortunately, sudo is not an option for my WSL instance, so there&#x27;s no way to add any components (including Emacs or any GUI functionality) to my WSL instance, so I can only download the native Windows portable version of Emacs.
 I know that you can use the WSL commands by prefacing them with bash -s, such as bash -s find -name filename.ext. However, I&#x27;m not sure where I can specify this to Emacs without going through the source to find all the variables containing the commands I need.
 To make this more complicated, I also make use of Vertico and consult (among the other components).
 Is there a single location where I can notify Emacs to add bash -s to the start of shell commands, or perhaps a list of variables that I can add to my .emacs.d tree?

I am already pretty used to the key bindings and really like using emacs, however, I haven&#x27;t quite nailed down how to get a good linter and customize emacs for that purpose. Looking to see if anyone out there has a good setup and could give me some tips on where to start. I am mainly going to be running my scripts through a server so using the terminal version of emacs is where I have been spending most of my time. Any help would be appreciated !

                              <span>I am using emacs ver 29.4, org version 9.7.8.
 I am trying to export the matplotlib graphic to the same directory that the org files lives in:
 #+begin_src python :results graphics file output :file temp_plot_2.png import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt x &#x3D; np.linspace(0, 10, 100) y &#x3D; np.sin(x) fig, ax &#x3D; plt.subplots() ax.plot(x, y) #+end_src 
 The file is generated as expected, but ends up in the ~ directory.
 I checked the default-directory variable, and it is correctly set to the ~/images directory, where the org file lives, and where I want the graph (image) to go.
 When I use absolute paths in the :file argument (e.g., :file /home//images/temp_plot_2.png), it works as expected, but I don&#x27;t want to need to provide the absolute path every time.
 Anyone have any idea what&#x27;s going on, and why relative paths seem to not be working as expected?
 From the org manual, which seems to be in conflict with what I actually observe, since the directory associated with the current buffer is /home//images according to the local default-buffer variable, but file output is actually /home/:
  
The ‘dir’ header argument specifies the default directory during code block execution. If it is absent, then the directory associated with the current buffer is used.
 https://orgmode.org/manual/Environment-of-a-Code-Block.html
  
I tried specifying the dir header; didn&#x27;t work. I tried using M-x cd and navigating manually to the /home//images directory; didn&#x27;t work.
 Thanks

                              <span>I am new to emacs, i am using org agenda with org roam my main issue is when openning org agenda it creates many buffers that I can see and it annoys me i know i can kill all with x keybinding. However, I want to ask about how do emacs users deal with this ?! I would have preferred that org agenda open these buffers silently and only show me the buffer that contains the todo I have selected. Is there a way to enable such a behavior ? Thank you in advance.

                              <span>I have read a few threads about this warning, but no detailled answer about how to deal with it.
 Please, correct me if I am wrong, but I understand it is a change in &#x60;org-mode&#x60; version 9.7 which throws a warning when the function is used in a non Org buffer. So, chances are that when the warning pops up, it is from an external package that has not conformed yet to that new rule/convention.
 Anyway, I get this warning every time I open the agenda time-grid, tall other built-in or custom views are working fine. This is not a terrible thing, but warnings are designed to be annoying, so I would like to get rid of it.
 Is pinning &#x60;org-mode&#x60; to a previous version the best way to go ? Any recommendation as to which version I should downgrade to ?
 I am a Doom Emacs user if it is relevant. Thanks in advance for your help.

                              <span>Not sure if this issue is specific to Doom emacs. When scrolling past any inline displayed image, the screen shifts down until the image gets completely out of frame, this sudden snap can be very distracting, especially with larger images, so i am asking for some type of workaround to fix this.
 Google searches only suggested pixel-scrolling options, which i tried and have not worked.
 ChatGPT told me to stop using images altogether lol.
 My version of doom emacs is a fairly new install with not much going on inside the configuration or packaging.

                              <span>Hi, I need to put an email address inside a org file that will be exported in HTML with Hugo. For privacy reasons, I need to encode it with HTML entities (like o@ etc.), but the HTML output I get is encoded (so it becomes &amp;#111;&amp;#064;).
 I put it between @@html:...@@ and worked great with the link description, but didn&#x27;t work at all with the link URL. What else can I try?
 I think this is mainly an issue with Hugo, but I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s another way in org to set a string as literal.

                              <span>Hey everyone, in the recent months I got interested in Haskell and decided I&#x27;d start a small side project just to get the feeling of programming in Haskell.
 homodoro is what I came up with, a quite simple TUI program with some timers and an extremely simple task manager, I feel like I probably didn&#x27;t learn much about Haskell/FP in general while developing this but it was the most joy I ever felt while programming something and I&#x27;m quite happy with the result.
 All feedback is much appreciated.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been researching how to use optimal evaluation to optimize Discrete Program Search and, eventually, I arrived at a simple algorithm that seems to be really effective. Based on the following tests:
 f 1001101110 &#x3D; 1010100110 f 0100010100 &#x3D; 1001101001 
 Solving for &#x27;f&#x27; (by search), we find:
 xor_xnor (0:0:xs) &#x3D; 0 : 1 : xor_xnor xs xor_xnor (0:1:xs) &#x3D; 1 : 0 : xor_xnor xs xor_xnor (1:0:xs) &#x3D; 1 : 0 : xor_xnor xs xor_xnor (1:1:xs) &#x3D; 0 : 1 : xor_xnor xs 
 My best Haskell searcher, using the Omega Monad, takes 47m guesses, or about 2.8s. Meanwhile, the HVM searcher, using SUP Nodes, takes just 1.7m interactions, or about 0.0085s. More interestingly, it takes just 0.03 interactions per guess. This sounds like a huge speedup, so, it is very likely I&#x27;m doing something dumb. As such, I&#x27;d like to ask for validation.
 I&#x27;ve published the Haskell code (and the full story, for these interested) below. My question is: Am I missing something? Is there some obvious way to optimize this Haskell search without changing the algorithm? Of course, the algorithm is still exponential and not necessarily useful, but I&#x27;m specifically interested in determining whether the HVM version is actually faster than what can be done in Haskell.

                              <span>This has been bugging me for a while, which probably says more about the occupational hazards of translating for a living than anything else. Does anyone actively disagree that Luhmann&#x27;s &quot;Register&quot; and similar documents in modern zettelkästen would naturally be called indexes in the absence of interference from the German word? If you disagree, what does the English word &#x27;register&#x27; mean to you, and in a zettelkasten context, how does it differ from an index? (I&#x27;m aware that Luhmann explicitly said his Register wasn&#x27;t meant to be exhaustive, but in my understanding an index doesn&#x27;t have to be either.)</span>

                              <span>bit of a crapshoot here, but thought i’d ask.
 im trying to get erc in emacs to scrub out ?ex to the end of the line in messages recieved. (mainly cos i use bitlbee as a bouncer via emacs cos my internet is slow as shit &gt;! 10mbit on a good day !&lt;) I can get embeds with erc-image. but not when they dont end in a normal image extension. 
 with all the tracking discord attachments have, i lose this.
 (use-package erc :init (defun erc-mention (match-type nickuserhost msg) (when (and (eq match-type &#x27;current-nick) (not (string-match &quot;^\\*\\*\\*&quot; msg))) (notify-send &quot;(IRC)&quot; (format &quot;PING! %s&quot; msg)))) (defun erc-clean-url (proc parsed) &quot;Clean trackers with ?ex from discord so enbeds properly work&quot; (save-excursion (goto-char (point-min)) (when (re-search-forward &quot;\\?ex.*$&quot; nil t) (replace-match &quot;&quot;)))) :hook (erc-text-matched-hook . erc-mention) (erc-insert-modify-hook . erc-clean-url)) 
 This is what i&#x27;ve got and it doesnt seem to work, any ideas?

                              <span>I really like an emacs theme that I use, but in diff mode it is totally unreadable. I was wondering what the usual way of correcting this would be. Perhaps I could modify the overall theme but I&#x27;d be worried that it would ruin the aesthetics of the theme in other modes.

                              <span>This is kinda antithetical to the minimalist nature of nano but I still wanna try it. I want to replace the GNU Emacs / N Λ N O text with an ASCII art. I wonder if this is plausible since ASCII is technically just text. For reference, this is the ASCII art I want to use (specifically Lucy as the &#x27;doctor&#x27;).
 If this is simply not plausible in nano then I&#x27;m also up for alternative splash screen that can do this.

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to get my Outlook work calendar accessible in emacs to escape the mess that is the outlook web interface, and came across excorporate. huge props to the author for getting an Exchange interface working! After a bit of trying out different configs I got it working with the OAuth 2.0 setup of my employer. 
 Now I&#x27;m trying to actually use it, but I find it somewhat unexpected; perhaps that&#x27;s because I have used org-gcal for a while and was expecting something similar, i.e. synchronizing of the calendar entries into an org file which can be linked to my org-agenda (and calfw).
 For example, a very frequent occurrence is to schedule meetings with other people (in person). This generally works by everybody looking at their calendar to find a spot in e.g. the next week where all of us are available. Is this possible with Excorporate? To me it seems it&#x27;s only possible to check the calendar entries for a given day (via M-x calendar, moving to the date, pressing d or e), but not get a list of all the events, or all the events in a week/month. 
 Furthermore, creating events seems to be possible via the API (https://github.com/emacsmirror/excorporate/blob/master/excorporate.info, chapter 6 API Usage), but this functionality is not exposed as an interactive function. Does that mean I have to write my own helper functions here? Has anybody done so already?
 Does anybody have experiences with excorporate for these use cases?

                              <span>I primarily do scientific work in python with code-cells.el and the ipython REPL. I like this workflow but, since I&#x27;m a subpar programmer, I often end up with giant and disorganized scripts which are difficult to navigate. I eventually delete the cruft and refactor but I still end up spending a lot of time in this disorganized state. To improve navigation through the spaghetti, I thought maybe a table of contents could be made from the code-cell headers (i.e. &quot;# %% Imports&quot;). Does something like this already exist? Is there some other quick solution involving, e.g., code folding, bookmarks, imenu, etc.? 
 If there&#x27;s no easy solution I thought this might be a good excuse to start playing with elisp and try implementing it myself. Any suggestions with respect to how to begin would be much appreciated.

                              <span>Edit: I changed the title from &quot;How do you take notes on claims attributed to secondary sources?&quot; to &quot;How to deal with unverified indirect claims?&quot;. @Andy pointed out that I am using the terms &quot;primary source&quot; and &quot;secondary source&quot; incorrectly. The distinction I was trying to make was between direct and indirect claims.
I&#x27;m currently working on taking more effective notes using the Zettelkasten method and have encountered a challenge when dealing with claims attributed to secondary sources.
For example, academic articles typically contain numerous references to outside sources. Many of the claims discussed are not original but rather derived from these secondary sources.
My struggle is with how to properly document these secondary claims in my notes when I&#x27;m unfamiliar with the sources being referenced. I feel uncomfortable directly citing them. However, these claims are often relevant and interesting, and I want to include them in my Zettelkasten for future reference.
Here are some questions I have:
How do you approach taking notes on claims that are attributed to secondary sources when using the Zettelkasten method?
Do you cite the original source, the secondary source, or both in your notes?
How do you ensure accuracy and avoid misinterpretation when you&#x27;re not directly familiar with the primary source?
Any strategies for efficiently exploring the primary sources when they seem particularly crucial to your understanding of the topic?
I’d appreciate any advice or strategies that have worked for you when navigating this aspect of academic note-taking. Thanks in advance!</span>

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m reading  book on Manning MEAP website and have difficulties in understanding its chapter 21, titled &quot;Hello World! - introducing IO types&quot;. In my opinion, it seems to give wrong information. Below is an example:
 &quot;If main isn&#x27;t a function, it should follow that neither is putStrLn. ... As you can see, the return type of putStrLn is IO(). Like main, putStrLn is an IO action because it violates our rule that function must return values.&quot;
 The author seemed to think &quot;IO ()&quot; isn&#x27;t a value, which I don&#x27;t agree with. So I googled and found the following on Haskell wiki https://wiki.haskell.org/Introduction_to_Haskell_IO/Actions:
 &quot;PutStrLn takes an argument, but it is not an action. It is a function that takes one argument (a string) and returns an action of type IO (). So putStrLn is not an action, but putStrLn &quot;hello&quot; is.&quot;
 So I think the author is completely wrong on that, isn&#x27;t it? On the other hand, however, I read lots of good reviews on the book on Amazon website. Am I misunderstanding something? Thanks for any confirmation or explanation.

                              <span>Hi, there are a lot of old posts about flycheck being better than flymake for haskell, but I heard flymake got much better lately so I have question, is it worth setting up flycheck in 2024?

                              <span>Howdy. 
 I&#x27;m trying to write a util function to clean up org-agenda items. Specifically, if an agenda item has a SCHEDULED and DEADLINE with matching date+time I would like to remove the SCHEDULED property. Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve come up with but though the messages indicate my logic is fine the changes are not being reflected in org-agenda view nor in the file where an item lives. Perhaps there&#x27;s some save function I&#x27;m not calling to persist the changes?
 (defun local/org-remove-schedule-if-deadline-matches () &quot;Remove SCHEDULED from agenda item if DEADLINE exists and matches.&quot; (interactive) (org-map-entries (lambda () (let ((scheduled (org-entry-get nil &quot;SCHEDULED&quot;)) (deadline (org-entry-get nil &quot;DEADLINE&quot;))) (when (and deadline scheduled) (let ((scheduled-day (org-time-string-to-absolute scheduled)) (deadline-day (org-time-string-to-absolute deadline))) (when (&#x3D; scheduled-day deadline-day) (message &quot;removing SCHEDULED from task: \&quot;%s\&quot; in file %s&quot; (org-get-heading t t t t) buffer-file-name) (org-entry-delete nil &quot;SCHEDULED&quot;) (save-buffer)))))) nil &#x27;agenda))

                              <span>Is it possible to automatically sync org files via Git similar to how it can be done via Dropbox. I can&#x27;t use dropbox in work laptop and I only have access to Git. I need to access files on Orgzly mobile app which does automatic sync even from Git.
 Possible options
  
Purely dropbox like which means it can sync files even if I open the files or not.
 Pull/merge when I open the file.

                              <span>I never touched emacs but want to start using it as a note-taking tool. I used a lot of zim wiki, it&#x27;s great but also very limiting and has all the cons of a retained-mode user interface.
 My question is what &quot;flavor&quot; of emacs should i use that best fits my needs?
 All i ask is rich text, image viewing support, linking to other notes/files, hierarchical notes and optionally a GUI.
 I don&#x27;t mind steep learning curves nor the specific type of rich text.

                              <span>Hello fellow Emacs enthusiasts!
 I&#x27;ve noticed an interesting behavior difference between fill-paragraph in text-mode and org-fill-paragraph in org-mode, particularly when working with selected regions.
 Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve observed:
  
In text-mode, fill-paragraph respects the selected region and only operates within it.
 In org-mode, org-fill-paragraph doesn&#x27;t seem to respect the selected region and operates on the entire paragraph.
  
I&#x27;ve created a GIF to illustrate this difference:
 https://i.redd.it/7trbpcthrqgd1.gif
 I initially thought this was a bug and submitted a report, but it was determined not to be one.
 I&#x27;d like to open this up for community discussion to get your thoughts and insights.
 In org-mode, the behavior remains the same whether a region is selected or not. When no region is selected, I believe this behavior is appropriate.
 However, the issue arises when a user explicitly selects a region, expecting the fill operation to be limited to that selection.
 I think org-fill-paragraph should respect the selected region, similar to how fill-paragraph works in text-mode.
 What do you think about this behavior?
  
Update: Now that I&#x27;ve reviewed the org-fill-paragraph function documentation again, I understand the current behavior.
  
The REGION argument is non-nil if called interactively; in that
 case, if Transient Mark mode is enabled and the mark is active,
 fill each of the elements in the active region, instead of just
 filling the current element.&quot;
  
Unlike text-mode&#x27;s fill-paragraph, org-fill-paragraph is designed to &quot;fill each of the elements in the active region.&quot;
 The current behavior seems to be explained by this information.
 Thank you for your opinions!

                              <span>Apologies for the spam, but the sonatype API recently changed in a subtle way (it started erroring on &#x60;//&#x60;s in the URL which it previously ignored), and as a result all Mill builds publishing to Sonatype are failing. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s getting fixed on the sonatype side, so I released a new Mill version that people will have to update to unblock themselves to continue publishing to sonatype:

 Trying to blast it broadly to reach the folks who are affected, sorry for the spam

                              <span>I gathered some popular Scala libraries into OSGi bundles. 
 https://gitlab.com/perikov/scala-bundles
 I tried this before ( https://github.com/p-pavel/osgi-scala ) wrapping every jar into a bundle, but I finally gave up.
 Everything is badly broken (split packages is the main problem).
 So I just taken a route on bundling releases (&quot;everything related to org.typelevel/cats/n&quot;).
 I also have Karaf features with dependencies. 
 For it lets me to just type &#x60;feature:install myApp&#x60; and have relevant libraries from cats ecosystem (and also elastic4s and others) just install transparently from maven. 
 and &#x60;feature:uninstall&#x60; just unloads everything.
 I&#x27;m not sure if I have to put all this on maven (maven central requires packaging sources with jars, and my jars are just bundles containing relevant libs).
 Is there any interest on this topic?

                              <span>In Scala 2.13, and play-json, I used the following pattern to serialize/de-serialize between case classes and Json:
 import play.api.libs.json.{Format, Json} object WelcomeResult { implicit val format &#x3D; Json.format[WelcomeResult] } case class WelcomeResult(service: String) 
 defining implicit formatin the companion object of the case class, made it easily visible from outside, so the following code worked without even requiring an extra import:
 val welcome &#x3D; WelcomeResult(&quot;test&quot;) val json &#x3D; Json.toJson(welcome) 
 In Scala 3 I saw the type class derivation feature and though I could take advantage of it by a. making the code more compact. b. defining such a default formatting only once in a generic way in the type class.
 This is the implementation I have in mind:
 case class WelcomeResult(service: String) derives JsonFormat
 And then something like this in JsonFormat:
 import play.api.libs.json.{Format, Json} trait JsonFormat[T] { val format: Format[T] } object JsonFormat { def derived[T](using scala.deriving.Mirror.Of[T]): JsonFormat[T] &#x3D; { new JsonFormat[T]: override val format: Format[T] &#x3D; Json.format[T] } } 
 But Json.format[T] fails with some &quot;Instance not found: &#x27;Conversion[T, _ &lt;: Product]&#x27;&quot; error. I guess, from other examples that I need a macro to implement the desired behavior, but not sure how.
 Any help appreciated.

                              <span>I read the following statement in this article - Direct-style Effects Explained. Does it mean one can accomplish the effect of e.g. ZIO, Cats without using those library? If so, apart from the examples Print, Raise/ Error, provided in the article. Any more examples that can be referred? Thanks
  
So direct-style effects and monad effects can be seen as just two different syntaxes for writing the same thing.

                              <span>In an org-ql-search in a code block, it is comfortable and easy to set a condition that a property has to have a certain string value. But how about number values? I have number values as properties and need to compare them: Is this value larger than 500, is it larger than 1400? But I cannot find a way to do this.
 I would be very grateful for any suggestions on how to find a solution path.

                              <span>I&#x27;m untrained in music, but every bit of music theory I learn really increases my enjoyment of it. I wanted to learn to compose a bit, and the traditional method is counterpoint. So I did what any barely musically literate nerd would do: I started to write a program to verify that a counterpoint composition follows the rules when played against a given melody. Frankly it was an uphill battle. But finally, this weekend, I got it working.
 https://github.com/ludflu/counterpointer-report
 The main thing that stymied my earlier efforts was that I didn&#x27;t understand the nature of musical intervals in a formal way. Every explanation I learned described it as a mathematically naive music student might require, which makes sense if I were trying to play the oboe or whatnot. Or, things would be explained in DSP terms, explaining how overtones work, etc. And that also makes sense, but....
 But what I really needed, was for someone to tell me that musical intervals are calculated using integers mod 12. Which actually makes a ton of sense when you think about how human&#x27;s perceive relative pitch. Did you know that humans are the only animals we know of that perceive relative pitch? I&#x27;m pretty sure I learned that from David Huron&#x27;s excellent book.
 Eventually I thought to ask someone over in /r/musictheory and things mostly worked out from there since I could use the Haskell modular-arithmetic library for the intervals, and Euterpea for representing notes and playing them via MIDI.
 Finally I had to hack around some broken stuff because Euterpea, though its a marvelous library, is not actively maintained and so needed some work to get it to run with modern Cabal. AND PortMIDI-haskell doesn&#x27;t agree with Clang on OSX. But I was able to patch all those things locally to get everything running, and I submitted PRs to try and fix them up for everyone else.

                              <span>Fellow PKM enthusiasts,
I find myself caught in what seems to be a cyclical dilemma in the world of personal knowledge management, and I&#x27;m curious if others are experiencing the same.
My journey began with enthusiasm for local-first environments like Obsidian and Logseq. The promise of data ownership and flexibility was alluring. However, as time passed, I found myself gravitating back to cloud-based solutions.
Now, I&#x27;m feeling the pull towards local files and Markdown again. It&#x27;s as if I&#x27;m caught in a perpetual swing between the convenience of the cloud and the freedom of local storage.
This pattern has me wondering:
Is this back-and-forth between local-first and cloud-based systems common in the PKM community?
For those who&#x27;ve made multiple switches, what ultimately made you settle on one approach (if you have)?
Are there solutions that effectively bridge this gap, offering the best of both worlds?
How do others manage the trade-offs between sync convenience and data sovereignty?
I&#x27;m starting to think this isn&#x27;t just a fleeting concern, but a fundamental tension in how we approach PKM. The desire for true ownership of our data and the freedom to use multiple tools seems to persist, even after trying various solutions.
Has anyone else found themselves in this PKM pendulum? How have you reconciled these competing needs in your own systems?</span>

                              <span>Hi everyone, sorry I couldn&#x27;t find a proper title for what I was looking for. what I want is a way for consult completion candidates to show a certain string when I&#x27;m selecting from the minibuffer but when the candidate is selected it should be the original form string.
 for example:
 ;; I have this list of paths that I want to select from (defvar paths &#x27;(&quot;/dir1/dir2/p1&quot; &quot;dir1/dir2/p2&quot; &quot;/dir1/dir2/p3&quot;)) ;; I want to parse those paths to only show the filename ;; in the minibuffer (consult--read (--map (file-name-nondirectory it) paths)) ;; the completion is supposed to be p1, p2, p3 ;; but when when I select I want the original path to be selected ;; for example /dir1/dir2/p1 
 I would do it using a hashmap or alist to map between the candidates and the selection.
 is there an easier way around this without using annotate function or marginalia ??

                              <span>what are your thoughts about mg https://linux.die.net/man/1/mg ? 
 I am tinkering with the github repo to make it a little bit more customized for my needs but other than that I praise its puristic and minimalistic ways. Its written in c and works smoothly over ssh (without tramp or sth.)

                              <span>Emacs beginner, started with spacemacs. I want to use spacemacs in terminal mode in my remote machine(Ubuntu) by doing ssh from my Mac. 
 How can I enable copy/yank from some text from my Mac browser into emacs buffer on the terminal and also vice versa. 
 I tried clipetty and it works when I yank something from emacs buffer and paste on Mac but not the other way around. Also it does not work at all when using tmux. 
 Appreciate any suggestions!!

                              <span>This question is mostly to those of you, who love or enjoy Scala (or not, but still visit this sub) but don&#x27;t get to use it at work, or use it only for Spark.
 Imagine that you&#x27;re given a task of creating a mission critical component of your company&#x27;s product. It would have to be a project deployed to the cloud, scalable, reliable, performant (but not extremely performant - jvm performance is fine). It will have to be maintained for years to come - by you, your team and your successors.
 Whatever you choose, you will have to recruit a team or train your coworkers - let&#x27;s assume that they are mostly java users, good old spring booters, but they are not against the idea of learning a new language and paradigm.
 Would you choose Scala for such a project if given a choice? Do you feel confident that you&#x27;d be able to sell this idea to your manager? Do you believe that with Scala it would be cheaper to maintain or more profitable than with other languages? When would it become profitable - the recruitment / trainings would be more expensive surely, so would benefits of Scala become visible after weeks, months, years of maintaining the product, or never at all?

                              <span>I stumbled upon a very toxic comment in this subreddit that somehow racked up 20 upvotes, and honestly, I was appalled by the sheer negativity of it.
 I get that everyone has their own opinions about coding, but flinging insults like that? That’s just not right.
 Can we please cut the negative rhetoric and start being more welcoming to EVERYONE, regardless of their skill level or coding style?
 The /r/scala subreddit should be a safe space for every Scala user. Labeling other people&#x27;s code as &quot;trash&quot; is not okay.
 That comment also fails to meet this community&#x27;s rules of &quot;decency&quot; and &quot;politeness.&quot; I&#x27;m very surprised that it received 20 upvotes.
 And can we please make full use of all the tools that reddit puts at our disposal? And let’s not turn a blind eye to this kind of behavior, we need to call it out. We can definitely do better. Thanks.

                              <span>Two dummy examples, both Scala 2.12. 
 First example - sequence of Foo[t &lt;: T], and I want some function to use that t somehow. Pseudocode-ish:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; type A &lt;: T type B &lt;: T
 trait Foo[t &lt;: T]
 object Foo1 extends Foo[A]
 objet Foo2 extends Foo[B]
 def someFunc[t &lt;: T](foo: Foo[t]): Unit &#x3D; { somethingThatKnowsHowToTakeTypes[t].foobar }
 Seq( Foo1, Foo2 ).map(someFunc) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 This leads to type erasure concerns, even though to me it seems obvious that that Sequence is of a type where each object inside is a Foo of some concrete type that fits the constraints. I can get around it by introducing some wrapper case class that I can stick Foo1 and Foo2 into, which retains it&#x27;s type as an explicit member. And then inside someFunc I have to manually use that type member explicitly. Feels clunky and it feels like something I&#x27;m tricking the compiler into doing. Not to mention at some point I did get it to compile, only to fail at runtime if I didn&#x27;t create the correct implicit typetag in scope.
 Second example:
 Sequence of (Foo[t &lt;: T], Bar[t &lt;: T]), and Bar/Foo have methods that operate on or return t &lt;: T. I store in a 2-tuple because inside a lambda I want to do something like Foo.read(...).map(Bar.transform) where Foo.read returns something typed by t and Bar.transform takes something subtyped by t. I assume since I pair them up in a 2-tuple, the Seq of these such objects could recognize that it&#x27;s some paired object, but instead the compiler complains about expected vs supplied types.

                              <span>Hey all, this is a follow up post to this post with an amazing title.
 I am writing this so it doesn&#x27;t just exist on my laptop and is documented somewhere. Maybe this is common knowledge, I did not find it anywhere.
 Basically, update from my end on the direction Monoidal -&gt; Traversing is that there&#x27;s a way to write
 monoidalToTraversing :: (Choice p, Monoidal p, Traversable f) &#x3D;&gt; p a b -&gt; p (f a) (f b) 
 we use a variation of Alexis King&#x27;s construction
 data Traversal a r b &#x3D; Done b | Yield a !(Traversal a r (r -&gt; b)) deriving Functor instance Applicative (Traversal a r) where pure &#x3D; Done Done f  a &#x3D; f  a Yield a rToTf  ta &#x3D; Yield a ((\ f b x -&gt; f x b)  rToTf  ta) traversal :: Traversable t &#x3D;&gt; t a -&gt; Traversal a b (t b) traversal &#x3D; traverse (\ a -&gt; Yield a (Done id)) unTraversal :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; Traversal a b tb -&gt; tb unTraversal _ (Done tb) &#x3D; tb unTraversal morph (Yield a fab) &#x3D; unTraversal morph (fmap ($ morph a) fab) traversalP :: (Choice p, Monoidal p) &#x3D;&gt; p a b -&gt; p (Traversal a b x) (Traversal b b x) traversalP &#x3D; dimap toEither fromEither . right&#x27; . (both  id  traversalP) where toEither :: Traversal a r b -&gt; Either b (a, Traversal a r (r -&gt; b)) toEither (Done x ) &#x3D; Left x toEither (Yield a resume) &#x3D; Right (a, resume) fromEither :: Either b (a, Traversal a r (r -&gt; b)) -&gt; Traversal a r b fromEither (Left x ) &#x3D; Done x fromEither (Right (a, resume)) &#x3D; Yield a resume monoidalToTraversing :: (Choice p, Monoidal p, Traversable f) &#x3D;&gt; p a b -&gt; p (f a) (f b) monoidalToTraversing &#x3D; dimap traversal (unTraversal id) . traversalP 
 (I call both :: p a b -&gt; p c d -&gt; p (a,c) (b,d) to Monoidal&#x27;s idiomatic class function) the other direction (Traversing -&gt; Monoidal) needs some other kind of ideas which I am not having so far.
 Remaining questions:
  
What about the other direction?
 How to do this for Traversing1? It shouldn&#x27;t use Choice, because Either a is not a Traversable1
 What are the implications?

                              <span>I mostly run Emacs 29.4 (from source) but on some machines I run Emacs 28.2 (Debian 12) and Emacs 27.1 (Debian 11). I&#x27;ve recently started seeing errors on Emacs 27.1 with consult-buffer and consult-ripgrep among others in Git repositories:
 No applicable method: project-roots, (projectile . &quot;/full/path/to/git/root&quot;) 
 and the commands no longer work. I don&#x27;t see these errors in newer Emacs versions.
 Am I out of luck trying to run modern packages on Emacs 27 or is it possible that I&#x27;ve got something configured incorrectly?
 Thanks.

 if I have #+title: python:getting command in ubuntu then org-roam-find-node can list it
 if I have #+title:python:getting command in ubuntu then org-roam-find-node cannot list it
 Both ways, the python:getting command in ubuntu are highlighted with org-document-title face, so I think (I could be wrong) that org-mode parses both way alright(or is it font-lock and parser behave differently?). but the space will make that huge difference to org-roam-find-node
 Why?

                              <span>My main gripe are
  
I&#x27;m not always logged into reddit, and when I click a reddit link, it produces some fake security error, and tells me I&#x27;m not logged in or I should use my developer token. I&#x27;m not sure why reddit has started to do this, but does it have something to do a desire to monetize it it more, and may even have something to do with AI. It seems reddit has also signed some exclusive deal with Google allowing only Google to index it.
 
The way Reddit know handles blocking by other users. Sometime ago I began to notice that so many responses had some error like deleted and unavailable. Something I remarked on in this thread - Why do some reddit users especially on r/emacs keep messing up threads their involved by deleting their posts or making them unavailable? I don&#x27;t see why some people should disrupt a technical discussion by blocking some participants who can&#x27;t see what is going. It is not as though this Twitter or Facebook, this is simply a technical forum and the discussions don&#x27;t often veer into the political. What kind of mindset does it take to block someone because you don&#x27;t want them to read your views on technical issues, and it is not as though the person blocked cannot login using another account to see the thread?
 
 These two issues are making this forum less appealing. Perhaps I should use stackexchange more instead.

                              <span>Hello,
 I need to find the nth prime number. This is what I have so far:
 module Prime (nth) where nth :: Int -&gt; Maybe Integer nth n | n  Bool isPrime 2 &#x3D; True isPrime n | n  n &#x60;mod&#x60; x /&#x3D; 0)) [2..root] where root &#x3D; (floor . sqrt . fromIntegral) n 
 Some of the errors I get are (seems that both functions are wrong):
 Couldn&#x27;t match expected type ‘Integer’ with actual type ‘Int’ • In the expression: x In the first argument of ‘(!!)’, namely ‘[x | x  Bool Actual: [Int] -&gt; [Bool] • In the first argument of ‘all’, namely ‘(map (\ x -&gt; n &#x60;mod&#x60; x /&#x3D; 0))’Couldn&#x27;t match type ‘[Bool]’ with ‘Bool’ Expected: [Int] -&gt; Bool Actual: [Int] -&gt; [Bool] • In the first argument of ‘all’, namely ‘(map (\ x -&gt; n &#x60;mod&#x60; x /&#x3D; 0))’ 
 The second error is not really clear for me, I thought that all returns Bool (a -&gt; Bool) -&gt; [a] -&gt; Bool), why would it be [Bool]? Also, any hint for the first function? Thank you.
 EDIT:
 Correct solution:
 module Prime (nth) where nth :: Int -&gt; Maybe Integer nth n | n  Bool isPrime n &#x3D; null [x | x &lt;- [2..n-1], n &#x60;mod&#x60; x &#x3D;&#x3D; 0]

                              <span>Almost any resource I read recently says that GHCI should show &quot;Prelude&gt;&quot; as prompt after start. And the prompt should change e.g. to &quot;*Main&gt;&quot; after loading a .hs file.
 In my case GHCi only shows &quot;ghci&gt;&quot; as prompt. Has this changed recently or am I doing something wrong here?

 val foo1 &#x3D; bar[TypeA]() val foo2 &#x3D; bar[TypeB]() val foo3 &#x3D; bar[TypeC]() def bar[T:AContextBound](): String &#x3D; ??? 
 I wonder - is there way to write it as something like
 val fooList:List[String] &#x3D; forAllTypes( ???[TypeI] &#x3D;&gt; bar[TypeI]()) 
 I have not a clue how the function definition would even look like. It would only save few lines, but it got me fascinated if there is some deeper scala magic I&#x27;m not aware of yet.

 .catchAllCause(e &#x3D;&gt; ZIO.logError(e.toString) *&gt; ZIO.fail(e.toString)) 
 Is there a better way to do this without manually adding this to every line?

                              <span>I am trying to create an agenda that lists only todos associated with a particular person or list of people. I am attempting to use org-ql-defpred with org-ql-query, and because I do not quite have a handle on what I am doing yet (I am far from an elisp expert, but don&#x27;t mind stretching my boundaries), I am trying to stick pretty close to the Org QL Custom Predicates Tutorial for now.
 Something that works exactly as I want, but lacks the flexibility of the predicate-based approach, is the following (with org-super-agenda):
  (setq org-agenda-custom-commands &#x27;((&quot;A&quot; . &quot;Agendas&quot;) (&quot;Aj&quot; &quot;John&quot; ((org-ql-block &#x27;(tags &quot;#John&quot;) ((org-ql-block-header &quot;John&quot;)))))

 Successfully starts and connects to a local pylsp when editing a local file - but is unsuccessful in starting a remote pylsp when TRAMPing a remote file. Exits with error: (:message &quot;Connection state changed&quot; :change &quot;exited abnormally with code 127\n&quot;)
  
 Local machine is windows running putty - TRAMP connection /plink:server:/temp/test.py
 Remote machine is FreeBSD 13.2 running sshd and samba.
 
&quot;Local&quot; editing (and pylsp) via samba share works, but with pylsp running on the local windows machine and test.py on the remote samba share editing is slow and is not optimal.
  
Any suggestions on having option 3. work for both local and remote pylsp?

It would be nice to have the results and the shell commands joined in the output so that it looks exactly like a command and its output looks like in a terminal. I am not sure how to go about merging them in the latex output though and whether it should be done as pre- or post- processing. Any help figuring this out would be very appreciated. Thank you.
 In case anybody is interested, I did this using the org-9.8pre version with its new export features and used the following relevant code...

                              <span>Hey everyone,
 recently I&#x27;ve had some trouble with Doom Emacs crashing unexpectedly and I&#x27;ve been trying to troubleshoot today with research and chatgpt.
 I found on r/DoomEmacs a similar thread where an Arch user was experiencing the same thing while editing C++ files while mine was mostly happening when editing Rust files. I don&#x27;t have much to go on but my assumption was that when the rust-analyzer was working or Rust LSP was communicating it was causing it to panic and crash but this was just an assumption and I was having trouble getting much out of --debug-init. This user was able to downgrade to version 29.3 and it solved their problems.
 Recently I&#x27;ve completely uninstalled rust, emacs and doom emacs and found wayland-emacs on the aur which I didn&#x27;t notice last time. I&#x27;ve reinstalled Rust and now I&#x27;m going to attempt to install this AUR package and go from there. Another issue I was having was opening Fish shell in Doom Emacs with Term which wasn&#x27;t an issue before until installing Rust.
 It&#x27;s also important to note that I&#x27;ve had this Arch + Hyprland install for about 2 weeks and Doom Emacs hasn&#x27;t given any issues what so ever until installing rust and rust-analyzer but also I upgraded around the same time and I know there was an upgrade 2 days ago. Thanks for reading, I wanted to try and be thorough so I apologize for the length of this.
 P.S The user on Arch I was talking about with a similar issue was using X11
 EDIT: solved, I use the pacaman package manager to uninstall emacs-wayland and installed emacs instead. So far rust hasn&#x27;t crashed when editing or coding rs files in doom and rust-analayzer is working. Must install with rustup component add rust-analyzer though, not your package manager. and using vterm this time with no issues.. yet ;)

                              <span>As is well known, evil automatically copies deleted text to the register. If you want to replace a piece of text without writing the deleted text to the register (in other words, you only want to delete the text, not cut it), so that you can continuously replace a piece of text in multiple places. If you don&#x27;t want to use any plugins and want to solve this directly through vim commands, the method is to first select the text and then enter the command &quot;ay, which copies this text to the a register. Then, for the text you want to replace, first select it and then enter &quot;ap, which replaces the selected text with the text in register a.

                              <span>Greetings note wizards! I run my own little branding &amp; design agency, and when I decided to start writing blog posts I found myself falling down rabbit holes of psychology, Jung, archetypes, consciousness, and on. I realized that I needed a better way to hold on to and integrate all the new ideas I was finding — which led me to a new rabbit hole of Zettelkasten and trying to understand the philosophies and processes behind it.
Many of my web searches would lead me to thoughtful discussions on this forum, so I thought I&#x27;d tag along and try to absorb your collective knowledge!
I&#x27;d already been using Obsidian, but I recently started a new vault so I could use it more correcter.</span>

The core applies the importance of purity in modernity to historic buildings. The purpose is to explore the topic for a possible journal article. I suppose my question (leaving content aside) is what you would do next.

                              <span>Yet another wasm question!
 I&#x27;m trying to compile a cabal project using the ghc-wasm-meta 9.8 compiler, but I&#x27;m getting the following error:
 wasm-ld: error: unable to find library -lHSrts-1.0.2_thr 
 my cabal.project and each name.cabal have the following ghc-options:
 program options/library ghc-options: -no-hs-main -optl-mexec-model&#x3D;reactor &quot;-optl-Wl&quot; 
 something I noticed is that if I run build using --verbose , the call to wasm32-wasi-ghc doesn&#x27;t have any of the ghc-options I&#x27;ve set. Maybe it&#x27;s got something to do with the &#x60;Setup.hs&#x60;? but that file just has the usual:
 import Distribution.Simple main &#x3D; defaultMain 
 Anybody got an idea of what might be happening?

                              <span>For years (I use AoC as way to get familiar with new languages I add to my trophy collection), I&#x27;ve been used to that naive solutions for AoC2015/4 (iterate over numbers, conver to string, concatenate with prefix, hash, convert to hex, check n zero prefix, repeat) take &#x27;too long&#x27;.
 The first optimization was to figure out how to pre-hash the prefix (in some languages/libs, copying the state is not as straightforward as calling a method).
 Second was not converting a number to string, but incrementing a byte array (or mutable string) representation of the number.
 The last is to re-use a buffer for the resulting hash, ideally not converted to hex, and to directly check the first few bytes (and perhaps 4 bits) to be zero.
 Usually, all this got me a speed-up of at least 10x.
 What totally shocked me was that the naive implementation finished in less then five seconds (I expected roughly a minute), and that further optimizations got it down only to under three seconds.

                              <span>Hi there,
 I&#x27;d like to invite all of you to another episode of the Scala Space Podcast. Today my guests will be:
  
Matthieu Baechler, french Scala engineer and freelancer who worked on the migration of rudder.io software
 Łukasz Krenski, polish Scala engineer working at MeWe, responsible for migration of their stack to Scala 3
  
Our topics will include the difficult parts of the migration, the ways to deal with them, what to pay attention to when migrating to Scala 3 and finally - whether it&#x27;s worth it!
 The podcast will be happening, as usual, live on Twitch and Scala Space Youtube channel today at 14:00 CEST so feel free to join the chat and ask questions. Links:

                              <span>I&#x27;m new to Scala. I&#x27;m writing some performance-sensitive code for processing objects on several axes. My actual code is more complicated and handles more axes, but it&#x27;s structured like this:
 class Processor: xData: Data yData: Data zData: Data def process(axis: Axis) &#x3D; axis match case X &#x3D;&gt; doStuff(xData) case Y &#x3D;&gt; doStuff(yData) case Z &#x3D;&gt; doStuff(zData) 
 But it is a bit repetitive, and it&#x27;s easy to make a typo and use the wrong data object. Ideally, I&#x27;d like to write something like this
 class Processor: data: HashMap[Axis, Data] def process(axis: Axis) &#x3D; doStuff(data(axis)) 
 Unfortunately, this code has different performance and correctness characteristics:
  
It&#x27;s possible for me to forget to initialize Data for some of the axes. In a language like TypeScript I could type the field as Record, which would check at compile time that keys for all axes are initialized. But I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s possible in Scala.
 Accessing the map requires some hashing and dispatching. However fast they may be, my code runs millions of times per second, so I want to avoid this and really get the same performance as accessing the field directly.
  
Is it possible to do something like this in Scala?
 Thanks!

I didn&#x27;t realize Boon wasn&#x27;t visual like Meow and Kakoune, otherwise I wouldn&#x27;t have created this post. Boon pays attention to ergonomics though, which according to this, isn&#x27;t something that any of the example Meow layouts do. I guess I&#x27;ll try to create an ergonomic layout for Meow in the future.

                              <span>This was useful for a few people I work with, so I&#x27;m posting it here for posterity. My job involves switching computers pretty frequently, and so I have everything set up with use-package&#x27;s :ensure keyword so I can just clone my init.el to a new machine, and Emacs will download all my packages automatically. In general, this works great; the exception is org. 
 Any kind of :ensure form doesn&#x27;t work with installing the latest revision of org (afaik), because the pre-installed version shadows it; use-package uses package-installed-p to decide if a package isn&#x27;t installed and needs to be downloaded, and since org is always installed, no download will ever trigger.

                              <span>So someone at my company years ago decided it was a good idea to create a company internal package format, say &quot;yuppie&quot; for yunified package. And that can randomly be tgz or zip archives. Don&#x27;t ask.
 Now I need some &#x27;yuppie-mode&#x27; function that dispatches to either archive-mode or jka-compr and then tar-mode.
 Any ideas? suggestions how to solve this?
 currently I&#x27;m creating symlinks from file --mime-type output and then open the file, but that is a hack, not a solution :-/

                              <span>I have been scratching my head for a while now about how to handle task dependencies in Orgmode.
 First off, I am aware of &#x60;org-depend&#x60; and &#x60;org-edna&#x60; as well as the &#x60;ORDERED&#x60; property. I am trying to find a way to make them work for a common, but specific type of dependency.
 Task Dependencies
 As defined in this [blog page][1] from the &#x27;projectmanager.com&#x27; website, a Gantt chart will define 4 types of dependency. I find two of them essential in my task management workflow.
 Finish to finish
 The first one, and most commn I think, is the **finish-to-finish dependency** which is the one I believe is covered by org-mode; this is also the easiest to enforce (again imho) programatically with orgmode tools. Task A cannot be marked as &#x60;DONE&#x60; before task B and C are.
 It is what &#x60;org-enforce-tod…</span>

 what I would like to have is something like this:
 (evil-global-set-key &#x27;normal (kbd &quot;C-bC-b&quot;) &#x27;my-func)
 Is that possible? If so how? I&#x27;ve noticed that  would trigger my-func after the first C-b, and if I change the third prefix to something else the issue persists. I&#x27;d like to have it triggered after the second C-b.

 I use emacs 29.4 and mostly I use it for C, C++, LaTeX and planing use it for clojure, haskell and common-lisp. For first two I use clangd-lsp with next emacs packages:
  
lsp-mode
 lsp-ui
 company-mode
 flycheck 
  
As you understand above, I use only company for autocomplete. I want to provide in my emacs yasnippet, mostly because of latex. But for some reason, firstly, it wasn&#x27;t working with company-mode: in company-autocomplete-box i didn&#x27;t have any of my snippets, but autocomplete by keybinding, which I provide in yasnippet config part, have been working. It was in all modes which I using. I research all internet, and just find config in this discussion, which really help me. And all is working fine in c-mode and c++-mode, but not for latex.

                              <span>Whenever I build a new version of Emacs from source, I generate PDFs from the texinfo files located in the source repository&#x27;s doc directory to have up-to-date documentation that I can easily read from tablet or smartphone. I find it more convenient than the HTML versions.
 This is done by running make pdf.
 However, these PDFs don&#x27;t have hyperlinks or clickable TOC.
 Only the major manuals released here, like the GNU Emacs Manual, the GNU Emacs Lisp Reference Manual and An Introduction to Programming in Emacs Lisp seem to offer that functionality.
 Any idea how to get it done for all the other manuals?
 EDIT:
 Problem solved. I overlooked that the hyperlinks work fine. They&#x27;re just not highlighted.

 I previous displayed a file buffer in this window, then I switched to another tab-bar, when I come back I see this.
 Why? What&#x27;s this, How to prevent it. Is there some variable or function can control related behavior?

                              <span>During the closing of bug#71801 a Windows build was uploaded to the GNU FTP which was shipped with libgccjit-0.dll. If that DLL is present, then Emacs will try to native compile the 3rd party packages. If it fails to do so then it will throw an error, and it will stop loading the 3rd party packages. One user complained on the mailing list about this, and a new release was uploaded to the GNU FTP without this DLL.
 The issue is that the Windows package managers already downloaded and hashed the build with libgccjit-0.dll the first time it was uploaded. Winget had a hash mismatch, but should be fixed since then. Chocolatey does not know about the new file, and it will download the build with libgccjit-0.dll in it.

Laggy UI ( is the biggest thing)

                              <span>This post is just a love note on org-mode and it&#x27;s wonderful developers and community.
 I started a business a couple of months ago, and using a spreadsheet as a crm + sales pipeline wasn&#x27;t very satisfactory. I needed a CRM system that can basically do the following:
  
Maintain a list of companies and the contacts in each of them
 Maintain a list of ongoing leads and opportunities, and qualify each one as the deal state changes
 Keep email communications for each opportunity attached to the lead and the company / contact
 Maintain a list of upcoming tasks related to each opportunity
  
I looked into a few CRMs and found most to be quite expensive. I didn&#x27;t want to spend on yet another subscription this early in the business. Some free ones like Hubspot that are too complex for my needs. S…</span>

                              <span>So I&#x27;ve been diving into the world of algebraic effects systems as an alternative to mtl-style classes for granular effect tracking. One thing I haven&#x27;t quite figured out yet is how to handle errors in the middle of a computation that uses a custom effect type. For example, let&#x27;s say I have an effect for talking to the database:
  data DB :: Effect where DBWrite :: Item -&gt; DB m () DBRead :: Key -&gt; DB m (Maybe Item) 
 and types for errors and the database environment
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; data DBError &#x3D; DeadLockError | ConnectionError
 data DBEnv &#x3D; DBEnv Connection &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 and let&#x27;s say I have the interpreter:
  runDBIO :: (IOE :&gt; es, Error DBError :&gt; es) &#x3D;&gt; DBEnv -&gt; Eff (DB : es) a -&gt; Eff es a runDBIO env &#x3D; interpret \_ -&gt; \case ... do handling here ... 
 Now the recommended way to instrument all of this is to wire up all of your effect handlers at the start of your program:
  main &#x3D; do env  ... do something ... Right -&gt; ... do something ... 
 This all makes sense. But what if I want to handle the error at a deeper level in the program and not at the very top level? The Error DBError effect doesn&#x27;t manifest in the type list until the runDBIO interpreter is applied. For example,
  tryWriteDBOrSendEmailPage :: Item -&gt; Eff [Email, DB] () tryWriteDBOrSendEmailPage item &#x3D; do catchError (dbWrite item) $ \_ e -&gt; emailPage $ &quot;Something went wrong: &quot; ++ (show e) return () 
 This doesn&#x27;t work here because the type signature doesn&#x27;t contain Error DBError, but the underlying implementation of DB uses it. If I add Error DBError to the effect list, wouldn&#x27;t that be a totally separate effect from DB, so it wouldn&#x27;t be able to throw and catch in the same context? Should I manually expose effects for TryDBWrite and TryDBRead that return an Either? Not exactly sure what to do here.

I think that data Expr &#x3D; Const a has type * and data Expr a &#x3D; Const a has type * -&gt; *, but I don‘t understand the deeper meaning behind it. Is it just to show how many datatype-parameters a datatype has? Please help, as you might imagine I don‘t have a lot of time 😅

 I am trying to learn Slick in Play,
 I was making a toy application, But I am not getting code generation support while writing queries in Slick,
 For details, I am using metals in VS code, Intellij is working better but takes up whole resources in WSL 10 gigs
 My code is something like this
 @Singleton class SessionStoreDao @Inject()(protected val dbConfigProvider: DatabaseConfigProvider)(implicit executionContext: ExecutionContext) { val dbConfig &#x3D; dbConfigProvider.get[PostgresProfile] import dbConfig._ import profile.api._ val sessionStore &#x3D; TableQuery[SessionStore] } 
 for an example: when I type
 sessionStore dot it doesn&#x27;t show available methods, I need it as I am new to slick
 I am clueless why is it so? I tried searching everything.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve worked on many systems built with all sorts of languages from Python and Scala, at the end of the day, they kinda of have the same level of bugs in production. Given that to release something to production we write lots of tests, these tests catch the problems, hopefully, before they hit production. What is your experience with that? My main concern behind this question is if it&#x27;s worth to pursue a more strict style of Scala with FP given the complexity and time to onboard new hires.

                              <span>Hi Everyone l,
 I have a somewhat weird scenario. I have been invited for a code review interview round with a company that works primarily on scala and a bit on Java. I am a Java resource and have never worked on scala before but they have told me that they are okay to hire people with Java knowledge as they have a pretty decent upskilling plan. However the code review is on a scala code. My question is as a senior Java dev how can I deal with this. I was thinking I will brush up on a few core concepts of functional programming and monads. Anything else you guys suggest. The recruiter said that they ofcourse know that I have never worked on scala so I will be judged accordingly but I am sure there will still be some stuff that I can do.

                              <span>SOLVED: eshell-highlight-prompt being set to nil caused the behavior. Setting to true fixes the issue, which makes me wonder why the setting is used in the repository at all.
 I am excited to start using Eshell after reading about it on Mastering Emacs. Since I wasn&#x27;t happy with default prompt, I installed the eshell-prompt-extras package like the article recommended. However, if I continue pressing backspace, my prompt and previous shell output can be deleted, which is not the correct behavior.
 I understand eshell-prompt-regexp has to match the prompt and I think it does because C-a takes me to the correct place after the prompt. Since Eshell doesn&#x27;t use comint-mode, I don&#x27;t know of a function to make the prompt read-only. Is there any way to achieve the desired behavior?
 My Eshell prompt customization settings are copied and pasted from https://github.com/zwild/eshell-prompt-extras:
 (with-eval-after-load &quot;esh-opt&quot; (autoload &#x27;epe-theme-lambda &quot;eshell-prompt-extras&quot;) (setq eshell-highlight-prompt nil eshell-prompt-function &#x27;epe-theme-lambda))

                              <span>I recently started playing around with stuff to figure out how loading libraries/autoloading works (so this isn&#x27;t for any practical purpose, just didactic), and I&#x27;m at the end of my rope trying to figure out where some documentation is coming from. For some reason, no matter what source files I change, inspecting autoloads with symbol-function returns documentation that seemingly isn&#x27;t on my system anymore.
 Here&#x27;s the setup: start emacs with emacs -Q, and then immediately run:
 (setq help-enable-completion-autoload nil help-enable-autoload nil) 
 If you do C-h f org-agenda, you get the documentation for org-agenda, but if you then inspect C-h v load-history, you can see that nothing org-related has been loaded yet. Evaluating (symbol-function &#x27;org-agenda) reveals how the documentation can…</span>

                              <span>Given a frame with various windows in it, I want to be able to write text into them without them being associated with a file, and I don&#x27;t want to spam buffers into the buffer list. I was thinking that having a single &quot;log buffer&quot; into which the messages would be written would prevent buffer spamming, and then I could just show the operator a different particular message in each window. Playing around with different things, trying to use indirect buffers with some sort of region narrowing seemed to be a good possible option.
 I didn&#x27;t have much luck with this though:
  (let ((org-dates (list &quot;2020-04-05&quot; &quot;2023-08-02&quot; &quot;2021-09-08&quot; &quot;2019-08-04&quot;))) (delete-other-windows) (split-window-right) (split-window-right) (split-window-right) (balance-windows) (dolist (earlier-journal-entry org-dates) (pop-to-buffer (make-indirect-buffer (get-buffer-create &quot;*Org Roam Daily Reflection Log*&quot;) (generate-new-buffer-name &quot;*indirect*&quot;))) (let* ((start (point)) (org-msg (concat &quot;\n\n* No daily journal entry for &quot; earlier-journal-entry &quot;.&quot;))) (insert org-msg) ;; (org-mode) (narrow-to-region start (point))))) 
 In particular, the narrowing doesn&#x27;t seem to work right. How should I be doing narrowing?
 (If this is at all the right sort of approach to this task.)

Scala is at 2.6% of all respondents, slightly down from 2.77% last year. Among respondents who are professional developers it&#x27;s 2.9%, down from 3.21% last year. Among those still learning to code it&#x27;s 1.7%, way up from 0.77% last year.
 If I had to put some flavor on these numbers I&#x27;d say Scala is still at the top of the long tail of languages. It comes in about 20th among programming languages (ie. I ignored SQL, HTML, bash, etc.) so certainly still relevant. Movement from last year is negligible except for new developers, which is very cool.

How does scala fare in that department?
 Thanks in advance for your response.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve had ‘A System for Writing’, the new book by Bob Doto, on my desk since yesterday.
Before I read a new book, I&#x27;m interested in how it relates to the books I&#x27;ve read so far. To get an initial overview, I simply create a new Reference Note for the book in my Zettelkasten. It consists of a brief description of the book and a few references to existing notes.
When I quickly look through the bibliography, I find these references. They are links to books that I have already read or to books that are on my reading list. These are simply added to link the Reference Note. The graphical overview is generated automatically by the Zettelkasten tool.

The resulting literature map helps to provide an initial overview. By adding a few details, the map becomes somewhat easier to read as a concept map.

The concept map will be refined further. Quotations and ideas from the existing &#x27;Reference Notes&#x27; make the &#x27;Bibliographic Map&#x27; easier to read. It now offers a good overview that facilitates the overall understanding of this bibliographic network.

My learning: The notes in my Zettelkasten benefit from being reduced in size (digital: 500 words or analogue: 5x7&quot; paper size). One note, one idea. But all the connections of my networked notes remain invisible. They are represented by simple hyperlinks on each note. Understanding context means having visibility of these networks. Using Concept Maps with an infinite canvas size is a great help.
Here is another example of extending the &quot;paper size&quot; to create a visual outline: Victor Margolin&#x27;s zettelkasten process for note taking and writing

 https://hackage.haskell.org/package/htmx
 This is roughly based on &#x60;lucid-htmx&#x60;, but is different enough that I think it can be considered stand alone and not a fork. Notable differences:
  
Not using the old &#x60;data&#x60; based tags
 New type-safe interfaces for various htmx enumerations
 Module structure tries to follow some htmx concepts (like core and extra attributes)
 Significant documentation
 Additional attributes that didn&#x27;t exist in &#x60;lucid-htmx&#x60;
  
I am going to try and stay active on the issue tracker, and keep this package up to date with new GHC indexes. Hope this is useful to some of you.

                              <span>I use vim &amp;&amp; ormolu + stylish-haskell in basic configuration.
 More or less satisfied so far, but may be there are some tips i just don&#x27;t know about.
 What i really want is ability to verically align &quot;::&quot; and &quot;&#x3D;&quot; on function declaration, like in snippet below (dots mean spaces). Or at least vertically align on &quot;&#x3D;&quot;
 func .......:: Int -&gt; Int -&gt; Int
 func 1 y ....&#x3D; 10 + y
 func 100 yyy &#x3D; 1000 + yyy
 funv _ _ ....&#x3D; -1

 Using ghc 9.6.6
 I create a newtype and then I derive Show and Read instances of it using deriving new type and then I do read of the value, it is always throwing Exception: Prelude.read no parse
 ghci&gt; :set -XDerivingStrategies
 ghci&gt;
 ghci&gt;
 ghci&gt; newtype Bucket &#x3D; Bucket String deriving newtype (Show, Read)
 ghci&gt;

                              <span>Dear all,
 How can I use orgmode to get citations in the form
 Smith, Wu, …, Miller (2023) Nature
 i.e. First Author, Second Author, ..., Last Author (year) Journal
 (This is my preferred form to cite things in presentations in life science field.)
 I am having a hard time reading the corresponding section in the manual trying to extract the necessary information.
 Ideally, I could dynamically decide on how many authors to cite &#x27;at each end&#x27;.
 Any solution using CSL or biblatex as drivers would be highly appreciated!

                              <span>In my notes collection I use org-publish to create a nice personal website out of org-roam files. I have an index file that programmatically lists posts in categories, with tags, or in alphabetical indices. I do this via macros that expand into dynamic blocks and run all dynamic blocks during export via a source block near the bottom of the page.
 It&#x27;s slow. Real slow. I do all the post link lookups using org-roam, so I assume that&#x27;s just sqlite db queries. Then I use very minimal org syntax to turn it into links.
 I realised recently that I could probably do the same thing via exported source code block results, since I only need all this stuff during export.
 Is there a noticeable performance difference between org-babel exporting the results of some Lisp code, and that same Lisp code being used via dynamic blocks?

                              <span>I want to rebind &#x27;q&#x27; (normal-state) in org-agenda. The actual keybind that is finally applied seems to be defined by evil-org-agenda minor mode (how do I tell?).
 I tried:
 (map!
 :mode org-agenda-mode
 :map general-override-mode-map
 :n
 &quot;q&quot; &#x27;org-agenda-exit)
 The idea being &quot;:mode org-agenda-mode&quot; will make sure that the keybind is set only in that mode and &quot;map general-override-mode-map&quot; should override any possible high priority keymap.
 This does not work.

                              <span>I have tried doing
 (setq-default indent-tabs-mode t)
 (setq-default tab-width 4)
 (defvaralias &#x27;c-basic-offset &#x27;tab-width)
 (setq ruby-indent-tabs-mode t)
 (defvaralias &#x27;ruby-indent-level &#x27;tab-width)
 (defvaralias &#x27;sgml-basic-offset &#x27;tab-width)
 But it doesn&#x27;t work. This leads to tabs just being composed of 4 spaces, not one tab. Similar to the neovim editor, I want tabs to be just tabs. One large block, instead of being packed with several tiny spaces. I need this for indentation. Relying on tabs to be just full of spaces is impossible for me. Can anyone help. I have tried several solutions, but they all are just solutions which means tabs will be filled with &#x27;x&#x27; no of spaces. not tabs with TABS. I am new to Emacs, and I have heard this whole tab business is not very straightforward. So please do explain if I got something wrong
 EDIT - I got the solution from this kind soul on stackoverflow https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6471803/making-emacs-tabs-behave-exactly-like-vims
 (eval-after-load &quot;cc-mode&quot; &#x27;(define-key c-mode-map (kbd &quot;TAB&quot;) &#x27;self-insert-command)) (global-set-key (kbd &quot;DEL&quot;) &#x27;backward-delete-char) (setq c-backspace-function &#x27;backward-delete-char) 
 This treats tabs as one large tab. You can have the same control as neovim. It also deletes the entire tabs via the single backspace. I am not sure if this is gonna work with javascript. But I hope this post will help others
 This is all I have put in my init.el file related to tabs
 (setq-default indent-tabs-mode t) (setq-default tab-width 4) (defvaralias &#x27;c-basic-offset &#x27;tab-width) (setq ruby-indent-tabs-mode t) (defvaralias &#x27;ruby-indent-level &#x27;tab-width) (defvaralias &#x27;sgml-basic-offset &#x27;tab-width) (eval-after-load &quot;cc-mode&quot; &#x27;(define-key c-mode-map (kbd &quot;TAB&quot;) &#x27;self-insert-command)) (global-set-key (kbd &quot;DEL&quot;) &#x27;backward-delete-char) (setq c-backspace-function &#x27;backward-delete-char)

                              <span>I&#x27;m referring to this manual -- not The GNU C Library Reference Manual, which does have an Info version. I&#x27;m guessing there are better, more up-to-date documents out there, but I just want to read this at the moment. I&#x27;m sure I can convert it manually, but just want to check that it isn&#x27;t listed as something odd in the existing set of Info pages.

                              <span>Hello.
 During upgrade to scala 3, a code involving reads/writes to json, raises a &quot;Ambiguous given instances&quot; error which I&#x27;m not sure how to solve.
 It only happens when trying to serialize a Seq of a type, not the type itself.
 Here&#x27;s a Scastie to demonstrate:

 any guidance appreciated

                              <span>Me again! after removing some libraries, my project now depends on:
  
containers
 mtl
 transformers
 singletons
 singletons-base
 parsec
  
Nevertheless, since I&#x27;m using ghc-wasm-meta, I cannot really include the singletons-base package (since it depends on th-orphans and the WASM backend doesn&#x27;t support TH yet).
 I might be able to patch things up, if I can just expand the TH definitions in the singletons-base package, but I don&#x27;t really know how to do this without just forking the repo, running cabal build with -ddump-splices -ddump-to-file flags, and manually deleting the _XXXX identifiers.
 Is there a better way to do this?

If I stage through the command line and try to commit, *Messages* displays &quot;condition-case: Wrong number of arguments: transient--emergency-exit, 1&quot; and nothing happens in Magit.
 How do I start debugging this one?

                              <span>Quick question, before I dive head first into tree sitter land.
 I have a 2400loc file which is super laggy
 Turning off font locking removes my performance issues, so I know it&#x27;s an issue of font locking
 Is switching to tree-sitter likely to fix my perf issues?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve seen some pretty and complex large code bases written in C++ for image manipulation and color space conversions and to the untrained eye they look like having a set of unrelated bunch of source code with same functionality spread between different files, but usually it makes sense due to the chosen of a complex architecture fitting to critical processing and low level access. It can take months to understand what its being done and the process usually feels like trying to take some random file reading it, trying to look its dependencies back and forth until you finally make some sense out of those. Could this process be eased if every file was accompanied by some org file? And could a master org file tell &quot;Hey this is how you should begin reading the source code&quot;

                              <span>I am an beginner using Emacs and I am not a programmer, but I heard many times that Emacs is a &quot;Lisp Machine&quot; with everything build on top of it (text editor, mail client, tetris, etc). 
 Let&#x27;s say, will it be possible to do the same with another interpreter? Something like a Lua interpreter and build everything on top of it with pure Lua or a Java&#x27;s JVM and build something on top? Was this tried before?

                              <span>I have quite a few projects and meeting and i keep track of them by using columnview dynamic block to show them in the project (each meeting has a property which points to the project and :match searches for the property). Columview has an option to add Links (so i just need to click on it and see what has been discussed). But this link feature doesnt work if the item are in a different file. 
 So when capturing a meeting with org-capture i just created another property like:
 :LINK: [[file:~/org/meetings.org::*%\1][%\1]]
 which is essentially a link to itself, where %\1 is the Meeting Title and the org headline and add this Property to the columnview. That way i can click on it form a project and see what the meeting was about.
 Now the Problem: the headline might not be unique (e.g. weekly repeating meeting) and there for i thought it might be a better idea to use a custom_id for example. So i tried to use a capture template like this:
 * %^{Meeting}
 :PROPERTIES:
 :PROJECT:
 :ATTENDEE:
 :LINK: [[file:~/org/meetings.org::*%\1][%\1]
 :CUSTOM_ID: %-%(string-replace &quot; &quot; &quot;-&quot; &quot;%\\1&quot;)
 :LINK2: [[id:%-%(replace-regexp-in-string &quot;\s&quot; &quot;-&quot; &quot;%\\1&quot;)][%\1]]
 :ID: %(org-id-new)
 :END:
 I try to replace the whitespace in the headline as this would be no valid ID. But that doesnt work it gets evaluated but the whitespaces are not replaced. i could reuse :ID: aswell but dont know how in a capture template. Ideas??

 But in emacs, I have been trying with grep, rg, occur... I get text with uppercase letters... like &quot;Find or &quot;Cut... Since I have more than 2000 entries to possibly fix, I want to do it within emacs .
 How shall I proceed in emacs to have it work? Why isn&#x27;t it working like it should?
 thanks for your help

I want to use packages like https://github.com/dbordak/telephone-line or https://github.com/tarsius/moody . And they look ugly without solid color on modeline, is it possible to do this in emacs?

Inspired by @ZettelDistraction, I&#x27;ve developed my own Custom Note Critic GPT, which I&#x27;ll share if you are interested. He focuses more on the formatting of the note, and I&#x27;ve made mine a writing tutor, pointing out areas where I can be more concise and more engaging and explain my ideas with confidence and clarity.


@ZettelDistraction said,

  
I would like to see this. In the spirit of the Paris Olympics, we could have a &quot;GPT-off&quot; to compare GPT output, Zettel by Zettel.


Here ya go! There is no guarantee that once you see this, you won&#x27;t puke.

I&#x27;ll have to run the same note through both GPTs and compare the results. This could be a big project.</span>

                              <span>Greetings,
 I am trying to make use of the &quot;wuss&quot; secure websockets library, at https://hackage.haskell.org/package/wuss. This adds TLS to the underlying websockets library.
 I can build and install the library fine with GHC 9.8.2, and the sample client at https://github.com/tfausak/wuss also builds fine. However, when I go to run it, it fails as follows:
 dyld[44192]: missing symbol called
 In this case, 44192 is just the PID. I tried using otool to see if there is a missing dynamic library, but I believe this shows that there is no missing library as such. Most likely, the &quot;missing symbol&quot; means that the library that is used, doesn&#x27;t have something that is called. However, the error doesn&#x27;t specify the issue there.
 otool -L ./dist-newstyle/build/aarch64-osx/ghc-9.8.2/wussTest-0.1.0.0/x/wussTest/build/wussTest/wussTest
 ./dist-newstyle/build/aarch64-osx/ghc-9.8.2/wussTest-0.1.0.0/x/wussTest/build/wussTest/wussTest:
 /usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1345.100.2) /opt/local/lib/libz.1.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1.2.11) /opt/local/lib/libffi.8.dylib (compatibility version 10.0.0, current version 10.0.0) 
 Any thoughts on how to resolve?

                              <span>Dear Haskellers
 I&#x27;ve been struggling with a strictness/laziness issue in a recursive mini-language I&#x27;ve been trying to define. I&#x27;ll present a pruned version here to narrow the code to the focus of my issue. 
 I can encode my problem with 5 combinators:
 haskell data Recur t a &#x3D; Val a -- ^ A stored value | Hop t -- ^ A jump-to-binding statement | Seq [Recur t a] -- ^ A sequence of &#x27;Recur&#x27; statements | Opt [Recur t a] -- ^ A choice of &#x27;Recur&#x27; statements | Bnd t (Recur t a) (Recur t a) -- ^ An introduce-binding statement deriving Eq makeBaseFunctor &#x27;&#x27;Recur 
 Then I can define recursive sequences like this:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;haskell type R &#x3D; Recur Text Int
 x12, x34 :: R x12 &#x3D; Seq [Val 1, Val 2] x34 &#x3D; Seq [Val 3, Val 4]
 n1, n2, n3 :: R n1 &#x3D; Opt [x12, x34] n2 &#x3D; Seq [n1, n1] n3 &#x3D; Bnd &quot;x&quot; n1 (Seq [Hop &quot;x&quot;, H…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking for project ideas for a final assignment in a college course using a functional language. We primarily used Haskell, but we&#x27;re open to other functional languages if the project is interesting.
 The project should take around two weeks for two advanced software engineering students, so it should have some complexity (but not too much). Preferably it should use a monadic strategy to solve a problem.
 I&#x27;ve already built a compiler in a previous course, so I&#x27;d prefer not to go that route again. I was considering creating a SAT solver, but one of our teachers mentioned it involves a lot of state management, so I&#x27;m unsure if it&#x27;s the best fit.
 Any suggestions or advice would be greatly appreciated!

                              <span>Streamly is a concurrent stream and array library supporting a wide range of functionality.
 Important features in the new release include: (1) fast binary serialization to arrays with an option to serialize record field names; (2) the array type can now represent pinned as well unpinned memory, unifying the representations used by bytestring, text and vector; and (3) concurrency support for folds.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been working on a project, and I&#x27;ve recently hit a devops-ish kind of issue: after getting ghc-wasm through nix flakes, I&#x27;m trying to compile the project by: wasm32-wasi-cabal build WASM --flags&#x3D;&quot;wasm&quot;, but I get errors building happy and th-orphans.
 happy error:
  Configuring executable &#x27;happy&#x27; for happy-1.20.1.1... Preprocessing executable &#x27;happy&#x27; for happy-1.20.1.1...

 th-orphans error:

 : error: Couldn&#x27;t find a target code interpreter. Try with -fexternal-interpreter &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Regarding the happy error, although there is no unlit executable in that folder, there is one called wasm32-wasi-unlit, so I believe some sort of symlink can solve this, but I have no idea on how to include this in the flakes.nix file.
 Regarding the th-orphans error, I&#x27;m totally clueless.
 P.D: don&#x27;t mind too much about stack in the flakes, it&#x27;s there because I wanted to make sure that the other executable compiles normally.

                              <span>I&#x27;m finding the &#x60;._&#x60; import so confusing and this is heavily used by the Scala community. My main issue is, given that you have multiple &#x60;._&#x60; imports it&#x27;s difficult to reason about the origin of the thing you&#x27;re using or what is available to be used.
 For those that have been using Scala for a long time, this improves over time and do you have this same feeling?

                              <span>ok right out of the game i&#x27;m using doom emacs, aside from the org plugins that comes with it i&#x27;m using org-auto-tangle (not the case for this file) and org-modern. now onto the issue.
 I have a very long list, with many subnested lists (think of it as a tree), and as of now it&#x27;s currently 6000 ish elements.
 before you say why such a big list it&#x27;s stuff I want to buy, it&#x27;s a way to autocontrol..
 whenever I C-c C-c on anything, that be a checkbox or a counting box (the [/], idk the proper name), it takes a lot, like a good two minutes at least.
 i tried to profiling, and it seems taht org-element--list-struct in memory section is the biggest one, with match-data in cpu, but the latter it&#x27;s only a 6%. I can post the full profiling if it can help, but from my (poor) understanding of the profiling reoprt, these two are what takes longer. is there a way i can improve the performance? or do I have to split it down into smaller lists? i have such giant single list because I like to have at the top two boxes that one is the percentage and the other one is the counting one. if there is a way to divide the list into the various categories, maybe with *s, while keeping an overall &quot;completion&quot; on the top, that would solve the issue.
 tl;dr i have a giant list. can i improve the performance? I just chronometered it, and it clocked it at around five minutes. or, if I break it down to more smaller lists, is there a way I can keep track of the overall progress?

 Release notes:
  
The change in major version from 2.x to 3.1 marks the dropping of support for versions of GHC before 8.4, deprecated in Stack 2.15.1.
  
Changes since v2.15.7:
 Behavior changes:
  
Stack uses the version of the Cabal package that comes with the specified version of GHC. Stack no longer supports such Cabal versions before 2.2, which came with versions of GHC before 8.4. Consequently, the init command will not try LTS Haskell before 12.0.
 The init command initialises stack.yaml with a snapshot key rather than a resolver key.
 After installing GHC or another tool, Stack deletes the archive file which provided the tool.
 Remove hidden flag --skip-intermediate-deps, effectively deprecated since Stack 1…</span>

                              <span>Hi,
 I am struggling to find the relevant documentation to get emacs to work with debugpy remotely.
 I have an app locally in docker, debug server running inside the docker, exposing port for connection.
 It seems I need to set up an lsp-docker.yml file but I cannot find a single reference specific to debugpy (which is a relatively common debugger - it&#x27;s a ms product designed for vscode - I would change it to pdb but team project and not possible)
 Anyone has experience working with this?
 Thanks!

 But when hovering over .scalafmt.conf, the vscode hints with the message below, though sbt package doesn&#x27;t throw any error.
 Invalid config: Default dialect is deprecated; use explicit: [sbt0137,sbt1,scala211,scala212,scala212source3,scala213,scala213source3,scala3,scala3future] Also see https://scalameta.org/scalafmt/docs/configuration.html#scala-dialects&quot; 
 What is the right way to configure scalafmt, allowing the vscode to format my code automatically?
 My environment
  
Scala: 3.4.0
 Java: 21.0.4
 sbt: 1.9.8
 vscode: 1.91.1

                              <span>Hello folks, I am still continuing to work on my &#x60;elfeed&#x60; configuration working in Spacemacs. It is certainly coming along now :).
 One question I had was, how can I get the date to display on the search screen. There are a lot of images of the elfeed search screen that show the date listed. I have posted an image below. 
 Elfeed with date column
 However, when I run my elfeed search screen in Spacemacs, I don&#x27;t see the date listed.
 Elfeed without date column
 Is there a specific configuration variable that I need to change? I looked through the elfeed docs, but I did not find any references to this.

                              <span>So I have a pretty good working setup for completions, but there is one annoyance that I haven&#x27;t figured out how to change. I&#x27;m writing both python and rust, and my issue is that when I select a completion for a function name or class, it always puts opening and closing parenthesis after it, automatically. Meaning, I type:
 my_obj.beginning_of_metho
 and it (corfu) gives me the option:
 beginning_of_method
 I select it, and what it inserts is:
 my_obj.beginning_of_method(argname1, argname2)
 Which is right 80% of the time, and infuriating that 20% of the time that I needed to pass that bare function somewhere. Its more annoying with class names, it puts parens in when I&#x27;m just trying to make a type hint. 
 I&#x27;ve seen this behavior with rust-analyzer, jedi-language-server and pyright, so I don&#x27;t think its server specific, and I&#x27;ve seen it with lsp-mode and eglot so I don&#x27;t think its specific to those modes. I&#x27;m using corfu, but I haven&#x27;t figured out a switch in corfu to change this behavior.
 The ideal behavior in my opinion would be when I select the method name, it inserts just that:
 my_obj.beginning_of_method
 And then if I type an open paren
 my_obj.beginning_of_method(
 At that point it would insert the args with the closing paren.
 my_obj.beginning_of_method(argname1, argname2)
 Has anyone else figured out how to do this? I can&#x27;t be the only person annoyed by this behavior.

 Am I missing anything here? 
 Also side-note: I see these &quot;file missing&quot; errors also when using other modes. Wondering if there any variables I can set to make it default behavior everywhere. 
 Thanks in advance :)

                              <span>I know this may be the wrong place to ask… but let’s give a try. I have some complex objects in my code, by complex I mean that they describe “actions” and they have an impact, may have preconditions, and may have incompatibilities. All these elements are maps from the same set of keys to to integer values. And these values may be 0, 1… or max-1, max (where max is maximum value) They are now described in my Scala code, but would like to give some SME, non programmers, the ability to modify them. I must say that the I find the Scala code reasonably easy to read, but probably will be error prone. From a usability perspective do you have any experience on what would work better? - Teach some Scala (case classes mostly) - Build a DSL - Provide a GUI
 Thanks!

I am currently a senior backend engineer and got an offer for a lead software engineer where the company used Scala. Although the role and compensation is good I am thinking if it will be a wise move to Scala from Java in terms of future scope and opportunities. Can someone who have similar experience share some thoughts, it will be helpful

 However, there was no need to use the State monad. Just mconcating endomorphisms s -&gt; s is the appropriate way to solve the problem https://stackoverflow.com/a/3411461.
 Can someone suggest a toy programming puzzle where you actually need to use the computation result a in the State monad s -&gt; (s, a)

                              <span>Dear Zettlers,
I am finishing my processing of the third part on how to read the various genres of non-fiction.
It seems to me that this section should be retitled as &quot;Our basic view on the philosophy of XY (social science, history etc.)&quot; I can&#x27;t get anything out of the whole part.
Did you get something out of the third part?
Live long and prosper

 Some of the tabs are red some are don&#x27;t. What might be the problem here?

                              <span>Packages similar to the above allow one to edit the filesystem as a buffer, where each line in the buffer is a file or another directory. By editing each line and saving the buffer,files and directories are created.
 I enjoyed this variant the most in neovim: https://github.com/echasnovski/mini.nvim/blob/main/readmes/mini-files.md

                              <span>I am relatively new to using &#x60;elfeed&#x60;. I used it years ago, then I forgot about it for a while, and recently came back.
 So I was wondering about the current best way to filter the posts by tags, so that I can focus on specific groups of posts instead of the entire stream. I was looking at Mike Zemansky&#x27;s approach to filter the posts using a hydra and a macro. It looks pretty good, and I was working towards that. However, I realized that this approach was 7 years old. 
 Hence, I was wondering if there are any better or improved ways to filter posts today, that were not referenced in Mike Zemansky&#x27;s post? I believe in his code, emacs looks for all unique tags in the total feed, defines shortcut or hydra keys, and finally creates a hydra that the user can use to search for those posts. So it seems simple and nice. 
 But as I said, I was not sure if there was a package to do this now, or do I have to write that code myself in my &#x60;.spacemacs&#x60; file. Any suggestions are welcome.

                              <span>I frequently use magit refs buffer to switch between branches. However, for a large repository that I am currently using, switching between branches or refreshing the magit refs buffer takes a minute or more on a modern macbook, and emacs gets hung up for a long time. The output after magit-toggle-verbose-refresh shows the largest time consuming operation
 magit-insert-tags 50.73 
 I tried to disable it with
 (remove-hook &#x27;magit-status-sections-hook &#x27;magit-insert-tags) 
 in init.el however I get a completely blank magit refs buffer after that, and plus I don&#x27;t want to disable it for all repositories. I also tried including
 ((magit-status-mode . ((eval . (magit-disable-section-inserter &#x27;magit-insert-tags))))) ((magit-refs-mode . ((eval . (magit-disable-section-inserter &#x27;magit-insert-tags))))) 
 in the .dir-locals.el file but that didn&#x27;t have any effect.
 I am wondering how I could disable magit-insert-tags while also displaying the branches. I am inclined towards repository specific rather than an init.el solution.

 Typically, in java, I just add a breakpoint or at least add logs. I&#x27;m not sure how to do this in scala.

 I&#x27;m getting frustrated on what should be a simple task. I can&#x27;t figure out where the &#x60;query&#x60; and other functions are coming from after importing quill._

 This is the only datasource related configuration Ive seen from the documentation. How am I supposed to know what this means?

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to move away from using bespoke query building logic in a Haskell service at work. My impression from surveying some of the popular options (Beam, Persistent, Opaleye...) is that while they have tools to pull schemas and synchronize with your database, they still require you to manually declare types corresponding to tables. 
 This Haskell service is however one of many accessing the database and the schema changes somewhat frequently, so manually keeping types in sync isn&#x27;t ideal. In the parts of our codebase that are written in TypeScript we use libraries like prisma and prisma-kysely to generate type definitions and the experience has been pretty good. 
 Is there anything like this in the Haskell space? My hope is that I wouldn&#x27;t need to manually edit type definitions if someone else at the company adds a table or changes a column somewhere in the DB.

 Granted most mentions are 7 years old...
 Should I just go ahead and download it from source, or are there better resources that do the same?
 I want nice integration. Ideally something that also interacts with Hoogle,

 For example, let&#x27;s say I have a handle function:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;haskell longBackgroundIOStuff :: IO () ...
 handleSomething :: ActionM () handleSomething conn &#x3D; do my_param :: String  { longAsyncIOFunction(); res.redirect(&#x27;/&#x27;) }); 
 What would be the best way to accomplish this with Scotty? Thanks so much and sorry if this isn&#x27;t the best forum for these kinds of questions.

 I was wondering if it is possible to achieve the following:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; class C t where type D t transform :: t -&gt; D t -&gt; [D t]
 funGeneric :: (C t) &#x3D;&gt; t -&gt; D t -&gt; [D t] funGeneric t initial &#x3D; _ {-# NOINLINE funGeneric #-}
 funSpecialized :: (C t, Int ~ D t) &#x3D;&gt; t -&gt; Int -&gt; [Int] funSpecialized t initial &#x3D; _
 instance C () where type D () &#x3D; Int transform _ i &#x3D; _
 {-# RULES &quot;specialize\Int&quot; forall x y. funGeneric x y &#x3D; funSpecialized x y #-} &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 and then, for instance:
  someFun :: Int -&gt; IO () someFun initial &#x3D; print $ funGeneric () initial 
 where I&#x27;d expect funGeneric to be re-written to funSpecialized The rule itself type-checks, but no matter what I try, it never fires due to:
  
&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; Rule check &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; 
 Rule check results: 
 Expression: funGeneric
 ($ctransform &#x60;cast&#x60;  :: (() -&gt; D () -&gt; [D ()]) ~R# C ()) () (initial &#x60;cast&#x60;  :: Int ~R# D ())

                              <span>So I&#x27;m still studying at college but this being my last year I have a lot of free time to get real world experience. I can do a little of everything, I can code with SpringBoot, .NET, NodeJS or Django. Also React and Angular, and SQL databases. I already know Git too.
 If these skills are not enough I can still learn a lot by myself in my free time and catch up to your required skill set.
 If you are interested please send me a DM and let&#x27;s talk!

                              <span>Basically, I&#x27;ve stayed at my job for 6 years. In my country there were at some point max 3 - 4 companies using Scala, even not full time, and now it is even rarer. When I got my first interview for a international remote job I had about 1.5 years of Scala experience, but 4 years total experience. I went pretty far but didn&#x27;t get it because lack of experience. After that, I&#x27;ve had up to a dozen of these kinds of interviews, for a remote international team, but I never managed to get a job. Now finally I have found a new job but it is not a great project and not what I want.
 I am not the most enthusiastic person when it comes always being up to date and reading blogs and stuff and also for the past years, I have not been a person who got assigned to the more complex stuff in my company. Otherwise I have a pretty good basis for algorithms and coding challenges (although I failed the last one which was live coding using lots of Scala generics).
 Now, it seems to me that when recruiting for a remote team, especially for a senior position, the stands for a Scala developer are pretty high and the projects are not simple (relatively, like more distributed stuff).
 Does anyone have more insights how this compares to other languages. A lot of people that I know which I wold think were at my level as a developer or even sub, got remote jobs or jobs away from my country, and I am feeling stuck. I keep wondering if it would have been easier to find this kind of remote job if i stayed with C# or moved to Java, and not due to lack of opportunities in the Scala world....

                              <span>I&#x27;m coming from a lower level kind of languages and I&#x27;m wondering how using this an effect system can impact performance. For example, what is the performance impact of using a HTTP server in ZIO or Cats Effect instead of a plain Java one. It&#x27;s likely that Scala will be slower, that is the expected, but what I&#x27;m wondering is how slow.

                              <span>Hello.
 In Scala 2.13 we were using the TypeCase from Shapeless library to overcome type erasure in pattern matching. demonstration:
 private val &#x60;Seq[AlertEntity]&#x60; &#x3D; TypeCase[Seq[AlertEntity]] def onGetAlerts(arg: Any): Unit &#x3D; arg match { case &#x60;Seq[AlertEntity]&#x60;(alerts) &#x3D;&gt; () } 
 It was pretty convenient.
 Now upgrading to Scala 3 and checking if there a new canonical way to do it or if I should best stay with the current implementation.
 Saw TypeTest but wasn&#x27;t sure how to use it even for this simple example.

 Update...
 I ended up just overriding the function org-margin-mode-on by removing the piece that threw the error. Not sure if this is a particularly good idea, but everything seems fine for now.

 i need a way to tag org files for a specific topic and then be able to search my note folder for all files with that tag, and it will be bonus to list all tags used in that project

                              <span>I&#x27;m building a package where a lot of behaviour relies on the following pattern: there&#x27;s a global variable holding a list of objects. Each object has a :key slot, a :name slot and a :payload slot. When the user runs a command, the package presents this list to the user in a prompt, and the user selects one or more objects from it.
 I want to write a function which uses the transient interface to achieve this prompt-and-select functionality. So if we have something like:
 (cl-defstruct selectable key name object) (setq foo (make-selectable :key &quot;f&quot; :name &quot;Foo&quot; :payload 1)) (setq bar (make-selectable :key &quot;b&quot; :name &quot;Bar&quot; :payload 2)) (setq baz (make-selectable :key &quot;Z&quot; :name &quot;Baz&quot; :payload 3)) (setq selectable-list &#x60;(,foo ,bar ,baz))

                              <span>I&#x27;m using emacs to write Common Lisp code, and paredit doesn&#x27;t respect the syntax of read macros. So, for example, when I write #P or #C or any other dispatch read macro(like my lovely home-brew λ)and open parenthesis or double quotes, it will insert a space before inserting the pair, and I have to double back to erase it. It&#x27;s a really minor inconvenience, but I&#x27;m wondering if there&#x27;s already a good solution to this problem or if anyone would be interested in improvement to paredit to correct this.
 You can just disable the behavior by adding to your .emacs, or whenever after paredit is loaded, 
 (defun paredit-space-for-delimiter-p (endp delimiter) nil) 
 But obviously this is a bit of a hack, and though I might try this out for now because I haven&#x27;t ever noticed the space-adding behavior to be useful, I might find I&#x27;ll miss it when it&#x27;s gone, and want a more syntax aware paredit. 
 I noticed there&#x27;s also a paredit-space-for-delimiter-predicates variable which you could use(or just use to disable the behavior in a less hacky way), but I would need to somehow query slime/swank to to robustly find out what the active read macros are(and I don&#x27;t know how to do that at the moment), as well as actually parse them(which is messy but doable).

                              <span>Hi folks,
 This is a package (early WIP, but usable for now) that enables formatting code in buffers via text properties.
 Long story short, it allows you to use any formatting function/command (like format-all-buffer or apheleia-format-buffer) to visually format the code in the buffer without actually modifying it. This is acheived by changing the text properties of the code with the spaces taken from the formatted code.
 This can be useful when working in a team and the codebase is poorly formatted, or when you don&#x27;t like the coding style and you want to view the code in the style you like.
 This can be seen as an ~equivalent~ to Resharper&#x27;s Virtual Formatter, which I just heard about when I started working on this package, but never used it actually.
 The current implementation requires treesit, so you will need Emacs 29+ with Tree Sitter support.

Announcing ghciwatch 1.0 by Rebecca Turner
At Mercury, we’ve developed a file-watching recompiler for Haskell projects called ghciwatch, which loads a GHCi session (a Haskell REPL) and instructs it to reload or add modules when files in your project change.

                              <span>I think I&#x27;ve realized that I don&#x27;t like that my habits are bunched together at the bottom of my agenda&#x27;s day view. Since I give my habits specific time slots during a day (I&#x27;m trying to be consistent of WHEN I do my habits), it would be nice to have them show up in relation to the current time.
 So I&#x27;m considering just removing the habit style and just setting them up as recurring scheduled TODOs but I want to confirm there aren&#x27;t other beneficial features to keeping it as a habit that I might not be aware of.
 Thanks

                              <span>I&#x27;m using the completion feature of HLS provided by ghcide in VS code (I&#x27;m getting the same behavior on Mac and Windows).
 If I start typing, it gives me autocomplete options for all functions from any package it knows about -- awesome.
 But if I do
 import qualified Data.ByteString as B B.p 
 The B.p will give completion options for all functions starting with the letter p from any package, rather than only showing functions from Data.ByteString.
 Is this how it&#x27;s supposed to work? Are there any workarounds/customizations that will make it useable? There&#x27;s no point in autocomplete if I have to type out the whole function name to eliminate irrelevant functions.

I tried by downloading and installing the necessary eMacs packages from mobaxterm package list and then in the terminal when I’m trying to invoke eMacs or even emacs —version it say that I should use install emacs and is opening the moba text editor instead. And when I’m trying to install emacs (with the apt-get..command)…it says the package already exits. How can I rectify this issue ? Any help is highly appreciated

                              <span>I run many Elisp scripts on my org-node zettelkasten, which is 2000+ Org files. So I&#x27;ve had plenty of situations where I hit this old nugget:
  File mode specification error: (file-error Cannot open load file Too many open files debug) 
 Now I&#x27;m wondering why. I take care to kill the buffer on each iteration, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to matter. But! If I let a function process only 500 files, then finish, then run it again for the next 500 and so on, it works out. Is the call stack holding on to all file descriptors opened by children?
 Anyway, a problem I cannot solve: I have no insight into the org-publish codebase, and recently I found that the count of files I want to publish has exceeded 1024. So now I cannot publish. Has anyone worked around that? My publish code.
 Root of the issue 
 On Linux you might think the issue is ulimit -n which defaults to 1024 (on Debian at least), but it turns out that even if you increase that then Emacs will just die. The base problem sounds like a compiled-in FD_SETSIZE value of 1024.
 Last year it seems someone tried to patch it: https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2022-05/msg00115.html but this person says it just made Emacs unresponsive.

                              <span>I have just had this idea and I think it&#x27;d be pretty useful. Knowing emacs, there&#x27;s a good change that either it&#x27;s already a package or a snippet exists online. 
 The idea is this. After entering a command, say M-x compile , I decide that I want it to be easily repeatable. So I then invoke a hypothetical M-x bind-last-command-to and it prompts for a key, say I now press . Now that compile command is bound to .
 I guess this is kind of like macros, but you bind it after the fact. And it is for a single command (even if it only worked for the last M-x compile it&#x27;d still be useful).
 Anyone know if it exists before I start trying to implement it myself? Thanks.

 Would that be an acceptable email to send there or is there maybe somewhere else I can put the message out to?

                              <span>When I use M-. to go to definition (e.g. with ctags or eglot), often multiple options are shown if the declaration is a header file and source file, e.g.:
 src/foo.c 226:void foo(struct bar *bar) src/foo.h 1:void foo(struct bar *bar); 
 Are there any elisp magicians who know how to make it automatically prefer the C file in this case and jump to it directly without opening a buffer with the choices, and maybe also display a message &quot;both .c and .h files found; using the .c&quot; or similar?
 Or anyone could point me to the docs for this kind of thing, I&#x27;m a bit lost.
 Thanks!

                              <span>I’m trying to get a C# environment up and running in Doom Emacs that can replace Rider. 
 I’ve managed to setup lsp-mode with Omnisharp and enabled decompilation, so I am able to use “go to definition” on .NET system types and external class libraries that are referred to in my project as nuget packages. 
 However if I have a class A in an external nuget package, and let’s say it refers to another type in another nuget package or a .NET system type, then I can’t go to definition from within class A to these types. 
 Rider allows me to do this, but Omnisharp can’t and this is one of the most useful features I use in Rider when debugging or trying to understand the code, and is the one thing that prevents me from going full Emacs for my C# development. 
 Is this a limitation in Omnisharp or can somebody share how to set this up, so I can decompile also referenced code from within a referenced nuget package?

                              <span>Basically, i&#x27;m working on moving the final pieces to org note taking. Many people recommend using git for notes. And on the surface this makes sense. It&#x27;s easy to use, automatic history and off device. But how do you deal with Personal Information in your Notes? Some of it might not be particularly interesting, but when you start using Due Dates and make Tasks on where to go, or whome you interact with, this could be different. Maybe you take a reminder to pick up some medication specific to a Illness you have.
 This might be even more of a problem if you use Org notes at work. Certainly most companies wouldn&#x27;t want you to commit customer data to github/lab.
 So, how do you deal with this? So far the obvious thing is to keep Notes that are work related in their own folder and either not sync that or keep it on our own hosted gitlab instance.
 With personal notes this is a tougher call. I want them on two PCs and my phone. My experience with Syncthing over three devices in the past has been less than stelar. Any other recommendations that work reliably so i can finally leave google keep and todoist behind? (And yes, i know it&#x27;s a bit ironic to care about personal information in org files in a git repo, when it&#x27;s currently all on google and todoist servers. But i want to improve things ;) )
