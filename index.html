                              <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;m trying to incorporate launching emacs as emacsclient with the daemon running in the background. So far, I simply have an autostart script containing the line emacs --daemon &amp; and launch a frame with emacsclient -c -a &#x27;emacs&#x27;.
 I have an init.el and an early-init.el. I suspect it is the latter that is causing problems. The fonts are set in init.el.
 However, launching emacs this way results in a different font as compared to launching emacs with the daemon running. I&#x27;d really appreciate any help on this. Thanks!

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to set up MIT Scheme with Scmutils (mechanics.com band file) to work seamlessly with Org-Babel and Geiser in Emacs, but I&#x27;m running into issues. Here’s what I have so far:
 (use-package geiser :ensure t :config (setenv &quot;DISPLAY&quot; &quot;:0&quot;) (setq geiser-active-implementations &#x27;(mit)) (add-hook &#x27;geiser-repl-mode-hook &#x27;hn-disable-trailing-whitespace-and-empty-lines)) (use-package geiser-mit :ensure t :config (setenv &quot;MITSCHEME_HEAP_SIZE&quot; &quot;100000&quot;) (setenv &quot;MITSCHEME_LIBRARY_PATH&quot; &quot;/Users/harish/Applications/mit-scheme/lib/mit-scheme-svm1-64le-12.1&quot;) (setenv &quot;MITSCHEME_BAND&quot; &quot;mechanics.com&quot;) (setq geiser-mit-binary &quot;/Users/harish/Applications/mit-scheme/bin/mit-scheme&quot;)) (org-babel-do-load-languages &#x27;org-babel-load-languages &#x27;((scheme . t))) (defun hn-org-confirm-babel-evaluate (lang body) (not (string&#x3D; lang &quot;scheme&quot;))) (setq org-confirm-babel-evaluate #&#x27;hn-org-confirm-babel-evaluate) (defun hn-disable-trailing-whitespace-and-empty-lines () &quot;Disable showing trailing whitespace and indicating empty lines in the current buffer.&quot; (setq-local show-trailing-whitespace nil) (setq-local indicate-empty-lines nil)) 
 With this setup, I can start a Geiser REPL and it beautifully loads mit-scheme with Scmutils functions, including talking to X for graphics. But Org-Babel (whose docs claim that it relies on the Geiser REPL) seems to load vanilla mit-scheme and not Scmutils. I cannot get it to recognise D and other Scmutils functions when executing Scheme code blocks.
 What is the best way to ensure that the mechanics.com band file is properly loaded in Org-Babel sessions, just as it is in REPL? Any help to streamline this process would be greatly appreciated!

When no buffers associated with files are open, I&#x27;ve restarted emacs, how does it have this path to prompt me with?
 When I have two files open in 2 buffers, how can I get ediff to use those files/directories, instead of prompting for some weird path?

                              <span>Why doesn&#x27;t dired/find-file update the path list when switching projects?
 I had an old clojure project and then created a new one with the same project name at the same root path. 
 IMO, because the path and the name are the same dired/find-file after switch-to-project lists the old and new project file and directory paths together.
 Should not the old project paths be removed, because it is not valid anymore?

I know it is not enough to simply add :global t, but I am stuck on how to do the modification.

That doesn&#x27;t seem to work though.... any help is appreciated.
 Here is the function defined by the package:
 (define-minor-mode org-starless-mode &quot;Starless org-mode&quot; nil nil nil :require &#x27;org (let* ((keyword &#x60;((&quot;^\\(\\*+ \\)\\s-*\\S-&quot; ; Do not hide empty headings!

                              <span>Hey, I recently started using the NS version of emacs 30 (previously I was using emacs-mac). The experience was great for most of the time but sometimes I&#x27;d get terrible stuttering which I eventually diagnosed to fringe rendering.
 As it turns out, the NS redisplay draws fringes by converting the bitmap into a vector where each pixel is a square. Both the &#x27;copy&#x27; and &#x27;fill&#x27; methods of such an NSBezierPath are incredibly slow on my system (perhaps rasterising a path was cached at some point but now on ARM MacOS Sonoma it is not?), with 90% of the cpu time being spent inside -[NSBezierPath copyWithZone:].
 I&#x27;ve come up with a patch that changes fringes such that they&#x27;re drawn using masked CGImages, which completely eliminates this slowdown when drawing fringes. But I&#x27;m no expert on NS so this might not be the best solution: https://gist.github.com/simmsb/7998452560b10a4de645a3d7d2adee32

                              <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;m curious to know what the workflow of fellow emacsers is on this sub. Do you run just one frame of emacs (no emacsclient) and use that one frame to do your work, or do you run emacsclient to work on multiple frames?
 I find the one frame workflow to be more integrated into the idea of using emacs for most applications.

 I&#x27;ve tried to look up stuff on comparing the two so that I can decide on which to use but I just can&#x27;t seem to find anything. 
 Anything on how they compare and why one would use one over the other would be great to know. Or if one is just simply superior in every way that would be good to know too.

 Hi everyone!
 In case anyone is collecting the Topps stickers for the current Euro 2024 tournament, I have created a small program which keeps track of your duplicates and the ones you still need.
 Essentially, you add the stickers you&#x27;ve got in files/Got.txt and it generates a list with your duplicates (together with how many extra copies of each sticker you&#x27;ve got) and the ones you still need. See the readme file for more instructions.
 This should work as it is, although there is still some room for improvement. Most importantly, how to print proper umlauts instead of escape characters in the files and how not to surround strings with &quot;&quot;. If anyone knows the solution to this please chime in! :)
 I hope this would be of help to someone. It certainly is it me as I couldn&#x27;t find a similar app for this tournament.
 Happy swapping!

                              <span>Just deconstructing a tuple is making each iteration overhead to around microsecond. For 3-tuples or 4-tuples, it&#x27;s up to a few microseconds. Does this make any sense.. is this what you would expect? Modern laptop CPU compiled with -O2.
 For tight loops, I&#x27;m doomed to go back to pointer management (Ptr) and IORefs? (to simulate variables, just so i can get closer to C speeds)?

                              <span>Dear Haskellers,
 We are happy to announce that there is a new job opening for a Haskell developer at Chordify! We have had some success via this subreddit in the past, so the content of this post may ring a bell to some.
 Chordify is a music platform that you can use to automatically detect the chords in any song you like. This way we help musicians to play all of their favourite music in an easy and intuitive way. You can try it at https://chordify.net
 Now, the backend for our website and apps, that are used by millions of people worldwide, is written in Haskell! We serve the user using primarily Servant, Persistent and Esqueleto. We also make use of a custom Redis caching layer; you may know us from https://hackage.haskell.org/package/redis-schema
 We are looking for a new proactive, independent and creative functional programmer to improve the Chordify backend infrastructure, core technology, and launch new ideas to join our team of experienced developers in our offices in Utrecht or Groningen. You&#x27;d get the opportunity to work with advanced type systems to power a website that serves millions.
 More information (e.g. expectations, salary range, secondary benefits) and a form to apply can be found at https://jobs.chordify.net. If you have any questions, feel free to ask them in this thread, or reach out to me at [menno@chordify.net](mailto:menno@chordify.net) 
 We strive for diversity in our team, and encourage people of all backgrounds and genders to apply.
 For transparency: this is explicitly NOT a remote job. We do allow working from home, but expect our colleagues to be in the office at least 50% of their time.

                              <span>I&#x27;m relatively new to Haskell programming, so please don&#x27;t be too harsh if this is a silly question.
 There&#x27;s a particular behaviour I&#x27;m accustomed to in vscode with other languages that Haskell&#x27;s extension doesn&#x27;t seem to provide, and I&#x27;m curious if any solution is available.
 In most languages, when you type out a functions name and then type the opening bracket for the function call, you get a popup showing the function signature, as well as the name of each function parameter as you type.
 In Haskell, you only get the function signature popup when you&#x27;re typing the name of the function itself, so you have to memorize the order of the function parameters, then go about actually typing them out. Sometimes, when there&#x27;s an error over a function, you don&#x27;t even get the popup when you hover over the function name, meaning you have to go elsewhere and type out the function name to check the order of its arguments.
 Some of this annoyance seems to be down to a fundamental incompatibility between Haskell and vscode; vscode expects a C-style language, where function calls are characterized by brackets, so can&#x27;t understand function calls without brackets. It also obviously can&#x27;t give parameter names, since parameters in Haskell can have multiple names because of pattern matching.
 Is there any solution to this issue, or is it just an annoyance you have to deal with?

                              <span>Serokell and the Haskell Foundation are excited to announce a community-led Haskell Certification Program. Serokell has developed an online testing platform for administering practical and theoretical Haskell problems. Haskell is a complex language, offering a wide range of techniques and features for programmers. It’s simply not feasible for a novice or intermediate programmer to master them all. The goal of the Haskell certification is to help standardize what it means to ‘know Haskell’ at various levels of experience.
 As a community driven effort, we are soliciting self-nomination for volunteers to take part in the organization and decision-making around the certification process. These volunteers will help determine how the certification process evolves and which questions are relevant to the various experience levels of a Haskell programmer. Volunteers from organizations that use Haskell professionally are especially welcome.
 Please send your self-nomination to certification@haskell.foundation by the end of July 10th 2024.

                              <span>I have a couple questions, if people don&#x27;t mind me asking.
 1) Are there any cabal build flags that tell it to maximize runtime efficiency, or is the binary I get from just running cabal build as fast the program is going to get? I&#x27;m not looking for removing safety, just wondering if debugging support can be removed for a faster run time.
 2) Would someone mind telling me the latest guidance for making a static binary? I know this has been asked many times, but searching around online I see a lot of old advice, and I&#x27;m not sure what the most current guidance is.
 Thank you!

                              <span>I noticed today a new section in the offical website: https://orgmode.org/. It&#x27;s called &quot;Project heartbeat&quot; and it&#x27;s an eclectic collection of links, mailing list messages, feature requests, links to specific git commits, some specific packages, etc. 
 I don&#x27;t think it should be in the TOP page of the official landing page for orgmode, pushing down the introduction, features, quickstart links and actual code examples. It&#x27;s distracting and of interest to a smaller group than to justify the front facing real estate. It can be put in the &quot;Update&quot;s, &quot;Worg&quot;, &quot;Contribute&quot; sections, pick your choice.

                              <span>Think about how you probably use magit, especially the log, where you tend to visit commits alongside the history, with the log in one window and particular log items in another window. Magit has a lot of views and these views often list items that can be in turn viewed in multiple ways. This list &amp; item interaction model has a lot of good karma with respect to both architecture and user interaction.
 I&#x27;m mainly picking on &#x60;org-agenda-list&#x27;, but not using the full window width always has bad voodoo in Emacs. When I see complex agenda views with a lot of information to the right of the list of items, I think it&#x27;s neat, but I also think it should be left &amp; right window for those cases so that the functionality can be remixed and viewed in a mix &amp; match kind of way. This is one of the main reasons I&#x27;m not building on top of agenda.
 Another reason this works with magit is because of collapseable sections for showing details of items. Vertical organization can hold arbitrary amounts of detail while left-right organization in a single window, well, this isn&#x27;t a web browser. Organizing information left-right in sections and controlling reflow are likely to not obtain a good result.
 This is related to casually spiking more work on afterburner, only at the pace that I am getting value out for now.

                              <span>Just installed emacs 29.4 pure GTK from source.
 When I run
 emacs --daemon 
 It says:
  
Due to a limitation in GTK 3, Emacs built with PGTK will simply exit when a display connection is closed. The problem is especially difficult to fix, such that Emacs on Wayland with multiple displays is unlikely ever to be able to survive disconnects.
  
And emacs daemon also doesn&#x27;t run.
 These may be two separate issues - the emacs GUI disappearing and daemon not starting, but in regards to the first, on a laptop we can expect there to be network connections to continually connect/disconnect. 
 Is anyone using a pgtk build on a Windows laptop running WSL2?

                              <span>Running emacs-mac (--with-no-title-bars --with-xwidgets --with-imagemagick). 
 When I take a pic from my iPhone, send it to my computer, and try to view it in Emacs, it just shows as blank, both in dired as well as an org inline image. I can take a screenshot of the image and use org-download to paste THAT image successfully, but specifically a photo taken from my phone just doesn&#x27;t show up. (I&#x27;ve checked the &quot;most compatible&quot; setting on my phone, so it&#x27;s making JPEGs and not .HEIC or whatever. I tried .HEIC and they also don&#x27;t work.)
 Other .jpeg and .jpg files work, but specifically not ones from my iPhone. 
 Any ideas?

However, I don&#x27;t want them all to pop-up all-at-once on the same buffer when I load into Emacs. Is there a way to have these loud in the background?

 I have an org file with this content:
 * John Doe
 :PROPERTIES:
 :NAME: John
 :SURNAME: Doe
 :PLACE: Disneyland
 :GROUP: Fantasy
 * Jane Doe
 :PROPERTIES:
 :NAME: Jane
 :SURNAME: Doe
 :PLACE: Neverland
 :GROUP: Power
 And so on...
 What i would like is to display only the headlines (+content) with say :PLACE:&#x3D;Fantasy
 And hide the rest
 Now with C-c / i see only headlines marked with &gt; when the property matches and the other
 headlines + content are still there
 With M-g i can go to the next match but all i want is only headlines+content filtered
 and hide the rest
 Is this possible??
 thanks
 Ray

                              <span>Hi everybody, I started exploring this world 3 days ago. I want to manage my notes with org-roam and org-download.
 How can I make images adapt to the width of the window dynamically? Because if the image is too large, it gets cut off halfway (and Emacs crashes many times).
 If this is too hard, How you manage this workflow?
 Sorry for my silly question, but I feel a bit overwhelmed when searching for information with so little learning time. Thank you very much.

                              <span>This version polishes the first-order refinement methods introduced in v2.5.0 and many compile-time messages enhancements.
 What is Iron?
 Iron is a library for refined types in Scala. You can attach predicates (also called &quot;refinements&quot;) to types and ensure they pass at compile-time or runtime:
 val x: Int :| Positive &#x3D; 5 val y: Int :| Positive &#x3D; -5 //Compile-time error val z: Either[String, Int :| Positive] &#x3D; -5.refineEither //Left(&quot;...&quot;) 
 There are many other features including: - Custom constraints - New zero-cost types - Many integrations with other libraries such as Cats, ZIO, Doobie, Decline, Circe...
 Check the README for further information.

                              <span>I&#x27;m just considering a rewrite of a webapp-server from Express.js to HTTPurple. The server does the following things:
  
Manages user sessions and injects user auth to all requests (to resolve an issue with opening protected raw files in new tabs, which is probably a terrible idea that needs rework anyways)
 Proxies paths starting with /api to backend servers
 Interprets other paths as paths to static files and serves them, if they exist
 Finally serves index.html if paths don&#x27;t match anything
  
All other routing is done in the SPA.
 Why do I want to rewrite the server? There is a very fine-grained role-based authorization scheme managed by the backend. For UX-reasons, some backend responses contain a permission object with some requests (e.t. GET /api/entities/ returns { data: ..., permissions: { create: true } }.
 Setting up accounts for all possible combinations of permissions is tedious, and for some combinations/new functionality, roles don&#x27;t even exist yet, so I would like to inject permissions to (some) /api/... requets after they return from being proxied to the backend. Express&#x27; imperative handler will not let me access the responses after a handler has matched, but with pure functions this should be trivial.
 So, are my use cases supported/possible with HTTPurple? Any suggestions?

                              <span>I&#x27;m trialling a digitized version of my small physical ZK, and I&#x27;m running into a small issue with what constitutes a seperate note.
Most of my notes are MUCH smaller than other&#x27;s, sometimes I can fit the entirety of the idea into the title. So I&#x27;m wondering if instead of focusing on reducing the idea I should be adding more of the &#x27;therefores&#x27; onto the notes?
For example, I have the following notes, which were titles only in the paper version but I have expanded on slightly in the digital.
The patient&#x27;s art is only understood through therapy, (Naimberg 1953)
Art seeks reaction, (artlust, 2024)
Art can only truly be understood in relationship
To me, the third one is the &#x27;therefore&#x27; of the first two. This is particulary obvious in the digital version where I expand slightly on &#x27;art seeks reaction&#x27;, because reaction can only happen in relationship. Initially I thought these are three seperate ideas, but now I&#x27;m not so sure.
Should I combine the second two notes?</span>

In homage to @jiwonac&#x27;s idea.
&quot;I posit that writing for an audience with a background similar to mine is a valuable exercise. This insight comes from my recent experience of writing short reports to communicate findings for research projects. I found that these reports forced me to clarify my thoughts and became a staple of my research strategy.&quot;…</span>

 I just released a new web framework I&#x27;ve been working on: FastScala - it includes some ideas from the LiftWeb framework and allows you to do very quick development, coding both the backend and frontend in Scala.
 If you&#x27;re curious, you can see more here: http://www.fastscala.com/
 Comments/suggestions appreciated 🙂

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking for ideas or options on how to go about in some way incentivising through financially sponsoring (as an individual, not corporate), or co-sponsoring, an upgrade to an open source Scala.js 3 repository.
 I don&#x27;t currently have the time to do the entire upgrade myself (although I&#x27;d love to try and contribute some hours), and I want to give the upgrade back to the community (as opposed to just keep a private fork).
 What sort of option frameworks exist for this kind of approach to incrementally improving open source in general, and within the Scala specific subdomain?
 While my exploration is about the more general problem, here&#x27;s the particular repository upon which I&#x27;m currently focused: https://antoine-doeraene.medium.com/make-your-google-spreadsheets-scala-ble-5695d9dd784f

                              <span>Hey,
 I have a little brain teaser if anyone is interested.
 I have multiple list of properties (house, apartment, …). Each list comes from a different source. The goal is to group properties to avoid duplicates.
 Because every source has their own way of doing things, it isn’t as easy as group by address.
 I need to come up with a way to group by address, or by geo coordinates, or by bedroom + bathroom + size, or by cover picture, or … some sort of group by similarity score.
 Would anyone have a solution to such problem?

In the microservices world, we spend a lot of time making ad hoc http requests to debug failing services, do sanity checks, etc. As a GUI, Postman makes it pretty easy for beginners to get started with this sort of work. However, you quickly run into its limitations:
  
 Leaking passwords to postman.com, or into your exported files, is easy
  Importing/exporting Environment and Collection files means, in practice, that these files do not end up in version control
  Working in your preferred editor/IDE requires an impractical amount of copy/pasting
  Incorrect (e.g. missing) variables, and DRY violations, can cause major hea…</span>

                              <span>Hi all! I was wondering what ways to promote a Scala tooling ecosystem PR would you suggest?
 E.g., Scala Steward PR: https://github.com/scala-steward-org/scala-steward/pull/3372
 (I&#x27;m aware I&#x27;m promoting the PR itself with this post 😂, but I&#x27;m way more interested in any answer to the previous question 😊)
 TIA!

                              <span>As a researcher who primarily uses interpreted language, I’ve recently been exploring compiled languages, especially functional languages. Right now I’m looking at Scala, and I really like its features. However, the jvm dependency, while great for some purposes (I do a lot of work in clojure), is a concern for others. One reason I’m looking at compiled languages is for building cli tools as static binaries that can be flexibly copied into docker containers, over ssh, etc.
 I’m curious how practical scala native would be for this purpose, or if I’d be better off using another language for cli tools. What if I wanted to do something that depends on third-party libraries, like image processing?
 Thanks for the help.

 Hello friends. I recently made a post here about switching to emacs. It&#x27;s been a few days (probably..? I&#x27;m sure you are no strangers to getting sucked into editing your .emacs file) I&#x27;m back with some updates!
 Upsides:
 Counsel, Which-key, Ivy, and Avy were all solid recommendations. these are instant benefit-adds that I could notice immediately. 
 Org mode is obviously a win. Org-novelist is also very powerful, but I have to spend a lot of time in that to really get a feel. I still haven&#x27;t setup magit yet (sorry! I know it&#x27;s amazing!)
 I opted for meow. I know, I got a lot of evil recommendations. Since I added the &quot;don&#x27;t recommend evil&quot;, and yet still got them, I can tel…</span>

                              <span>I have been using projectile for years and it works nicely. However, recently I have noticed that more people recommend project.el because it is lighter and has the backing of the Emacs maintainers. Therefore, I want to give it a try.
 One confusion about project.el is how to specify a project if no version control exists.
 For example, suppose I have the following directory:
 \---myproject | +---subproject1 | \---.git | | Makefile | \---subproject2 \---.git | Makefile 
 How to specify myproject as a project? Note that the myproject itself is under VC. 
 By projectile, I just add a empty .projectile to myproject.
 From Emacs docs:
  
Whether a given directory is a root of some project is determined by the project-specific infrastructure, known as project back-end. Emacs currently supports two such back-ends: VC-aware (see Version Control), whereby a VCS repository is considered a project; and EDE (see Emacs Development Environment). This is expected to be extended in the future to support additional types of projects.
  
Therefore I have to write a back-end by myself? or use EDE which seems rarely used?
 Thanks.

                              <span>Hello everyone!
 I am looking for a way to customize my C indentation style in Emacs to fit my school style guidelines.
 One of the guidelines I am trying to implement goes like this: &quot;Each variable declaration must be indented on the same column for its scope&quot;, see my example below for clarity. 
 Example:
 int main(void) { int a; int b; int c; } int main(void) { int a; char b; float c; } int main(void) { int a; char b; unsigned char c; } 
 As you can see I have to indent the variables on the same column as their longest neighboring type name basically (C89 style).
 So far, I have dealt with it by remapping my TAB key to insert actual tabs with this elisp snippet: (local-set-key (kbd &quot;TAB&quot;) &#x27;tab-to-tab-stop) so I can indent everything manually. It does the job for me but I&#x27;m curious if there is a way to make full use of c-mode functionality to do that without having to write a super complicated elisp function that checks if the symbol at point is a C type and then indents it to the right column (with potential backtracking also). 
 I think the short answer is probably no but I&#x27;m curious how you would deal with this if you were in my situation or/and if you personally had to do any &quot;hacks&quot; to your c-mode config to fit some project&#x27;s guidelines. 
 I quickly skimmed through manual, it probably has all the answers I need but nothing really stood out to me at first glance.

 so I&#x27;m trying to follow the installation from here and in it it mentions MELPA. So I go to install MELPA from here but it mentions this
  
Enable installation of packages from MELPA by adding an entry to package-archives after (require &#x27;package) and before the call to package-initialize in your init.el or .emacs file:
  
yet my .emacs file located at the home directory has a single line
  
(put &#x27;upcase-region &#x27;disabled nil)
  
which I assume is because I enabled this command
 but I add the entry anyway and run M-x package-refresh-contents which tries to contact melpa.org but then it throws a signature error

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I&#x27;ve recently started using Emacs and found it to be an incredibly cool and powerful editor. However, I noticed that there wasn&#x27;t a GitHub theme similar to what Neovim offers, so I decided to create one myself. I have developed GitHub dark theme, light, and dark dimmed versions. The theme has been tested on WSL2 running on Windows Terminal, but if you encounter any issues, please let me know on GitHub.
 You can find theme on Github.
 Key Features:
  
Customizable colors for comments, keywords, strings, numbers, etc.
 Support for various modes including org-mode, term, ivy, swiper, and more.
 Compatibility with Emacs 24 and later.
 Easily modifiable to suit personal preferences based on the provided code.
  
Since I&#x27;m not familiar with Emacs package managers yet, you can install and use the theme manually as long as autothemer is installed.
 Feel free to customize the theme according to your preferences. If you have any questions or encounter issues, please report them on GitHub :)
 P.S.
 I also tested the themes using the emacs -nw command. Both the dark and light themes work perfectly in the terminal. However, the dark-dimmed theme isn&#x27;t fully compatible because I couldn&#x27;t find a suitable color to replicate the greyish tone used in the GUI version.

                              <span>I&#x27;m having trouble with citations in my Org-mode documents when trying to include them in QUOTE or EXAMPLE blocks. The current setup I have doesn&#x27;t allow citar to recognize and insert references in these blocks, which causes issues during LaTeX export.
 #BEGIN_EXAMPLE [cite:citationKey 20] #END_EXAMPLE 
 The above snippet gets rendered in LaTeX as:
 \begin{example} [cite:citationKey] % instead of \cite{citationKey} \end{example} 
 I see two potential solutions, but I&#x27;m not sure how to implement them, being quite new to Lisp:
  
Allow Citar to Add References in Blocks: Expand the context variable in citar-org.el to include blocks. Here&#x27;s the relevant line in the citar code.
 Modify LaTeX Exporters: Ensure that [cite] expressions within blocks get parsed correctly during LaTeX export.
  
What would be the best approach to achieve this? Any suggestion would be greatly appreciated!

                              <span>Hi, guys.
 I came from update org to version 9.7.5 and now I have an issue running a emacs-lisp block source. The block source is very simple:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 +BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :session ego :results output
 (setq org-babel-python-command &quot;~/.virtualenvs/data-science/bin/python&quot;)
 +END_SRC
 The message error is: &#x60;org-babel-execute:emacs-lisp: ob-emacs-lisp backend does not support sessions&#x60;.
 What&#x27;s wrong with my block source code ?

                              <span>I just released Org mode 9.7.5 that fixes a critical vulnerability. The release is coordinated with emergency Emacs 29.4 release.
 Please upgrade your Org mode or Emacs ASAP.
 The vulnerability involves arbitrary Shell code evaluation when previewing attachments in Emacs MUA (gnus-based: at least, mu4e, Notmuch, Gnus itself) or when opening Org files. All the earlier versions of Org mode are affected.
 Note that the vulnerability solved in this release has nothing to do with recent Org 9.6.23 release (https://list.orgmode.org/871q7zbldp.fsf@localhost/). It existed since long time ago and was discovered by accident.

I&#x27;m Justin, a 32 yo nurse assistant who work with elders suffering from severe dementia.
I&#x27;ve been lurking here for a few months and finaly found the time to convert my website to a zettelkasten(ish) thinking machine.
I&#x27;ve been exploring ideas about caring, gardening and sociology for a few days and I quite enjoy the process.
Luhmann ID user I&#x27;m currently between Obsidian and Acme Editor (plan9). I&#x27;ve been working on a few shell script to adapt my workflow with the later as I find it quite relaxing when writing.
Thanks for all users here for your greate debates and ideas. A pleasure to read, a pleasure to think about.
Take care,
Justin</span>

                              <span>(This is one of the reasons I don&#x27;t like building/installing emacs myself. When I built 29.1, this happened and now it&#x27;s happened again with 29.3 and I can&#x27;t remember how I fixed it...)
 This is for Ubuntu 22.04, using a pretty stock GNOME desktop environment.
 Having just updated emacs to 29.3 by building and installing it myself (under /usr/local), I am having some weird interaction with the GNOME desktop. I run emacs directly, and leave it running for my session. I have (had) the desktop icon fixed in my taskbar. I only just noticed this morning that there was a second emacs icon in the taskbar while the application is running. Hovering over the icon, it reads, &quot;Emacs (Client)&quot;. I thought perhaps there was a minor conflict between 29.3 and 29.1, so I removed the fixed icon from the task…</span>

Does anybody knows how to accomplish this? Below my current config simplified:

 I&#x27;ve been looking something to make graphic notes like obsidian&#x27;s canvas for a while now, and I spotted this today. Absolutely brilliant package.
 And the same method(ors-get-id and copy to canvas) works on obsidian-excalidraw as well

                              <span>Hi. I have trouble setting up mbsync to properly handle deletion in two GMail accounts. They&#x27;re configured identically (&quot;When I mark a message in IMAP as deleted&quot; &#x3D; &quot;Auto-Expunge off&quot;, &quot;When a message is marked as deleted and expunged from the last visible IMAP folder&quot; &#x3D; &quot;Move the message to the Trash&quot;), however, the behaviour for them is quite different. For the first one, it is more or less fine:
  
👌 mu4e-headers-mark-for-trash for mail in inbox moves it to trash
 👌 mu4e-headers-mark-for-trash for mail in archive moves it to trash
 🤷 mu4e-headers-mark-for-delete for mail in inbox moves it to archive
 👌 mu4e-headers-mark-for-delete for mail in archive moves it to trash
 😠 mu4e-headers-mark-for-delete for mail in both inbox and archive does nothing (the email gets removed from my local maildir, but it is still present in GMail web interface)
  
However, for the second account (configured identically) the situation is much worse:
  
🤷 mu4e-headers-mark-for-trash for mail in inbox moves it to archive
 😠 mu4e-headers-mark-for-trash for mail in archive does nothing
 🤷 mu4e-headers-mark-for-delete for mail in inbox moves it to archive
 😠 mu4e-headers-mark-for-delete for mail in archive does nothing
 😠 mu4e-headers-mark-for-delete for mail in both inbox and archive does nothing
  
I&#x27;d like to have a way to just press a button and send an email to trash folder, without checking where this email comes from.
 Is it something I&#x27;m missing, some kind of hidden GMail setting or perhaps something in mbsync configuration? Here&#x27;s how I configured mbsync: https://pastebin.com/7wR4RCpt

 SVG specifications allows flowing text along a curve via textPath element. This opens up possibilities for cool text effects e.g. Formula Editor in GNU Emacs.

 (I also welcome any alternatives that do something better than libhunt but have no associated Emacs package)

 I recently started using eglot and pyright for my python setup and it works as expected (I think) on my local machine. However it stops working when I start coding on my remote server. I get the following errors:

                              <span>Hi everyone! I&#x27;d like to announce release 0.13.0 of dunai. It is accompanied by a matching release of dunai-test and bearriver.
 Dunai is a reactive programming library structured around a notion of Monadic Stream Functions. Dunai can be used to implement other reactive and FRP frameworks on top, including Classic FRP and Arrowized FRP variants.
 Dunai comes with:
  
bearriver: API-compatible implementation of Yampa. (The Bear River is a tributary to the Yampa river.)
 
dunai-test: QuickCheck-based temporal testing library that can be connected with the testing system haskell-titan.
 
 See https://github.com/ivanperez-keera/dunai#features for details on Dunai&#x27;s features.

                              <span>In Haskell, why is the following code valid:
 haskell f :: a f &#x3D; f 
  
Is it because we can infer the return type, together with Haskell not requiring a term to have parameters and being lazy?
  
What I mean is that I can get something similar in ML only in two steps:
 ocaml let rec f (x: &#x27;a): &#x27;b &#x3D; f x let x : &#x27;a &#x3D; f () 
  
How does this relate to the halting problem?
 Having a inhabited bottom makes Haskell&#x27;s type system inconsistent and, hence, unsound (because inconsistency implies unsoundness). So why do we say that it is sound? Do we say that considering just the consistent subset? (I&#x27;ve read the article on fast and loose reasoning).
  
Note: Haskell is my favorite language, so I&#x27;m not trying to bash it. I&#x27;m writing an assignment for uni on formal logic about consistency in lambda calculus. I would appreciate it if someone could answer as objectively as possible so I can further my investigations on how Turing completeness (the inclusion of general recursion) impacts consistency in type theory.

                              <span>Hi everybody,
 I would like to know if there is a way to have an org-agenda view for today presented in a time-grid view where I can see my notes, state changes, clocks and all the things from logbook?
 The idea is to visualize in a single time-grid view for a day all the logbook related things from my TODOs. So in exactly the same way as the SCHEDULED items are shown on a time grid now, I would like to see notes, clocks, state changes etc for all TODOs.
 If such a view is not possible, I would like to implement it. Is there any advice you can give, or a suggestion, on how I could manipulate the time grid view to display data I parsed from logbooks? I could format it while parsing in any way it is needed but the display of information on the time-grid I am not familiar with.

 I need a basic lsp setup with treesitter
 Can you guys link to specific snippet?
 Treesitter is not showing correct syntax highlighting on my end especially for c++-ts-mode
 Lsp is working but c++-ts-mode is not
 Is there a thing in emacs like kickstart in neovim?

                              <span>I&#x27;m using eglot over tramp for python development. lsp is pylsp. I use pythonic-activate to activate the venv after tramp to the remote machine, and eglot works out of box, which is great.
 The problem is I&#x27;m asked for password twice for each python file I visited. This is not there when I don&#x27;t have eglot, so I think it is eglot establishing connection or something. I use ssh config to hop 3 times into the remote server, one with public key and other 2 password, so I had to type 6 passwords for each file I opened(and they are all different), which is annoying.
 Does anyone else have this problem? How do you solve it?(make eglot ask for password less often)

                              <span>Hello! I&#x27;m a writer, and a programmer. I&#x27;ve in the past obviously leaned towards vim for my text editing &amp; writing, and have become very comfortable in that environment with vim movements.
 Recently I&#x27;ve decided to give emacs a try (as I&#x27;ve always wanted to), and after hearing about org-mode (&amp; org-novelist, export with pandoc, etc) I wanted to try and move my workflow over to emacs for writing. I have a few questions though:
 What is the best way to move around a text file, in your experience? I&#x27;m of course reading through documentation, but things like sexp movement don&#x27;t benefit much from prose! In Vim I could move to any line and any word with a pretty quick series of inputs: is this possible in emacs?
 What are some must haves in the config? i&#x27;m doing vanilla (please don&#x27;t recommend evil--I want to experience emacs for what it is) This is specifically for writing. I know emacs has thousands of commands, and I can only imagine it has a similar amount of settings (setq&#x27;s? what are these called?)
 I already have lived a long life with capslock as ctrl (started after i got a HHKB, couldnt&#x27; go back) but is there a way to use meta/alt as spacebar instead? I know I said no evil, but space as my leader key has been something of a game change in terms of ergonomics for me.
 Finally I plan on just using bleeding edge, building from source. I know theres some exciting things that have just came out, or will be coming out in 30. Has anyone had any issues using the --pgtk with wayland? It&#x27;s hard to find any communication about this back and forth online (i suppose a lot of emacs folks are still on mailing lists or on matrix and not reddit/discord)
 I&#x27;ll appreciate any feedback, even if it&#x27;s not regarding a question. Thanks so much
 edit: thanks for all the help. I have literally never made a post on reddit in over a decade between many accounts that received such useful input.

                              <span>Hej fellows,
 I want to be able to narrow down the candidates to SWITCH-TO-BUFFER not only based on the buffer/file name, but also based on the major mode (or any other information provided by MARGINALIA, for that matter).
 Is there some integration, or some variable I can set? I struggle to believe that no one else has run into this problem, so I am CERTAIN someone has already encountered and fixed this problem.
 I am glad for pointers, advice and recommendation.
 Have a good day, fellow &#x27;macsers!

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been unsatisfied with existing tree file browser packages for emacs, they all have been too slow for me. 
 Expanding whole tree for bigger projects takes, like, forever, so I&#x27;m writing my own.
 It mainly utilities unix tree command output:
 https://gitlab.com/OldManProgrammer/unix-tree
 one functionality it&#x27;s missing is interactive expand / contract tree, for example:
 ├── assets/ │ ├── images/ │ │ ├── testImage.jpg │ │ └── testImage.png │ └── shaders/ │ └── default.glsl 
 contracted would look like:
 ├── assets/ │ ├── images/ │ └── shaders/ 
 and even more contracted would look like:
 ├── assets/ 
 Before i write my own logic for this, i thought built-in outline-mode could be a perfect fit for this.
 But I&#x27;ve been playing with outline-regexp for quite a while, and i always can&#x27;t quite get it right.
 if anyone is interested, i can post repo for this later in the comments. Its&#x27; pretty simple, but i want to fix few more things.

                              <span>I have the following block in init.el:
 (use-package which-key :ensure t :delight which-key-mode :commands (which-key-mode which-key-setup-minibuffer) :custom (which-key-idle-delay 0.3) (which-key-prefix-prefix &quot;◉ &quot;) (which-key-sort-order &#x27;which-key-key-order-alpha) (which-key-min-display-lines 3) (which-key-max-display-columns nil) :config (which-key-mode) (which-key-setup-minibuffer)) 
 However, which-key-mode is not triggering when emacs starts up. If I navigate to the (which-key-mode) line and C-x C-e, it will activate. This appears to be the only package I&#x27;m having this issue with.
 Is there maybe a known list of packages that this one conflicts with?
 Edit: It seems that removing the :commands line fixes this (but results in &quot;function X might not be defined&quot; squiggles for both of the :config commands).

                              <span>I am wrecking my brain over the following:
 (fmap . fmap) sum Just [1, 2, 3] yields Just 6
 But why? a composed fmap, in my understanding, is to &quot;jump&quot; (so to speak) over the structure of 2 functors, in this case Maybe and [] functors. So why is this not an error? Isn&#x27;t this supposed to run sum on the values of the list?
 I would expect:
 fmap sum (Just [1,2,3]) to yield Just 6, and indeed it does (with paranthesis).
 What am I missing here?
 Thanks in advance!
 Edit:
 Even if I follow the types, I get:
 (fmap . fmap) sum :: (Functor f1, Functor f2, Foldable t, Num b) &#x3D;&gt; f1 (f2 (t b)) -&gt; f1 (f2 b)
 where f1 &#x3D; Maybe, f2 &#x3D; [], t &#x3D; [], and Num let&#x27;s say is an Int, so:
 (fmap . fmap) sum :: Maybe [[Int]] -&gt; Maybe [Int]

                              <span>Hi everybody,
 I would like to know if there is a way to have an org-agenda view for today presented in a time-grid view where I can see my notes, state changes, clocks and all the things from logbook?
 The idea is to visualize in a single time-grid view for a day all the logbook related things from my TODOs. So in exactly the same way as the SCHEDULED items are shown on a time grid now, I would like to see notes, clocks, state changes etc for all TODOs.
 If such a view is not possible, I would like to implement it. Is there any advice you can give, or a suggestion, on how I could manipulate the time grid view to display data I parsed from logbooks? I could format it while parsing in any way it is needed but the display of information on the time-grid I am not familiar with.

                              <span>i&#x27;m basically writing down a list of various stuff, and it&#x27;s organized like this:
  - total [/] - first category [/] - game one [/] - expansion one [/] - [ ] foo - [ ] bar - expansion two - second season - [ ] foo - [ ] bar - [ ] biz - second category [/] - game two [/] etc...  
 as you can see it&#x27;s subtree shenanigas; now, I tried to re-do the file from scratch, and checking for syntax errors, but everytime i try to C-c C-c the 40th counting box I get this error (with backtrace) 
  Debugger entered--Lisp error: (wrong-type-argument integer-or-marker-p nil) org-update-checkbox-count() org-update-statistics-cookies(nil) funcall-interactively(org-update-statistics-cookies nil) call-interactively(org-update-statistics-cookies) org-ctrl-c-ctrl-c(nil) funcall-interactively(org-ctrl-c-ctrl-c nil) call-interactively(org-ctrl-c-ctrl-c nil nil) command-execute(org-ctrl-c-ctrl-c)  
 i tried on Org version 9.6.24, emacs 29.3 and 30, but I always get stuck at the 39th, the 40th throws that error.
 any idea on what i&#x27;m doing wrong? I can share the file if that help, it&#x27;s just a collection of RPGs and Tabletop games that i want to collect, it&#x27;s nothing too personal, but i would rather get what exactly i&#x27;m doing wrong.
 also, I have this at the top of my file: 
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 +begin_src emacs-lisp
 (define-key org-mode-map (kbd &quot;M-RET&quot;) &#x27;org-insert-todo-heading) (setq org-checkbox-hierarchical-statistics nil)
 +end_src
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; 
 I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s relevant, but it&#x27;s worth mentioning.
 thank you all for your help!

                              <span>In recent years, many ideas from Haskell, mainly those rooted in category theory, have found their way into Scala and become well-established in parts of the community.
 Coincidentally or not, many Scala developers have started to migrate to Kotlin, whose community takes a more pragmatic approach to programming and is less inclined towards category theory.
 Haskell is quite open about its goals, with the slogan “avoid success at all costs.” This philosophy allows them to experiment and conduct language research without chasing mainstream success. I&#x27;m curious about the Scala community&#x27;s vision for Scala&#x27;s success.
 While Haskell is extremely aware and open about its goal of not chasing success, how aware is the part of the Scala community that promotes Haskell&#x27;s ideas?

 Can someone help me, I want to implement the createNewUser function. If the error already exists, it will return an AlreadyExistsError. If it doesn&#x27;t it will insert the user in the database and return the UUID.
 Edit: Used generic F instead of IO

                              <span>This week marks the release of the 10 year anniversary edition website overhaul 
We&#x27;ve changed the landing page to better guide new readers into the topic, and we overhauled the blog to provide a table of contents that helps with orienting and navigating in longer documents.
One caveat, though:  the table of contents navigation doesn&#x27;t yet work on mobile. I think a sidebar/temporary toggle would be best on constrained devices, but that requires more JavaScript, so let&#x27;s not be too hasty 
Hope you enjoy it!</span>

                              <span>I would appreciate if anyone knows if there is a way to set up the template for the name of the images pasted into The Archive - at the moment it seems to be &quot;YYYY-mm-DD HH-MM Pasted Image.png&quot; - and I want to get rid of the spaces in the name as it then causes troubles when I try to preview my notes in 1Writer.
&quot;Hidden Preferences&quot;. 
Oh, and while I am at it, for some reason I can now also not find the setting for the new file ID in The Archive! I set it to be YYYYmmDDHHMM and vividly remember how I removed the seconds, but now fail to figure out where that setting is! 😅 In other words, I am lost in the settings - which are not many - so feels like I am lost in a forest of three pines 😄
Thanks in advance to anyone kind to respond!</span>

                              <span>I am currently using a custom-built emacs (29.1) on my Ubuntu 22.04 system. I decided just now to try the Homebrew version, to see if there were any config issues or anything. There aren&#x27;t, but it seems to be limited to terminal-only. I can&#x27;t seem to get it to run a GUI.
 Is there a way to get this through Homebrew? I&#x27;d like to keep emacs (relatively) up-to-date, but don&#x27;t have the bandwidth to rebuild it regularly.

 When emacs starts up and it hits the (use-package corfu-popupinfo ...) clause it invokes package-refresh-contents - which tries to go online and fails. I can confirm this by putting a (debug-on-error #&#x27;package-refresh-contents) in there and I get a debug trace:

                              <span>Dear members of the church of emacs, 
 I have a fairly good laptop setup (rtx 4070,i9, 32 gigs) and have been ok with using windows (this is only OS i have ever really used). Recently, I realized that I really just use my laptop for 5 main things: VS Code (mostly for simulations), Browsing, Latex, Obsidian notes, and file explorer (or on the rare ocassions, some MS office software). And I have been really thinking, if it would be possible to maximize my comfort and efficieincy if I could find a way to manuever between these seemesly, at first I thought about downloading Linux (Gentoo/arch/nix) but since I have 0 experience with it, I am unsure if it would just end up making my life harder instead of easier. 
 Then I heard from a friend that I could just use EMACS to combine all of these things and get it pretty close to an OS. I have zero experience with emacs and wanted to ask if it could be the key for this seamless vision I had?
 Thnx !

                              <span>[SOLVED]
 I just built the latest Emacs on Ubuntu 22.04:
 GNU Emacs 29.3 (build 1, x86_64-pc-linux-gnu, GTK+ Version 3.24.33, cairo version 1.16.0) of 2024-06-20 
 It starts with a 10-point font no matter what I do. I&#x27;m using the same config that works fine on older versions of Emacs and always starts with a larger font. If I use &gt; Options &gt; Set Default Font, I can select a font that works for *that session only*. If I click on &gt; Options &gt; Save Options, it adds this to my .emacs:
 (custom-set-faces ;; custom-set-faces was added by Custom. ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful. ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance. ;; If there is more than one, they won&#x27;t work right. &#x27;(default ((t (:family &quot;Ubuntu Mono&quot; :foundry &quot;DAMA&quot; :slant normal :weight regular :height 143 :width normal))))) 
 Upon reopening Emacs, the font is back to 10 point. This basically makes Emacs 29 unusable.

                              <span>Hey. I wondered how, or if, you guys setup your editor indentation, comment and general source code formatting rules, on a per-project basis, and how well that works with projects using external source formatter configurations?
 For instance, if working on a C/C++/Python project using clang-format, ruff, gnu-indent, or uncrustify to format its source, how do you tell your Emacs to use the same rules according to their settings? Also, how do you keep this on a per-project basis (.dir-locals or similar) ?
 Any advice or anecdotes are welcome :-)

                              <span>Hi,
 do you have a dockerfile what can compile emacs on debian:stable and make a deb package ?
 Please share with me :)
 thanks in advance!

                              <span>What are the best practices to keep your emacs environment in sync across multiple devices? I&#x27;ve always used SyncThing to sync what emacs considers my HOME folder between devices, but I&#x27;ve encountered some problems below with my ELPA folder where packages are installed (&quot;~/.emacs.d/elpa&quot;).
 Specifically I noticed that when I upgraded emacs from version 28 to 29 on one machine and then upgraded some packages like pdf-tools and org-mode on that machine, those packages (which SyncThing synced to my other devices) no longer worked on the machines still running emacs 28 because emacs 29 has some new functions that those two packages use, like defvar-1.
 So should I have different ELPA folders for different versions of emacs, e.g., by putting a line in my init.el like (setq package-user-dir (concat &quot;~/.emacs.d/elpa-&quot; emacs-version))?
 Thanks!

                              <span>I have a few packages I&#x27;ve developed, and for various reasons they&#x27;re not on Melpa.
 But I still want to use them. I guess I could add a (load-file &quot;path/to/file&quot;) to my init, but that feels a little odd for some reason.
 What do y&#x27;all do?

                              <span>Is there some way to get Emacs to show the JavaDoc (or other language equivalent) in a popup for the function at point?
 I like the idea and expressiveness of such documentation, but I am never going to run my code through a doc formatter like Doxygen, but it would be helpful if Emacs could make use of it.
 Eldoc shows my function and the parameter names, but none of the available docs for each parameter.

                              <span>I didn’t find any solution in documentation. I have all my tables in a specific schema say abc. By default beam or any other database library works with public schema. How to set the schema in beam? It would also work if I can set the schema at Postgres-simple level…maybe while creating the connection. I looked around for other languages, there are some solutions that says you can pass in key&#x3D;value parameter in the connection string with your current schema&#x3D; . I didn’t try it because there is no mention of it jn postgres documentation.

 We aim to focus a lot on real world aspects of Haskell, specifically on web applications.

All my projects (2008-2023) by Chris Done
It might be a “getting old[-er]” thing, but I’ve recently started feeling like documenting the complete set of software projects I’ve worked on that I remember. Not as a CV (an advertisement of paid work), but a comprehensive list of everything.

 I&#x27;m using Jaxson Van Dorn&#x27;s invoice template from here: https://github.com/woofers/org-invoice-template
 As you can see, the sub-totals for each day are correct, but those subtotals, for some reason I can&#x27;t figure out, aren&#x27;t being summed together to arrive at the correct total for the invoice.
 I have scrutinised the formula, but I&#x27;m rather new to org table formulas and find the cell references alone difficult to follow, so I can&#x27;t spot what&#x27;s amiss. Can someone identify what&#x27;s going wrong?

                              <span>This might be kind of an obscure question, but here goes anyway:
 The LaTeX memoir document class has a nice feature to add breaks within a chapter, called \pfbreak (plain/fancy break). What it does is add a couple of lines between paragraphs, when the break is in the middle of the page, and adds 3 asterisks to the top or bottom of the page, when the break is between pages.
 In a regular LaTeX document, I can get it to work fine, but in Org Mode, I&#x27;m struggling. The break in the middle of the page works, but if the break is between pages, I don&#x27;t get the 3 asterisks.
 I figured all I would have to do is add #+LaTeX_HEADER: \documentclass{memoir} to the in-buffer settings, and then use $\pfbreak$ when I wanted to add a break, which seems to be somewhat right, since it works in the middle of a page. Just not the end.
 Any way I can track down what I&#x27;m missing, or if this will even work in Org Mode?

I&#x27;ve honestly avoided writing this post because I don&#x27;t think I am accurately conveying the issues I&#x27;m having but I do really want feedback from you all - Here are some things I&#x27;m struggling with.
So first of all, I notice that I&#x27;m really stuck in my ways and often seem to write essays rather than notes. In order to avoid stressing about a note being atomic, I try to allow my notes to build up until they naturally can be broken down. However, by then, I feel like the statements are too intertwined and codependent and then I struggle to break things down. This is mainly referring to things I write about from background knowledge but happens with referenced things too.
I really want to know how other people structure arguments, claims they don&#x27;t believe, and things they don&#x27;t…</span>

                              <span>One of the key features of Nickel is the merge system, which is a clever way of combining records, and allows defining complex configurations in a modular way.
This system is inspired by (amongst others) the NixOS module system, which are the magic bits that tie together NixOS configurations and gives NixOS its insane flexibility.
Nickel merging and NixOS modules work slightly differently under the hood, and target slightly different use-cases:
Nickel merge is designed to combine several pieces of configurations which all respect the same contract. This allows an application developer to define the interface of its configuration, and have the user write it in a modular way.
NixOS modules, on the other hand, are designed to combine pieces which not only define a part of the final configurat…</span>

 Coming to vim, I would typically navigate my file system through basic shell commands like cd and would then edit the files with vim filename.txt.
 With emacs, instead of using dired to open files, is there a way I could directly open them using vterm?

                              <span>One common concern with emacs&#x27;s included terminal modes is that they used to run on interpreted elisp code that&#x27;s the reason alternatives such as vterm outperform it. But now that there&#x27;s native compilation I cannot help but wonder if there&#x27;s really that much of a difference

 I&#x27;m using the scheme layer in spacemacs. Here is my config
 scheme-implementations &#x27;(mit) geiser-mit-binary &quot;/path/to/mit-scheme&quot; geiser-default-implementation &#x27;mit 
 The person who closest ran into this issue I could find it seems like this person:
 https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/nnuapw/geiser_not_sending_correct_code_to_chicken_repl/
 They were using chicken scheme and it seems like some chicken scheme command fixed it.
 The closest analog I can think of with mit-scheme is there is a Setup.sh script to run (which I haven&#x27;t), though it seems this requires an already working mit-scheme compiler 😵‍💫
 I am able to run code fine in the geiser REPL 👍

                              <span>I want to create a (mode? package?) that behaves like a tui. The content should be read-only, but on key press I want to fetch data from a server, generate a collapsible/expandable tree from the result, be able to navigate the items and trigger further actions on the focussed items by more keypresses.
 I&#x27;m new to elisp, but data fetching, parsing etc. is not what gives me a headache - I&#x27;m familiar enough with Clojure to have a grap of lisps and willing to learn the language &quot;enough&quot;.
 The great unknown for me are the emacs internals on how to actually build the ui. Are there any introductions, tutorials or simple examples I can use to learn from? I could start with magit, which does all what I&#x27;d like incredibly well, but I feel like that&#x27;s a little over my head ;)
 Of course, best practices for fetching and parsing JSON are appreciated, too.

                              <span>Let&#x27;s say I want to write a function that returns an IO[Int] that might have a NOT_FOUND or DUPLICATE error. What would be the best way to write this function?
 Any blogs or videos that discuss about this topic? I&#x27;m confused onwhat the best practice in scala is. I hate java style exceptions and prefer error as values.
 If you can give me an example method or repo for doing this that would be nice.
 Edit: I&#x27;m not trying to make an app. I want to know what the usual way in scala is so that I can read scala codebases

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m new to scala and I am using vscode with Metals to code. However, when I create a project and import the build following the tip of Metals , Metals will be stuck on indexing even longer than 20min. It also cant navigate to the source of lib.
 Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. THX !

                              <span>I want to use Haskell for back-end (paired with Elm for front-end), but I&#x27;m not sure about committing to it for two reasons:
  
Haskell&#x27;s compiler error messages are confusing and feel unhelpful to me. I&#x27;ve been spoiled by Elm and Rust, and languages like Gleam seem to incorporate a similar style of compiler messaging I appreciate.
 I&#x27;ve heard that Haskell is difficult to maintain in the long run. When it comes to packages in my experience, cabal feels a bit less organized in comparison to package systems like Elm&#x27;s or Crate for Rust.
  
Are there solutions that could make Haskell a winning choice for a language in these aspects, or would I be better to go with something else?
 (As a side note, I admire the direction of Richard Feldman&#x27;s language Roc, but as it is still a developing language, I would not be keen to invest in that too much at the moment. If you think it&#x27;s worth it, maybe let me know.)

                              <span>So this is a little bit strange, but I cannot see any reason why this shouldn&#x27;t be possible, using various low-level GHC runtime functions etc.
 I want a function that looks like this:
 writeExecutable :: FilePath -&gt; IO () -&gt; IO () 
 Calling writeExecutable fpath action on a Linux machine should create a Linux executable file at fpath that, when run, runs action as if it were main of that executable.
 To be a bit more specific regarding pre-existing state, I want
 writeExecutable fpath action args &lt;- System.Environment.getArgs System.Posix.Process.executeFile fpath args Nothing 
 and
 action System.Exit.exitSuccess 
 to be essentially equivalent, modulo the created file of course. (Bear in mind executeFile is UNIX exec, which does not create a new process but replaces the current process with new code).
 Why do I want writeExecutable? Because I wrote an interpreter and I want to turn it into a compiler for free.
 Does anyone know of any work that&#x27;s been done in this area (even in another language)?

                              <span>Is there a configuration to force the Ediff window to pop next to the main window instead of on top of it?
 The default position is inconvenient since the Ediff window will be covered if I click on the main window. I&#x27;m always having to move it aside so I can go back to keep looking at the diffs.

                              <span>One day, I tried to reflect on why I don&#x27;t really like EasyMotion-like packages (Avy, Ace-Jump, etc.). It was because they feel too intrusive to my flow - I want to go to a place almost mechanically, without thinking like, &quot;So I need to go to this &#x27;f&#x27; symbol, I should type &#x27;f&#x27;, then wait, read, and type the next symbols one after another&quot; 
 So, I tried to create a package that works the opposite way—you always go to the same place with the same keybindings. E.g., if you type M-s f u p, then you will always be in the top right corner.
 It might be slower at the start, but probably more mechanical, faster, and freeing your head in the end. 
 I wrote an example package and a training game, only to find out later that there exists the package I wanted, but which does it on a system level :) And it is https://github.com/rvaiya/warpd/

                              <span>Hey!
 At work we use 2 indentation styles:
 void shortFunction(int arg1, int arg2, // ..., int argN, int argM) { // ... } void SomeClass::AndAnotherInnerScope::veryLongFunctionNameJustForFun( SomeOtherVeryLongTypeName arg1, int arg2, std::string arg3, ) { // ... } 
 Default tree-sitter indent rules can&#x27;t cope with that. They weally want to align all arguments to an opening brace, turning second function declaration into a mess.
 I have written my own indentation rule, maybe ugly, but it get the job done.
 It tries to indent first argument by 4 spaces if it is on its own line, and doesn&#x27;t move it at all otherwise, and everything else is aligned to it.
 (defun lazy/smart-indent (node parent bol &amp;rest _) (let ((first-real-child (treesit-node-child parent 1))) (if (or (not node) (treesit-node-eq node first-real-child)) (save-excursion (goto-char (treesit-node-start parent)) (back-to-indentation) (+ (point) 4)) (treesit-node-start first-real-child)))) 
 Then I had to create my own c-ts indentation style where I changed 2 rules: for argument lists and parameter lists to this:
 ((parent-is &quot;argument_list&quot;) lazy/smart-indent 0) ((parent-is &quot;parameter_list&quot;) lazy/smart-indent 0) 
 I don&#x27;t know a good way to do it other than copy existingy styles and patch in place.
 Hope it helps someone.

I want to modify the log message, but the function vc-git-log-edit-toggle-amend seems to work only in the log-edit-mode buffer, which I don&#x27;t know how to invoke without committing changes. 
 Does anybody know a solution to this issue? Thanks.

                              <span>Hi, everyone!
 I&#x27;m relatively new to Emacs, I&#x27;ve watched a few SystemCrafters videos, flipped through the documentation and tutorials. I&#x27;ve started writing my config, but it still looks far from what I want it to look like...
 So I&#x27;m here with a question: where can I find more variety of good cofigs for inspiration (and possibly for use)? The usual search on the net and on github gives mostly very outdated builds(
 For the context, I&#x27;ve been on Arch Linux for two years now, I&#x27;m switching to emacs from obidian, and I want to fit most of my activities into emacs: PKM (org-roam), Task manager, programming (C, Python, JS), etc

                              <span>Hi!
 Has anyone experienced this bug with poly-org and org-mode 9.7? 
 https://github.com/polymode/poly-org/issues/49
 I see the issue when the buffer glitches from top to bottom, with the cursor moving line by line too fast. It&#x27;s basically unworkable at this state. 
 My solution is to stay in 9.6 until there is a permanent solution for it. 
 Best.

 Could someone please explain why it makes sense that m needs to be a type constructor that takes one type argument, so of kind * -&gt; *? Why wouldn&#x27;t it make sense to have Monads where m is of kind *?

 Is there a way to gather all the knowledge in one course?

Some libraries will be buggy and some libraries are not a good fit in some situations. I also want a library that is simple but I don&#x27;t mind losing some simplicity for power(performance, capability etc). I want to make Conway&#x27;s game of life like automata based artwork. Where entities interact with each other and through emergence create complex structures, groupings and behavioral patterns. Based on my needs can someone point to me the best library, tool etc

 I can&#x27;t seem to figure out how to use MonadError here. Im new to scala and dont understand the syntax that well.
 Edit:
 I tried doing this
 class LiveVendors[F[_]] private ( xa: Transactor[F] )(implicit ME: MonadError[F, String]) 
 But Im getting No given instance of type cats.MonadError[F, String] was found for parameter ME of constructor LiveVendors in class LiveVendors in the apply method

 This post is not specific to Scala but I like this community so I ask it here.
 What do you think makes more sense for testing API status code and messages returned to the client? Unit testing (and mocking your services)?
 Or Integration testing to test with the real system?
 Thanks!

 I&#x27;m an experienced Scala dev currently working through a consultancy for US clients. Lately I&#x27;ve been looking around for Scala jobs in LinkedIn and stuff, but it seems like all dev jobs are either US or Europe based.
 Does anyone have any tips for the job search taking that into account? As an aside, I&#x27;d rather not relocate right now, but I&#x27;m open to it in the future.

                              <span>I should just use old pinned stack resolver versions but I have a small compulsion to update the resolver versions of my many little projects to the latest LTS version.
 life is so much easier if I add allow-newer:true in each project’s stack.yaml file.
 It seems a little sloppy doing this, but are there specific reasons why this is a bad idea?
 thanks in advance for any advice.

 I&#x27;m not a programmer, am a writer looking to switch his primary digital writing process from Obsidian to Emacs, specifically Org Mode and Org Roam. I&#x27;ve been looking at a lot of intro guides and have done most of the in-built Emacs tutorial. I will keep on learning Emacs itself and the key commands and such as I go on, but today I wanted to get started actually using it (haven&#x27;t really worked the last few days as I spent time just reading about whether Emacs is worth it, then started to dip my toes into the water). Honestly I just wanted to make an org file to list the three dozen odd tabs I have open for various Emacs resources. N…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been using text-scale-increase|decrease for awhile, but it only works on one buffer at a time, doesn&#x27;t affect the modeline, and so forth. Since most of the time I&#x27;m on very large monitors, I have the base font size set to be readable there, though sometimes I&#x27;m on the laptop and need it to scale down a little bit.
 I&#x27;ve done some searching for solutions but seems like the only ones I&#x27;ve come up with are from EmacsWiki (zoom-frm.el). This is fine, but also seems like it requires a lot of additional packages, also from EmacsWiki. 
 Anyone ever tried these solutions? I can go searching through EmacsWiki for all the dependencies and download them if I need to, but the Git repo is absolutely gigantic to try to get small amounts of packages so a bit of a pain. But if they&#x27;re the miracle cure, I&#x27;ll do what it takes.
 Also open to other packages that do the job. Just would like to control the text when the laptop is hooked up to dock with big monitors, and when it&#x27;s just a laptop.

                              <span>Hi, i&#x27;m new to emacs. I&#x27;ve been using vscode mainly and forgot that other IDE&#x27;s existed. I wanted to try and give emacs a go because I&#x27;ve heard good things about it. However, I&#x27;m a bit confused on how to get started with it. Anyone have any resources they recommend to get started? Thanks. Also, i&#x27;m wanting to learn C and use emacs as my IDE, I&#x27;m on MacOs. I previously learned javascript for around 8 months.

                              <span>The following settings help me compile my LaTeX documents via C-c C-c, and synctex works quite well with Skim on MacOS, with one exception. The LaTeX document compiles fine only when compiling from the root directory.
 Typically I have a main file acting as the &quot;scaffolding&quot; that imports various chapters/sections in separate files.
 main.tex └── sections ├── chapter-1.tex └── chapter-2.tex 
 Everything works as expected only if I compile from a buffer open with main.tex, but not with any of the chapter files in the sections directory.
  (use-package latex-mode :init (setq TeX-view-program-selection &#x27;((output-pdf &quot;PDF Viewer&quot;)) TeX-view-program-list &#x60;((&quot;PDF Viewer&quot; ,(concat &quot;/Applications/Skim.app&quot; &quot;/Contents&quot; &quot;/SharedSupport/displayline&quot; &quot; -b -g %n %o %b&quot;)))) :hook (LaTeX-mode . auto-fill-mode) (LaTeX-mode . variable-pitch-mode) (LaTeX-mode . tex-source-correlate-mode) (LaTeX-mode . reftex-mode) (LaTeX-mode . visual-line-mode) (LaTeX-mode . (lambda () (local-set-key (kbd &quot;&quot;) #&#x27;TeX-view) (setq font-lock-maximum-decoration t line-spacing 3 fill-column 80 TeX-command-default &quot;LaTeX Make&quot;))) :mode &quot;\\.tex\\&#x27;&quot;) 
 In main.tex, I have the following at the end of the document.
  %%% Local Variables: %%% mode: latex %%% TeX-master: t %%% End: 
 And in all other TeX files, I have the following.
  %%% Local Variables: %%% mode: latex %%% TeX-master: &quot;../paper&quot; %%% End:

                              <span>I&#x27;m running pretty recent Emacs 29.3 PGTK build, with Org 9.7.4 and pdf-tools 1.1.0
 When exporting an org file as PDF with preview, Emacs creates a new window showing the PDF correctly but also switches the current org-mode buffer to show the same PDF file, as show in this screencast recording.
 It also seems to create a new frame showing the PDF if current frame is &quot;too small&quot;, which is not an issue for me.
 What annoys me is something switches the org-mode buffer to the PDF viewing buffer.
 I do not have &#x60;display-buffer-alist&#x60; rules regarding pdf-tools buffers.
 Have any of you seen this before?

                              <span>Hello Emacs Community!,
 I heavily use org-mode src blocks, normally with the ob-shell extension (sh, bash...), I previously worked in a MacOS system where the installation is a little complex, but can be done. Now, I recently got the opportunity to change systems so, I did.
 In a new Debian 12 installation, I have my Emacs installation and, when testing Src code blocks with *:async*, I noticed that my Emacs was still being blocked. This is a fresh installation.
 What I did:
 Run a src code block from the documentation that worked on the MacOS system, but didn&#x27;t in the Debian. Async should put an ID and then replace it:
  
+begin_src bash :session execute-asynchronously :async yes
 echo &quot;Execute session blocks in the background&quot;
 sleep 20
 echo &quot;Using the :async header&quot;
 +end_src
  
What happened:
  
In MacOS, an ID is put in the results, Emacs doesn&#x27;t get worked and after the 20 seconds I get the result. Works perfectly.
 
In Debian, Emacs gets blocked, with the message &#x27;Executing Bash code block at position 480&#x27;.
 
 Things I&#x27;ve tried:
  
Emacs -Q for a minimal example, same issue.
 
Searched for the ob-async github, nothing related and, no &#x27;requirements&#x27; I may have missed, or packages.
 
Searched the web for answers, apparently, this is not an issue that I can find logs about, and given that I am in a new installation, I&#x27;m at a loss at what else to check... 
 
 At this point, I&#x27;m not sure what do debug, since usage of src code blocks is a must and, the support of Emacs in Linux should be better as I understand, for example, I don&#x27;t have issues with gpg in Debian, while I couldn&#x27;t configure it on MacOS.
 Thanks!

 I really want to use this file as a drop-in replacement for use with use-package.
 Update: I&#x27;ve discovered :load-path so that answers the local-storage part

                              <span>Hey guys, 
 I have ADHD and it is a struggle to clean up my tasks or rather doing them, I mean I love how I can capture any idea and any to-do for a given project, but doing them ... that is a whole other story. 
 I recently read about how gamification can help people with instant feedback problems, to better work if their tasks are gamified. So my question is, is there a way in emacs, to implement like a point system for tasks, like when im capturing a to-do, give it an value or link the prio of the task to points and at the end of the month, get like a highscore or somehting?
 I was just wondering, if anyone did something like this and can help someone out who is really in need of something like this :D
 Thank you all, and a happy day to you all!

                              <span>As in the title i have been offered two different roles. This would be my first job after a bootcamp. 
 One is in Scala, it provides a high level of training and supervision and you work with big clients but my fear is whether Scala is future proof as someone beginning their career. 
 The other is in C# in a very small company. I hope the training will be good but there will only be 4 of us so we&#x27;ll have to see.

                              <span>Just wanted to see if anyone here could help me brainstorm a setup using org roam dailies to track my phyisical fitness / lifting goals. I&#x27;d like to use org roam dailies to track my body weight, some measurements, my workout lifts, and possibly progress photos sporadically as well. Org roam dailies stores information in a one-file-per-day system where each file is named after the date. I&#x27;m comfortable with the templating required to make information entry quick and easy in this system, and have already been tracking all of this on pen and paper for over a year. Organizing and inputting this information is something I&#x27;ve already figured out for myself. I can get somewhat close-ish to the functionality I&#x27;m looking for with org-ql, but can&#x27;t quite get the feedback I&#x27;d like displayed the way I want. Ideally, I&#x27;d like to be able to make line charts of certain tagged entries in the daily file and plot them over time. Certain things will not be in every single entry. I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a way to accomplish this, I have not found the right plugin yet.
 Has anyone here ever used emacs to analyze information this way?

                              <span>I am trying to define a custom coding system for PETSCII, that currently uses a custom font with the appropriate symbols in a Unicode Private Use Block #xE000-#xE100. Eventually I&#x27;ll switch to the Symbols for Legacy Computing block, but for now...
 Finding useful documentation (or even code samples) for creating coding systems has been difficult - any pointers greatly appreciated. At present, the code below 1) decodes the PETSCII properly, but only 7-bits. Characters &gt;#x7F do not get translated. 2) Does not encode properly at all. Everything below #x7F gets translated to #x20 on writing.
 I&#x27;m being overly-explicit with some of this code, so excuse the verbosity. I did not include the entirety of &#x27;petscii-unicode-map&#x27; here for brevity, but it&#x27;s just a one-to-one mapping (and I&#x27;m hard-coding un-printable symbols ATM):
 (defvar petscii-unicode-map &#x27;((#x0 . #xE41D) (#x1 . #xE41D) (#x2 . #xE41D) (#x3 . #xE41D) [...] (#x3C . #xE03C) (#x3D . #xE03D) (#x3E . #xE03E) (#x3F . #xE03F) (#x40 . #xE000) (#x41 . #xE001) (#x42 . #xE002) (#x43 . #xE003) [...] (#xFC . #xE07C) (#xFD . #xE07D) (#xFE . #xE07E) (#xFF . #xE07F))) 
 Then I define a charset (which seems to work), an encode and decode translation-table, then the coding-system itself.
 (define-charset &#x27;petscii-standard &quot;PETSCII coding&quot; :dimension 1 :code-space [0 255] :map (seq-into (flatten-list petscii-unicode-map) &#x27;vector)) (defvar petscii-decode-table (make-translation-table petscii-unicode-map)) (defvar petscii-encode-table (make-translation-table (mapcar (lambda (v) (cons (cdr v) (car v))) petscii-unicode-map))) (define-coding-system &#x27;standard-petscii &quot;PETSCII coding system&quot; :mnemonic ?P :coding-type &#x27;charset :eol-type &#x27;mac :ascii-compatible-p nil :charset-list &#x27;petscii-standard :decode-translation-table petscii-decode-table :encode-translation-table petscii-encode-table) 
 Any help is greatly appreciated. I&#x27;ve dug through mule-conf.el and a few other bits of existing elisp, to no avail.

                              <span>I posted a week or so ago about a problem with consult-register-load. I get this error when using consult-register-load or consult-register-save. Both of these functions work but they do not display the little mini buffer info with the preview and the optional do what you mean stuff that makes consult-register so great.
 Error running timer: (void-function nil) register-read-with-preview-traditional: Non-character input-event 
 This morning I took another swing at working on tracking down this bug. I put together a basic init.el file and ran emacs with -q -l test.el. Then I used M-x package-install-file. Directed it to the consult folder my regular emacs init file uses and found that consult-register-load works flawlessly. So I can eliminate the possibility that this was a bug in consult conflicting with the fact that I&#x27;m running emacs 30 or that emacs 30 it self had an issue.
 On the emacs wiki page about timers this line jumped out at me. Seems clear that it is the heart of my problem but I don&#x27;t know what to do to try and isolate or resolve it.
  
This predicate function returns non-nil if object is a timer.
  
I don&#x27;t know enough elisp to understand what that means. I&#x27;m also confused by what is going on in consult-register.el. Without a deeper understanding of what the offending functions in consult-register.el are doing. I don&#x27;t know how to proceed. Could someone explain it for me? Any tips on debugging this? Any and all suggestions welcome.
 Full emacs config.

                              <span>This question is just to satisfy my curiosity. Looking in the site-start.d I notice that asy-mode.el is loaded at the start of the load process. As I understand it, this mode is for the editing of asymptote vector graphics files (something I never do) and so I was wondering why it is autoloaded so soon? Does anyone know? Is it required by another crucial package?

                              <span>What are they for? To cause emacs to be dependant on the distro version? I normally use the emacs package manager within emacs.

                              <span>Is there a function which i can use, to select specific git commit for git directory and browse its files in dired-like interface? 
 kinda like a history file browser of that git project
 best answer i found was https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24993868/how-do-you-list-tracked-files-git-ls-files-in-magit:
  
use M-&amp; git ls-files -z | xargs -0 -- ls -ld followed by M-x dired-virtual RET. The latter requires the dired-x library to be loaded.
  
problem with this, is when i open file from that buffer, i want it to open version of that file from that specific git commit, but it opens in current work dir

                              <span>org-transclusion-http is an extension for org-transclusion that lets you transclude content over HTTP. If you have pandoc installed on your system, org-transclusion will convert HTML documents to Org format and transclude them. It handles link anchors (&quot;fragments&quot;) in HTML as well as Org mode documents.
 After installing org-transclusion-http, run M-x org-transclusion-add-all in an org-mode buffer containing the following text:
 # Transclude ~org-mode~ document #+transclude: [[https://ushin.org/software.org#emacs]] # Transclude HTML document #+transclude: [[https://ushin.org/software.html#emacs]] 
 If you are connected to the internet and you have pandoc installed, the contents of those two files should asynchronously load, and the section of each document which matches the #emacs tag will be displayed in place of each #+transclude: link.
 org-transclusion-http is now available on NonGNU ELPA, so you can try it out on Emacs 28+ by running M-x package-refresh-contents then M-x package-install RET org-transclusion-http!

                              <span>I am, I believe, about to embark on a large Emacs project, described a little in this footnote[1]. Let&#x27;s call it Hode. In each hode-mode buffer, there will be some text, and parts of that text will correspond to objects in a TypeDB database. It will need to keep track of (among other things, surely) those correspondences.
 This means I&#x27;ll have to things in memory that are invisible to the user. The only kind of state I&#x27;ve manipulated previously in Emacs is the text itself.
 The only idea I&#x27;ve come up with so far is to define some global variables starting with &quot;hode-state-&quot;, and hope a user doesn&#x27;t clobber those names.
 Is that how it&#x27;s done?
 [1] It will use Emacs as a frontend to a TypeDB database, allowing users to maintain personal knowledge bases, like org-roam but with more structure.

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking for a package that allows the execution and editing of Pharo &quot;scripts&quot; from Emacs and have come across shampoo-mode and Literate-Smalltalk (Github)
 Off the two literate-smalltalk appears to be the more up to date one.
 The links for shampoo-mode are
 project page in melpa,
 Shampoo mode for Emacs,
 Smalltalk image-side server that provides a remote access to an image,
 and Shampoo SqueakSource which seems to have more support for Pharo.
 
 Does anyone have some familiarity with these two packages?

                              <span>I&#x27;d like to announce a new release of csound-expression on hackage. The CE is a music framework for haskell with focus on ease of use and feature rich as it rides on top of the powerful audio programming language Csound. It is a DSL to build Csound programs. So the library embeds Csound in Haskell. 
 It&#x27;s a bug fix release. Many algorithms in the low-level renderer csound-expression-dynamic were rewritten and fixed. In the previous version unforunately there were severe bugs in effectful expressions and in if-then-else blocks. But now they are fixed. 
 Also I&#x27;ve updated the library to include new Csound opcodes (audio processing units from 6.18 version).
 Happy music making with Haskell!
 About the future of the csound-expression:
 I&#x27;ve started the implementation of more tiny csound-core package. It offers a missing layer of low-level building of type-safe Csound expressions. In the previous version I&#x27;ve created lots of abstractions to make music making more pleasant for FP style. But this layering makes it kind of hard to debug rendered code. So I&#x27;d like to create a tiny imperative style core that will allow me to debug produced Csound code. And the rest of the code should be expressed in terms of this library. I&#x27;m not there yet. I&#x27;ve built the core library and it turned out very well. But now I need to rewrite FP abstractions on top of it. I&#x27;m not there yet. But I hope that gradually I will make it. 
 Also I plan to deprecate GUI features as FLTK was deprecated in Csound and it&#x27;s not packaged with Csound anymore. I think maybe it would be better to substitute them with JS+OSC.

                              <span>Does anyone else have this issue? If the cursor is on the far right side of a line which is folded you can&#x27;t move it to the left. It just says &#x27;beginning of line&#x27; at the bottom. 
 I&#x27;m using evil mode and it works when I&#x27;m in insert mode, but not in normal mode. So, maybe it&#x27;s related to evil? I tried to figure it out using chatGPT, but I couldn&#x27;t find a simple answer.

 [edit]
 Here is a screen video capture for those who want to see more in practice. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;WUsgmQjMB6Q
 Some details about what I&#x27;m doing and shortcuts:
 00:00 : navigating and editing trees and list using navigation commands : https://orgmode.org/manual/Motion.html cycling (also works for src blocks) https://orgmode.org/manual/Global-and-local-cycling.html structure editing : https://orgmode.org/manual/Structure-Editing.html 00:16 : adding src block : C- s then type desired language (bash, python, ...) 01:00 : entering a src block editing mode, C-&#x27; then launching python console C-p and select desired code, then send it to console with C-r 01:17 : save and quit src block editing C-&#x27; 01:44 : add time stamp, C-u C-u C-c . 01:50 : cycle through todo-keywords C-c C-t 
 There are tons of other features that I don&#x27;t show, of course. I.e, embedding src block results and plots directly in org mode, jupyter-like style; isolating (sub)tree in buffer; tangle block code; calendar and time alerts; ... I&#x27;m far from exploiting the full potential of orgmode. But bit by bit, it progresses. I would say I usually learn (or rediscover ) one or two new shortcuts/feature a week, on average.
 Being able to I-search a keyword in my whole work is probably one of the most time saving feature of working in a single file. I can easily copy and look up for some code or notes I&#x27;ve written already.

                              <span>My manager informed me that I&#x27;ll be moving to a new team by the end of the year to work mainly with Scala. I have half a year to prepare to that and to be honest I&#x27;ve been avoiding this as the plague because I find Scala utterly complicated. I&#x27;ll dearly miss the simplicity of Go with errors as values and everything being async IO by default.
 My first question is: if you had to move from Go to Scala how it was your journey?
 Second, do you need to deal with exceptions everywhere like in Java doing Scala FP? And, how can I know which function will/can throw an exception? For example, in Scala is pretty normal to consume Java libraries, how can I know if I need to put a try/catch?

                              <span>I&#x27;m having issues with the Svelte lsp server, using emacs 29 w/ nativecomp and lsp-mode:
  
No highlighting or echo area information when hovering over stuff
 The autocomplete is weirdly sluggish 
 If something is lsp-renamed in a .ts file, the changes are not reflected in .svelte files, and vice versa
  
On the other hand, the typescript server is snappy and seems to work as expected, so now I suspect something may be amiss with the svelte server, and/or the lsp integration.
 The problem persists with the following simple config:
 (setq-default package-archives &#x27;((&quot;melpa&quot; . &quot;https://melpa.org/packages/&quot;) (&quot;elpa&quot; . &quot;https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/&quot;) (&quot;org&quot; . &quot;https://orgmode.org/elpa/&quot;)) load-prefer-newer t) (setq-default use-package-always-ensure t) (require &#x27;use-package) (use-package typescript-mode) (use-package web-mode :mode ((&quot;\\.html\\&#x27;&quot; . web-mode) (&quot;\\.svelte\\&#x27;&quot; . svelte-mode)) :config (define-derived-mode svelte-mode web-mode &quot;Svelte&quot;) (setq web-mode-engines-alist &#x27;((&quot;svelte&quot; . &quot;\\.svelte\\&#x27;&quot;)))) (use-package company :config (global-company-mode)) (use-package lsp-mode :commands (lsp) :hook (((typescript-mode svelte-mode) . lsp))) 
 I hope someone can help out, I have no idea how to solve the problem. It seems few people develop svelte using emacs, so it&#x27;s hard to find information

                              <span>Is there a reliable way to set the weight of the default and italic faces dynamically?
 This isn&#x27;t working:
  (set-face-attribute &#x27;default nil :weight &#x27;light) 
 I tried with various fonts including Iosevka and Fira Code. I can set the font to &quot;Light&quot; using the &quot;Options | Set Default Font&quot; menu option. I want to do it in elisp though, to auto-toggle between light and regular depending on whether I&#x27;m using a dark or a light theme. (A lighter weight can look nicer with dark themes.)
 Curiously setting it to a bold weight does work. In one case the font I tried didn&#x27;t even have a bold weight, but Emacs synthesized it. Which is cool, but I can&#x27;t set it to a light weight using elisp.
 I tried using the :fontattribute and building a font spec string manually, but it was inconsistent. Sometimes it would take effect, other times not, and I couldn&#x27;t set the italicface to light and italic.

It helps concentrating on the current task and reminds to turn the clock off on time especially if you are doing your work outside of emacs.

                              <span>Hey fellow Emacs users!
 I’ve been working on a Bash script to simplify running Emacs and Emacsclient, and I wanted to share it with you all. Whether you’re frequently starting and stopping Emacs servers or switching between different profiles, this script can save you time and streamline your workflow.
 Here’s what it does:
  
Start an Emacs server with a specified profile or initialization directory.
 Run Emacsclient in terminal or GUI mode based on provided arguments.
 Kill running Emacs servers easily.
 List available Emacs server socket files.
  
How to use it:
 (assuming you added the script to your path)
 Help Message:
 ec -h 
 Displays the usage message with all available options.
 Script Version:
 ec -v 
 Shows the script version.
 Start Emacs Server with Profile:
 ec -p my-profile 
 Starts the Emacs server with the specified profile.
 Start Emacs Server with Init Directory:
 ec -i /path/to/init-directory 
 Starts the Emacs server with the specified initialization directory.
 Run Emacsclient in Terminal Mode:
 ec -nw 
 Opens Emacsclient in terminal mode.
 Kill Emacs Server:
 ec -k 
 Kills the Emacs server processes.
 List Socket Files:
 ec -l 
 Lists the available socket files for Emacs servers.
 EmacsClient Options are supported
 All the regular emacsclient options are supported, so you can for example specify a different server to run it, for example:
 Create an emacs server in org mode
 emacs --bg-daemon&#x3D;demo-server --init-directory ~/init-directory/testing-org-config 
 use ec to open emacsclient with daemon named demo-server on line 23 of a file
 ec -s demo-server +23 ~/my-file.org

                              <span>The org mode habit tracker is really nice if you&#x27;ve ever used it. It has inspired me to try something similar. However, I don&#x27;t love the Emacs Lisp source code for it, or for org agenda, it looks somewhat involved and painstaking, I was wondering if there are any more high level libraries for creating images in an emacs buffer, in particular colored images (which presumably would have to implement the coloring through font lock? not sure if there&#x27;s a better way)

                              <span>Next month it&#x27;ll be my zettelkasten first anniversary. Thanks to this forum as well, this has been a very prolific year. Since I started my zettelkasten I have produced more than a thousand zettels, but now I&#x27;m struggling with their organisation.
My current workflow consists of: 
To solve my problem I wanted to slightly change my workflow:
Another concern of mine is about the &quot;granularity&quot; of a structure note. Eg. I have a structure note about philosophy that contains lots of zettels, and I want to subdivide it. Should I subdivide it for book, author or topic? I tend to have a topic-first approach, but maybe a book-first or an author-first approach could provide a simpler structure.</span>

                              <span>Hello Emacs Community!,
 I&#x27;m trying to define a complex workflow where:
 I get My Github Issues
 #+name: gitlabGetIssuesAssignedToMe
 #+begin_src sh
 curl --header &quot;PRIVATE-TOKEN: ${GitlabPersonalAccessToken}&quot; &quot;https://gitlab.com/api/v4/issues?scope&#x3D;assigned_to_me&quot;
 #+end_src
 I get a specific Issue via iid.
 #+name: getIssue
 #+begin_src sh :stdin gitlabGetIssuesAssignedToMe() :var iid&#x3D;&quot;&quot;
 jq --arg iid $iid &#x27;.[] | select(.iid &#x3D;&#x3D; ($iid | tonumber))&#x27;
 #+end_src
 I get the description of a specific one via iid too
 #+name: getIssueDescription
 #+begin_src sh :stdin getIssue(iid&#x3D;&quot;2495&quot;)
 jq &#x27;.description&#x27;
 #+end_src
 The problem is that, while this is working:
 +call: getIssue(iid&#x3D;&quot;2495&quot;)
 This is not working, as I&#x27;m still seeing the results of 2495 as in the getIssueDescription definition, I have &quot;2495&quot; still.
 +call:getIssueDescription(iid&#x3D;&quot;2498&quot;)
 I have also tried to put just iid so that I pass it, but no luck.
 So in this case, I want to change the variable of a chain of functions. I&#x27;m still trying but, haven&#x27;t found how...
 Thanks for looking into this specific issue!

                              <span>Hi, has anyone had success using &#x60;eglot-workspace-configuration&#x60; in a &#x60;.dir-locals.el&#x60; to pass configuration to Microsoft&#x27;s PyRight LSP? Am I doing something wrong below or is this not supported by either eglot or pyright?
 I am experienced with directory local variables and elisp, but beginner in pyright and eglot although I have read docs for both.
 ./foo.py:
 import sys import sys print(sys.argv) 
 ./.dir-locals.el:
 ((nil . ((eglot-workspace-configuration . (:python (:reportDuplicateImport t)))))) 
 &#x60;M-x eglot-show-workspace-configuration&#x60; output:
 { &quot;python&quot;: { &quot;reportDuplicateImport&quot;: true } } 
 In this simple case I expect the duplicate &#x60;import sys&#x60; in the python file to be flagged, but it is not, thus pyright is not using the config. It did use the config and flag the expected python line when I tried using the &quot;pyrightconfig.json&quot; file mentioned in pyright docs. So pyrightconfig.json file works, but in this case I want to use eglot-workspace-configuration. In fact I would like to use a hybrid of both (ie pyrightconfig.json checked into shared repo, and eglot-workspace-configuration on my local machine). Any tips? Thanks.

                              <span>Is Emacs good for developing React Native using TypeScript? I see that the front-end folks who use React Native and React with a million new features seem to lean more towards VS Code. Has anyone been developing extensively in React Native, connecting with emulators, dealing with those exotic CSS libraries (Like Tailwind or css modules) for React, etc., and had a good experience?

 Desired Appearance
 Current Appearance
 Bonus: If you know of a way I can remove/modify the last tab-bar separator, I would greatly appreciate your guidance.
 Bonus: Remove last separator
 Would I need to modify the tab-bar format function? Do you have tips on inspecting (similar to using describe-face) the face of clickable/non-editable regions (such as the buffer name on the modeline)?

 I managed to achieve the final goal! Here is a screenshot:

 Original:
 &quot;Hooks are an important mechanism for customizing Emacs. A hook is a Lisp variable which holds a list of functions, to be called on some well-defined occasion. (This is called running the hook.) The individual functions in the list are called the hook functions of the hook. For example, the hook kill-emacs-hook runs just before exiting Emacs (see Exiting Emacs).
 Most hooks are normal hooks. This means that when Emacs runs the hook, it calls each hook function…</span>

                              <span>I am trying out this new &#x27;pattern&#x27; for giving a typed interface on top of Akka actors. Here&#x27;s an example using classic untyped actors (based on https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/actors.html):
 import akka.actor.Actor class MyActor extends Actor { private var num &#x3D; 0 def receive &#x3D; { case &quot;incr&quot; &#x3D;&gt; num +&#x3D; 1 case &quot;decr&quot; &#x3D;&gt; num -&#x3D; 1 case &quot;get&quot; &#x3D;&gt; sender() ! num } } object MyActor { trait Trait { def incr: Unit def decr: Unit def get: Future[Int] } class Client(ref: ActorRef) extends Trait { import akka.pattern.ask override def incr: Unit &#x3D; ref ! &quot;incr&quot; override def decr: Unit &#x3D; ref ! &quot;decr&quot; override def get: Future[Int] &#x3D; (ref ? &quot;get&quot;).mapTo[Int] } } 
 This is inspired by the Erlang/Elixir style of having modules with a &#x27;client&#x27; portion that wraps the actor&#x27;s &#x27;protocol&#x27; ie the messages that it sends or receives, in a normal class with normal methods. This &#x27;client&#x27; class in Scala can also implement an interface which can be used by callers to abstract away the &#x27;implementation detail&#x27; of being an actor under the hood.
 val myActorClient &#x3D; new MyActor.Client(ref) myActorClient.incr myActorClient.decr myActorClient.get.map(println)

                              <span>In case no one else mentioned the $(\LaTeX)$ Knowledge package by Thomas Colcombet, I post it here. The package generates hyperlinks to definitions of terms defined in PDF documents. From the description:

  
As readers and reviewers, we have all been irritated, be it a bit or a lot, by not being able to find easily a key definition that was given sometimes hundred pages before (in a PhD thesis for instance). Using the knowledge package, every use of a concept becomes one click away from its definition (in the electronic version of the document), and an index with all its occurrences can be easily maintained (for the printed version of the document). The longer is the document, the more it improves the reader&#x27;s experience, but it already helps in conference papers.


A draft book written with the knowledge package is My First Category Theory Textbook by Ralph Sarkis.
Zettelkasten.de forum members might find the package particularly helpful for $(\LaTeX)$ mathematics documents, but mathematics isn&#x27;t the only application.</span>

                              <span>Hey all, I wanted to share a successful experience of turning my chaotic voice to text brain dump into zettels using a very simple method.
I was going through my journal which I use for fleeting notes and I found a brain dump that I wanted to process into zettels. I kept struggling with figuring out what is important enough for it&#x27;s own note and what belongs inside another note? Also, how do I want to break up these ideas where there are so many different ways I could do so?
I found a post response by @andang76 where he described the &quot;train of thought&quot; method of brainstorming he uses. Instead of using this to brainstorm, I applied this idea to processing a brain storm and it worked amazingly! I wanted to share it here because it seems like such an obvious and simple way to process your not…</span>

                              <span>Hello!
 I&#x27;ve been playing with FP libraries in Python and JavaScript.
 Because those languages do error handling with their native try catch mechanisms, most of the code I could see that make use of those FP library looks like the following.
 Isn&#x27;t it strange to mix both try/catch and the Either monad?
 I get it. It allows us to keep a full FP error handling core and logic.
 But the function implementations still make use of try catch. There are obviously no way around it.
 Those libraries can be used as FP wrappers.
 I guess the same applies in Scala when using Java libraries.
 What are you thoughts about it?

                              <span>Habits are displayed separately from other tasks on the TODO list. This is great, I like the consistency tracker, but I can&#x27;t figure out how to schedule it. Say I want to run every few days, but I also want to schedule my next run for 4pm on Tuesday. Is there a way to switch between two modes, one where habits are displayed in a block with their consistency graphs, the other where habits are displayed as ordinary TODO items with a repeating block?

                              <span>in neovim there are these plugins like flash.nvim or leap.nvim that instead of using relative line jumping or using the / key to search for your word, you can just trigger the plugin and type two characters from the word your are looking for, the plugin will then suggest another third character when you press it you will jump to your word.
 flash.nvim do other cool stuff like selecting a function or an expression by using treesitter (i really don&#x27;t know how it works really), like you would trigger the plugin in another way and then you will see characters suggestions to where to jump or select.
 is there something like this in eamcs? i&#x27;m sure there is but i didn&#x27;t know what to type in google to find anything
 thanks in advance

                              <span>Sometimes, when I am working on mixed language projects, I find that just inserting std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;we are here 1\n&quot;, std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;we are here 2\n&quot; works well. I copy the first print, then paste it where I want, increment the number, etc.
 Is there a way to write a function where every time I paste something, it increments the number for me? Optionally, does something like this already exist?
 p.s.: I have a snippet where I can increment the number under point, but that means navigating to the number and invoking that function. I would rather keep pasting the snippet and have the correct number show up. Probably a global counter which gets incremented on paste.

                              <span>I have started using Emacs 6 months ago and I love it! I use it for everything, from keeping notes, scheduling tasks to keeping bookmarks.
 Recently, after reading an article on using Emacs as a password manager through auth-info and epa packages, I started to implement it in my own workflow. 
 I wonder if this is seen as a security risk for some reason. I know Emacs is open source and packages are open source but there are many packages one uses and it is not possible to audit everything even if you knew Elisp to that extent (which I don&#x27;t). I am not using some obscure code but lots of some rather well known packages mainly related to org.
 I am somewhat worried that if I use epa package and decrypt some stuff in Emacs that there will be a small posibility that one of tens of packages is spying on me and may see the decrypted data. It seems like a case of paranoia to me but I&#x27;m curious to what your thoughts on this are.

                              <span>is there a way to print variables that watched through display in pdb. Say if I have a large array A that needs to be watched in whole form A not just particular element in A[i]. Is there a way to even display them using matplotlib for watching matrices.

                              <span>Hello! Sorry for yet another &quot;why doesn&#x27;t my shit work&quot; post, but why doesn&#x27;t my shit work.
 I&#x27;m using doom emacs config, with Emacs 29.1
 I have successfully enabled treesitter for typescript/tsx, javascript, and rust, so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s my treesitter config...
 Switching from go-mode to go-ts-mode drops syntax higlighting, but all of the other aspects of treesit mode, like treesit-explore-mode work. Interestingly, nil is highlighted in my .go files, but nothing else is.
 I know that typescript/tsx have a known bug that requires downgrading to a specific version, but I don&#x27;t know how anyone discovered that bug so that I can replicate and perhaps downgrade go as well.
 I&#x27;m pretty new to emacs, and have only really started scratching the surface of how to customize it to my liking, so tips on how to debug would also be super helpful!
 treesit config:
 (setq treesit-language-source-alist &#x27;((go &quot;https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-go&quot;) (gomod &quot;https://github.com/camdencheek/tree-sitter-go-mod&quot;))) (setq treesit-font-lock-level 4) 
 maybe relevant go config?:
 (setq lsp-go-use-gofumpt t) (eval-after-load &#x27;flycheck &#x27;(add-hook &#x27;flycheck-mode-hook #&#x27;flycheck-golangci-lint-setup)) (add-hook! &#x27;go-mode-hook (which-function-mode 1) (flycheck-select-checker &#x27;golangci-lint) (add-hook! &#x27;before-save-hook #&#x27;lsp-format-buffer t t) (add-hook! &#x27;before-save-hook #&#x27;lsp-organize-imports t t)) 
 Let me know if there&#x27;s anything else I can include that might be screwing with treesitter :)

 https://github.com/kiwiz/gkeepapi
 On my phone, I use Google Keep as a thoughtdump.. (for example: when im commuting and remembered about something important, i open my phone, click on the Gkeep widget, write stuff down, then turn off my phone)
 basically all the tasks and ideas that come to me are written down there. I also use google keep when im using the school computer and want to pass or receive information through my google account. I want to know if it&#x27;s possible for me to integrate this api to my emacs to improve my workflow. im not yet knowledgeable in cs to understand how APIs work :(

                              <span>I swear to god, it can&#x27;t be that hard. But apparently i&#x27;m to stupid for this.
 What i want is, to use ansible-language-server in yaml files and have ansible-lint hints, but no automatic formating. I&#x27;m trying to make this work with lsp-mode or eglot. I prefer lsp-mode for the breadcrumbs and how it&#x27;s configured, but if i get what i want out of eglot, that&#x27;s fine too.
 First of all, i remap yaml to yaml-ts-mode
 (use-package yaml-mode :mode (&quot;\\.yml\\&#x27;&quot; . yaml-ts-mode) (&quot;\\.[0-9][0-9][0-9]\\&#x27;&quot; . yaml-ts-mode) (&quot;\\.[0-9][0-9]\\&#x27;&quot; . yaml-ts-mode) (&quot;\\.[0-9]\\&#x27;&quot; . yaml-ts-mode) ) 
 The lsp-mode setup i tried looks like this at the moment:
 (use-package ansible :hook (yaml-ts-mode . ansible)) (use-package lsp-mode :custom (lsp-keymap-prefix &quot;C-c l&quot;) (lsp-yaml-server-command &#x27;(&quot;ansible-language-s…</span>

 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; ❯ swaymsg -t get_tree | jq -r &#x27;.. | select(.app_id? &#x3D;&#x3D; &quot;emacs&quot;) | .app_id | ascii_downcase &#x27; emacs
 ❯ la /run/user/1000/emacs/server srwx------ 1 iamkarlson iamkarlson 0 Jun 13 08:59 /run/user/1000/emacs/server
 ❯ swaymsg -t get_tree | jq -r &#x27;.. | select(.app_id? &#x3D;&#x3D; &quot;emacs&quot;) | .app_id | ascii_downcase &#x27; emacs emacs
 ❯ la /run/user/1000/emacs/server srwx------ 1 iamkarlson iamkarlson 0 Jun 13 08:59 /run/user/1000/emacs/server &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 As you can see before I ran emacsclient there was already existing emacs frame. According to the help:  -r, --reuse-frame Create a new frame if none exists, otherwise use the current Emacs frame 
 What am I doing wrong? Why emacsclient cannot reuse the frame?

                              <span>To be honest, I don&#x27;t know why only now, after years of using Emacs, I have realized that I have never attempted to figure this out, in many regards, quite important feature of any text editor.
 I want to find a good, predictable way to jump between places. Not just within a single buffer or same window - between windows, tabs and frames. 
 So this is what I want:
  
I would be typing something in one buffer (matter of fact I&#x27;m typing this very message in an Emacs buffer), let&#x27;s call it t1/w1/b1, okay?
 
Then I would move the cursor to the top of the buffer, to fix a mistake.
 
Then for whatever reason I would switch to another window, right next to my current window&amp;buffer - let&#x27;s call it t1/w2/b2, and then type some other stuff.
 
Then, I would switch to another tab (I&#x27;m using tab-bar-mode) where it finds t2/w1/b1
 
 Now, is there a way to:
  
Pressing a key to jump to the previous tab, window, and buffer? So in my case pressing the key would take me first to t1/w2/b2, pressing it again to t1/w1/b1 at the top of b1, and then if I press again - to the end of it.
 
Seeing and using the jumps history in the minibuffer.
 
 Is there a good package that works this way? Emacs has powerful position system, how is something like this is not a thing? Or maybe I just don&#x27;t know about it yet? 
 Doom Emacs uses better-jumper, but it works within a single window or buffer, it can&#x27;t take you across different windows, tabs and frames. And because of that, it feels super unpredictable, I never know where better-jumper-jump-backward would take me next.
 There are Evil marks and built-in Emacs markers, but they also don&#x27;t seem to have cross-window-tab-frame functionality.
 What is you recommendation for this problem?

This post might seem unnecessary to alot of u and i agree but when u experience the pain of many years of terrible docs for different technologies u truly learn to appreciate this stuff.

                              <span>TL;DR: any quick and dirty way to say… convert this org buffer with eMacs faces into the html equivalent? (In terms of look). I’m tempted to just share screenshots but would lose links and people would think me mad.
 —-
 I’m exporting to html because I’ve failed at setting up pdf export on my Mac. I use code blocks to get something like a breakout text block… but all white space seems to get eaten and it just gets very “wall of text”. And the text blocks are full screen/scale but the text wraps at my eMacs width. 
 Can I get it to just export a look like the eMacs faces? Italics get broken in quote boxes. Newlines without an extra line get wrapped into a wall. Etc etc, I’m sure we’re all familiar with this. 
 I eventually want to learn how to format correctly and get it all working… but I don’t want to delay sharing my doc for the week that will probably take me to figure out. ;)
 Any pro tips appreciated. Is html just the wrong way and I need to bite the LaTex bullet? It was crazy how funky it seemed to be to get it going. 
 Thanks.

 I thought everything somehow fixed itself.. but it started happening again. 
 This time however, I was able to get some crash logs and it looks like it is related to corfu?

                              <span>Hey Emacs fellows,
 It is my first post here, and i want to introduce the devcontainer-feature-emacs-lsp-bridge project! This feature brings auto-completion to your Emacs setup within development containers, using the powerful lsp-bridge.
 What is it?
 The devcontainer-feature-emacs-lsp-bridge automates the setup of language servers supported by lsp-bridge inside your devcontainers. By using Nix packages, it ensures a consistent and reproducible environment, making it easier than ever to get started with Emacs and language servers in a containerized development environment.
 Key Features:
  
Auto-completion in devcontainer
 Support for multiple languages
  
Check out the repository for more details.

                              <span>I keep noticing that some Emacs users seem to not be familiar with keyboard macros, and even those that are familiar with them aren&#x27;t always familiar with the fact that there&#x27;s a counter facility associated with them so you can do things like giving every #define in a block of C code a distinct associated value or what have you in a few keystrokes.
 Multiple cursors are sometimes the right tool, but some of the things people do with them are probably better done with keyboard macros. If you don&#x27;t know about them, you should.

                              <span>Using straight.el I installed the newest version of org-mode from the tecosaur repo and I also installed pdf-tools. Whenever I tried viewing a pdf for the first time, I would get a void variable error for org-format-latex-header. Even though this is declared as an obsolte variable in org-compat.el, its replacement is not defined at the time the pdf is opened. I am not sure what is the canonical way to solve this. Should I just (require &#x27;org-latex-preview) in my init.el or is there a cleaner approach like passing some parameter to use-package?

                              <span>Hello Emacs Community!,
 I&#x27;ve going around my head and investigating as for a way to finally implement all my email setup in Emacs, which is:
  
3 Gmail accounts that I can implement with .authinfo and application passwords
 
2 Gmail account that I can&#x27;t
 
1 Microsoft Exchange account where I can&#x27;t use app passwords and, when configuring davmail, I needed authorization (actually asking for it)
 
 My problem is the latter two, where in case I got lucky and manage to fight my case and get my app password in the Exchange one, I would still will be unable to use the 2 Gmail accounts that don&#x27;t have application passwords activated.
 I could configure Davmail for exchange, now, not sure about the other two gmail accounts... I think davmail only works for Microsoft.
 Is there, perhaps something like davmail that I can use across all of my accounts?, since application passwords aren&#x27;t considered secure, in the case these are eliminated, I wouldn&#x27;t want my accounts to stop working...
 How complicated would be to implement this? (elisp developer), is there perhaps a protocol that is not implemented in Emacs?, something like ouath2 which I think has a package. How technically complicated is this and, how much would it take?. Or is there perhaps, a different more updated way that I don&#x27;t know of?.

                              <span>Running EMACS 29.3, I get the messaage package cl is deprecated on start (been going on for a while--it was deprecated in 28 or 27, IIRC). I believe this is associated with the [simplenote2](https://github.com/alpha22jp/simplenote2.el) package. I use one of it&#x27;s functions (creating a note), I get the message format: Symbol’s function definition is void: math-fixnum. If I create a note on the browser, I can edit it in EMACS to my heart&#x27;s content. I just can&#x27;t make a new one. 
 My suspicion, as I said, is it&#x27;s related to the cl package. I was going to try to dig into the code to see if there is a fix, but I wanted to ask before digging into that: is there some standard fix/best practice/shim that can be applied to fix this?

                              <span>Hi folks,
 My talk &quot;Functional Programming: Failed Successfully&quot; from LambdaConf 2024 is now published online.
 This is my attempt to understand why functional languages are not popular despite their excellence. The talk&#x27;s other title is &quot;Haskell Superiority Paradox.&quot;
 Beware, the talk is spicy and, I hope, thought-provoking.
 I&#x27;ll be happy to have a productive discussion on the subject!

 Are there any tools or resources that can help me get really good at it? Specifically, I&#x27;m looking for MOOCs or courses similar to the ones from the University of Helsinki. Any recommendations for the best ways to learn and master Scala would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!

This is yet another opportunity to share with your friends what you are working on. Add to this discussion by telling us about your zettelkasten journey. Share with us what you&#x27;re learning. Sharing helps me and, hopefully, you, too. It helps us clarify our goals and visualize our thinking. And sometimes, a conversation sparks a magical moment where we can dive into an idea worth exploring. I&#x27;d love to hear more from you.   🫵🏼
Here is a report on the ideas I&#x27;m exploring with my ZK and why I&#x27;m here:
The difference between who I am now and who I was five years ago is largely due to how I&#x27;ve spent my time along the way.

How does my note-taking tie into my writing? More intimately, how do ideas get into my thinking? They do so in two ways: fast and slow. The adage, &quot;Nothi…</span>

                              <span>I don&#x27;t fully use all parts of a zettelkasten but I am trying to get better at making my notes atomic. This was one of the first notes I ever wrote but the more i learn about zettelkasten the more I think that this is more of a mini-essay. I think many of my notes are more of mini-essays rather than individual zettels. If so, how would I turn this into individual zettels? How do I know how far to break something down and when does it get too much? Sometimes I feel like every sentence could be turned into a zettel.
Side note: I use links instead of tags for categorization - not sure if I love this method but it&#x27;s whats been working for a bit.

With the availability of far more powerful free and open source NLP models, has any attempt been made to either replace (don&#x27;t think there are any models that are GPL freindly, yet) or supplement Eliza on emacs (a.k.a M-x doctor)?

                              <span>I work on a lot of parallel features in the same very large git repo, so I&#x27;ve been making use of git worktrees and treating each worktree as a separate projectile project. Usually the worktree is named ~/reponame/feature_im_working_on. 
 However, because the repo is so big, and because the build cache takes so long to initialize, I don&#x27;t want to create a new worktree every time I start a new feature. mv&#x27;ing the worktree unfortunately breaks the build cache, for reasons of stupid build system that&#x27;s out of my control. What I&#x27;d really like to do is have ~/reponame.real/a ~/reponame.real/b ... and symlink those to ~/reponame/my_feature. But projectile and project.el notice that its a symlink and name the project ~/reponame.real/a. I&#x27;ve been looking for a way to prevent this behavior, and just use the symlink as the project name, and I haven&#x27;t found it. Has anyone else done something like this with their workflow? Or do I need to hack the project.el source and add this?

                              <span>I started using Eshell a few months ago and by and large I like it. I really like having eat-eshell-mode enabled, which means if the command I run wants to be interactive, I get a terminal emulator right there! So seamless! So nice!
 One area I wish could be smarter is completions. I use corfu and cape; I would love it if Eshell were super smart about completing commands, sub-commands (like with git), control flags, etc. I have some configuration around this, but I&#x27;m not happy with it.
 How do you configure Eshell and your completion-at-point mechanisms to be as smart as possible?

  (add-hook &#x27;vterm-mode-hook (lambda () (set (make-local-variable &#x27;buffer-face-mode-face) &#x27;(:foreground &quot;white&quot; :background &quot;black&quot;)) (buffer-face-mode t)) ) 
 but it doesn&#x27;t work. I also tried face-remap-add-relative, but it doesn&#x27;t work either. Does anyone has a solution for this? Thanks.

                              <span>Hi all,
 I am trying to establish a LaTeX workflow, and ideally would like to use pdf-tools (or something similar) because well, everything works that way all within emacs. However, the rendered pdf doesn&#x27;t feel quite snappy and fast as a standard pdf viewer like Zathura or even firefox&#x27;s pdf viewer.
 Is this a known issue with pdf-tools, or is there something that I would have to change in the config to make it work seamlessly with emacs and auctex?

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;ve been away from emacs for a while but am helping a user get access to a package archive (melpa) and the only way out is through an authenticating proxy. I found a discussion on stackoverflow suggesting a config like this: (setq url-proxy-services &#x27;((&quot;no_proxy&quot; . &quot;\(localhost\|10.*\)&quot;) (&quot;http&quot; . &quot;proxy.com:8080&quot;) (&quot;https&quot; . &quot;proxy.com:8080&quot;)))
 (setq url-http-proxy-basic-auth-storage (list (list &quot;proxy.com:8080&quot; (cons &quot;Input your LDAP UID !&quot; (base64-encode-string &quot;LOGIN:PASSWORD&quot;))))) 
 (I can find similar examples elsewhere also)
 ... the url-proxy-services seems to work, as I can see the request hit the proxy. But the url-http-proxy-basic-auth-storage seems to not work, as the proxy logs include a DENY with &quot;Authentication required&quot;, and when I look at the traffic with the request to the proxy, it doesn&#x27;t include any authentication.
 Has anyone had any success getting this working? It&#x27;s emacs 27.2 on OpenSuSE.
 Thanks

                              <span>Hi. I am using borg for package management for my Emacs config. I&#x27;ve been thinking about incorporating some TDD into my Emacs config. I want to try out Ecukes, but it doesn&#x27;t seem too compatible with Borg. Whenever I try to run &#x27;eask install-deps&#x27;, it gives the error &quot;Package not installable &#x27;ecukes&#x27;; make sure the package archive (source) is included&quot;. I managed to trace the error to the following function in eask in lisp/_prepare.el:
 (defun eask-package-installable-p (pkg) &quot;Return non-nil if package (PKG) is installable.&quot; (assq (eask-intern pkg) package-archive-contents)) 
 Since I use Borg, I don&#x27;t appear to be setting the variable package-archive-contents. What would be the right way to go about solving this issue?

                              <span>Consult has recently stopped displaying the register list when I use my keybinding for consult-register-load. The function still works if I remember the binding I tied to the register but I get this error if I wait for the mini buffer to populate and the preview to start.
 Error running timer: (void-function nil) 
 Anybody have any ideas? I looked at the register.el file but I&#x27;m not good enough with elisp to do more than guess at what is causing the problem. I&#x27;ve included my consult settings from my init file in case I&#x27;m missing a setting. It worked for months without but I&#x27;ve recently begun pulling from the github to stay more up to date on my emacs packages. I don&#x27;t remember if this started after an update.

                              <span>Hi, I have some experience with Java Springboot &amp; wanted to improve on that. But my project got changed which has data pipelines work now. (Azure Databricks pipelines) Should I ask for release in the project? Or side by side prepare for interviews? I am in service based company &amp; fearing of going to bench. Please suggest.
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>Hey, we&#x27;ll continue exploring Lean Scala tomorrow at 12 AM CEST. There are some interesting challenges in PRs that improve safety in Ox and I&#x27;d like to tackle them with you.
 On the previous stream we got paging done in Scala.today and this week we&#x27;ll try to get the basic set of functionalities complete for prod deployment.
 If you have any questions, suggestions, complaints regarding Scala, Scala tooling, infra as code tool Besom, VirtusLab&#x27;s work on Scala and such, fire away in the chat, I&#x27;ll be happy to answer anything.

                              <span>I have a question regarding how to handle enums on a code that is deployed on different situations.
 Think of &quot;region/State&quot; field, they are of course fixed (at least in the short term) but different on each country. I can see two different ways to handle it:
  
Manually change the file with the enum, simple
 
Keep them on a database and use set to generate the code automatically, cam make people nervous with this self-modifying code thing
 
 What would be the preferred approach in Scala?
 Thanks

                              <span>I have a parser for user input in a text adventure game, and I would like it to operate on a list of words instead of a String. What is the easiest way to parse a [String]? I am having trouble figuring out, e.g., how to (1) run the parser, and (2) how to consume an individual String or a [String] from the input.
 More generally, what is the easiest way to use Parsec when the input is a list of a Token type instead of a list of Char?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve finished reading Learn You a Haskell and I&#x27;m currently following a tutorial on monad transformers I found online. The exercise is implementing MaybeT.
 The author makes MaybeT an instance of MonadTrans as follows:
 instance MonadTrans MaybeT where lift &#x3D; MaybeT . (liftM Just) 
 I&#x27;m a little confused initially, so I open my code editor and get the type annotation for lift, which makes it clear instantly: it takes a value in the base monad to produce a value in the transformed monad, with that same base and Maybe as a precursor.
 So I implement it on my own:
 lift :: (Monad m) &#x3D;&gt; m a -&gt; MaybeT m a lift x &#x3D; MaybeT $ do x&#x27;  x 
 And then the thought occurs to me that lift could be implemented generally, like so:
 lift x &#x3D; MonadT $ do return  x 
 But then the author asks, as an exercise: why is it that the lift function has to be defined separately for each monad, whereas liftM can be defined in a universal way?
 So I know I must&#x27;ve gotten something wrong somewhere here; but where exactly? Is it that using return makes sense in the context of Maybe, but it doesn&#x27;t in some other monad?

                              <span>I am a complete newbie to emacs/doom emacs. Trying to migrate from vim and build a org mode note taking workflow.
 These auto suggestions/completions are very annoying. I don&#x27;t understand emacs enough (yet). How would I disable these? In the future, how could I go about looking for help about visual elements like this from within emacs?
 Screenshot: https://imgur.com/a/8V8MOs7
 Edit for more info:
 I did think it was coming from the company package so I have it commented out and still the completions continue to show. Here&#x27;s my init.el snippet: https://imgur.com/CmKvnD0, and here&#x27;s the output of M-x describe-mode which shows that company is active: https://imgur.com/a/m1c407M (this is after doom sync, full restart of emacs)
 Apparently M-x company-mode toggles it and then the suggestions go away, but that only seems like a local change. Could you help me understand what is happening?

 Hello, I recently wanted to try emacs, last night it worked great, but today I got the blue screen out of nowhere and when I wanted to open emacs again I got that, should I reinstall it or what is the problem? By the way, I&#x27;m super new, beyond reading the documentation they recommend

                              <span>The math symbols are (way) smaller than the default font.
 Recently, I&#x27;ve been fighting with org-pretty-entities to customize some behaviors. My latest endeavor is &quot;why the UTF-8 character for math symbol are so small compared to the default font?&quot;. FYI, this happens in org-mode and LaTeX-mode.
 When looking into the characters itself, some clues I&#x27;ve gathered:
  
the faces applied are font-latex-math-face and font-latex-sedate-face. Unfortunately, changing the height in any of those cause other parts to be comically large (math-face is also applied to the rest of the math block, sedate-face is applied to any latex command like \underbar).
 
the font used to display those characters is mac-ct:-*-Apple Symbols-medium-normal-normal-*-12-*-*-*-p-0-iso10646-1 despite my default supporting it (both mono and variable pitch are nerd font).
 
 Right now I am mostly suspecting the issue is the font that is being applied, but I am not sure how to fix it. Even when using (set-face-attribute &#x27;font-latex-math-face nil :family &quot;NotoSans Nerd Font&quot;), it keeps using the aforementioned font.
 Actually, the describe-char gives me the following info (some kinda of character composition? Not really that expert in Emacs):
 display: composed to form &quot;\alpha&quot; (see below) Composed with the following character(s) &quot;alpha&quot; by the rule: (?α) The component character(s) are displayed by these fonts (glyph codes): α: mac-ct:-*-Apple Symbols-medium-normal-normal-*-12-*-*-*-p-0-iso10646-1 (#xA1E) 
 Any help would be appreciated.

                              <span>I see a lot of modes for programming languages. &quot;rust-mode&quot; &quot;python-mode&quot; &quot;this-mode&quot; &quot;that-mode&quot; and I don&#x27;t really understand why I would need them and how I could setup my dev environment without them.
 I like to keep my non built-in package count very, very, lean. I understand that there are probably some practical benefits to using these programming language specific modes but I just don&#x27;t like the idea of picking a package for every programming language, learning all the complexities of each of them, and using LSP, and using tree-sitter. It just seems like a lot.
 I also don&#x27;t know how to autmatically enable LSP and tree-sitter when editing certain file types without hooking into these modes.
 I&#x27;m very new and just looking for some Emacs wisdom. Thank you.

 FWIW I&#x27;m using emacs-plus on mac, but this seems to be noticed by others too. E.g. https://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2024-06/msg00012.html
 Applause to our devs who support such amazing software on their free time!

 What are you favorite Emacs spaced repetition packages/flows? Do they also extend to iOS?
 Regardless of whether or not your workflow extends to mobile, what&#x27;s your favourite Emacs package for spaced repetition?
 Currently playing with org-drill and anki-editor to get a feel for these too. Any other I should consider?

                              <span>Please skip this reading, it&#x27;s just a message about me and Emacs.
 I was ready to write a rant.
 Then I gave up and started to breathe and think.
 I&#x27;ve been an Emacs user for a couple of years and have learned a lot but I&#x27;m still pretty dissatisfied.
 But dissatisfied with what? Not about Emacs. Not about the packages I use. The truth is that I&#x27;m dissatisfied with myself using Emacs, mostly because I&#x27;m lazy, that&#x27;s the sad truth. Emacs is not for lazy people like me. Emacs is a demanding teacher. It requires you to be focused, focused and disciplined. So I decided to completely change my approach. I stopped compulsively trying any piece of package I found on Reddit. I decided to read and study Lisp, starting from the basics, the commands and the basic architecture.
 My frustration is driven by my ignorance. Above all.
 Emacs isn&#x27;t for me when I think I can find a baked solution on satckoverflow.
 Emacs is not for me if I expect to have every package well documented in detail.
 Emacs isn&#x27;t for me when I think one package can solve all my problems.
 Emacs is not for me if I think Emacs can organize chaos in my head.
 But I also found the main problem in Emacs: it causes dependency.
 Once you try it you can&#x27;t stop using it, you can&#x27;t stop thinking about it, you can&#x27;t stop trying to find new solutions. Learning Emacs must be done in an organized and programmatic manner.
 I&#x27;m not a developer, nor a programmer, I&#x27;m mostly an aspiring programmer (I use R and a little Python), but the way Emacs forces me to stay focused on what I&#x27;m doing, to organize my notes, my documents, my GTD is something new and somehow irreplaceable.
 Thank you all. Thanks Emacs. And sorry for the unnecessary message.

                              <span>I have enabled pop in my gmail account and have the following in my .gnus:
 (setq gnus-select-method &#x27;(nnnil &quot;&quot;)) ;; Define how Gnus is to read your mail. We read mail from ;; your ISP’s POP server. (setq mail-sources &#x27;((pop :server &quot;pop.gmail.com&quot; :port 995 :user &quot;my@mail.com :stream ssl))))) ;; Say how Gnus is to store the mail. We use nnml groups. (setq gnus-secondary-select-methods &#x27;((nnml &quot;&quot;))) 
 When I launch gnus, I am prompted for my password, and then dumped into an empty buffer with a minibuffer message saying &quot;no news is good news&quot;. I get the same behavior using the wrong password too, so I am not even sure if it is trying to connect to the server. Those options in my mail-sources are what is given to me by Gmail when I look into their &quot;Configuring your email client&quot; instructions. How do I debug this?

                              <span>I enjoy the code-writing experience Emacs and the community provides. But this is the 8th year since I joined the party and I still feel overwhelmed. Usually when I write code, random &quot;problems&quot; still show up here and there, even I have &quot;solved&quot; a lot in the past.
 By &quot;problem&quot;, I mean issues, warnings, behaviors that don&#x27;t work the way I like, configurations I have to choose and balance, even functionalities I used to know but forget their shortcuts, function names or triggers.
 If I ignore those &quot;problems&quot;, they will just stay there and continue to popup every now and then until I upgrade the whole packages and hoping those problems get automatically solved.
 If I solve them, it usually take some time which will interrupt my normal workflow. This is annoying.
 There are two solutions I can think of:
  
Either &quot;problems&quot; get fewer as time goes (which is usually not the case). or
 I get control over Emacs and can solve every &quot;problem&quot; really quickly.
  
In terms of option 2, what can I do? Should I
  
get better at common lisp?
 read more packages&#x27; source code?
 remember more built-in elisp functions?
 write a package from start?
 just spare a fixed amount of time fixing Emacs problem every day?
  
What&#x27;s your experience and solution? What&#x27;s your advice to people like me?

                              <span>basically the title. I&#x27;ve searched for it everywhere but with no avail. I like how emacs NANO has the modeline on top, although I could not find any way to do it with other modelines.
 I&#x27;m using doom emacs btw if that&#x27;s important

                              <span>I have been an Evil user for a while, but I am playing around with meow and it seems extremely interesting. However, there are a couple of Evil&#x27;s functionalities that are essential to me, and I could not find an obvious equivalents in meow. These are:
  
Jump lists (C-oand C-ishortcuts in Evil)
 Jump to definition
  
I am wondering if you guys have any insight on how to get such functionalities in meow.

                              <span>I have corfu and cape installed, but this only gives me some very basic completions. I would like, for instance, to have type info (whether a completion is a function, variable, or macro, etc), or for the ui to only suggest valid completions (not variables out of scope), some linting would be nice too where it indicates potential problems. Essentially, i am looking for an lsp experience for elisp

For context, I&#x27;m pursuing a Ph.D. in Computer Science.

                              <span>In lsp-mode (or any other Emacs cases), I can use lsp-rename to rename a var/id, all references being updated automatically. Now I want to modify a function&#x27;s signature, e.g. adding an argument, in a way similar lsp-rename. Anyone knows how to to that, thanks.

                              <span>I have been using Obsidian / VSCode for many years now, but wanted to &#x27;get the hang of&#x27; Emacs to see why it is regarded as the most efficient way to manage code/info. The last time I used Emacs was in the 90&#x27;s but I don&#x27;t recall it being extra special at the time. (I probably wasn&#x27;t looking at all the features though)
 I am feeling good about Emacs now - I find myself working pretty easily with it, and am finally getting the hang of some of the shortcuts (it was really difficult at the start to not C V )
 CSV editing is great - columns can be aligned easily
 Dired mode is the real bonus - apart from the initial oddness of clicking a folder and having it open in the next buffer, I am now loving it. It is really quick to jump around and edit multiple files, and the directory list itself is great to copy quickly from (making a lot of tiny CSV files). The marking of files via regexp is fantastic, and there are so many little things that make working just that bit easier.
 So, I have uninstalled VSCode and am using Emacs full time for coding now (still using Obsidian - the markdown links are a bit borked so I need to do some scripting to convert them so they work nicely)

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m just getting started with learning emacs and I&#x27;ve been watching some of SystemCrafters to start building my config to understand this software better. 
 I installed the GUI version on windows 10 and one thing I have trouble figuring out is how to make the cursor position visible as in the lower part of this image which is taken from a screenshot of &quot;Emacs from Scratch&quot; 
 I would like to have something similar so I can find my position in the buffer. Unless I type something I do not know where in the line my cursor is (as in the upper part of the image)
 So far I only managed to set the hl-line-mode on so I can at least find the line I&#x27;m in, but several things I tried to put in my config that I found in various forums led me to believe that I perhaps do not know the correct terminology for this setting.
 I tried
 (setq-default cursor-type block) 
 and 
 (setq make-pointer-invisible nil) 
 and tried changing the cursor color, but it didn&#x27;t make it visible. 
 Any help would be appreciated, I&#x27;m sorry for asking such a basic question but I could not figure it out with googling it.

 Coming from a vim background, it is pretty straightforward to specify text wrapping of certain number of characters for specific filetypes. Is there a way to achieve this in emacs?
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I have released version 0.6.0 of Kele, the spritzy Kubernetes management package for Emacs. Changelog here.
 Note: This release bumps the minimum required version of Emacs to 29.
 This release introduces the notion of kind-specific keybindings. Some resources have special &quot;actions&quot; associated with them, e.g. &quot;restarting&quot; Deployments or getting logs from Pods. kele-resource now has a dedicated column for these keybindings that, when defined, are dynamically filled in based on the selected resource kind. For now, there is only one resource-specific keybinding—R to restart a Deployment. Try s-k deployments to check it out.

 In addition, individual bindings within kele-resource are disabled based on your permissions for the given context/cluster. In other words, if you don&#x27;t have permission to list Pods within the selected cluster, Kele will disable the l keybinding with a helpful message.

 Lastly, this release fleshes out the resource listing functionality. Some highlights:
  
In addition to opening a resource from the list view (RET), you can now also delete/kill the resource at point with k;
 The list view now shows the owner resource(s) for every list item; hitting RET with your cursor over the owner cell will instead open the owning resource;
 The list view now supports listing across all namespaces.

 For more details, see the Kele documentation. As always, please open an issue for any peculiar behavior you notice, or feel free to start a discussion if you&#x27;d like to give general feedback or throw ideas around.
 Enjoy!

                            <span class="media-object__text">
                              <span>So I&#x27;ve noticed that recording a macro when having a special input-method enabled (say TeX) and using isearch, the macro is terminated by ringing of the bell. I&#x27;ve found that one of the functions called is isearch-with-input-method (isearch-x.el), and it calls exit-minibuffer; commenting out that call, even though some things behave funny, at least doesn&#x27;t terminate the macro. It also works if I disable the input-method temporarily, then use isearch, and simply turn it back on if I have to input something specific to the input-method; that however rules out any searching for special characters, which isn&#x27;t ideal at all. Is there a way to remedy this? It seems strange to me that one shouldn&#x27;t be able to record a macro simply due to using an input method... Help greatly appreciated! I&#x27;m using Emacs 30 from homebrew-emacs-plus.

                              <span>I have been watching tsoding (btw reallly recommend his channel if you’re into software engineering) and I came across some manipulation he did with emacs. See the clipped video. I have been trying to search about how to do it. Does anybody know? Also, I have been trying to learn how to « learn » more effectively. This is a perfect example of something I see is possible but I don’t know how to search emacs docs for it. Would you mind sharing your usual flow of search?
 Thanks people and have a nice week end !

 I usually set PYTHONPATH as follow to make the module available for importing like this

                              <span>I was reading that doom emacs is easier to get into that vanilla emacs for vim users, so I went through the installation and everything looks good with doom doctor. 
 But, when I start up emacs, it doesn&#x27;t seem like evil-mode works at all!
 If doom emacs is installed correctly, should evil-mode be working when I start up emacs? Are there commands I can run inside of emacs to check if evil-mode is installed and enabled?

I am facing the following problem: I have a structure note on Financial Reporting, and I am trying to find an efficient way to display all the contents of the links of that structure note in a single document. I currently do that by manually opening notes and copy pasting their title and contents in the end of the file. I would really appreciate that if someone could point me to a less-manual way of doing that!</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;ve long lurked this forum and related spaces, but I thought I&#x27;d join the discussions from here on out.
I am an early stage PhD student for computer science.
I&#x27;ve been using a Zettelkasten-esq system in Typst (a LaTeX alternative) to keep track of my research, coursework, and a few serious hobbies.
My current in-Zettelkasten obsessions include disparate but I-swear-they-make-sense-in-my-head subjects such as:
Vector databases and sparse graphs
Package queries and user defined functions
Matroid theory
Theory of order statistics
Whatever is going on in that feud between invasive biologists and conservation biologists
Early 20th-century Christian socialism
I am a little bit of a bat who is just passable enough at seemingly unrelated topic in databases and mathematics to eek out some papers. As a professor told me, it&#x27;s easier to be first than to be the best. And, if you&#x27;re not cut out for pure mathematics, just get into applied-applied-applied mathematics of computer systems!
My current Zettelkasten iteration is a bit weird; if it matures and stands the test of time, I may divulge further. Its main principle is to help me keep on chugging along and do some real work.</span>

                              <span>I am exposing my thinking to public scrutiny as a way of probing the universe, seeking wisdom, and improving my thoughts. Writing ideas in the form of notes is an essential act, and hugely impacts my thinking. For example, I spent the morning writing this little diatribe. In the process, my thinking improved, but I still have a long way to go. Knowledge emerges through continuous stress testing of ideas, mostly through writing.

In knowledge work, the Pareto Principle suggests that 20% of the activities contribute to 80% of the achievement, making it especially pertinent in knowledge management.
Initially, whether we are zealous explorers or hesitated, confused overthinkers, the one activity that provides the most value is the habit of routinely writing notes, which are proxies for ou…</span>

                              <span>I am currently trying to get Scala 3 to work with Apache Flink via the community flink-extended api https://github.com/flink-extended/flink-scala-api. I am running into a few issues and was wondering if anyone here has encountered similar issues.
 Following the g8 template they provide https://github.com/novakov-alexey/flink-scala-api.g8, I can run the included WordCount program using sbt run. 
 However, when i try to package the code into a fat JAR (using sbt assembly) and submit to a local flink instance, flink reports the following errors
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

 in the code above I am trying to connect to an sqlite database using doobie and retreive the data from a table
 the table is &quot;create table person (ID integer primary key autoincrement, nameperson text, birth DATE not null);&quot;
 but when I try to execute I get an error Caused by: java.text.ParseException: Unparseable date: &quot;1997-08-03&quot; does not match (\p{Nd}++)\Q-\E(\p{Nd}++)\Q-\E(\p{Nd}++)\Q \E(\p{Nd}++)\Q:\E(\p{Nd}++)\Q:\E(\p{Nd}++)\Q.\E(\p{Nd}++)
 note: if I remove the date field it works perfectly and the data is retrieved successfully
 how to retrieve a Date column and parse it correctly

                              <span>This isn&#x27;t Scala specific, but I thought it would be a good place to ask.
 I&#x27;m working on forming my thoughts on error handling, and I&#x27;m looking for any existing writing that I should be aware of. Specifically I&#x27;m looking for anything that compares and contrasts control flow driven (ie. exceptions) and data driven (unions, tuples, monads of various flavors, etc.) error handling.
 Other free food for thought: It seems like as of 2.13 the Scala ecosystem had pretty well settled into data driven error handling of various flavors. With Scala 3 there are new options on the horizon for control flow based error handling. Interestingly things like boundary break syntax for error handling in ox looks very much like monadless syntax, but works totally different under the hood.
 disclaimer: when I say control flow driven error handling, I don&#x27;t mean the anti-pattern of intentionally using exceptions for control flow

I have reached out to my lecturer for help with the task but to no avail, no support or help was provided. The task that was assigned to me was to write down 10 classes in which the classes should cover:
 1) The characteristic of the class
 2) Behaviour- without actual implementation
 Can a kind soul please help me check and guide me on any errors I may have made? Perhaps, some classes I should swap out?

                              <span>long time nvim user, heard about orgmode recently and it sparked my interest, haven&#x27;t tinkered much with it or emacs yet.
 For now i have doom emacs setup basically, and I wanted to know how much emacs would I need to know to be able to take advantage of orgmode, planning on using it for daily notes, todos, calendars and technical writeups.
 Im currently pretty happy with my nvim setup for development so not rlly planning on going down the emacs rabbit hole, I just wanna make the most out of orgmode with doom, just wanna be productive enough with it if that makes sense, Im willing to put in the work for this purpose.

I have seen counsel+ivy+swiper, helm, and consult+orderless+marginalia+vertico+embark, and then there is corfu+cape. Are these bundles interchangeable, do they do entirely different things?

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to create a projectile project in Emacs but for the life of me can&#x27;t get it to recognize my simple folder as a project. I&#x27;ve done all of the below to no avail:
  
Created the project folder.
 Created a python file in it (.py)
 Initialized a git repository in it and committed the above file: git init; git add .; git commit
 Added an empty &quot;.projectile&quot; file in the folder
 Made sure my projectile-project-search-path is set to &quot;~/&quot;
 Ran projectile-discover-projects-in-search-path and verified that it was able to discover other projects
 Ran projectile-add-known-project and selected the folder
  
Up to step 6, it doesn&#x27;t discover the folder as a project. When I do step 7, it seems to add the project folder to the list of projects, but when I try to switch to it, it complains that the directory is not a project, and then removes it from the list.
 Here&#x27;s the directory after I create it:
 project/
 ├── .git
 ├── .projectile
 └── script.py
 What do I have to do?!!!!

                              <span>When writing elisp code and looking for a function that would do something you need, what do you use to find it, inside Emacs only (no web search)?
 Emacs has a lot of built-in documentation; it has
  
a help system,
 an info system,
 Apropos
 all code has docstrings,
 for other outside help, it has an excellent support for the man pages with: 
 man and woman
 
  
On top of that you can install other complementary packages that add more help search features such as:
  
helpful (which is excellent)
  
There&#x27;s a lot of commands available with the C-h or  key prefix and lots that are not bound by default.
 I documented the ones I know and created some others in my system in this PDF: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pierre-rouleau/pel/master/doc/pdf/help.pdf
 Despite all of that, every so often, I stumble to find the name of a function that I know exists but can&#x27;t remember the name. The other day I was looking for the predicate function that tells whether point was at the beginning of line; bolp.
  
I tried typing beginning and using C-M-i to complete it. That did not work.
 I typed C-u C-h d for apropos-documentation and got a long list of suggestions from which I searched for &quot;beginning .? line&quot; with some regexp and finally I found bolp at line 7833 of the Apropos buffer.
  
I eventually found it, but it took longer than I like. And was very tempted to search the internet or depend on a connection to the outside world (eg, IA). But there must be a better way to quickly find functions in Emacs.
 How do *you\* quickly find the functions you need *inside Emacs*?

                              <span>What&#x27;s the best way to sync installed package versions between different computers?
 I have been using use-package with :ensure t for a long time (with the default package.el as the backend). But I&#x27;ve read posts from experienced Emacs users suggesting to not do this. Instead, they recommend using package-install manually and then check ~/.emacs.d/elpa into their dotfiles repo, so that you sync the exact set of installed packages between computers. This is supposed to make the config more reproducible, since after a git pull every computer will have the same &quot;Emacs state&quot;.
 This idea appeals to me, especially since I&#x27;ve noticed that (i) sometimes my config doesn&#x27;t bootstrap correctly on new computers, (ii) sometimes package upgrades break my setup and I want an easy way to roll everything back when I need to just get work done, and (iii) I&#x27;ve started relying more on GitHub packages (via package-vc-install-from-checkout) and would like to avoid having to repeat this on new hosts.
 Some more concrete questions for those who follow this approach:
  
If you sync your installed packages in this way, what exactly do you sync (i.e. what&#x27;s your &#x60;.gitignore&#x60;)? 
 I guess you *should* sync the &#x60;*.el&#x60; files, otherwise there&#x27;s not much point.
 I guess you *shouldn&#x27;t* sync the natively compiled {&#x60;*.eln&#x60;, &#x60;*.so&#x60;, &#x60;*.dylib&#x60;} files.
 But what about the byte compiled &#x60;*.elc&#x60; files? Are these portable across different operating systems, different processor architectures, different Emacs ports, and different Emacs major versions?
 
 After syncing, do you need to do anything special to make things work? 
 For example, is &#x60;package-recompile-all&#x60; required?
 
  
Or is all this a fools errand, and I should instead switch tox e.g. elpaca, straight, etc.? Since I left Spacemacs and Doom Emacs some years ago, I&#x27;ve mostly stuck to the default package.el when I use Emacs (I regularly use Vim as well). But I am open to other tools if they make my life significantly easier.

                              <span>As a cowboy who often force pushes into master, I noticed that I can&#x27;t command magit faster than my shadow: I need to type P and then need to wait for a second and then type -F. If I type P -F quickly, the -F isnt picked up by magit. Is that a feature or just slowness?
 EDIT: Delay actually kicks in after typing the &quot;-&quot;, which immediately updates available actions. The minibuffer then takes about a second to show &quot;--&quot; and then I can type F.

 For now i have doom emacs setup basically, and I wanted to know how much emacs would I need to know to be able to take advantage of orgmode, planning on using it for daily notes, todos, calendars and technical writeups.
 Im currently pretty happy with my nvim setup for development so not rlly planning on going down the emacs rabbit hole, I just wanna make the most out of orgmode with doom, just wanna be productive enough with it if that makes sense, Im willing to put in the work for this purpose.

                              <span>I was trying to use replace-string to remove the underline-creating underscore prefix/suffix pairs at various points in an Org document. But neither it, nor any of the related replace/search commands appear to be able to find them. This only happens in this pairing scenario, where there&#x27;s an underscore both at the start of the first word in a sequence, and at the end of the last word. Otherwise the underscore is found by search as it should be.
 Can anyone explain what causes that?
 FWIW, the replace/search fails regardless of whether I havecase-fold-search defaulting to t or to nil (although that does affect what message I get when the replace/search fails).
 ADDED: I&#x27;ve just noticed that the same problem exists with all six of the formatting characters mentioned in the manual, viz.: *, /, _, &#x3D;, ~, and (if I must 🤓) + . I guess that should be a clue as to what the cause is, but I don&#x27;t see it yet.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve recently done some work where I wrote a parallel test loop for QuickCheck (QC). I did this in collaboration with Koen Claessen, Nicholas Smallbone, and Bo Joel Svensson.
 It is not merged in the QC repository yet, and it will take some time (it is a significant change). I must have implemented five different versions along the way, and what is there now is a mix of all of them. I am happy with the end result, but had to rush a bit in the end to reach a deadline. There is some wonky code lingering around my fork that will go away in due time.
 If you would like to try it out before it gets merged, I have written up some instructions in the link below. I have also included some of my results as well as links to both the code and paper :)

                              <span>Hello,
 Generally I have been enjoying reflex but this time I&#x27;ve stuck with what seems like a very simple feature for days! Hopefully someone can help.
 Let&#x27;s say I have a dynamic list of some value and a delay Dynamic t [(Text, NominalDiffTime)]
 I&#x27;ve been trying to end up with an Event t Text which would be an event stream that fires as many events as there were in the list with very limited success.
 This event stream should be triggered by another event Event t ().
 I&#x27;ve been trying something like
 haskell performEvent $ ffor theTriggerEvent $ \_ -&gt; do valuesAndDelays &lt;- sample . current $ valuesWithDelays ... construct the event stream 
 but the problem is that I can&#x27;t use delay inside Performable.
 I have a gut feeling this is some sort of a fold but I can&#x27;t wrap my head around it.

                              <span>I have been looking for a way to do this for a long time, but it seems really difficult.
 It is only possible to turn off a specific set of rules by recompiling the source files with those RULES pragma commented out? Then if want to turn off rules written in the base package, is it true that I will have to hack it and recompile the base package myself? Many thanks in advance!

                              <span>Hi! Switched to emacs somewhat recently, and I use a long running daemon on a server, ssh into the server, and emacsclient into it. I use emacs as both an editor and also a &quot;runner&quot; i.e. all of my long running tasks run inside shell or vterm. I usually can find the shells that I need but, I&#x27;d like a way to group shells / text editors / direds together according to &quot;projects&quot; (and have the ability to switch to buffers/shells only within that project) In addition, I&#x27;d like these projects to be permanent and restore-able. I.e. I quit emacsclient, have projects open and associated buffers (shells and text). Then the next day I can reopen emacsclient and restore the same setup. I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of ways to do this (projectile, project.el, perspectives, beframe, tabmode) but can&#x27;t seem to be able to find a setup that ticks all the boxes above. I&#x27;m also honestly a little overwhelmed by the choices here :D Thanks for any pointers!

                              <span>Hi,
 I am desperately trying to get doom emacs in terminal mode (emacs -nw) to have a transparent background. I have tried everything that I could think of and find as resources, but I can only get the emacs GUI to have the transparent background by following emacs wiki and setting in my doom emacs config.el:
 (set-frame-parameter nil &#x27;alpha-background 70) (add-to-list &#x27;default-frame-alist &#x27;(alpha-background . 70)) 
 My emacs version is emacs29-pgtk. I am using the kitty terminal and have already made the terminal itself transparent.
 I would greatly appreciate any tips on how to make this work, as I have tried for a long time and have no idea why this is not working.

                              <span>I recently saw a tweet featuring an upcoming improvement to Metals that would allow you to interact with code and use completion/navigation while the project is not in a compiling state.
 This is more challenging to do than it sounds, and I wrote a tiny blurb about the problem and the proposed solution.
 TL;DR The Scala team at VirtusLab is working hard on improving the experience of using Scala 3 with Metals, but I also believe this could greatly benefit IntelliJ IDEA as well.

 I&#x27;ve got experience with data engineering, Play, Akka, ZIO... As well as a few other languages, so don&#x27;t hesitate even if I don&#x27;t seem like a perfect match. Thank you!

                              <span>I&#x27;ve had trouble understanding a couple of things around filtering results with a columnview dynamic block:
  
I couldn&#x27;t get the LABEL setting for :id to do what I expected.
 Same thing with the :match setting.
  
One cool trick--add a number of rows with a :noexport: tag and put the columnview dynamic block outside of them--made reporting a bit easier as a way to avoid including headings that aren&#x27;t necessary except as property containers.
 While the above&#x27;s mostly a complaint, I do have a constructive question: how can we get a cookbook of working examples that show uncommon usecases (e.g. using column view as a multi-line workaround for tables)?

                              <span>Writing modular code is a challenge any large project faces,
and that stands even more true for Python monoliths.
Python’s versatility is convenient, yet a very big gun to shoot one’s foot with.
If there’s one thing I’ve learnt over the years of building software,
it’s the importance of testing to mitigate risks and allow refactoring in the long run.
In my experience however, I’ve seen much less testing in projects than I would’ve liked.
If it can be rarely attributed to plain malevolence or stupidity,
the most recurrent reason is: it is hard and it takes too much time.
The issue is, it’s often true!
So how can we lower the barrier to make testing easier?

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking for a way to generate a traditional &quot;org chart&quot; (e.g. for a company) from an Org mode file.
 So far I&#x27;ve tried out org-mind-map† (via graphviz). It works, but the output is more DAG-like than the kind of thing you see with a standard organizational chart††. I know that org-mind-map-engine offers some control over the format, but none of the options match what I&#x27;m looking for.
 Does anyone know if I can get what I&#x27;m after out of org-mind-map?
 Or, if not, any other Org mode-based suggestions?
 Thanks!
  
† I&#x27;m using the-ted/org-mind-map via melpa, rather than the unpackaged fork at alphapapa/org-mind-map . That&#x27;s simply because although it&#x27;s a fork, the latter appears to be behind the former in commits. The forked code looks to be the unmodified v0.1 of the original, whereas the original is now at v0.4. But if anyone (e.g. u/github-alphapapa himself :-) ) thinks there&#x27;s more going on there, and that the fork actually is the one to use, let me know.
 †† For example, in the traditional org. chart, a parent node with multiple child nodes would connect to its children using a single line with branches off it to each child (and the parent). Something like this. By contrast, org-mind-map&#x27;s DAG-style has a separate line from the parent to child for each of the children.

 * Sell My Home ** Purpose / Expected Outcome - Sell my home for a lot of money ** Project Reference - Asking price :: $100 - [[https://zillow.com][Zillow]] - [[https://realtor.com][Realtor]] ** Actions *** TODO Research Home Values :LOGBOOK: CLOCK: [2024-06-05 Wed 09:00]--[2024-06-05 Wed 10:00] &#x3D;&gt; 0:00 :END: *** TODO Create Listing :LOGBOOK: CLOCK: [2024-06-05 Wed 10:00]--[2024-06-05 Wed 11:00] &#x3D;&gt; 0:00 :END: 
 I use clock tables like this:
 #+BEGIN: clocktable :scope file :maxlevel 4 :compact t :block today #+CAPTION: Clock summary at [2024-06-05 Wed 11:06], for Wednesday, June 05, 2024. | Headline | Time | |----------------------------+------| | *Total time* | *2:00* | |----------------------------+------| | Sell My Home | 2:00 | | \_ Actions | 2:00 | | \_ Research Home Values | 1:00 | | \_ Create Listing | 1:00 | #+END: 
 I&#x27;d like to skip the &quot;Actions&quot; row, like this:
 | Headline | Time | |----------------------------+------| | *Total time* | *2:00* | |----------------------------+------| | Sell My Home | 2:00 | | \_ Research Home Values | 1:00 | | \_ Create Listing | 1:00 | 
 Is it possible to either exclude certain heading levels, or (better) exclude certain headings, but still include their children? For example, exclude &quot;** Actions&quot; but still include its children. I see there is a matchoption, but I&#x27;m looking for an exclude option, based on the header name.

                              <span>Hi all, I&#x27;m currently trying to generate MkDocs from my collection of org files, to have some sort of static documentation site based off my notes.
 My approach so far has been converting org to markdown with pandoc, to then feed all markdown files to mkdocs along with some custom css.
 This seemed quite straightforward, however I soon realised there are a few caveats: - pandoc org parsing is not 100% accurate and some elements are missing (e.g.: task priorities are not parsed to their own AST element) - mkdocs extends markdown with custom syntax, this md block for instance:  ??? Drawer Lorem Ipsum  will be rendered as a collapsible drawer in the resulting html. This led me to write some custom pandoc filters, for example to convert a :NOTES: org drawer to a ??? NOTES md block.
 In all fairness, it&#x27;s becoming a bit complex and there&#x27;s a lot of stuff I&#x27;m not covering yet.
 So the reason for this post is to ask you for guidance about what approach to use, I see 3 options: 1. continue with the current approach of using pandoc, adding more logic/filters when needed 2. use a different, more complete, org parser and then generate mkdocs-compatible markdown myself 3. write something entirely in Elisp, similarly to projects like ox-hugo.
 I&#x27;m a bit of an Elisp newbie, so I&#x27;m not sure how feasible it is for me to tackle option 3, other than that feel free to suggest other options.
 Thank you for taking the time to read this!

                              <span>I&#x27;ve spiked several pieces of functionality over about the last year, both for internal and user-facing work. Some features will be present in work I&#x27;m doing anyway. I am curious to get some early feedback before attempting to crystalize it.
 Fully specified, fully decideable schedules are appopriate when scopes and times are known. I can imagine people who have jobs that are relatively static find the features of vanilla org mode to be appropriate.
 However, for open-ended work, which is endemic to small companies in their high-growth and product development phase, these tools (and many, many others) fall down in a lot of ways. Most work is optional, even aspirational. The payoff of any piece or an ensemble of pieces is uncertain. The bandwidth is scarce and must be triaged. Managing is i…</span>

                              <span>I am considering to give haskell a go (again). I actually wanted to earlier but got discouraged by an (at that time) very clunky tooling experience, and I also found it annoying that I had to use pragma&#x27;s to for example enable exhaustive type checking (which imo always should be default). At the time I instead decided to dive into Purescript, which I have been enjoying quite a lot ever since. I have probably written somewhere around 10k lines of purescript by now. However, I feel that purescript is quite niche and has some annoying limits due to primarily running on node or in the browser. For example, I don&#x27;t see myself ever doing proper parallel processing in purescript. I also feel that purescript might be more limited in context of future job opportunities. These are the reasons for which I am considering to give learning Haskell a second try.
 Much learning material seems to be targeted at OOP programmers who are new to FP. I obviously don&#x27;t need the the whole FP sales pitch with my background. What I need is more something along the lines of &quot;I am comfortable with FP, monads, type classes and monad transformers, and now I want to learn Haskell without getting bored by the learning material&quot;.
 I have read the excellent purescript book called &quot;Functional programming made easier&quot; https://leanpub.com/fp-made-easier. My background before Purescript has been working professionally with F# and Clojure for a few years.
 On the longer run I am considering to do some Haskell certification https://certification.serokell.io/

                              <span>I&#x27;m using emacs &amp; org for knowledge management, and I often need to search my notes. One of the ways I do this is with +default/org-notes-search (from search.el, maybe it&#x27;s a doom thing? It just wraps ripgrep on org-directory), which displays two windows; a list of results on the bottom and a preview of the currently selected result on the top window.
 I don&#x27;t hard-wrap my text files; I rely on visual-line-mode instead. This makes searching kind of annoying, because I can&#x27;t get the preview window (the top one) to wrap long lines. The closest I&#x27;ve been able to get is by doing this:
 &#x60;(add-hook &#x27;occur-mode-hook &#x27;visual-line-mode)&#x60;
 which sort of enables visual-line-mode in the preview window... but only sometimes, and only if I click in that window to focus its buffer. I can then go back down to the results and flip through results in the same file, but when I Get to the next file I have to refocus the results buffer again.
 Anyone have an idea of how I can get this to work seamlessly? Extra bonus points if I can enable visual-fill-column-mode too!

 I tried the modus themes but to modify an sql / C# / ... file is not enough good.
 What I used to use is vs-light theme what is good for coding but I&#x27;m very curious what you use for coding.

Does emacs has something similar? At least I haven&#x27;t found something close to two sites written above. If there is really no similar sites/list...

                              <span>For those using the &#x60;linux&#x60; indentation style to code in the kernel space, how do you indent with a tab instead of 8 spaces?
 The following config still adds 8 spaces when I press Enter.
 (defun set-c-indentation () &quot;Indentation for C programming.&quot; (setq-default c-ts-mode-indent-style &#x27;linux c-ts-mode-indent-offset 8 tab-width 8 indent-tabs-mode t)) (add-hook &#x27;c-ts-mode-hook &#x27;set-c-indentation)

                              <span>help-enable-variable-value-editing is a variable defined in ‘help-fns.el’. Its value is t Original value was nil If non-nil, allow editing values in *Help* buffers. To edit the value of a variable, use C-h v to display a &quot;*Help*&quot; buffer, move point after the text &quot;Its value is&quot; and type e. Values that aren’t readable by the Emacs Lisp reader can’t be edited even if this option is enabled. This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in version 29.1 of Emacs. You can customize this variable. 
 I just tried this out, and wow, is it useful. I appear to have overlooked it, and I couldn&#x27;t find it mentioned on this sub yet, so...enjoy!

                              <span>Hey, I&#x27;ll stream my work on dev.scala.today app tomorrow at 10 AM CEST. Feel invited to hang out and bother me in the chat. We&#x27;ll try to get the whole thing to a level where we can deploy it to actual prod for the first time.
 We&#x27;ve got some interesting insights based on practical experience on Saturday that turned into proposals (with PRs) to Ox already:
 https://github.com/softwaremill/ox/issues/147
 https://github.com/softwaremill/ox/issues/149
 https://github.com/softwaremill/ox/issues/150
 If you have any questions, suggestions, complaints regarding Scala, Scala tooling, infra as code tool Besom, VirtusLab&#x27;s work on Scala and such, fire away in the chat, I&#x27;ll be happy to answer anything.

                              <span>Could you please recommend a scala library (or another jvm based or even .Net based library) that I can use to stress test an intranet web app that uses windows authentication (IIS web server)? 
 From my research gatling doesn&#x27;t support this type of authentication: https://community.gatling.io/t/i-want-to-use-the-ntlm-auth-is-it-possible-with-gatling-if-not-do-you-have-another-solution/7705/3.
 I am using jmeter at the moment but I find it a little bit painful. I would feel more comfortable to write code.

                              <span>I’m trying to config lua in emacs, currently i’m using the following:
 (use-package eldoc :init (global-eldoc-mode) :custom (eldoc-echo-area-use-multiline-p nil) (eldoc-documentation-strategy #&#x27;eldoc-documentation-default)) (use-package eglot :preface :hook ((lua-mode . eglot-ensure)) :bind (:map eglot-mode-map (&quot;M-&quot; . eglot-code-actions)) :config ;; Please be faster (fset #&#x27;jsonrpc--log-event #&#x27;ignore) (setf (plist-get eglot-events-buffer-config :size) 0) :custom (completion-category-overrides &#x27;((eglot (styles orderless)) (eglot-capf (styles orderless)))) (eglot-sync-connect nil) (eglot-report-progress nil) (eglot-autoshutdown t) (eglot-extend-to-xref t)) (use-package lua-mode :ensure t :defer t :mode (&quot;\\.lua\\&#x27;&quot; . lua-mode) :interpreter (&quot;lua&quot; . lua-mode) :custom (lua-indent-level 4) (lua-indent-string-contents t)) 
 It&#x27;s working pretty well with the exception of the Eldoc documentation. When I hover over something, the documentation correctly shows in the minibuffer, but when I open the Eldoc buffer with eldoc-doc-buffer, the documentation is repeated multiple times.
 I tried debugging it and found out that if I remove eglot-signature-eldoc-function from eldoc-documentation-functions, I get only one item in the Eldoc buffer. However, I don&#x27;t know how to prevent Eldoc from adding this item and thus avoid the duplication in the Eldoc buffer.

                              <span>Is there a way to check if a key is being pressed? 
 I would like to have a function that keeps executing until the user presses a key. Something like this:
  (while (no-user-action) (do something) (sleep for a bit)) 
 Or do you know of a package that implements something like this?
 My use-case is the following: I have a video playing (web browser), and the subtitles in emacs. I can query the video for the timestamp and synchronize the subtitle to the video (moving the point to the current subtitle and potentially recentering the window).
 I want this to be done automatically until I press a key. At that point the synchronization stops.
 thank you for any help

                              <span>I have been experiencing random flickering on the pgtk build of emacs on wayland in the recent months since updating to nvidia-drivers version 535 from 525.
 I am building Emacs from source with pgtk enabled every week. And I am quite sure it is related to Nvidia because all the flickering goes away when I downgrade to nvidia-525. I am now on Nvidia 550 and the issue persists. 
 I have an RTX2060 with Gentoo.
 After some testing, I find that all OpenGL related applications especially with lower version of OpenGL like 3.x are having the same issue. I even wrote a bunch of SDL window to render simple textures to test that. All the others with vulkan does not have the same issue.
 I have messed around with Minecraft recently, and the launcher has an option of running OpenGL on Zinc, which is an OpenGL implementation on top of Vulkan. If I run Minecraft with Zinc enabled, the flickering is gone.
 I believe Emacs is using OpenGL to draw on screen. Is there any workaround for me to run Emacs&#x27; OpenGL call via Zinc? Or does anyone have similar experience that have found a solution?

                              <span>For the first time in years I upgraded Emacs to latest 29.3.50 and latest for all packages also. The first thing that broke was org-mode with the new default of tab-width &#x3D; 8 that will conflict with editorconfig but easily solved by adding a rule on your .editorconfig file for org-mode files.
 Now it looks like it is treesitter, when displaying C++ there&#x27;s no font-locking and I get the following error. It does work for C and other languages. Has anybody seen this?

 Study for a life in Emacs.
 pen.el was created in 2021 as an annotation tool, but I was not used it a lot at that time. Recently I picked it up and dramatically changed its usage. Now it is a complete solution of making annotations and language learning tools, right inside Emacs.
 pen relies on sqlite. All annotations are saved inside a database, which means it can be easily backup and you can read and make annotation right inside Emacs (PC/mobile) using same database.
 pen’s ideas are coming from all following great tools:
  
LingQ: Learning a language by reading
 Kindle Vocabulary Builder
 org noter
 Chatgpt
 SDCV
 go-translate
 Eudic
 蒙哥阅读器
  
and more.
 This package is mainly used along with:
  
nov-mode
 org-mode
 pdf-view-mode
 eaf-mode
  
But it is able to work with all modes in Emacs.

 It used to happen once a day but now it crashes legit every 15 minutes. Any idea what could be the problem, or has anyone experienced something similar? 
 If I had to bet I would say it&#x27;s a Fedora problem, but how to know for sure? Because these crashes seem to only happen with Emacs.

                              <span>I&#x27;m creating some onboarding documentation for the workplace and have been using the bigblow html template, and it&#x27;s got a lot of great features, but I&#x27;d really like to be able to have interactive checkbox/TODO items within the document for the trainee to track their progress. Does anybody know of any templates that allows the reader to check off tasks and/or change the TODO state of a heading?

                              <span>Hi, I ported org-krita and org-xournalpp with custom link. They used to be based on creating their own overlay, and in my forks they are configured with &#x60;:image-data-fun&#x60; with org-mode custom links. So I commented out their minor mode definition, as they are no longer relevent; previewing images is done with &#x60;org-display-inline-images&#x60; like all other custom links.
  
https://github.com/hermanhel/org-krita (used github because I want to pull-request)
 
https://codeberg.org/Hermanhel/org-xournalpp (don&#x27;t want to create gitlab account)
 
 story: 
 I was revamping on my solution to include visual illustrations in org-mode. I passed on them 2 because they were painful to use with that custom overlay, and they make huge overlays which is hard to adjust size. I used org-excalidraw for a bit, it was great, but the export tool it used excalidraw_export does not function properly at all in my KUbuntu 24.04 environment. I see the author&#x27;s demo works perfectly in macOS, so maybe it is because of different svg library(excalidraw&#x27;s own svg export does not display font correctly on my machine).
 I saw excalidraw use a image-data-fun, so I played around a bit and made org-krita and org-xournalpp the same. It is kind of weird that lambda do not work when I was testing, I had to declare my own functions and use function&#x27;s symbol in &#x60;:image-data-fun&#x60;.
 enjoy.

                              <span>Good afternoon, Emacsen
 I don&#x27;t honestly use tree-sitter much -- my main language is well handled by the venerable vhdl-mode. However I had been using it many moons ago for a Typst document. I had all the libraries obtained, and snagged typst-ts-mode for the part where it does things with the tree-sitter output.
 I distinctly remember there being syntax coloring when I was using it before.
 I recently opened the same Typst document, and it&#x27;s not doing anything with syntax highlighting. I dutifully updated Typst, the tree-sitter libraries, and typst-ts-mode and still no joy. I can turn on treesit-explore-mode and see tree-sitter correctly interpreting the code. So far, so good I guess. That&#x27;s the main engine. (Also (treesit-language-available-p &#x27;typst) returns true, so I think I&#x27;m pretty solidly in the tree-sitter active camp.)
 However I have been reading Mickey Peterson&#x27;s article on tree-sitter (https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/how-to-get-started-tree-sitter), trying to make sure there wasn&#x27;t some step I left out along the way. Also the tree-sitter Emacs documentation at https://emacs-tree-sitter.github.io/syntax-highlighting/. This last claims that there exists a function tree-sitter-hl-mode. I tried M-x tree-sitter- and about this time, completion offers up nothing. There are no tree-sitter functions! This is Emacs 29 and it was built with tree-sitter support so I would imagine that the basic functions would be there.
 Any ideas what went pear-shaped here? I started a ticket at typst-ts-mode&#x27;s repo but I am not entirely sure if the issue is that I forgot to set something up, or if it is indeed that package.
 Thanks! I think I will remove the call to use typst-ts-mode and see if there&#x27;s any difference in behavior. I THINK there&#x27;s a slight snag when that buffer loads, but I&#x27;m not 100% certain just yet. (EDIT: doesn&#x27;t appear to be a delay so it must have been my imagination)

I&#x27;m guessing that such a thing should exist - does anyone know of any documentation about how to use it?

                              <span>I&#x27;m talking about the prompt that opens when you run M-x eww RET to type the URL, or when you use eglot-rename and it asks the new symbol name.
 Is there a package that allows me to replace that prompt with a temporary buffer?
 What I need: - To be able to insert text efficiently with all the &quot;normal&quot; buffer bindings instead of the limited buffer
 What I would love: - A buffer that pops up in a posframe - When I save and quit, it has the same effect as pressing RET in the prompt - When I quit without saving it has the same effect as C-g

 What is the correct way of doing this?

                              <span>Right-clicking a file in most GUI file managers provides an “Open with” menu for choosing which application should be used. I created a small package that provides such functionality for Dired.

                              <span>As the title says, I&#x27;m having a bit of trouble installing all the required dependencies to build a Scala program.
 OS: Arch linux
 JDK: 21
 What I&#x27;ve done so far:
  
Install coursier per the website instructions
 update the JDK to version 21 of OpenJdk
 Install Metals extension with vs code.
 Create a new app using sbt sbt new scala/scala3.g8
 Open with vs code and import the sbt build for metals.
 Run metals doctor and get a bunch of warnings about version mismatches.
  
It seems like the current version of coursier ships with JDK 11 and I though it would be a good idea to update a more recent one. Seems like Metals supports up to version 21, but 17 is the current default.
 So, long story short, the environment is out of sorts. What would you all do in this situation?
 Edit: Specific error messages below
 Code navigation will not work for 3 build targets in this workspace due to mis-configuration. Select &#x27;More information&#x27; to learn how to fix this problem.

That said, I am trying (purely for education) to explore this problem where my functions can return values while also modifying a key data structure, so I think using the State monad makes a lot of sense.

                              <span>I am looking for a way to have an Emacs frame that displays all term buffers as tabs (similar to a traditional terminal manager like gnome-terminal).
 The initialization of the frame that displays the terminals is easy enough using something like
  (dolist (buf (buffer-list)) (with-current-buffer buf (when (eq major-mode &#x27;term-mode) (tab-bar-new-tab) (switch-to-buffer buf)))) 
 but then such a frame should keep track of terminal buffers being killed/created and add corresponding tabs. I can probably hack my way with appropriate hooks, but I wanted to know if there&#x27;s a package that already does this.

                              <span>We all know that Emacs is more than an editor. You can spend an entire life learning Emacs. It never stops and it adapts to anything you want to do with a computer. 
 Using one, or several terminal emulator buffers inside Emacs can be extremely useful. What&#x27;s you use case?
 As for me, one thing I do often is create a keyboard macro that gathers information from one or several shell or REPL output to place it inside text file either for documentation or to create unit-test code. And sometimes I write some elisp code to do some of that. Being able to interact with an Erlang and Python REPL for example, with the OS shell of a local or remote computer and Emacs Lisp together (including with eshell) greatly enhance what can be done quickly. 
 Not all Emacs terminal emulators are made equal. I wrote a comparison table for the ones I know and what I have tested. That might be useful for others. It&#x27;s here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pierre-rouleau/pel/master/doc/pdf/shells-comparison.pdf

What are *your* use cases?

                              <span>hi all, 
 I am trying to learn Lisp, and since most of the tutorials seem to use Emacs, I am learning Emacs at the same time. 
 Now, I have a 60% keyboard, and I was wondering whether I should move to a full-sized keyboard to use Emacs more easily?
 for example, the very first example in the Portacle tutorial requires typing ~ three times, which on a 60% keyboard is Fn-S-~ , so it is a bit of gymnastics. (Portacle is a packaged installation of Common Lisp with Emacs) 
 Thank you for any advice

                              <span>So I am quite new to doom emacs (by new I mean like 5 months of using it) and org mode version 9.7 came out just recently, it supports pasting images from clipboard which is exactly the thing that was missing for me in emacs (yes I can use org download but it isn&#x27;t as fluid). Will org mode 9.7 come to doom emacs so that running &#x60;doom sync&#x60; gets the job done or will it come in a few months and until then, just manually install the latest org mode version?

                              <span>Org 9.7, a major release, is out. Org 9.7 will be a part of Emacs 30.
 You can upgrade from GNU ELPA or install with M-x package-install RET org RET
 Please, also re-install all the Org-related packages - some of the changes require re-compiling packages that use Org mode APIs.
 Release notes: https://orgmode.org/Changes.html
 Announcement: https://list.orgmode.org/87jzj7adfd.fsf@localhost/T/#u
 If you enjoy using Org, please consider supporting contributors via https://liberapay.com/org-mode/. Donations do help a lot.
 Some highlights of user-facing additions
  
Org mode supports drag-and-drop and pasting images/files from clipboard (pasting from clipboard requires Emacs &gt;&#x3D;29)
 Thanks to Visuwesh for contributing these features.

                              <span>I am trying to run a haskell project using the haskell-intellij plugin https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8258-intellij-haskell inside intellij community.
 I am working in linux mint. The stack and haskell installations are fine. Stack runs fine with the command line.
 However, I am trying to run a haskell project/script using the GUI in Intellij. In the run configurations, I am trying to create a new one using a haskell runner, but then I am not able to select my stack executable in the drop down menu. It is just blank and I cannot type the path of the executable.
 How can I fix my problem?

                              <span>I&#x27;m writing a NES emulator in Haskell, and I&#x27;m getting pretty inconsistent frame rates.
 They are consistently inconsistent in the sense that I&#x27;ll have a frame run at a rate of 130 FPS, and the next one at a rate of 30 FPS, followed by another frame at 130 and so on. 
 If I run with +RTS - p -RTS, I can get a center cost that tells me which functions take the longest.
 But I&#x27;m not interested in the mean cost of each function, but rather in the variance.
 Is there any way to profile this automatically? I would really prefer not to wrap every function I have in a timer.

                              <span>Today I learned the existence of IPE. I created a small package for org. I love to be able to quickly create drawing to export them with latex backend.

                              <span>If anyone has Emacs on MacOS, can you tell me what this command does on your system
  (process-lines-ignore-status &quot;osascript&quot; &quot;-e&quot; &quot;tell application \&quot;System Events\&quot; to keystroke tab using command down&quot;) 
 It&#x27;s supposed to switch away from emacs by sending Cmd+Tab. However, on my setup (GNU Emacs 29.1, MacPort), Emacs seems to be receiving C-s- (with control pressed) and I get a message C-s- is undefined on Emacs.
 If you are noticing the same behavior, any idea where the extr control is coming from?

                              <span>I have been running emacs as server/client in Wayland. Before the emacs 29 release I started compiling locally to disable X (--without-x) and enable PGTK (--with-pgtk). It was running fine. Now on 29.3 the server just fails every time I try to run it. What is the state of affairs now, and is it still an option? Does anyone have a howto?
 I&#x27;m on Fedora 40, and the packaged versions of emacs (emacs and emacs-lucid) also fail.

                              <span>Hey,
 I&#x27;m not too experienced with Emacs-fu, but I think I might be developing a case of Emacs pinky. I&#x27;ve tried making some changes—I&#x27;ve adopted evil, god-mode, and I&#x27;m planning to buy a split keyboard this year.
 The main issue I&#x27;m facing is inefficient mini-buffer navigation. For instance, I use WSL, so there are a lot of nested folders I have to navigate through, which means I end up hitting TAB a lot, and it&#x27;s painful.
 My current workflow looks something like this: C-x C-f ~/fol TAB (folder1) TAB nes er2 TAB (nested-folder2), and so on.
 For completion, I used Helm in the past. I use Vertico now because I believe I&#x27;ll be able to master it sooner than Helm. I feel it&#x27;s more predictable with more information available online on how to set it up. However, I liked how Helm handles completion with the RET flow instead of TAB unlike Vertico which opens Dired on RET. 
 Now, I have a few questions:
  
Is there a better way to navigate mini-buffer completions? 
 Is there a better way to navigate through nested folders efficiently?
 
 How can I mimic Helm-like completion behavior in Vertico?
 How do I turn off TAB completion so that I don&#x27;t keep clicking out of habit, like I do with Capslock?
  
Thanks!

                              <span>Hello, Community!
 There are different oppinions about solving algorithmic problems during hiring process. Not a big fan of it, but I still see that employers include coding tasks in such platforms. My recently I was asked to pass task in HackerRank and Codility. For another interview Codewars was recommended for preparation. I quite enjoyed https://www.codewars.com I must say (not a promotion btw just sharing personal impression), however it does not have a lot of Scala tasks.
 I assume 90% of that market is occupied by Leetcode, but still curious whether you are practising solving such small coding tasks and if so, on which platform? 
 Thanks.

                              <span>Hey guys, I would appreciate some thoughts/opinions on this. 
 Preface: In my day to day work I am Java Dev using hibernate. I resented it at first (too much magic), but it kind of grew on me and I recently started to really appreciate it mainly in the following sense: When modeling my domain I can go full java-first, completely ignoring that my model is backed by a RDBMS, that is - code my model as if there were no DB, slap the right annotations on it, (make a few compromises here and there) and get going. It even forward engineers the ddl for me.
 So in scala world it seems to me that the accepted approach is to separate the model from the persistent model? 
 Here is why I think that: - the libraries I found map rows to case classes, but usually no built in support for inheritance, sealed trait hierachies, ... - no support for one to many aggregation - bad support for nested case class, especially if they occur multiple times
 Here is a sample of how I would model an invoice if there were no database
 scala case class Invoice( ... senderName: String, senderAddress: Address, // general purpose case class to not repeat myself recipientName: String, recipientAddress: Address, status: Status, // some sealed trait with cases like e.g. case Sent(when: LocalDate) positions: List[InvoicePosition] ... ) 
 I feel like I either - have to compromise A LOT in modeling my domain if I want to close to zero hassle with db libs out there - have my db access case classes be separated from the domain and do alot of mapping/transforming
 Any experiences, or hints? how do you handle this in your apps

                              <span>I found out from this post that this feature was removed. I tried the solution given below, but it seems like, at least with my current configuration, that my computer is not able to handle it and just shuts down emacs. I was wondering if anyone figured out a way to restore this feature. Thanks.
 Additionally, totally disabling standard org fontification (bold, italics, underline) in example blocks would be helpful, if anyone has any insight.
 Edit - The post solution worked. There was just something wrong with my installation of emacs.

                              <span>I&#x27;m experimenting with composition-function-tableto add effects to certain sequences of characters, like shoving to characters closer together. I noticed that characters with descenders that extend below the baseline like &quot;g&quot;, &quot;j&quot;, and &quot;y&quot; can cause the line height to increase when rendered via &#x60;font-shape-string&#x60; via a custom entry in &#x60;composition-function-table&#x60;. This happens for example with the &quot;M+ Code Latin 50&quot; font, but only at certain font heights.
 The simplest reproduction is this:
 (set-char-table-range composition-function-table t &#x27;([&quot;g&quot; 0 font-shape-gstring])) 
 That causes this artifact, where typing a &quot;g&quot; causes the next line to shift downwards:
 https://cdn.zappy.app/801ae7a7b03d568b3b80500b04047054.gif
 It works fine (no line shifting) stock, but when I add an entry to &#x60;composition-function-table&#x60; the weirdness starts happening.
 I tried messing with the font in FontLab. I can fix the problem by increasing the Units per eM value, which causes the font to get smaller. I then increase the font height in Emacs to compensate. That works, but it&#x27;s an odd thing to do, and I have to make the font height pretty large to get a normal-looking actual height. Other options in FontLab like increasing the line gap, safe descender value, etc didn&#x27;t help.
 I&#x27;d like to understand why this is happening.
 EDIT: &quot;;&quot; (semicolon) is a more realistic example. I&#x27;m trying to create a ligature that will push &quot;;;&quot; closer together, for Lisp comments. However the semicolon in my font has a descender that extends below the baseline, causing the same line shifting effect as shown with the &quot;g&quot; above, when I try to use a &quot;;;&quot; ligature.

 EMACS packages are written for EMACS users, for those who use emacs&#x27; default keybindings, not for VIM users.

Are there any packages (or tools that play nice with ansi-term) that I could install to achieve btop level functionality? For instance, network and disk usage, better procedure grouping, etc?

                              <span>This is more of an annoyance than an actual issue and I&#x27;m not sure if this is because of the way Emacs is compiled, or some other setting but my title bar is white but it should be black like the other windows. I already have set Legacy applications to use the Adwaita theme but this had no effect on Emacs.
 Is there anything I can do to make the titlebar have the normal color?

                              <span>I want to learn more about being productive and I&#x27;m watching videos on org-mode and org-agenda but I can&#x27;t seem to visualize how I can manage my TODOS in a file?
 I have many questions like 
  
How many agenda files do you have? One for every project? Or a group of tasks? Or divided by year?
 Similarly what should the headings for the tasks be?
 How to find a particular TODO if you have multiple agenda files?
 How big do your agenda files get? What do you do if it gets too big?
 What happens to tasks that are DONE, do they get deleted or can you save them in history.
  
I need to see some example agenda files to understand how this works. I tried looking online but couldn&#x27;t find any sample org-agenda files. Do any of you guys have an agenda file you are comfortable sharing?

                              <span>Hi guys, I don&#x27;t know if this is the correct place to post this kind of question.
 Recently a colleague of mine introduced me to the wonders of Scala, which I ignored for years thinking that&#x27;s just a &quot;dead language&quot; that&#x27;s been surpassed by other languages.
 I&#x27;ve been doing some research and I was wondering why someone should start a new project in Scala when there ares new language which have a good concurrency (like Go) or excellent performance (like Rust).
 Since I&#x27;m new in Scala I was wondering if you guys could help me understand why I should use Scala instead of other good languages like Go/Rust or NodeJS.
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>To understand ghc&#x27;s package management better, I decided to manually install vector package and see if it gets picked up by hls and if the final program compiles.
 I went to the vector package on hackage, saw it had two dependencies, vector-stream and primitive. I downloaded vector, vector-stream and primitive using the commands,
 cabal get primitive cabal get vector-stream cabal get vector 
 then first I compiled the dependencies primitive and vector-stream, using cabal build. That gave dist-newstyle directory.
 Inside dist-newstyle\packagedb\ghc-9.8.2 there was a .conf file, I edited it to point all the file references to the ghc package database which is ghcup\ghc\9.8.2\lib\x86_64-windows-ghc-9.8.2.
 I placed the entire downloaded package directory (eg vector-stream-0.1.0.1) inside ghcup\ghc\9.8.2\lib\x86_64-windows-ghc-9.8.2.
 Then I registered the package with
 ghc-pkg register .conf 
 After performing above steps for primitive, vector-stream and vector respectively, vector was now being picked up by hls. GHC also compiles and links fine.
 Did I do it correctly? Will there be any issues in the future?
 I know this is not the preferred way at all, and you should be using cabal which streamlines this process. Vector had just 2 dependencies which already comes with base so it wasn&#x27;t much of a hassle. This only for learning purposes.

                              <span>I have a backend that serves HTML using Warp and Servant (https://github.com/runeksvendsen/haskell-function-graph). Because some elements on the page take up to a second to load, I want to stream HTML to the client as it&#x27;s produced, thus sending the slow-to-create HTML later.
 The HTML consists of (in order):
  
Static/pure &quot;preamble&quot; (which can be sent immediately)
 IO action streaming query results (which I want to stream as HTML one result at a time as they come in)
 A final IO action that calls out to an external process and produces HTML
  
I&#x27;m writing this post as I&#x27;m unsure what the most sensible way to achieve this is. On the one hand I would like to keep it as simple as possible — e.g. a MimeRender instance that produces a lazy ByteString. But this doesn&#x27;t seem possible as the rendering involves IO. On the other hand I want to make sure that HTML is sent out as soon as it&#x27;s produced, ie. no buffering on the server side — which makes me want to get a hold of some sendData :: Socket -&gt; IO () function, so that I&#x27;m sure data is sent out when I want it. The former seems more elegant, but I don&#x27;t see how it&#x27;s possible (due to performing IO to produce the ByteString) and it&#x27;s not clear to me how the server will buffer lazy ByteString chunks. The latter seems to do the job, but seems very low level.
 Any clues on how I should approach this?

                              <span>The latest version of #Scala-Native 0.5.2 now supports OS-Lib&#x27;s os.proc subprocesses. This opens up a whole world of using Scala-Native for scripting and automation, since you can now subprocess out to anything from Scala Native that you can call from Bash. 
 I tagged OS-Lib 0.10.2, which should be out soon. Please try it out!

                              <span>Hi, please consider below example,
 import scala.concurrent.{Future, Await} import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global import scala.concurrent.duration.Duration def asyncCalculation1() &#x3D; Future { Thread.sleep(1000) 10 } def asyncCalculation2() &#x3D; Future { Thread.sleep(1000) 20 } val c &#x3D; asyncCalculation1().flatMap { a &#x3D;&gt; asyncCalculation2().map { b &#x3D;&gt; a + b } } val d &#x3D; Await.result(c, Duration.Inf) println(d) 
 As far as I understood, first thread (T1) will execute the asyncCalculation1function and content inside the Future will be handed over to a new thread (T2). Handling the flatMap function won&#x27;t a responsibility of T1 as first Future is not completed, but it will be blocked by the Await.result function until it is resolved. Or T1 is going back to the pool?
 Meanwhile T2 thread will wake up from 1sec sleep and will return 10 as the result and start executing the asyncCalculation2 function and it will create another thread (T3) while doing that. After that, what will happen to T2? Will it go back to the global thread pool this time? Or is it set to a blocked/waiting status as T1?
 And finally T3 is the one responsible for executing the callback inside the map function. And now since T3 is the last thread to complete, for whom the Await.result function is waiting for?? Is it T2 or T3 ??

                              <span>Hello all,
 I work on a remote server regularly and hence use screen for running various codes on the terminal. But now I want to switch to emacs in order to run my code instead of the terminal. I have tried screen on both vterm and eshell and both have failed to run screen. So couple of questions:
  
What is the best &quot;term/shell&quot; mode in emacs to run screen?
 If I let go the idea of using screen, and willing to adapt to other options like tmux, what is the best &quot;term/shell&quot; mode? Basically which is your preferred way to run terminal commands on emacs (which also accommodate remote screen/tmux/others)
  
Please let me know.

 I installed emacs 29.3 to test(switching from 28.2) but something is wrong with the compilation buffer. When I run &#x27;compile(with running a .sh file) another windows launches(as usual) .For some reason if .sh file outputs something emacs hangs for a half a second or even a second before rendering the output in the other buffer. The output still renders as fast as 28.2 but it hangs before rendering the first output. If there is no output for some reason it works as usual.
 This issue happens on both 29.2 and 29.3 but not on 28.2. Does anyone have any idea what could cause this?
 Edit:
 It seems like colored ansi buffer which was attached to the compilaiton buffer output causes this on 29.3 and 29.2, I disabled it and it&#x27;s fixed.

                              <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;ll shortly be starting a new role as a tech writer, where much of the docs are written in Docbook and DITA.
 I&#x27;m hoping to do the bulk of my work in org-mode and export to the required format.
 I&#x27;ve seen an exporter for Docbook, but I wonder if anyone has successfully used Emacs/org-mode to work with DITA content? Any recommendations? How are custom tags handled? And how can I best work with Docbook/DITA files that were created in another editor, like OxygenXML?
 Thanks in advance.
 Edit: typo

                              <span>I&#x27;m wondering how Emacs will fare against AI code completion (i.e. copilot) as it becomes able to generate whole files of code. I get that Emacs will be able to adapt... but VSCode and Microsoft and OpenAI are becoming integrated with each other and with backend resources that will be beyond our reach. It seems like this might be the beginning of the end (for coding, anyway).

Haskell is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what’s going on in its community.

A boolean is maybe true by Håkon Robbestad Gylterud
The following is an exploration of a few functions I found while writing various Haskell programs over the years. Their names collide with some standard function in Prelude, which is unfortunate, and while the new functions cannot be used as drop-in replacements of the prelude functions, they are morally generalisations.
cabal fields by Oleg Grenrus
cabal-fields is partly motivated by the Migrate from the .cabal format to a widely supported format issue. Whether it’s a solution or not, it’s up to you to decide.

 The example I came up with (and then setting manually &#x27;Heading 1.1&#x27; an &#x27;Heading 1.2&#x27; to DONE) doesn&#x27;t work:

 Any ideas how it can be done?

                              <span>Liquid Haskell is a compiler plugin for GHC that can
verify properties
of Haskell programs. It used to be a standalone analyser tool,
but it was converted to a plugin later on. This makes it feasible to support Haskell modules that use the latest language features, and immediately integrates
the verification into the build workflows; but it also implies that Liquid Haskell
is rather coupled with the internals of GHC. A consequence of this
coupling is that a version of Liquid Haskell is likely to require
modifications to support newer versions of the compiler. The effort

 I ask because I wonder to what extent can dependent typing already be achieved in effect in current Haskell via &#x27;emulation&#x27; (without safety guarantees) as an experiment/playground.

                              <span>As I am learning Haskell, I decided to try taking an existing function I had made and modifying it to use the State monad. I won&#x27;t go into a lot of detail, but basically it&#x27;s traversing an s-expression graph and adding each sub-expression to a new representation, called a Case. When it adds a sub-expression, it checks whether that sub-expression has already been added, and if it has, it doesn&#x27;t bother trying to add it again. In my old code, I can use a guard to do that check. In the new code, there&#x27;s no way to use a guard (I think) because the Case is the state, and thus it is not directly available until I grab it with get. I have to do that twice, since my function is matching over two patterns, and thus the version of the code using the State monad and without guards is considerably lon…</span>

                              <span>I have clang installed in a docker container which I&#x27;m able to interact with in emacs through tramp. The motivation is to replicate a dev-container like environment in emacs. As much as possible, at any rate (as per this post).
 I can access the docker container&#x27;s filesystem through the path /docker:container_name:/path/to/file. I&#x27;m using the clang-format package in emacs, which allows me to run clang-format on buffers. I&#x27;d like it to use the clang-format binary installed in the container. By default, it will look on my local filesystem, so have fiddled with the clang-format.el. It used to read:
 (defcustom clang-format-executable (or (executable-find &quot;clang-format&quot;) &quot;clang-format&quot;) &quot;Location of the clang-format executable. A string containing the name or the full path of the executable.&quot; :group &#x27;clang-format :type &#x27;(file :must-match t) :risky t) 
 and have bodged it to the following:
 (defcustom clang-format-executable &quot;/docker:container_name:/usr/bin/clang-format&quot; &quot;Location of the clang-format executable. A string containing the name or the full path of the executable.&quot; :group &#x27;clang-format :type &#x27;(file :must-match t) :risky t) 
 But when trying to run clang-format in a buffer, I get:
 apply: Searching for program: No such file or directory, /docker:container_name:/usr/bin/clang-format 
 Clearly I&#x27;m doing something stupid, but I&#x27;m sort of out of ideas at this point. Presumably this is actually possible; eglot can invoke &#x60;clangd&#x60; in the container as its LSP; that all works really nicely straight out of the box, but I have absolutely no idea where to even start looking in eglot to figure out how it works...

 Any one know what else I should check or how to diagnose this ? I am on linux wayland with this emacs version.
 GNU Emacs 29.3 (build 1, x86_64-solus-linux-gnu, GTK+ Version 3.24.41, cairo version 1.18.0)
 Not sure what to check or why it might not be working, I have consult embark vertico orederless plugins but they all have minimal configuration.

                              <span>Read Emacs Coding-Conventions, it recommended
  
Indent the file using the default indentation parameters.
  
which means enabling indent-tabs-mode and results mixed SPACE and TAB.
 Checking some Emacs built-in packages, such as simple.el and indent.el, via global-whitespace-mode, you will find they are all mixed SPACE and TAB.
 However, many coding styles guide recommend (setq-default indent-tabs-mode nil) to use spaces for indentation. No hard tabs.
 Do you use TAB or SPACE for indenting Emacs Lisp code?
 Personally, I prefer SPACE over TAB for two reasons:
  
Many other programming language now use SPACE for indentation.
 SPACE is compatible with more editors without special settings. Note that because of the tab-width variable, using TAB is not a problem in Emacs, but other editors might not. For example, this let* is not aligned on GitHub.
  
TAB has its own advantage, such as reducing code size, but it&#x27;s no longer a problem in 2024.
 Unfortunately, if you&#x27;d like to submit patches to the GNU Emacs community, you might still have to use TAB instead of SPACE to follow the convention. That is why I am still keep indent-tabs-mode enabled now.
 Any comment about it?

                              <span>Could anyone get a startup license for Akka from Lightbend? I&#x27;ve started from their website&#x27;s Pricing page. I&#x27;ve filled out the huge license request form full with invisible (!) selection boxes.
 At the end I&#x27;ve reached the confirmation page.
 License request confirmation
 A few day later I&#x27;ve got an email with a link to the same page to fill out.
  
Dear Gyula, 
  
Thank you for your interest in Lightbend and registering for an Akka Startup License. 
 The Akka Startup License is a new BSL 1.1 source Available license, for Production usage, and there is no cost for companies with under $25M in revenue. Click here to register for an Akka Startup License.
 I&#x27;ve filled the same form again ang got exctly the same response... when I&#x27;ve found myself in an infinite loop. 
 I&#x27;ve also tried to respond to their email with the subject: &quot;Last Chance for Akka Startup License!&quot; which I&#x27;ve got the same response: fill out the (same) license request form I&#x27;ve filled out twice already.
 I get marketing newsletters since the first application, but still no idea how to reach them to get a startup license for my own small company. (way below $25M revenue)
 Any help would be most welcome!

                              <span>I&#x27;d definitely like to know about them, especially if they&#x27;re younger. I&#x27;ve tried researching this and thought they&#x27;re just extremely rare, but every day I learn about more companies using Scala I didn&#x27;t know of (but, they&#x27;ve usually been around for +10 years though), so it got me curious if there are some that have been founded relatively recently. These are just some I know of:
  
Verneek
 Narrative
 Ziverge
 Conduktor
  
And these are all US-based, so I&#x27;m sure there are others in other countries!

                              <span>It seems currently the webdev tech is trending where the client side computations are sourced to the server side. After each user interaction with the web app, the server renders a new HTML, computes the diff, sends it to the client and the thin JS layer on the client side applies it to update the page.
 This tech is available with:
  
Elixir Phoenix - Live View
 Ruby on Rails - Hotwire
 C# Blazor
  
At a glance, it&#x27;s an exciting tech as you no longer need to worry about splitting your app into two platforms, or at least minimize such a split.
 AFAIK Play or any other Scala web framework doesn&#x27;t feature anything like that. Has anyone been working on an implementation for Scala? What are your thoughts on the tech? Particularly, Elixir claims they e.g. have an advantage over Ruby due to its parallel-first runtime - how do you think Scala&#x27;s parallel capabilities (Akka, Pekko) relate to Elixir&#x27;s runtime?

                              <span>Hi,
 I often find myself wanting to edit TODO headers when viewing the Agenda (spelling errors, better phrasing, clarifying etc etc).
 My current process is: go to the offending line -&gt; follow link to org file with TODO item -&gt; edit header text -&gt; save org-file -&gt; reload Agenda view.
 But I can&#x27;t stop thinking there must be a better/quicker way of doing this, something like Wdired for Agenda view?

                              <span>Hi everyone! 
 I just started to organise myself with org-mode and org-roam. I tried out a bunch of different programs(notion, anytype, obsidian, logseq). From all of those Obsidian was the best since it was so easy to implement a working note taking system(and a second brain). The only problem with Obsidian is that it&#x27;s not open-source and I can&#x27;t use it on my work machine, so I decided to look for other options.
 In my work life I live in neovim like 90% of the time and I don&#x27;t want to change that. (I tried Emacs for work, but that was a bad experience, since the lsp was slow and I spent several seconds between jump-to-definition etc.)
 I heard a lot about org-mode before, so I decided to give it a try and man.. I love it already. I see the unlimited possibilities(thatswhy it&#x27;s so unfortuante that I can&#x27;t use emacs as a primary IDE). 
 Now I&#x27;m trying to setup a meeting and personal tasking process for myself. In Obsidian I used the following people and meeting notes suggestion and it was very nice. people notes template, meeting notes template
 I&#x27;m looking for something similar. What I really like:
  
I have autocompletion for attendees
 I can query for meeting for an attendee in their person notes
 I can capture a new person very easily
 I can capture a new meeting either quickly or retroactively
  
I&#x27;m still learning the capabilities of org, org-roam, so I just wanted to ask you how to implement a similar approach? 
 Do you have any other recommendation for me?
 I also like that I can leave next actions as todos, so I can see them in org-agenda.

                              <span>In this task, you are going to build a rule evaluation mechanism. 
 Implement the following function:
 function evaluate(order: Order, rules: Rule[]): Boolean 
 When “order” is a object with the following (encoded to json) structure:
 { &quot;id&quot;:101, &quot;total_price&quot;:193.95, &quot;created_at&quot;:&quot;2018-01-30T17:35:48.000Z&quot;, &quot;email&quot;:&quot;SEAN@yahoo.com&quot;, &quot;browser_ip&quot;:&quot;54.196.243.29&quot;, &quot;currency&quot;:&quot;USD&quot;, &quot;billing_info&quot;:{ &quot;first_name&quot;:&quot;Sean&quot;, &quot;city&quot;:&quot;Fountain Inn&quot;, &quot;country&quot;:&quot;US&quot; } } 
 And “rules” represents a list of rules, when each rule is of the following (encoded as json) structure:
  [ { field: &quot;email&quot;, operator: &quot;.ends_with?&quot;, value: &quot;yahoo.com&quot; } }, { { field: &quot;total_price&quot;, operator: &quot;&gt;&quot;, value: 1500 } ] } ] 
 The function should return true if there is at least one rule on which the order was evaluated a…</span>

                              <span>https://github.com/ichernyshovvv/completing-read-strings
 The package provides a function, completing-read-strings, that allows to read strings in the minibuffer, with completing-read under the hood.
 Usage:
 (completing-read-strings &quot;PROMPT: &quot; &#x27;(&quot;first&quot; &quot;sec,ond&quot; &quot;third&quot;)) 
  
The candidates are chosen by pressing RET.
 Pressing C- erases the last chosen candidate.
 Pressing C- exits reading and returns the list of chosen candidates.
  
Rationale
 In completing-read-multiple, the result list of chosen strings is made by splitting the input string with crm-separator regular expression variable.
 This approach is not suitable in several situations:
  
Candidates might contain the default , separator. In this case, the candidate with , inside will be treated as two typed candidates:
  
Example:
 (completing-read-multiple &quot;PROMPT: &quot; &#x27;(&quot;first&quot; &quot;sec,ond&quot; &quot;third&quot;)) ;;  ;; &#x3D;&gt; (&quot;sec&quot; &quot;ond&quot;) 
 A developer have to locally rebind crm-separator and tell the user which character to type to separate the candidates.
 (let ((crm-separator &quot;[ \t]*|[ \t]*&quot;)) (completing-read-multiple &quot;Type &#x60;|&#x27; to select another candidate: &quot; &#x27;(&quot;first&quot; &quot;sec,ond&quot; &quot;third&quot;))) 
  
Candidates might contain any character, so it&#x27;s hard to pick easily typed separator. Example: Org headings, file names. In this case a developer might use \n as a separator, which a user can enter by pressing C-o and moving the cursor 1 char forward to be able to display the list of candidates (which is not convenient).
  
Example:
 (let ((crm-separator &quot;[ \t]*\n[ \t]*&quot;)) (completing-read-multiple &quot;Prompt: &quot; &#x27;(&quot;first.&quot; &quot;sec,ond&quot; &quot;third;&quot;))) 
 completing-read-strings solves the issue by providing a function that have the same interface for all kind of candidates. Internally, collects the chosen candidates into a list during reading and then returns it (without the need to split the input string with regular expression).

                              <span>Hey all,
 I sometimes want LSP to auto-import some dependencies. When I call &#x60;lsp-execute-code-action&#x60;, expecting auto-import action to be executed, emacs creates empty file and moves me to there instead.
 When there is no code action, LSP inserts a dumb action for creating a new file and moving there. So if LSP is too slow to find out the actual code action needed, it creates a new file instead.
 This issue is ruining my workflow and wanted to ask if anyone else encountered. I got following shourtcut in my setup:
 (local-set-key (kbd &quot;M-i f&quot;) &#x27;lsp-execute-code-action)
 Any recommendations?

I also published 3 scripts that support Linux and macOS (both Intel and Apple Silicon CPU).
  
e : start independent Emacs process in terminal mode
 ge: start independent Emacs process in graphics mode
 ec: start an Emacs client in terminal or graphics mode, start the Emacs daemon if it&#x27;s not already running. Also has option to check if the daemon is running or just start the daemon.

                              <span>I use Mouse to operate Emacs. 
 Place the cursor somewhere (pos1) at LINE 1 (without mark anything), then scroll the text down through the window, press SHIFT and click at somewhere (pos2) at LINE 1000. The expected behavior is selecting all text content between pos1 and pos2, just like VS CODE and other modern editors. Is this behavior possible in Emacs?
 One possible technical barrier I found is that Emacs cursor moves as the screen scrolls and cannot be fixed in a certain position, except mark it manually. 
 P.s. I know there is variable &#x60;scroll-preserve-screen-position&#x60;, but it is not what I want.

                              <span>Agda is a dependently typed language. Idris is a dependently typed language, but with a less particular focus on mathematical theorem proving. Haskell does not have dependent types as such. All three of the languages are part of the Haskell universe.
 Outside of academia (Agda, ?Idris/Idris2), what could be some advantages of dependent types? 
 Note: indeed, &#x27;outside of&#x27; is a relative term here--many say Haskell is an ivory tower language.

 How can I do the opposite? Trigger the parent to be DONE once the children are DONE? I tried this, but it doesn&#x27;t work:
 * Heading 1 :PROPERTIES: :TRIGGER: if children then todo!(DONE) endif :END: ** Heading 2 ** Heading 3

                              <span>I recently upgraded from emacs 28.2 to 29.3. I noticed that if I opened an 11MB org-mode file (that used to give me no problems with speed or performance on 28.2) and then invoked org-refile once, then suddenly any user interaction involving the big 11MB buffer (from text entry to simply activating the buffer) would take forever to execute.
 I wondered if it was something in my config, and eventually noticed that switching org-refile-use-cache from t to the default nil stopped the slowdown from happening after invoking org-refile. I confirmed the issue was seemingly solved by running a minimal org-mode config in an emacs -Q session and observing that the slowdown only happened if org-refile-use-cache was set to t.
 So I decided to just stop setting org-refile-use-cache to t and everything …</span>

                              <span>I currently use Google Contacts to manage my contacts on Android and PC (web app). But I&#x27;m now trying to get rid of Google (I just started using notmuch, goimapnotify, mbsync, msmtp, etc. instead of Gmail web app).
 I read that synching Google Contacts with a Desktop was a nightmare, so I thought about using an open-source Android contact management app instead (like Fossify Contact, OpenContacts or ConnectYou).
 The idea would be to start from a Google Contact export and then continuously populate either the Mobile app or the Desktop app.
 On the Desktop side, I&#x27;d prefer to use Emacs (e.g. ebdb or org-contact). Ideally, Syncthing would do the sync between Mobile and Desktop.
 I couldn&#x27;t find tutorials on how to implement this. Would you have any advice (my desktop OS is Linux Arch)?

 Resulting buffer
 Original buffer
 It looks like every character is swapped with something. It is reflective too which is very interesting in my opinion.
 It also looks like the frame is cursed, not the buffer :D. I can confirm that by opening the buffer in any other frame or opening any other buffer in this frame.
 What I wonder is if this is like an Easter Egg, or a bug?

 Resulting buffer
 Original buffer
 It looks like every character is swapped with something. It is reflective too which is very interesting in my opinion.
 It also looks like the frame is cursed, not the buffer :D. I can confirm that by opening the buffer in any other frame or opening any other buffer in this frame.
 What I wonder is if this is like an Easter Egg, or a bug?

                              <span>How is the support for tree-sitter syntax highlight on LaTeX files currently? I&#x27;ve been using Emacs 29 with tree-sitter explicitly enabled when building it (probably redundant for 29, but just to be sure), and still couldn&#x27;t find a way to enable it for TeX mode. Could someone using it now help me by pointing out where to start to make it work?

 Any idea about why it freezes or hangs?

                              <span>To any elisp developers out there, please don&#x27;t hardcode the name and options for external programs. A better alternative is to use variables named -program and -program-options , or -command and -command-options . 
 Relying on $PATH for program resolution is great until it doesn&#x27;t work.

                              <span>I just installed a brand new Debian GNU/Linux 12 box, then installed GNU Emacs 28.2 using &#x60;apt-get install emacs&#x60;. It works fine. But when editing a regular text-file, I find about one time in eight that I press the space bar, as well as inserting the space, it emits a beep, as though I had typed C-g. This seems to be random: sometimes I will type 20 or more spaces with no beeps, other times two or three consecutive spaces might beep. The space-bar is bound to regular self-insert-command as you would expect.
 Does anyone know how to prevent this harmless but very irritating quirk?
 (And why is it happening straight out of the box?)

                              <span>Hi there i am a student and have a github student dev pack. It comes with copilot and I use it when something don&#x27;t make sense in my code and to write commit messages and do a quick chat in vscode. I cant affort any other paid service and i hate using vscode. Neovim has a great extension for copilot chat with plethora of features but on emacs side the support is very minimal with just the copilot.el. I can understand why such thing land late in emacs community due to FOSS principles and i totally respect that. Should i lose hope on good copilot support in emacs and just accept the reality? Folks who use copilot is there any good copilot package that i am not aware of?

 Just the ways you have seen people use Haskell that goes completely against the way it is meant to be used.
 Bonus if it was code used in prod.

                              <span>doctest is an amazing tool to maintain a consistent documentation, but also to avoid writing separate test files in some cases.
 There are multiple implementation of doctest with different tradeoffs:
  
doctest: the original one. See this pretty example: r/haskell/comments/14xizu0/haddockdoctestcairo/
 doctest-parallel. See its announcement: r/haskell/comments/rnkof1/ann_doctestparallel_isolate_and_speed_up_your/
 doctest-extract
 Maybe more, please share!
  
What is you experience with them and which one do you prefer?
