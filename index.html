                              <span>I have been experimenting with tab-bar-mode which I have found very useful for arranging my workspaces. I frequently open a directory in dired and like to work from that. I can open files in tab-bar mode using C-x t C-f but I would like simply to be able to simply  on a file in dired and have it optionally open that file in a tab. I say optionally because I would not like to do this with all my files, but only when I choose to create a workspace of tabs.

                              <span>Is there a trick to getting the emacs daemon running in WSL2?
 It launches fine, but emacsclient can’t find the socket and doesn’t think a server is running. 
 If I set EMACS_SERVER_FILE the socket file isn’t created and (obv) emacsclient can’t find it. 
 I have no such issues doing the exact same thing on windows with the same CFGs.

                              <span>Hi.
 Don&#x27;t really know is this is the correct place to ask this but here it goes.
 I&#x27;m using Doom Emacs and I&#x27;m trying to debug some PHP Laravel code using LSP+debug. Remote debugging seems to be working fine but, in Emacs, when I inspect variables there is less information than in VS Code. Noticed this especially in Model instances.
 Below is a screenshot comparison of the same inspection in both Emacs and VS Code.
 As you can see, in Emacs the last entry is escapeWhenCastingToString and in VS Code there are entries for attributes, original, changes, ...
 Have no clue where to begin to fix this... Any help is appreciated.
 Thanks in advance.

 Is anyone else experiencing this or maybe I have my configs messed up?

                              <span>I need to add a UUID to each row in a table, but I also need to keep any existing IDs without changing them.
 It&#x27;s simple enough to add a UUID with &#x27;(org-id-new):
 | Col1 | UUID | |-------+--------------------------------------| | test1 | 1BFBFCAA-CD59-4D4E-9956-CA27B3DCED1E | | test2 | 18209466-723B-4820-A175-0237769548FD | #+TBLFM: $2&#x3D;&#x27;(org-id-new) 
 Going forward I want to keep those UUIDs and only generate new ones for new rows.
 I thought I could try &#x27;(unless $2 (org-id-new)), but I get nils.
 Is there a reference for the current cell, or a way to only apply a calculation to an empty cell?

                              <span>Hello All,
 I am trying to figure out which is better. I used to do evil with Doom, but I decided to try out generic emacs bindings and I enjoyed them . Then I found meow and I like the inbetween&#x27;ness of Meow. Which is better for someone who doesnt want to customize all day? For example I probably will be using framework for the rest of my life and dont particularly care to over customize. Should I just keep with the &quot;emacs bindings&quot; or should I keep up with modal editing. OR just decide on the more popular framework because im lazy. 
 Excuse the Ravings Posted this before bed.
 ​
 TL:DR: Should i stick with Emacs bindings or modal. (i used evil/doom) for someone who would rather let someone take the reigns.
 ​
 Thanks everyone

                              <span>i consider myself an intermediate haskell developer. i know the core language pretty well although in my usual applications i don&#x27;t use many of the advanced type system features ( mainly because my work involves a lot of Sets and Maps which are not instances of the Functor hierarchy.) i am a library developer (internal/proprietary) and my applications are in the quantitative domain
 i feel like my knowledge can be improved in getting good performance in haskell. my usual approach to improving performance is using profiteur and optimising the big blocks there. but i don&#x27;t know very much about when to use strictness annotations or other stuff to squeeze out better performance. 
 also not sure if my haskell is very idomatic since i&#x27;m fully self taught. Any books or resources i should look at? thanks

supposed to be working on, and I really like it so far.
So, it seemed like a good idea to actually join the forum, and follow the discussions to get more fo the various perspectives that people have on the system.

I have had no reply so far.
Here is the link of my post: 


If some knowledgeable Zettelkasten practitioners on this forum could reply my question with clarity, or simply correcting me, I would be thankful.</span>

 I keep records using org-agenda. In the above example I am adding an anniversary date to my agenda. The second date range is only for record purposes and should not be displayed in the agenda. How can I achieve this?

                              <span>Hi all,
 I admit the title is a bit catchy, because I wanted to slightly leverage Cunningham&#x27;s law. Sorry for that! 🙂
 I&#x27;m an intermediate Org user, and I haven&#x27;t yet picked up Org-roam, simply because I can&#x27;t see the usefulness of the Zettlekasten method in my life (that may be the topic for another post). Anyway, I&#x27;m writing my Master&#x27;s thesis, and I want to keep a journal of what I discover, sort like a log of the research/ideas that might turn out to be useful. At first, I used built-in Org capture&#x27;s functionalities, with a plain text journal.

 This time, I want to generate a linear timeline directly within my org file to later be exported to PDF. Does anyone know of a way to accomplish this?

 I am looking to export to PDF from org-mode with the same looks as in org-mode/emacs and the same selected theme.
 Check out [1] to get an idea to what I am trying to achieve (goal is to export to PDF instead of png images with the same looks as in [1]). 
 Thanks!

                              <span>At Tweag, we write a lot of code using the Nix language. Most of that code produces derivations or packages but occasionally we write small helper functions that are algorithmic in nature. As diligent developers and when appropriate, we should write unit tests to ensure the correctness and maintainability of our code. This post will demonstrate and compare various ways available in the Nix ecosystem to add unit testing to your Nix code — specifically Nix functions.

Minimal Examples
We will start with minimal working examples from 3 different frameworks and then show off some extra features and capabilities. If you would like to test out these examples yourself, you can find them all here.

 I have this table on my postgres db, create table public.some ( ...some fields, dates date[], times time[]). On Scala side I want to treat them as Seq[String] for ease on visual representation. Then I&#x27;ve created two Meta instances: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; implicit val dateArrayMeta: Meta[Seq[String]] &#x3D; Meta.Advanced .array[java.util.Date](&quot;date&quot;, &quot;date&quot;) .timap(_.map(dateFormat.format).toSeq)(dateArray &#x3D;&gt; dateArray.map(date &#x3D;&gt; dateFormat.parse(date)).toArray)
 implicit val timeArrayMeta: Meta[Seq[String]] &#x3D; Meta.Advanced .array[java.util.Date](&quot;time&quot;, &quot;time&quot;) .timap(.map(timeFormat.format).toSeq)(dateArray &#x3D;&gt; dateArray.map(date &#x3D;&gt; new java.sql.Time(timeFormat.parse(date).getTime)).toArray)  But the compiler yells at me with type mismatch:  found : Seq[String] required: doobie.syntax.SqlInterpolator.SingleFragment[]; incompatible interpolation method sql &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

                              <span>Currently, my requirements are:
  
Scala 3
 HTTP server (including WebSockets)
 HTTP client
 Postgres
 Pulsar
  
And of course more will come along later.
 I had been using Akka and Quill before, but it looks like ProtoQuill uses ZIO 2. Okay, so there&#x27;s ZIO-HTTP for ZIO 2, which covers my HTTP requirements, but the zio-pulsar library doesn&#x27;t support ZIO 2 yet.
 So I&#x27;m not sure which direction to go. I could stick with Akka, but then which Scala 3 database library would I use? I don&#x27;t think Slick supports Scala 3 yet. Doobie uses Cats.
 This is all quite confusing. Is it just too early to start using Scala 3?

 In my time with doobie, my case classes were simpler, so zero complications, until now. Within my table there&#x27;s a column &quot;dates&quot;, which is a date array. On the Scala side my case class has a field dates: Seq[String]. This is because, the field is read only so the string representation is great. But I cannot figure how to declare the desired Metaor at least Get mapping.

                              <span>Final Update (barring new insight), I have switched to using msmtp for outgoing mail and it works perfectly. Links below.
  
Hey, I recently set up mu4e following SystemCrafter&#x27;s guide and was pleased to find everything worked upon setup.
 However, about a week later I found Emacs now hangs entirely whenever I try to send a message. I don&#x27;t recall making any changes to my config since then, though have had system updates (Fedora)
 Running a backtrace of the freeze using SIGUSR 2, I get this:
 * substitute-command-keys(&quot;Quit&quot;) make-network-process(:name &quot;smtpmail&quot; :buffer # :host &quot;smtp.office365.com&quot; :service 25 :coding nil) network-stream-open-starttls(&quot;smtpmail&quot; # &quot;smtp.office365.co…</span>

 Practically speaking, I&#x27;m calling these processes from org-open and shr-open, but this behavior shows up when calling &#x60;(call-process &quot;xdg-open&quot; 0 nil 0 &quot;https://duckduckgo.com&quot;)&#x60;. Anybody know what gives?

                              <span>Hey there,
 Does anyone know why &#x27;here doc&#x27; syntax (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here_document) with the &#x27;&lt;&lt;-&#x27; symbol does not automatically get indented in Ruby files with Emacs? 
 Here&#x27;s an example:
 This gets indented in other editors just fine:
  def self.create_table sql &#x3D; &lt;&lt;-SQL CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS songs ( id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, album TEXT ) SQL DB[:conn].execute(sql) end 
 This same block in Emacs does not get indented at all:
  def self.create_table sql &#x3D; &lt;&lt;-SQL CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS songs ( id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, album TEXT ) SQL 
 Here&#x27;s my config snippet for my Emacs with LSP config:
  
Here&#x27;s a link to a snippet of my Emacs config that I have using a literate Emacs config in a &#x27;~/.emacs.d/configuration.org&#x27; file:

 my package zuul.el, which integrates build logs from Zuul into Emacs, is now available on ELPA. I have made a blog post, Bring Zuul into Emacs, which describes (in text and with gifs) the features of the package :)

As I have lost my ability to tolerate non emacs keybinding I write my e-mails with emacs as much as I organize my theories (org-roam).
 Have I passed the point of no return? Am I lost here forever? Is there something like alcoholics anonymous for like fated people?

 Issue:
  
I&#x27;m getting this message appear in my &#x27;*Messages*&#x27; buffer when I visit a Ruby based file with the &#x27;.rb&#x27; file extension on MacOS:
  
​
 LSP :: The following servers support current file but do not have automatic installation: ruby-ls sorbet-ls typeprof-ls ruby-syntax-tree-ls steep-ls You may find the installation instructions at https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/page/languages. (If you have already installed the server check *lsp-log*). 
 What I Have Done:
  
I installed &#x27;Solargraph&#x27; via the &#x27;gem install solargraph&#x27; command on both my Linux machine (Manjaro Linux) and MacOS machine.
 I made sure to include a change to my &#x27;~/.bashrc&#x27; config to include the following section on both my Linux machine (Manjaro Linux) and MacOS machine (Macbook Pro):
  
​
 # Ruby specific variables: export GEM_HOME&#x3D;&quot;$HOME/.gem&quot; 
 Current Emacs Config Snippet Containing My LSP Based Config Section:
  
Here&#x27;s a link to a snippet of my Emacs config that I have using a literate Emacs config in a &#x27;~/.emacs.d/configuration.org&#x27; file: 
 https://bpa.st/3PQA
 
  
​
 Question:
  
What can I do in this scenario?

                              <span>I have opened Emacs&#x27; Info (C-h i) and am trying to open different sections/manuals in two side-by-side windows, e.g. node Elisp Into&gt;Buffers on the left, and Elisp Reference&gt;Buffers on the right; or even simply different parts of the same multi-screen page, as done in any other context.
 But I see exactly the same content in both windows, whatever action I take in one of them. I have verified that follow-mode is disabled. So I am forced to switch back and forth between two running Emacs instances and view one manual page at a time.
 Is this a quirk of Info-mode, or am I missing something?
 I use Emacs 28.1
 Thanks for any comment...

 I don&#x27;t see anyone talking about it.
 Do people still use it?
 How does it compare to the moderm LSP experience?

Over the years, I have found that, in the beginning, users might get annoyed when they find a missing feature. And they start exploring packages. But with experience, they come to know that there is already an emacsy way of doing the same thing.

 Can you explain, how it work, or maybe, you have a link to some simple tutorial specifically about undo/redo.
 I am trying to learn it from the official emacs tour page, but it&#x27;s confusing.

 doubled :: [Int] -&gt; [Int] 
 I guess my question would be how to access each element to double it. Thank you

                              <span>A few of my students have encountered a problem running HLS 1.7 on Windows 10/11. Their Haskell installations mostly seem okay---everything installed by ghcup (1.8) , and cabal (3.6.2) and ghc (9.2.2) work as expected. However, when VS Code (via the Haskell plugin) attempts to start the language server, it exits repeatedly with error STATUS_DLL_NOT_FOUND (or its signed integer equivalent).
 Has anyone encountered a configuration that leads to this problem before? Most of the students are not having this problem (nor am I, on similar software configurations), so I suspect it&#x27;s a consequence of something else they have installed.

 I was thinking about this topic for a long time.
 This post has high level technical discussion and some notes about psychology, but it mostly came from thinking about code as something that comes with cognitive effort and that this effort should be kept under control.
 I would like to solicit feedback from Haskell and FP programmers first before I start showing it to a wider audience.
 It is a high level rant that includes quite a bit of FP and Haskell.
 Thank you for taking a look.

                              <span>Bellroy helps people carry better by making great bags, phone cases, and wallets. We’re Australia’s Best Place to Work (&lt; 100 employees category), we’ve grown rapidly, and we’re now looking to expand our Technology Team to keep pace with that ongoing growth. We’re not a software company, but software development is one of our core competencies. This means the Technology Team rarely works to hard delivery deadlines (we prioritise “correct” over “now”) and regularly makes open-source contributions.
 We&#x27;re looking for a Haskell developer who can balance shipping features with improving this codebase every time they change it. While we&#x27;re not afraid of the occasional inelegant hack, we&#x27;d much prefer to look back and see that we used the right tools and abstractions, instead of brute force.

 That said you might care about:
  
 Create Entries without requiring an Internet connection to load Categories, Tags, and Pages. Previously it would error out preventing you from creating the Entry on your computer.
  WordPress 6 broke View Entry. Fixed.
  Although you were unlikely to have used org2blog-buffer-post-or-page-view or org2blog-subtree-post-or-page-view, you can&#x27;t anymore. See their function for details. Guessing you were unlikely since the break was never reported.
  Easier to check for compilation errors since long docstrings now get ignored.

                              <span>I have lots of tasks and I would like to create a long backlog based on my perceived priority.
 I was thinking to deal with them in the following way:
  
divide them in groups,
 manually sort priority for every group,
 mergesort groups, that is, start merging groups in pairs, and manually sort for every step the union group until I have a large sorted backlog.
  
For this to be practical, I would need an easy way to sort manually a group of tasks and get them assigned automatically a priority (or any other hack) so that priority ordering matchs manual ordering.
 Any idea about how to get this done?

                              <span>I gave Orgzly a chance, but it doesn&#x27;t do what I need it to do. I use org-roam to link my notes together, and it would be great if an app recognized org-roam formatting such as backlinks, metadata, ids, and aliases. Also, I&#x27;m not a huge fan of how writing to org files requires you to basically fill out a form, I&#x27;d much rather edit it right in the editor, in a WYSIWYG fashion. 
 Basically, I want an app like Obsidian but for org files instead of markdown. I know there is also Logseq, but Logseq uses wikilinks instead of org-roam&#x27;s id-based linking format. 
 Coincidentally, I&#x27;m just starting school for Mobile App Development in September. I don&#x27;t have the skills to make this yet, but if nobody else does, I will for sure once I&#x27;m able to.

Is it somehow possible mixing ordered and unordered list, for different levels, in the same list?
 Use case: Quite often I make lists where the top level is ordered (do these items in this order), but the next level(s) should rather be unordered, as they are more &quot;comments&quot; or thoughts, but having them ordered looks a bit silly, as if &quot;you must do it in this order&quot;. Especially when sharing notes with others.
 Desired way of using it, something like:
 1. Item 1 - Sub item 1 - Sub item 2 2. Item 2 - Sub item 1

 Some people are happy just searching their notes by titles, some also like to search tags by adding them into org-roam-node-display-template, and others like to do full text search with ripgrep. These worked OK for me, but they each had their own disadvantages, so I was looking for something different.
 Let&#x27;s say I have a note called &quot;Python Linting and Formatting&quot;. In the tags I might have something like :python:linters, in other words, very generic tags, which is how I like it.

 So can I ask Emacs about the current active folding mode? Which is it? (e.g. hsminor, vdiff, origiami, ...)

 How can I customize it so that the error message doesn&#x27;t break like so?
 Sorry for the noob question, I tried to figure it out and read the documentation provided, but could not do it.
 SOLUTION:
 The issue with wrapping lines is caused when using a fixed font, so removing the value set to font face height solved the issue for me.
 Another thing I tried was changing the font to a non-mono-spaced one, but I decided to stick with the first one.

 I&#x27;m using Arch Linux and every time I compile, I have to open the PDF with Brave.
 Here https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/PDF,_PS_and_DjVu it seems like there are PDF engines, viewers etc, but I don&#x27;t understand what to do :D
 Any suggestions on how I can automate this?
 Have a nice day!

 ((&quot;Apples&quot; (:quantity 10 :location pantry)) (&quot;Bananas&quot; (:quantity 3 :location counter)) (&quot;Cucumbers&quot; (:quantity 5 :location fridge)) 
 I want to define a function that will prompt the user with a list consisting of Apples, Bananas, and Cucumbers, will allow the user to choose multiple items, and will output a list consisting of all the cdr of those lists whose car was selected by the user.

 I figured out how to do a single item version of it:

 This is my first time doing this.... and I am rather new to haskell!

 General questions:
 A lot of my question relate to create user defined types with QuickCheck.
 ​
  
Question 1: So if I do something like this
  
​
  instance Arbitrary MyVariable where arbitrary &#x3D; MyVariable  arbitrary 
 Do I really want to put this is in the same file MyVariable is made? Wouldn&#x27;t I only want this instance in the testfile? I assume this would be better because then it is only be used when I am calling &quot;stack test&quot; Wouldn&#x27;t putting this instance in the file MyVariable.hs expose this to the entire project that imports MyVariable.hs ?
  
Question 2: How do I have QuickCheck test user defined types within userdefined types? So would I just make an arbitr…</span>

                              <span>I wanted to use an ECS system in Haskell and I have found apecs and ecstasy. However, both seem to use IntMap for storing component data, so I figured that performance could not be all that great.
 That&#x27;s why I created a new library, hero, which uses sparse sets for storing component data. Basic benchmarks seem to suggest that hero is roughly 40 times faster than apecs at iterating over components.
 The interface for hero is inspired by apecs, but there are some significant differences.
 The library is still rough around the edges, but you can already find it on https://github.com/Simre1/hero. I have also started work on an sdl2 binding which is in the same repository.
 The end goal for hero is to empower people to make simple games in Haskell, but there is still a long way to go.

 For some time now I had a project in mind - website that would teach physics. The issue was that I didn&#x27;t know anything about web development. So I started reading about html, css and javascript, and I tinkered a little with Phaser.js and created very very simple game with it. I also tried wordpress, ihp and django. I also looked at purescript and halogen as was suggested to me on r/haskell three weeks ago. With none of those I spent more than 2 or 3 days though, so I do not really know much about any of these technologies. I just got my pinky a little wet.
 Anyway, thanks to reading discussions on this subreddit, I decided to settle on …</span>

                              <span>For example, this is some snippet from mandelbrot:
 hs {-# INLINE vecNLE #-} vecNLE :: DoubleX24# -&gt; Double# -&gt; Int# vecNLE (# v0, v1, v2, v3 #) f &#x3D; ((v00 &gt;## f) &#x60;andI#&#x60; (v01 &gt;## f) &#x60;andI#&#x60; (v10 &gt;## f) &#x60;andI#&#x60; (v11 &gt;## f) &#x60;andI#&#x60; (v20 &gt;## f) &#x60;andI#&#x60; (v21 &gt;## f) &#x60;andI#&#x60; (v30 &gt;## f) &#x60;andI#&#x60; (v31 &gt;## f)) where !(# v00, v01 #) &#x3D; unpackDoubleX2# v0 !(# v10, v11 #) &#x3D; unpackDoubleX2# v1 !(# v20, v21 #) &#x3D; unpackDoubleX2# v2 !(# v30, v31 #) &#x3D; unpackDoubleX2# v3 
 which, in my eye, is quite ridiculous. Why are the code made like this? Is this obfuscation required to make haskell as performant? Or is the entire benchmarkgame itself full of these kind of code? If the latter is true, I wonder whether benchmarkgame is credible for anything.

                              <span>Hi Everyone,
 mtl-2.3.1-rc1 (https://github.com/haskell/mtl/releases/tag/v2.3.1-rc1) is up on Github. We&#x27;ll give this a 2 week window for issues relating to the changelog, and then do a release. Please review and upgrade if you&#x27;re interested. Backported is also a migration doc for people interested in migrating to mtl-2.3. You can find it in the repo. 
 Special thanks to Koz and everyone else who contributed. 
 Cheers,
 E

                              <span>Currently, i am learning how to build applications with tagless final pattern. However, I am a bit confused at the moment, that which tagless final approach is the right one. I know there are tons of resources out there which states that in tagless final pattern, we use trait as the algebra with a companion object. Most of the times, developers tend to do the implementations in the companion object as well, or create another class (interpreter) where they implement the algebra&#x27;s functions. However, I have seen many solutions where the devs replace the trait + companion object combo with class + companion object one. 
 Honestly, I am pretty confused which approach is the right one: 
 // 1. trait + companion object approach trait Repository[F[_]] { def findAll[A](): F[List[A]] } object Repository { def apply[F[_]]()(implicit ev: Repository[F]): Repository[F] &#x3D; ev def make[F[_]](): Repository[F] &#x3D; new Repository[F] { def findAll[A](): F[List[A]] &#x3D; ... } } // 2. class + companion object approach class Repository[F[_]]() { def findAll[A](): F[List[A]] &#x3D; ... } object Repository { def apply[F[_]](): Repository[F] &#x3D; new Repository[F]() }

                              <span>Hi - I installed Scala via &#x60;cs&#x60; (Coursier) installer. Java version is &quot;1.8.0_341&quot; and it is in the path.
 Checking &#x60;sbt&#x60; version shows &quot;1.7.1&quot; and &#x60;scala&#x60; version is &quot;3.1.3&quot;.
 I tried to test it with basic project but sbt new scala/scala3.g8 (in empty folder) starts from fetching &quot;getting org.scala-sbt sbt 1.3.4&quot; - why? I already have &quot;1.7.1&quot;.
 Then it fails due to access denial:
 [error] [launcher] java.nio.file.AccessDeniedException: C:\Users\tom_n\AppData\Local\Coursier\cache\v1\https\repo1.maven.org\maven2\com\swoval\file-tree-views\2.1.3\file-tree-views-2.1.3.jar -&gt; C:\Users\tom_n\.sbt\boot\scala-2.12.10\org.scala-sbt\sbt\1.3.4\file-tree-views-2.1.3.jar
 [error] [launcher] could not retrieve sbt 1.3.4
 PS. I had older version of &#x60;scala&#x60; and &#x60;sbt&#x60; installed before but I uninstalled them - could it be that there are some artifacts left?

                              <span>Hi All,
My professor has shared many cool worksheets and spreadsheets for organizing literature notes for use in my lit reviews. (Thank you, amazing professor!!) However, as I was going through the examples, I found myself thinking, &quot;hey, couldn&#x27;t I just do this via zettels?&quot;
Here&#x27;s my thinking: Each worksheet or spreadsheet uses a one-line per article approach. For each article, the worksheet provides space to capture the following:
Authors (year)
Relevant Literature &amp; Theory (Major Points, Topics, Ideas, and Who was referenced?)
Purpose of the study
Overview of Study Design (Method, Variables/Key Concepts, Sample - who was studied and how were they selected, Means of Data Collection?)
Major Finding(s)
Conclusions, Implications, &amp; Limitations
Now, here&#x27;s how I currently structure my zettels:

I include the citation in the title
I include a &quot;too long, don&#x27;t read&quot; summary at the top
I write a more expansive entry
I include my own tags for cross-referencing
I include related card links
I include the actual reference
In theory, it should be pretty easy to establish a new template where the top part becomes spots for those worksheet areas. The bottom part would largely remain the same, only the tags would allow me to include things like
Which lit review this is for (creativity &amp; spirituality, agency &amp; organizational transformation, or if it speaks to both)
Findings tags and research method tags (e.g., #creativity-spirituality; #quantitative #survey)
My own brilliant insights and connections
Et cetera.
My questions for this community are:
Thanks in advance for your help with this one!

Right. Well, this week is the first week of school and the first semester of doing my literature reviews for my Ph.D. WOOT!!!! I AM SO EXCITED!!!!
So I&#x27;m reviewing all the different ways I could organize my reading notes for the purposes of my lit review (thank you, fabulous professor, for sharing these resources!) when I start thinking: hey, couldn&#x27;t I just do this on individual zettels?
This week&#x27;s focus, then, is getting my strategy together for how to best leverage the power of my Mighty Zettelkasten in service to a positively smashing lit review.
What are your ZK plans for the week?

Dan Allosso has finished a major rewrite on his and S.F. Allosso’s earlier edition of A Short Handbook for writing essays in the Humanities and Social Sciences. This expanded edition has several new chapters on note making (notice that this is dramatically different than note taking) using a zettelkasten-based (or card index or fichier boîte if you prefer) approach similar to that practiced by Beatrice Webb, Marcel Mauss, Claude Lévi-Strauss, Roland Barthes, Hans Blumenberg, Mortimer J. Adler, and Walter Benjamin among many others.
The focus of the book is on note making for actively producing tangible outputs (essays, papers, theses, monographs, books, etc.). …</span>

                              <span>Hello fellow Zettelnauts,
https://hackmd.io/ is proposing a solution with Github in markdown, so it could be integrate in the archive or obsidian…
Also, a point of concern for me, I have my own archive, and do not wish to create duplicate notes for the common archive. Is there an approach for this or even a solution?
Thanks a lot for your help</span>

                              <span>Hi there,
 I&#x27;m converting my bash and zsh configs to a literate org file and finding noweb quite confusing. I think I understand everything in the manual, but my changes keep breaking it.
 In this commit, all I&#x27;ve done is move two blocks from one noweb-ref to another (previously they inherited their noweb-refs from the subtree properties). This was intended just to clean up the org file without changing the output.
 The tangled shell scripts and zsh.toml haven&#x27;t changed. But bash.toml (which I didn&#x27;t touch at all!) now includes the #+begin_src and #+end lines of the :noweb-ref prompt-format block.
 I&#x27;d be really grateful if anyone could have a look at the diff and let me know where I&#x27;ve gone wrong:
 https://github.com/quarkQuark/dotfiles/commit/82551520806ad2e9c2b22e3bc4446c5352ce14c2
 I&#x27;ve also noticed that sometimes replacing a :noweb-ref header argument with an equivalent #+name makes every noweb reference in the org file expand to the empty string. There seems to be no rhyme or reason for when this happens, but going back to :noweb-ref always fixes it.
 Thanks in advance for any replies.

                              <span>Anyone come up with anything for a calendar? I&#x27;m partial to plain text (aren&#x27;t we all), very much opposed to Google FWIW....
 I&#x27;m kind of in that really weird place where I&#x27;ve got my work calendar, business 1 calendar, business 2 calendar, Family stuff calendar, etc.... and it&#x27;s all just starting to become a mess.
 Truthfully Google Calendar never really made me feel any better when it came to calendaring anyways. I was always in that place of add an event for my days off and deal with the conflicts when I schedule something for said day off... or add every day that I work and delete the days off.... 
 ​
 Any thoughts?

                              <span>Hi guys, hope you all doing fine. I was wondering about a way that makes emacs recognize a key hold, 
 so can i for example create a program that for example when the space bar is pressed and hold then i press another key with it, it would send some Unicode character that i dont use or such a program is impossible.
 I&#x27;m sorry i have no idea about the topic so excuse my ignorance 
 i use ubuntu 20.04 by the way.

                              <span>hi, i would like to know how to fontify text between quote marks in org-mode.
 the way it appears in my scratch buffer, which is lisp i believe, would be great. example here: https://imgur.com/a/C1eaQAd
 i found this post that seemingly describes how to do it, but i evaluated the code given in the response and it doesn&#x27;t seem to have had an effect: https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/44578/using-org-mode-for-writing-would-like-text-in-quotes-to-be-highlighted-and-also
 any assistance would be appreciated!

 I can&#x27;t find it here https://leanpub.com/markdown-mode/read#leanpub-auto-lists and here https://jblevins.org/projects/markdown-mode/
 Is this possible in https://jblevins.org/projects/markdown-mode/?

                              <span>Does anyone know how to set one-based column numbering in emacs 28? Documentation says that
 column-number-indicator-zero-based 
 This variable is obsolete since 28.1; use &#x27;mode-line-position-column-format&#x27; instead.
 I&#x27;ve tried
 (setq mode-line-position-column-format &quot; C%C&quot;) (setq mode-line-position-column-line-format &quot; (%l,%C)&quot;) (column-number-mode t) (line-number-mode t) 
 Thanks.

                              <span>Hello everyone, I write Haskell as a hobby. I am still learning and some concepts are still very hard to understand for me. Since I mostly write Javascript for my day job, I recently got into a very interesting problem. I had to write some logic in where as set of data has to be checked through multiple other datasets and return a value or null at the end.
 When I thought this through in imperative way, I found that I have to write a massive set of if-else logic which might end-up being an &quot;if-else hell&quot; and quite unmanageable to in future. Since I knew I can chain a Maybe monad through multiple function using bind operator in Haskell. I ended up implementing something like this in JS. Here is the Maybe monad implementation 
 class Maybe { __value; constructor(value) { this.__value &#x3D; value; } static from(value) { return new Maybe(value); } isNothing() { return ( this.__value &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; null || this.__value &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; undefined || this.__value &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; false ); } just() { return this.__value; } do(f) { if (this.isNothing()) { return Maybe.from(null); } return Maybe.from(f(this.__value)); } 
 }
 With the help of this I can do something like this --
 Maybe.from(1) .do(prevValue &#x3D;&gt; prevValue &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; 1 ? prevValue + 5 : null) //return Maybe 6 .do(prevValue &#x3D;&gt; prevValue &gt; 5 ? prevValue * 2 : null) //return Maybe 12 .do(prevValue &#x3D;&gt; prevValue &gt; 10 ? prevValue + 30 : null) // return Maybe 42 .do(prevValue &#x3D;&gt; prevValue &gt; 100 ? prevValue + 5 : null) // return Maybe null .do(prevValue &#x3D;&gt; prevValue &lt; 100 ? prevValue + 50 : prevValue * prevValue) // will do nothing here .just() // return null since failed on 4th step 
 Is my understanding of Maybe monad implementation correct? How similar it is considered to Haskell&#x27;s implementation of Maybe monad?

 Currently I&#x27;m trying to follow this guide, and I&#x27;m up to the &quot;I prefer stack for this goal.&quot; part, however trying to run the stack commands show it as unrecognized. I had said yes to installing it before, and I also used the windows installer here, but it&#x27;s still unrecognized. 
 Any help would be much appreciated.

                              <span>I wanted to benchmark some basic code in Haskell so I can get better feel of better coding practices and it was suggested to me to try Criterion. I tried tutorial at: tutorial it suggests installing via &#x60;cabal install criterion&#x60; - that worked fine but I could not run the Fibonacci example (saved as Fibber.hs) via &#x60;ghc -O --make Fibber&#x60;. The complaint was about non-existent module &#x60;Criterion.Main&#x60;. I ended up copying &#x60;.cabal&#x60; file from GitHub and running &#x60;cabal build fibber&#x60; (which basically build and installe &#x60;criterion&#x60; once again) and then &#x60;cabal run Fibber -- --output fibber.html&#x60;.
 So it worked with &#x60;cabal&#x60; but why did &#x60;ghc&#x60; fail. What am doing wrong?

                              <span>G&#x27;day guys,
 As per the title, whop would like me to start making a weekly group study session and post on here for the purpose of learning Haskell. I am studying this wonderful language at Uni (Australian National University) and am really enjoying the content so far.
 I think a resource like this will be really good for the Haskell community.
 The book is made up of 21 Chapters and has many exercises and practice problems for each of them. Each chapter will cover off on a Haskell concept and then build upon that knowledge.
 I have made a Discord for this and this invite link is: https://discord.gg/2u7GBeZe
 There is a poll for those of you who are interested in this.
 The group posts and &quot;classes will start next week&quot;. As I am also a &quot;beginner&quot; in the world of Haskell it will be a learning experience for all of us but I am sure that we will have fun. As the book is 21 chapters long, I suspect that this group learning activity will take 21 weeks!
 For those of you who cannot find a copy of this book, the third edition can be easily found on Libgen. Feel free to PM me for a download link to it :)
 ​
 The .hs files for each chapter can be found here: https://www.haskellcraft.com/craft3e/Home.html

                              <span>I am struggling to specify org-capture-template to insert a template at a current location in the current buffer. This template will be inserted in multiple files, so I cannot specify the file name explicitly.
 This is a plain text template, there is no substitution, or anything else. I just want to insert a heading with a checklist.
 My current definition is (after some Googling)
 (&quot;m&quot; &quot;Miller Heimann checklist&quot; entry (file+function buffer-name (lambda () (goto-char (point)))) (file &quot;~/org/miller-heimann-checklist-template.txt&quot;) :immediate-finish t :prepend t :empty-lines 1) 
 This works, sort-off:
  
If point is in the middle of a headline line, a new child node is inserted as expected.
 If the point is on a blank line or on a text line anywhere in the file, a child node is inserted as the first node in the file
  
Before I go off to single-step through the code, has anyone here faced a similar problem?
 I found one post with examples of org-capture tempaltes, but none of them matched what I am looking for. They all had specific file names as targets. 
 It makes me wonder whether I am misusing org-capture-templates. My other option is to create a plain elisp file that will insert text.
 Thanks,

                              <span>hi! I have downloaded Java Development Kit (OpenJDK) and curl -fL https://github.com/coursier/launchers/raw/master/cs-x86_64-apple-darwin.gz | gzip -d &gt; cs &amp;&amp; chmod +x cs &amp;&amp; (xattr -d com.apple.quarantine cs || true) &amp;&amp; ./cs setup on my mac, and I have also downloaded the Scala Metals extension on vs code. However, when I try to run code with correct syntax I get the following prompt: No build target could be found for the path: /Users/theomega/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Code/Scala/PGK/Eget/Hello world.scala
 ​
 Is this because my OpenJDK is installed in my library on mac and the file I am running, called Hello world.scala is located in my icloud drive folder (under user as root)?
 My patience is running low now haha.

                              <span>Yeah, didn&#x27;t expect it to be honest. 
 Did a tech assignment, which I think I did well, but had a tech interview and afterwards they decided they didn&#x27;t want to continue with me.
 It feels that they were looking for someone with a lot of FP knowledge (which I don&#x27;t have that much, I understand the concepts, but where I work in currently it&#x27;s not that much FP), even though that didn&#x27;t really reflect from the job posting.
 I feel sad, I thought it was a pretty good fit and I put quite some time in the assignment. I prefer to learn on the job as well, that works the best for me
 Do you get rejected too for scala jobs? Any tips on how to move on from this?

 Update: find-file-literally did the trick! Plus, Avy still works. Thank you all!

                              <span>I was trying to view images in emacs, and it works fine as expected. The problem came when I tried to view thumbnails with image-dired.
 Whenever I try to use M-x thumbs I get thumbs-call-convert: Searching for program: No such file or directory, /usr/X11R6/bin/convert, whenever I try to use image-dired from whitin dired I get image-diredx--invoke-process: Wrong type argument: processp, [nil 25355 43307 399593 nil image-dired-thumb-queue-run nil nil 110000] and when I call image-dired alone I get Error running timer ‘image-dired-thumb-queue-run’: (error &quot;Executable image-dired-cmd-create-thumbnail-program not found&quot;)
 I scrolled through documentation in the wiki and I thought that I had a problem with Image magick, so I installed, but as you have read, It tries to read to executable from a release of Xorg that is 26 years old.
 I&#x27;m a little lost here, I&#x27;ve scrolled through all the posts with &quot;thumb&quot; in various forums a good part of them mostly apply to compile time shenanigans (ruled out because I can see images with dired and pressing &#x27;v&#x27; or Windows with the image magick support (and I&#x27;m on Debian). Thanks.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve recently installed elfeed and it works wonderfully. However, I have a question to which I was not able to find answers (either on the package&#x27;s page or the internet) and I&#x27;m pretty sure you would be able to help me with. 
 So here it comes:
 Whenever I invoke elfeed (M-x elfeed) it opens both a search buffer (*elfeed-search*) and the elfeed.org file I&#x27;m using to list my feeds. This means that, once I&#x27;ve exited the elfeed-search buffer, I see the elfeed.org file there. Is there a way to prevent this file from opening in a buffer (preferably) or to close it automagically when the *elfeed-search* buffer is closed?
 Thanks in advance for all your help.

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently thinking about taking over my Zettelkasten Workflow with Emacs.
 I&#x27;ve used r/ObsidianMD for a long time now, but it seems like it would be a pain to replace the Handwriting capability that I have with Obisidian apps on my tablet etc.
 I didn&#x27;t do digital handwriting for a while, but I want to have it, just in case.
 So do you know of any .el or package to handwrite using Emacs?
 I really like the idea of one personally customized Program for everything, it sucks to have wasted knowledge about specific programs that I change so damn frequently.

                              <span>A struggle that I often have writing prose in Org-mode (or in any text editor with a markup language) is when I need to review things.
 I like to review from a printed copy, I&#x27;m better at catching errors that way. I also enjoy the ritual of getting off of my computer, sitting on a desk with printed pages, a red pen, and a cup of coffee.
 For that, I&#x27;ll export as latex-pdf or odt and print---no big deal. The problem is that when I go back to the computer to make the changes in the file, the positions of the words and sentences are naturally very different from the ones in the printed page. So I have to be constantly switching my view from two texts that are very differently formatted, and that is tiresome. So much so, that I will often make the changes in the odt file on Libreoffice Writer, losing my god-given editing shortcuts, and once they are all done, I&#x27;ll copy the text and paste it back on my org file. But then I have to be careful with italics and other stuff that will change once I copy the text in the odt and paste it on org. If all I&#x27;m doing is writing some informal text, no biggie. But when on an academic writing, messing with footnotes I&#x27;d be playing with fire to work in that way. So I end up writing a lot of my academic writer in Writer instead of Emacs.
 The obvious easy solution would be to get used to review from screen, directly in the org file. But that wouldn&#x27;t help whenever I have other people&#x27;s review of my text, like advisors and other professors (and a lot of them will require something compatible to MS-Word anyway, for them to use track changes).
 So... any technical solutions of different workflows that I haven&#x27;t considered? How do you deal with that?

                              <span>When I open a header or quickly scroll through a newly opened org-file, I can see how the buffer is drawn in a different font-size and color and with all the leading stars shown, and then it is quickly repaired. Why is that? Did I set some hook wrong?
 I managed to capture it in the moment being drawn (see picture). A fracture of a second later, all the headings will look like &quot;Szenen allgemein&quot;. But this is redundant, I would prefer Emacs not to have to draw everything twice.
 I have custom-set the faces of the headings a little bit bigger and set them to Source Sans Pro font. The colors come from the theme doom-solarized-light. I use org-superstars to change the looking of the stars, but even if I didn&#x27;t, why are there two stars drawn at first, with org-hide-leading-stars set to t?
 If I add +pretty to the doom module list, this behaviour is gone (although it should only load org-appear and org-fancy-priorities), but then there is some bug, everything gets extremely slow, taking five seconds to load a 1.3M-file and 1-2 seconds to open a header. I don&#x27;t need org-appear and org-fancy-priorities, so I prefer the setting without the +pretty module.
 Any ideas why the buffer is drawn twice and how I can omit that?

 I can open each file manually and run my macro which is fine. The problem is that I have thousands of them. Here is where I am lost.
 How do I run my macro on every file with a specific extension and then save the result with the same filename but as a .txt?

 I have a file with a scala 3 macro that runs through a package object somewhere and outputs a list of all the objects of a certain type. If this file isn&#x27;t recompiled any time the program changes, this list becomes stale, and that causes problems. I can&#x27;t figure out how to do this besides literally writing a timestamp to the file in a pre-build task every time so that the file has a modification to it, but there has to be a better way than this, right?
 ​
 Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!

                              <span>I am learning Scala after C++ and Rust.
 I was writing a module to parse some made-up binary opcodes into appropriate case classes implementing some common ancestor class: 
 sealed abstract class Instruction object Instruction { case class Add(t: Type, source: Register, destination: Register) extends Instruction ... } 
 I came up with a solution including a list of Int &#x3D;&gt; Function tuples: (2)
 val handlers &#x3D; List( (OPCODE_NOP, (_,_,_) &#x3D;&gt; Instruction &#x3D; Instruction.Nop(_, _, _), .. ) 
 The above code is approximate. The original solution was: (3)
  (OPCODE_NOP, Instruction.Nop) 
 But it turns out the second element of the tuple becomes Instruction.Nop.type, instead of a function as I would expect. My question is why is it so and is there a way to shorten the function (2) with placeholders to something similar to the last code block (3) ?
 -----
 Side note: implementors of Instruction have different argument sets, so currently I split them into multiple groups based on argument sets and handle them using LUTs:
 val handlers_type_reg_reg &#x3D; List( (OP1, OP1_constructor), .. ) val handlers_type_reg &#x3D; List( (OP2, OP2_constructor), .. ) val handler_types &#x3D; List( (OP1, handler_type_reg_reg), (OP2, handler_type_reg), ..) 
 So the top-level function would choose a specific function for a group of instructions based on an argument set and call it, the specific function would look up the constructor for the specific instruction and call it.
 Does it look sane or am I missing some beautiful FP / Scala expressiveness?:)

                              <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;m wondering whether there is an upcoming way to sync org with with gcal (I need it, my family uses it). I ask because:
  
I see the last activity on org-gcal&#x27;s github was 2017, not a bad thing if it works; but
 I also saw a post on r/emacs discussing the end of OAuth support, on which org-gcal relies
  
Am I missing an alternative?

 Is there some chrome extension with this functionality?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been happily using org-journal, using weekly file option. Each entry for a day has a timestamp. It is very cumbersome to browse headlines because I have to keep opening file after file for each week of journal entries.
 I had the idea that yearly would be a better option, letting me see all of the headlines for a given year. But there isn&#x27;t a timestamp for the entries. Each new date gets an entry but no timestamp within the day. Is this by design?
 Okay, so I can just hit a key combo and let emacs put in a timestamp for me. It doesn&#x27;t work. C-c . just inserts the date, no time. C-u C-c . also just inserts the date, no time.
 Anyone with ideas on how I can have my journal entries timestamped, short of me looking at a clock and entering it by hand?

                              <span>Core Strats at Standard Chartered Bank are hiring Haskell developers again. We&#x27;re currently looking for three developers, and we&#x27;re flexible with regards to seniority / experience.
 The head of our group has given a talk at the Haskell Implementer’s Workshop last year where he described the team and what we do: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;A70SN7vFsKU
 These roles are specifically for Applications &amp; Services development, so expect some GUI work and plenty of stakeholder interaction.
 Applications should go via these links:
 Warsaw: https://scb.taleo.net/careersection/ex/jobdetail.ftl?job&#x3D;2200023433 for direct employment, or [CoreStratsRoles@sc.com](mailto:CoreStratsRoles@sc.com) for contracting
 London: https://scb.taleo.net/careersection/ex/jobdetail.ftl?job&#x3D;2200023448
 Singapore: https://scb.taleo.net/careersection/ex/jobdetail.ftl?job&#x3D;2200017272
 Shanghai: reach out to [CoreStratsRoles@sc.com](mailto:CoreStratsRoles@sc.com)
 The Warsaw position is open to both contractors and direct employment, whereas the others are only open for direct employment. Standard Chartered supports (practically fully) remote working, but only from the country of payroll, and after an initial 3-month in-office period. We cover visa and relocation costs for successful employment applicants.
 Note that the first step of the application is a Valued Behaviours Assessment and it is quite important: our team won’t be able to see your application until you pass this assessment. Feel free to contact us at [CoreStratsRoles@sc.com](mailto:CoreStratsRoles@sc.com) if you have any questions about these positions.

                              <span>Dapr - Distributed Application Runtime simplifies the way to talk to various of distributed services today, including state storage, message queue, services finding and invocation, and etc.
 I initialized a project nodew/haskell-dapr (github.com) to bring dapr to Haskell world. And I believe it will make Haskell more productive on web development.
 Since Haskell doesn&#x27;t have good GRPC support today, so currently, I just implemented the HTTP client APIs. 
 You can contribute the project by:
  
Add more tests
 Add Server module
 Create a sample app
 GRPC integration
 Simplify the APIs
  
I&#x27;m not good at writing tests in Haskell, especially testing against such a complex system. Your suggestion will be a great help to me and this project, of course, PRs would be much better!
 Thanks again!

 However, using some tools, I found evidence that stack IS working. (See details below.) It is just being...silent.
 TL;DR:
 So, maybe stack is communicating with some servers, downloading package metadata. (Like Apache Maven downloading .pom files.) It&#x27;s being silent that makes me worry.
 Are there some CLI options to let stack elaborate on what it i…</span>

                              <span>A recent rant got me thinking. The powerful type system and other facilities provided by Haskell are believed to provide significant advantages in reducing defects and minimizing debugging. But there&#x27;s a steep learning curve to get to the point you can take advantage of all of that. Are there any studies or data supporting the notion that benefits are worth the costs? Do we see fewer defects, less time debugging, etc? Just curious.

                              <span>Day 3 of trying to do something with Haskell and I just spent 45 minutes arguing with the compiler for refusing to take String over Text as the argument for a Bloodhound function. Now debugging arcane Polysemy messages for hours while getting very little actual work done. I don&#x27;t know if the proposed benefits will ever actually come (or whether I can get most or all with an easier language) but so far it&#x27;s really fucking hard. I don&#x27;t see much in terms of &quot;beginner friendly&quot; documentation, either - almost all the docs is in the form of &quot;example code&quot; (is that the cultural norm in Haskell?), which presumes a fair amount of preexisting Haskell knowledge, depending on what the example actually looks like.
 Rant over.

                              <span>Hi there everyone,
I am Carlos and I live in Spain. I discovered this website recently and it immediately caught my attention, so I decided to join, because I&#x27;ve been thinking about creating a Zettelkasten system for some time and I found it one of the best sites I&#x27;ve seen to learn, with quite deep knowledge about the system from both Luhmann&#x27;s and Ahrens&#x27; interpretations.
So that&#x27;s it. I hope to learn a lot and actually starting to build my Zettelkasten.
Regards.</span>

                              <span>I am currently working on a package which allows writing natural deduction proofs (Quine Style) in an org-mode table and then exports them to LaTeX. I intend to add quite some features to it, for example 
 - editing the proof in a separate window similar to how org-src--edit-element does it
 - changing how the table is exported
 - displaying special overlays within that table 
 - allowing LaTeX-previews of the proof.
 I know this is a bunch of different features, so I need to start adjusting at a very basic level. What seems to be a good idea is to define a new org-element ndproof which allows for just that. Does anyone of you have any experience in how to approach this, or whether this even makes any sense?

I also don&#x27;t read much about people using macros, so that got me wondering. How and when do you use macros? Moreover, why do you use macros over regular lisp / shell-command-on-region / ... ?

 I would like to remove the preamble text: &quot;Python 3.10.6 (main, Aug 2 2022, 00:00:00) [GCC 12.1.1 20220507 (Red Hat 12.1.1-1)] on linux. Type &quot;help&quot;, &quot;copyright&quot;, &quot;credits&quot; or &quot;license&quot; for more information.&quot;
 I would like to have the interpreter start at the bottom with the file on top.

                              <span>Hey, I&#x27;m learning emacs and currently using it to write LaTeX, especially beamer.
 So I tried C-c C-c with various commands, but I can&#x27;t get the pdf.
 I either get Quit (core dumped), no TeX output buffer or all the auxillary files but not the pdf.
 Tried latex, pdflatex and latexmk but neither of them work.
 I&#x27;m using Tex Live 2022/Arch Linux
 Any idea? Thanks.

                              <span>I always get &quot;file not found&quot; error when including files even though my project compiles fine. This is because my include files are seperated from the source files. Is there any package that allows emacs to work properly in a cmake project automatically?

 I write my blog in org-mode and export to a single-page html file. In my setup file, I have 
 #+OPTIONS: toc: nil
 And in the main file, where I want the table of contents, I put:
 #+TOC: headlines 1
 In the exported file, the header above the TOC is &quot;Table of Contents&quot;, but I&#x27;d like to set it to something like &quot;Posts&quot;. Is there an easy option or a variable to set this, or am I going to have to write a custom function?
 Any help is much appreciated!

                              <span>Hello, I enabled the variable pitch mode in Org but it doesn&#x27;t work well for some blocks such as the front matter. I added these rules to assure the front matter displays with a fixed pitch font:
 (set-face-attribute &#x27;org-indent nil :inherit &#x27;(org-hide fixed-pitch)) (set-face-attribute &#x27;org-document-title nil :inherit &#x27;fixed-pitch) (set-face-attribute &#x27;org-document-info nil :inherit &#x27;fixed-pitch) (set-face-attribute &#x27;org-document-info-keyword nil :inherit &#x27;(shadow fixed-pitch) 
 The front matter now displays using a fixed pitch font which is what I want but the indentation is still messed up. It looks like so:
 #+title: Document #+author: Author name #+date: [2022-08-27 Sat 12:50] 
 I would like the indentation in the front matter to be fixed as well. The document, author name, and date don&#x27;t line up.

                              <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;m looking for a way to remove tags from all but one org heading (and its subs) without affecting things like DEADLINE: 
 I use org in a GTD-like manner and have just simplified my projects list to be:
  
Priority_Projects (org heading); and
 Everything else (awaiting, someday, maybe, incubate, reference). 
  
I&#x27;d like to loose all the context tags &#x60;:home:garage:phone:&#x60; etc from everywhere except my priority heading. I can&#x27;t see a built-in way to do that. Any ideas?

                              <span>Hello all, 
 I have a space leak in a quite simple conduit, where I don&#x27;t understand why this leaks. See the link for a more detailed wiki page about it with pictures of the heap profiles and the output of eventlog2html.
 Basically, this is the end of a conduit pipeline, which reads from a network socket, parses packets with attoparsec and passes it to this conduit, which assigns a number to the packet, gets some fields (integral values) out of the header of the packet, formats this into a Text value as CSV and writes it to a file handle. 
 See here: https://github.com/oswald2/AURIS/wiki/space_leak
 Can somebody explain to me, why that leaks and how to fix it? I am staring at this now for some hours and feel really stupid...

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently looking for a senior developer, architect or team lead position (full-time). As I don&#x27;t want to relocate the position should be in Germany, preferably in the Ruhrgebiet area or remote. And obviously it should involve working with Haskell.
 My background: - more than 20 years experience in functional and object-oriented software development in inhouse and consultancy jobs. - experienced in different roles: developer, software architect, team-lead, technical product owner, solution- and enterprise architect. - experience with AWS, GCP and Azure - I love to improve coding quality by promoting methods such as DDD, TDD, clean code, clean architecture, property based testing, static code analysis, code metrics, CI/CD, etc. - I&#x27;m actively contributing to the opensource community (https://github.com/thma) - I&#x27;m maintaining a Blog on Haskell and FP related topics (https://thma.github.io/)
 I&#x27;m happy about every hint!

                              <span>I recently discovered Haskell and watched a YouTube Video on the Basics, but i feel kike, that this was not enough. I also discovered the book &quot;learnyouahaskell&quot;, which i am planning to read this weekend. 
 Are there anymore ressources to learn from? 
 I developed in languages such as C and have a bit of an issuse understanding functional programming concepts. 
 I really want to learn Haskell, because i find it very powerful.

                              <span>I&#x27;m having trouble getting this function to work right (or properly set the alist). I have Onedrive who&#x27;s main directory is a symlink and I&#x27;d like to keep /Library/CloudStorage urls from being shown throughout Emacs.(macos) The default-dirctory is showing how I want it to.
 ​
 As I understand buffer-file-truename should be using abbrev-file-alist via abbreviate-file-name function to do this.
 I&#x27;ve narrowed my issue down to this function not abbreviating urls.
 ​
 abbrev-file-alist value:
 ((&quot;\\&#x60;&#x27;/Users/username/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive&quot; . &quot;/Users/username/OneDrive&quot;))
 Function:
 (abbreviate-file-name &quot;/Users/username/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive&quot;)
 Returns:
 &quot;~/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive&quot;
 Function:
 (abbreviate-file-name &quot;~/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive&quot;)
 Returns:
 &quot;~/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive&quot;
 ​
 Does anyone know what may be wrong with my list?

But after that, the org document recognizes the paragraphs as sentences, that is - if I press M-a, the cursor moves to the beginning of the paragraph, &amp; M-e takes me to the end of the paragraph, instead of moving by sentences.
 Is there any way to configure it?

 I just updated my system to ubuntu 22 LTS and emacs 28, and my &#x60;C-;&#x60; key binding for line commenting is being short-circuited by a system-wide shortcut making a popup window containing the letter &#x27;e&#x27; appearing. This shortcut is not listed in the gnome shortcuts, so I really don&#x27;t know how what it&#x27;s pointing to and how to disable it... Any ideas?
 ​
 Thank you a lot in advance for your help!

 I am trying literate programming and in my attempts to reference a source code block A from source code block B I get the following behavior which is not what i need.
 Is my approach wrong or am I missing something?
 org-version: 9.5.2; emacs-version: 28.1; distribution: spacemacs
 #+name: A #+begin_src js () &#x3D;&gt; { console.log(&#x27;hello world&#x27;) } #+end_src #+name: B #+begin_src js :noweb yes let fn &#x3D; &gt; #+end_src should the outcome of the expansion be? let fn &#x3D; () &#x3D;&gt; { console.log(&#x27;hello world&#x27;) } Instead I get: let fn &#x3D; () &#x3D;&gt; { let fn &#x3D; console.log(&#x27;hello world&#x27;) let fn &#x3D; } 
 I found this article in stack overflow which is very similar if not the same problem I am having; but does not help since it attributes the problem to an old org-mode version.
 Cheers,
 pnoul

So far everything is going great, except that whenever I insert a colon character &quot;:&quot;, the popup suggesting snippets shows up. This is rather frustrating, since if I type something like case foo: I accidentally insert a snippet. Is there a way to configure company-mode so that company-yasnippet does not activate when I type specific characters?

 Looks like eshell tends to echo whatever values are there into the shell when starting up. Does anyone know how to turn this off?
 Example, I have this in login file:  (setenv &quot;REDDIT&quot; &quot;EMACS&quot;)  and this in profile:  (setenv &quot;REDDIT&quot; &quot;GOPAR&quot;) 
 Both values are being echo&#x27;d to shell. Initially I thought it was something in my config but it even happens on an empty config emacs.

 C-h v doesn&#x27;t give any leads. Any info appreciated. Thanks!

 I’m happy to announce the first release of the library hegg-0.1 on hackage: hegg: Fast equality saturation in Haskell 12 !
 hegg
 stands for haskell e-graphs good, and it’s a library featuring e-graphs (a data structure that efficiently represents a congruence relation over many expressions) and a high level API for equality saturation (an optimization/term-rewriting technique)
 It is a pure haskell implementation found on two recent awesome papers: egg: Fast and Extensible Equality Saturation 3 (2020) and Relational E-matching 2 (2021).
 I’d love to see what you might come up with leveraging e-graphs and equality saturation (there’s a world of applications – check out the papers and other resources), so do let me know about your efforts and how the library could be improved.
 I’ve spent a long while optimizing and making the e-graphs and equality saturation considerably performant. So we are already pretty fast! (according to my symbolic rewriting tests). I’d love to see more involved use cases, because I still see many opportunities for improving performance, and would love to take them when justified by bigger numbers and applications!
 I’ll be happy to clarify anything,
 Thank you,
 Rodrigo

                              <span>I&#x27;ve read a lot of tutorials for monads and applicative functors but for some reason it&#x27;s just not clicking. I understand specific use cases, but I&#x27;m having trouble gaining a general intuition of what monads and applicative functors do. For example Typeclassopedia says &quot;the structure of a Applicative computation is fixed, whereas the structure of a Monad computation can change based on intermediate results&quot;. By &quot;structure of computation&quot;, do they mean that it behaves similar to an if-else statement? Like if b from (a -&gt; m b) is 5, then do x, otherwise do y.
 What I took away from Graham Hutton&#x27;s video on applicative functors was that they basically are an extension of fmap but for multiple arguments. This made sense, until I thought about the List applicative. pure (+)  [1, 2, 3]  [1, 2, 3] equals [2, 3, 4, 3, 4, 5, 4, 5, 6], which makes the &quot;multiple arguments&quot; angle confusing. I know that applicative functors can &quot;embedded&quot; functions into context, and that&#x27;s why the result of the List applicative was so, because of how it models nondeterminism. But idk it just hasn&#x27;t &quot;clicked&quot; for me yet.
 I was wondering someone could explain the intuition behind monads and applicative functors. Thank you in advanced!

                              <span>There is an Applicative instance for all the polynomial functors except Sum. Not because no instance is possible but because too many instances are possible. When lifting over different constructors we need to choose how to map one to the other, and which to map.
 Abstracting with Applicatives gives the approach of using an applicative morphism, something that preserves the applicative operations (here idiom) to mediate between between InL and InR. This is the approach used by my idiomatic package.
 instance Natural f g &#x3D;&gt; Applicative (Sum f g) where pure :: a -&gt; Sum f g a pure x &#x3D; InL (pure x) liftA2 :: (a -&gt; b -&gt; c) -&gt; (Sum f g a -&gt; Sum f g b -&gt; Sum f g c) liftA2 (·) (InL as) (InL bs) &#x3D; InL do liftA2 (·) as bs liftA2 (·) (InR as) (InR bs) &#x3D; InR do liftA2 (·) as bs -- these are interesting liftA2 (·) (InL as) (InR bs) &#x3D; InR do liftA2 (·) (idiom as) bs liftA2 (·) (InR as) (InL bs) &#x3D; InR do liftA2 (·) as (idiom bs) -- Applicative morphism type Idiom :: (Type -&gt; Type) -&gt; (Type -&gt; Type) -&gt; Constraint class (Applicative f, Applicative g) &#x3D;&gt; Idiom f g where idiom :: f ~&gt; g 
  
Can all Applicative sum types be deconstructed in this way
 Specifically can the Free f Monad
 What would you call this approach and does it appear in the literature

 Edit: Taking the suggestion from u/sjrd, I can remove the cast and it compiles but I am still seeing compile errors highlighted in my IDE. They don&#x27;t arise when actually compiling though. This makes me feel like there has to be a more idiomatic approach.

                              <span>I have been using The Archive for almost half a year and it&#x27;s great, in general. But there is one issue that worries me: I noticed – more than once – that some files lose their content and do have the content of other files. It happens on saving, I surmise, but I cannot confirm that yet, because so far I have always recognized it later only. Then I wonder why the filename and the title do not match anymore. Luckily, I use git and commit my whole zettelkasten daily, so it&#x27;s easy to revert. Still, it&#x27;s disquieting somehow and should be fixed, I guess.
Has anyone here already noticed the same problem?</span>

                              <span>Hi all,
New here! Been lurking for a bit, been making notes a lot longer. Super quick rundown, as it might be relevant to my question (feel free to skip and jump to the bold sections to tl;dr it):
I&#x27;ve carried a small pocket notebook on me for as long as I can remember, using a numbering convention of XXX.YY.ZZ where X is the &quot;volume&quot; number, Y is the page, and Z is the entry on the page, e.g., 092.04.01
I previously used Standard Notes, creating &quot;discrete&quot; markdown notes that basically just lived on their own (SN can&#x27;t link); had probably 2 or 3k notes at this point just using that analog numbering system in digital form. My biggest issue, which is now obvious, was the &quot;set it and forget&quot; it nature of unlinked notes, making it a &quot;stale&quot; system.

                              <span>I am learning Haskell as a Scala/ZIO developer. I just read https://www.fpcomplete.com/haskell/tutorial/exceptions/ while trying to understand why Haskell effects such as Polysemy and RIO don&#x27;t have a typed error channel (as in ZIO). In particular, this quote:
  
There is no indication at the type level if something throws an exception. You should assume that, unless explicitly documented otherwise, all actions may throw an exception.
  
Meaning, every time I call any &#x60;IO&#x60;, I can expect an exception, meaning every time I need to use something like &#x60;tryIO&#x60; and handle the exception. Doesn&#x27;t that cause a lot of boilerplate? If you have to try every piece of code doesn&#x27;t it look really defensive? In ZIO you just have to make sure the error channel has the correct type when composing effects, but it will handle short-circuiting for you.

                              <span>I&#x27;m writing a generic library for wrapping some FFI-code neatly.
 The FFI-functions rely on an external context type that can be generated from a configuration type. Essentially, all but initial configuration functions take a pointer to the context as one of their arguments. As part of memory management, I wrap this pointer with finalizers and a reference counter in a newtype that is intended to be pretty opaque to the user. 
 Since I want this library to be polymorphic for different codes wrapped in the same manner, I want to create a typeclass
  class Context c where type RawContext c --type of unwrapped context type RawConfig c --type of unwrapped config 
 With methods that map directly to the utility functions in the FFI-code, and some other instance specific functions. The problem is that most of these methods make no direct reference to c, but rather RawContext c and/or RawConfig c, which makes them ambiguous.
 One solution to this would be to instead use functional dependencies &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; class Context context rawContext rawConfig | context -&gt; rawContext, context -&gt; rawConfig, rawContext -&gt; context, rawConfig -&gt; context, rawContext -&gt; rawConfig, rawConfig -&gt; rawContext where
 ... &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 but this would result in pretty cumbersome type signatures, which I want to avoid.
 Is it possible to get clean type signatures, as in a class with only one type variable (the wrapped context type) without resorting to AmbiguousTypes? I have not worked with type families much before, but they seem like a cleaner solution for something like this if they are applicable.

                              <span>I read through the Real World Haskell book and I am looking through projects and examples to get an idea for what it&#x27;s like. I see a lot of language extension declarations, and they look a bit like magic to me. I have no idea what they do, and while the book doesn&#x27;t cover them, they appear in just about every bit of code that I see. It&#x27;s almost like you need to know the language but then also understand what the extension is trying to say. How should I reason about language extensions and what they do?

I know they have their own IO monad but I&#x27;d still like to use an effects library. I think Polysemy is the closest one. Has anyone used both ZIO and Polysemy/another Haskell libraries? Are they comparable?

                              <span>In the past year, I&#x27;ve been working with Scala on different projects. It&#x27;s a core tool at my job(for doing Kafka especially), but it was never my favorite; with my background in Python and Go mostly, I did not have a hard time learning enough Scala to write code for Spark and Kafka projects. Specifically, with a lot of example code around the web, it&#x27;s really easy to find what you are looking for.
 Now I feel like I&#x27;m not writing actual good Scala code but a code that only compiles; I only borrow patterns and things I know from other languages, and I think my code is not good quality code, so I&#x27;m putting time into learning it seriously, so next time we are writing an application I can make good suggestions about the architecture.
 I&#x27;m going to start with the book.&quot;Hands-on Scala Programming&quot; I like that it&#x27;s project-based, so I&#x27;ll see some enough other than the syntax itself.

                              <span>This is a pretty basic issue but I couldn&#x27;t find a solution after spending an hour on it. I&#x27;m trying to query database to get a list of values through Scala Anorm ORM. I want to convert the result to a List[String] in order to pass to a Scala view. 
 But It shows a compile time error
  type mismatch; found : List[Unit] required: List[String] 
 This is the helper function that interacts with the Db
  def getActiveConceptNames(organizationId : Long) : List[String] &#x3D; { DB.withConnection { implicit c &#x3D;&gt; val conceptCountQuery &#x3D; SQL(&quot;select * from tbl_concepts where org_id &#x3D; {org_id} and is_deleted &#x3D; 0;&quot;) .on(&quot;org_id&quot; -&gt; organizationId) conceptCountQuery().map { conceptRecord &#x3D;&gt; val conceptName &#x3D; conceptRecord[String](&quot;concept_name&quot;).toString }.toList } 
 }
 And I call the helper function in the controller like this
 val conceptNamesList &#x3D; ConceptHelper.getActiveConceptNames(organizationId)

 Can anyone please suggest some good libraries to use DynamoDB with scala?
 I have checked scanamo which I find good one to start. Please suggest some more to explore?
 TIA.

                              <span>EDIT Trying posting this again since apparently the reddit bots took it down as spam last time, with no explanation of why.
 Using Gnus to handle my emails I use nnmail-split-methods to sort my mail into groups, and I also have nnmail-crosspost t so that I get threads that include my sent messages (at least on Google servers). The trouble I have is that there are some auto-emails generated by an external watcher system that writes to an address that I already hav ematching another group. Because cross-posting is enabled, it gets filed in BOTH the group I have just for those emails, and also in my other primary group for that address.
 What I want is a rule that says: &quot;Split to my TO: GROUP UNLESS from the certain address&quot; (ie don&#x27;t duplicate those particular ones). Does anyone know how to do this?

 Also, because Latex assumes periods after Upper case letters *not* to be sentence-ending, you have to use &#x27;\@&#x27; when it actually is. (&quot;I like words that start with the letter Z.&quot; would become &quot;I like words that start with the letter Z\@.&quot;
 Are there equivalents for those in Org mode for when exporting to pdf? 
 Also, I like to set sentence-end-double-space to nil. Is there a way to add the things above to the rules that define sentences in emacs?

                              <span>Hello,
 When selecting a file in a browser (e.g., an email attachment), an app is opened to help you select the file. Is it possible to use emacs dired mode to do that? 
 I am using linux and chrome but if you know how to do it with another browser it would help also.

                              <span>I am aware you can jump to a process buffer attached to the current buffer, I was wondering if there is functionality to connect the process to a project and jump to it while when in any buffer ?
 I use the send to buffer quite a lot, so would ideally like a flow of send to python if the python buffer is not visible then open a window, hopefully which works regardless of which python file I am editing in the project.
 I know clojure has a better story for this but would also like the pop up the buffer if its not open for clojure code in case it can be done for one of the languages.

 Now I have many more lines that are like this that I want to type. Currently I just paste the previous line and do a Query Replace. But this is inefficient because the pattern is that only the part after the net_ changes and it is common on both sides (except for capitalization).
 Is there some workflow where I can define some temporary elisp code, then call it with just the suffix, and it automatically generates the next line (with the proper indent and everything).
 For example:
 Some Keybind + workarea
 Should generate
  pub net_workarea &#x3D;&gt; b&quot;_NET_WORKAREA&quot;, 
 I know that by the time somone points me in the right direction and I figure it out I could just manually write it :)
 But I would like to take this opportunity to learn if there is an efficient way of doing this.

Nice to hear from you. Doom emacs looks great! (Although I&#x27;m too much of a dinosaur to have tried it.) 
 The customization you can do in VSCode, or any other environment, stands in relation to that which can do in emacs as the sounds you can coax from a referee&#x27;s whistle stand in relation to the music you can play on a piano. 
 But that&#x27;s not the point. The point is that everything is a buffer -- EIAB. Until one has used emacs enough for that to sink in, one has not really used it, and one might as well stick with VSCode. Pick your favorite shell (bash, zsh, etc.) and make it your default shell in emacs. Then do M-x shell. Start using your new shell. Observe that it is just another buffer. Live with that for a while, until the profundity of it sinks in. Then accept your fate, which is to watch in pity, for the rest of your life, as your non-emacs colleagues struggle to interact with their computers. You&#x27;re now a deer bounding through the woods, past coyotes chewing their own legs off from the traps they&#x27;re stuck in. Unfortunately, you can never unsee that vision. Sorry!
  
​
 I&#x27;m still using Doom because I like the evil keybindings, but maybe one of you can convince me to fully commit!

                              <span>In this post I will introduce the Scalable Build Systems team at Tweag and
describe our goals and our work.
We believe that correct, efficient, and reliable builds are critical for
developers to work and collaborate effectively. And that the size and
complexity of a project should not be bounded by its build
system, but by what is best to achieve the goal of the project.
Whether you have a large codebase or a small one, whether your project is
polyglot or monolingual, and whether you work in an enterprise organization or
on an open source project - the build system you have available should provide
correct, efficient, reliable builds.

Open Source
We believe that the open source build system Bazel takes a leap in the
right direction and establishes important values like correctness,

 If I hit my compose key I have a normal behaviour wherever I am. If I hit &#x60;C-;&#x60; anywhere, nothing happens, but in emacs:

 I&#x27;ve never had this behaviour before. I&#x27;m on emacs 29.0.50.

 Whenever I select a region and execute test-overlay, if my cursor is in the region and I hit TAB the overlay disappears, if I&#x27;m outside, the normal TAB happens.
 However, if I put these functions in a mode:
 (defun my/remove () &quot;NTS.&quot; (interactive) (remove-overlays)) (defvar test-map (let ((map (make-sparse-keymap))) (keymap-set map &quot;TAB&quot; &#x27;my/remove) map)) ;;;###autoload (defun test-overlay () &quot;NTS.&quot; (interactive) (let ((new-overlay (make-overlay (mark) (point)))) (overlay-put new-overlay &#x27;keymap test-map) (overlay-put new-overlay &#x27;display &#x27;(&quot;...&quot;)) )) ;;;###autoload (define-minor-mode test-minor-mode &quot;Test mode.&quot; :init-value nil :lighter &quot;Test&quot; ) 
 The keymap is never loaded. And if I put :keymap test-map in define-minor-mode, TAB will execute my/remove even thought it&#x27;s not on my overlay (which looks normal).
 What am I missing that would make it work?
 Thanks :-)

                        <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wwsbxv/orgroamcapture_function_behaves_differently_when/">
                          <div class="article-summary-box-inner media-object">
                            <span class="media-object__text">
                              <span>I&#x27;ve got the following function:
 (defun my/org-roam-capture-to-link () &quot;In org-roam files, capture to node linked at point.&quot; (interactive) (when-let ((_ (org-roam-file-p)) ;; Only act in org-roam files (link-start (car (org-in-regexp org-link-bracket-re 1))) (link (save-excursion (goto-char link-start) (org-element-link-parser))) (id (plist-get (cadr link) :path)) ;; This will fail if there is no node (node (org-roam-node-from-id id))) ;; If there /is/ a node, capture to it. (org-roam-capture- :node node))) 
 This should capture to the org-roam node at the id linked at point, but only if point is at a link to such a node, and I&#x27;m in an org-roam file&#x27;s buffer.
 Normally when I just run org-roam-capture and select an already existing node, no new text is added, and I just add whatever I need to and press C-c C-c.
 Now, If I&#x27;m on a link to an org-roam node, and run my/org-roam-capture-to-link interactively with M-x, it does exactly that: nothing new is added, exactly what I want.
 But I wanted to run it from org-metareturn. I added the symbol for the function to org-metareturn-hook. Now if I press M-RET on an appropriate link, I do get an org-roam capture, but it adds an empty heading on a newline (that is, it adds &quot;\n* |&quot;, with the cursor at |).
 What&#x27;s going on? How can I make the meta-return version work like the M-x version?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hi,
 I am trying to get a simple Python setup working in Emacs. I have gotten auto completion to work but not to the extent where it will add parenthesis, insert the arguments, and allow me to select between them. I believe this should work (requires integration with yasnippet?) since I can see on the bottom of Emacs that on completion Pyright provides the function information e.g. import gc gc.collect shows (function) collect: (generation: int &#x3D; ...) -&gt; int
 init.el
 (setq custom-file (concat user-emacs-directory &quot;custom.el&quot;)) (when (file-exists-p custom-file) (load custom-file)) (require &#x27;package) (add-to-list &#x27;package-archives &#x27;(&quot;melpa&quot; . &quot;https://melpa.org/packages/&quot;)) (package-initialize) (unless (package-installed-p &#x27;use-package) (package-refresh-contents) (package-install &#x27;use-package)) (require &#x27;use-package) (setq use-package-always-defer t use-package-always-ensure t) (use-package company :hook (lsp-mode . company-mode) :config (global-company-mode)) (use-package flycheck :init (global-flycheck-mode)) (use-package lsp-mode :commands (lsp lsp-deferred) :init (setq lsp-keymap-prefix &quot;C-c l&quot;) :config (lsp-enable-which-key-integration t) :hook (python-mode . lsp-deferred)) (use-package lsp-pyright :hook (python-mode .

                              <span>I&#x27;m making a switch from VSCode to Emacs. I started with Doom Emacs and things are going well. I&#x27;m really falling in love with the use of keybindings and even when they are not yet second nature to me I feel like I&#x27;m more efficient with them. 
 With LSP I&#x27;m able to get the behavior of Emacs nearly identical to VSCode. There are some small, nearly ignorable, areas where I do feel like code completion works better in VSC. Where can I get details about what LSP VSC uses for which language? How does it integrate so well with different languages like RJSX and CSS in my Next projects? I&#x27;m sure it only has to do with some LSP configs. 
 In Emacs I have to explicitly give the lsp configs whereas VSCode used to do it implicitly, I want to somehow locate what those configs were and then copy them over to Emacs.

                              <span>Hello,
 I found a snippet of code that displays each tab with a | character on the internet, that is very useful however the background color it uses doesn&#x27;t play well with my theme, I don&#x27;t understand a lot of elisp so could you tell me which line to modify to make it fit my theme? 
  ;; (OPTIONAL) Visualize tabs as a pipe character - &quot;|&quot; ;; This will also show trailing characters as they are useful to spot. (setq whitespace-style &#x27;(face tabs tab-mark trailing)) (custom-set-faces ;; custom-set-faces was added by Custom. ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful. ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance. ;; If there is more than one, they won&#x27;t work right. &#x27;(whitespace-tab ((t (:foreground &quot;#555&quot;))))) (setq whitespace-display-mappings &#x27;((tab-mark 9 [124 9] [92 9]))) ; 124 is the ascii ID for &#x27;\|&#x27; (global-whitespace-mode) ; Enable whitespace mode everywhere 
 Any help would be appreciated, thanks in advance c:

                              <span>It&#x27;s not surprising most of us find ourselves doing more and more in Emacs as time goes on. Here&#x27;s an environment that&#x27;s completely malleable and transparent - a productive playground where workflow and tooling grow organically together, intertwined. 
 I sometimes feel like a blacksmith or the &#x27;primitive technology&#x27; youtuber: building tools that make new tools possible, each more powerful and precise than the last, working in concert to open new possibilities. 
 As I think about that comparison, it strikes me that this must be the key to Emacs&#x27; allure. Most of our computing tools are delivered to us on a plate, like a modern mass-manufactured product. Impressively engineered and convenient to be sure, but closed and impersonal. In a funny way, I feel Emacs puts us in touch with a much deeper human tradition: moulding and shaping our environment to suit our own needs, instead of being moulded and shaped ourselves.

                              <span>So... I wanted to start coding on emacs but my workflow doesn&#x27;t seem to be suitable for it. I code in Laravel and Vue.js on daily basis. What do you guys recommend for setting up Emacs for PHP / Laravel? There is web-mode or php-mode and serenata and intelephense for LSP mode but I still don&#x27;t know which would be the suitable combination for this setup... And Vue.js seems unusable on emacs since vue-mode is pretty outdated. Maybe I should give up? :(

                              <span>I am facing this problem which on the face of it should be easy to solve but isn&#x27;t.
 this is my .editorconf:
 root &#x3D; true [*] indent_style &#x3D; tab tab_width &#x3D; 4 end_of_line &#x3D; lf charset &#x3D; utf-8 trim_trailing_whitespace &#x3D; true insert_final_newline &#x3D; true 
 I am running doom emacs with ts-ls with LSP for javascript.
 I have some files in my project that are indented with 4-width Tabs and that&#x27;s how I like it. If I change something in them and save they stay properly indented with 4-width Tabs.
 I have other files in the same project that are indented with 2 spaces. I don&#x27;t want that. I want to be able to convert that to 4-width tab but that does not happen automatically on save, they stay in 2 space formatting.
 Any new file I create in Emacs is also indented with 2 spaces, but if I create the file in VSCode and write some Tab spaced text and open it back in Emacs it stays Tab indented.
 How can I fix this?

                              <span>I find it pretty unintuitive how magit, vterm, rg, and other commands that want to open a new window will interact with a multi-window setup. Sometimes they&#x27;ll use an existing window, sometimes they&#x27;ll make a new one. I prefer having things be predictable: terminals always go here, search results go there, and so on. I was looking for ways to tame this, and I found purpose, popper, shackle, and of course, directly hacking on display-buffer-alist.
 I also found winner-undo, which is nice, but I&#x27;d like to prevent things from getting messy rather than letting them get bad and then undoing them. And there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a &#x27;modern&#x27; clean approach; i.e., there&#x27;s no window management equivalent of corfu. (Maybe this is an excuse for me to get my toes wet in actual emacs package development; purpose is probably the closest, but I don&#x27;t like how it works by advising everything...)

When a PDF file exists on a remote server that is being accessed over an SSH connection and the file is displayed in a dired-mode buffer, I&#x27;d like to view the PDF locally in an external reader such as xpdf or acroread on linux (Ubuntu). It wouldn&#x27;t be that difficult to write up a solution (e.g., download to a temporary directory, perhaps using something like url-retrieve-synchronously), but if a solution already exists, I&#x27;d like to start with that. Any ideas how that would be done would be greatly appreciated.

                              <span>I&#x27;m heavenly new to Haskell and asking myself how to solve the following problem. I have a simple data structre like this: data Document &#x3D; Document { title :: String, content :: [String], wordCount :: Int } I want to have besides the default constructor where I have to provide a title and the content another one where I just have to provide the title and the content or just the title. And I also want to have a constructor function that creates out of a completely different data structure a Document. I find it pretty nasty to name all these constructor functions differently. Especially since I encountered this problem with a lot of different data structures. So I decided to use ad-hoc polymorphism provided by a generic type-class: class Factory a b where ‏‏‎‏‏‎‏‏‎‏‏‎­ create :: a -&gt; b Which I use like this: instance Factory String ([String] -&gt; Document) where create title words &#x3D; Document { title &#x3D; title, words &#x3D; words, wordCount &#x3D; 0 } instance Factory String Document where create title &#x3D; Document { title &#x3D; title, words &#x3D; [], wordCount &#x3D; 0 } instance Factory RawDocument Document where create RawDocument{..} &#x3D; create title (splitOn &quot; &quot; content) Now I can use simply the create function everywhere with the defined input types. And it scales nicely with all my data structures. Do you see any problems with this approach? I&#x27;m really not sure if I&#x27;m missing something. I&#x27;m just facing one problem: - Either I define the factories in the same module as the data structure, but then I need to live with the name shadowing warnings for values like title and words (I would hate to name them differently since they describe the same thing) - Or I have a separate Factory-Module but then I have to live with the orphan instance warnings. Which is also pretty nasty What do you recommend?

                              <span>I&#x27;m starting out my dev journey in Haskell and what I have done so far is install Stack and through Stack I installed ghc and hspec.
 What I then wanted to do was configure vscode for Haskell and so I downloaded the Haskell extension which says ghcup is not installed and that intero isn&#x27;t as well. At first glance GHCup seems to do the same thing as Stack (a kind of dependency manager). But Stack seems to do more than that, creating projects, testing, etc...
 To add to the confusion, there seems to be a Cabal library and a cabal-install package, both of which I don&#x27;t understand.
 Not sure where to go from here honestly. At this point, I just want VSCode to work without installing tools that do the same thing. (I said seem to be the same because they are probably not)

                              <span>So far, for writing small toy applications, I&#x27;ve mostly sat in some sort of ExceptT ProgrammeError IO a which I runExceptT in my main function.
 I&#x27;ve been starting to build slightly more interesting applications, and was reading The ReaderT Design Pattern, so started to think maybe I wanted something like the following as a base monad (I heard this term on a podcast but I can&#x27;t remember which).
 type App &#x3D; ExceptT ProgrammeError (ReaderT AppEnv IO) 
 I imagine I can improve on this by using MonadError, MonadReader, etc. typeclasses, but I would like to know, when you write applications, what &quot;base monad&quot; you use (especially for different sizes of application -- nothing I&#x27;m writing is hugely complex but I am finding my code is becoming a big convoluted).

                              <span>Let me preface that by saying that I am somewhat proficient in Lisp, having been working through SICP over the past few months. However, I am unable to grok Haskell concepts like I was able to for Lisp, and most tutorials I am finding for Haskell are catering to those who either are familiar with Haskell, or are absolute beginners with functional programming in its entierety. Is there a guide for someone of my background, who has dipped their toes in functional programming but not Haskell?

                              <span>Hello Zettlers,
I wonder how you work  with different languages in your Zettelkasten.
My problem is that I think about different topics in different languages: 
My question: how do I best deal with this in my Zettelkasten?
So far I tried to write all of my zettels in german, but I realize more and more, that this is sub-optimal: it introduces the added problem of adequate translation and some of the thoughts and arguments loose nuance in translation, or (worse) get added meanings and associations through the translation which weren&#x27;t there in the original. The mental work of tranlating also introduces additional friction into the system.
How do you deal with this? Do you have a single language Zettelkasten and translate all of your thoughts into your primary language? Or do you mix and match, having Zettels written in different languages in the same Zettelkasten?
Kind regards</span>

                              <span>Hello, the default value of org-tags-column is -77 which aligns the tags to the right. I set the value of the variablle to 0 so the tags gets placed directly after the headline text.
  Before (org-tags-column -77) * Headline text :tag After (org-tags-column 0) * Headline text :tag 
 I have a few documents in which the tags were set when the variable was still at a value of -77. As a result the tags are all aligned to the right. Is there a way to update all the tags in the file to use the new value of the variable, the zero value? or do I need to remove all tags manually from all headlines and insert them again?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve recently started using org-journal along with my (fledgling) usage of org itself. I like the thought of periodically exporting things to HTML to make it viewable in my browser-of-choice. What I&#x27;m wondering, is, is there a way to have the export roll all of the journal files into a single destination file? I.e., perhaps an org-file that when exported will import all the files matching the name-pattern and include them?

 Normally I have this format when reply some email.
 Me  writes: &gt; Old reply &gt; Old reply &gt; Old reply &gt; Old reply #+begin_signature --\\ My signature #+end_signature 
 However, I want that my emails are formatted like this (noticed the switch in the signature and the citation)
 #+begin_signature --\\ My signature #+end_signature Me  writes: &gt; Old reply &gt; Old reply &gt; Old reply &gt; Old reply 
 I have this line (setq message-cite-reply-position &#x27;above)in my config.el but it doesn&#x27;t work. I activated +org (org-msg) in the init.el
 Thanks for the help.

 It would be nice if my fat-fingered mistakes (e.g. myFile isntead of myfile) could be overlooked.

                              <span>Hi all, i&#x27;m new in emacs, i&#x27;m using &quot;doom&quot; and i have some problems trying to disable a pop-up.
 I think the pop-up is related to &quot;spell&quot; or something but i can&#x27;t locate the name of the package to disable.
 so Have 2 questions. First Question is what is the package i show in the image.
 Second Question is if i have the same problem how can i locate myself?

 Is this a new behavior? Was there an update from straight.el repo which I missed?

                              <span>Is it possible to set a right margin based on the length of the line, starting at the first character, rather than a specific column?
 My use case is this: I&#x27;m writing a document that has various indentation levels, and due to how its processed I can afford (eg) 50 characters on a &quot;line&quot;. But the line may be indented so I can&#x27;t just set the fill-column to 50, since I might be at column 8, 12, 16, etc. indentation. So I&#x27;d like it to be 50+column_of_first_character.
 Ideally then things like auto-fill-mode and fill-paragraph and such would work.
 Is this possible?

Is it made by the developers of Doom? Does it have any connection to Doom, or did the makers of Doom Emacs just happen to like the game Doom? 
 Maybe I&#x27;m reading too much into it. I can&#x27;t find any straight answers for this online.

                              <span>Suppose you have a list of org-mode headings each with a property drawer. Suppose you have another list of org-mode headings, in a different buffer, say, each with a property drawer too. I&#x27;m looking for a way to update the values of properties of the first list of headings using the second list. So, for example, if I have: 
 * Heading 1 :PROPERTIES: :COLOR: blue :AGE: 5 days :END: * Heading 2 :PROPERTIES: :COLOR: red :AGE: 10 days :END: 
 I want to be able to update it with: 
 * Heading 1 :PROPERTIES: :COLOR: green :END: * Heading 2 :PROPERTIES: :COLOR: orange :END: 
 So that the result is this: 
 * Heading 1 :PROPERTIES: :COLOR: green :AGE: 5 days :END: * Heading 2 :PROPERTIES: :COLOR: orange :AGE: 10 days :END: 
 Now my questions: 
  
Is there some ready-made utility for doing this? 
 If not, can you think of some ready-made utilities that would help with this?
  
I thought I&#x27;d check with folks here to see if there&#x27;s a likely better way than cooking up my own tool.
 I&#x27;ve been reading through the documentation of the org-element and property APIs and I have a very rough sense how to use it for what I want, but I&#x27;m having trouble with one issue: 
  
how do I get the list of properties (with or without their values) in the first list of headings so I get candidate properties to update using the second list? 
  
I understand org-entry-properties is a place to start, but I only want the properties explicitly listed in the property drawer. (If I call org-entry-properties on the first heading in the initial list, I get this: 
 ((&quot;CATEGORY&quot; . &quot;???&quot;) (&quot;AGE&quot; . &quot;5 days&quot;) (&quot;COLOR&quot; . &quot;blue&quot;) (&quot;BLOCKED&quot; . &quot;&quot;) (&quot;FILE&quot;) (&quot;PRIORITY&quot; . &quot;B&quot;) (&quot;ITEM&quot; . &quot;Heading 1&quot;)) 
 Can I just assume that there is a fixed list of default properties that will always be included in such a list?

 I have Pyright installed and on my PATH. executable-find also finds pyright.cmd.
 Here is my relevant config: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;el (use-package lsp-mode :config (lsp-enable-which-key-integration t))
 (use-package lsp-pyright :hook (python-mode . (lambda () (require &#x27;lsp-pyright) (lsp)))) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 when I open a new buffer with Python Mode and then lsp-describe-session, I get nothing. When I run lsp I get nothing.
 When I run lsp for an Emacs Lisp file, I get errors saying there is no languages server installed for that language.
 I have spent many hours trying to solve this but I can&#x27;t find anything.

                              <span>So, Emacs is reallllly confusing for a new user.
 anyway, 
 Here is the documentation I&#x27;m following: https://github.com/hlissner/evil-multiedit 
 First, I can&#x27;t find the &#x27;evil-multiedit-default-keybinds&#x27; that it mentions. But then I noticed that the commands pallete already shows some keybinds. 
 When I try to execute &#x27;evil-multiedit-match-and-next&#x27; it shows (M-d) as the keybind. It even says so at bottom that I should use &#x27;M-d&#x27; if I execute the command in the pallete by hitting return. But in the actual editor if I try to use &#x27;M-d&#x27; it says: &#x27;I-Search Backward: [No Previous Search String]&#x27;. 
 I have not created any new keybinds myself. I&#x27;m just very much working on defaults so far.
 How can I fix this?

                              <span>Autothemer version 0.2.8 has some nice new features which theme designers will enjoy.
  
Generate a beautiful SVG image of the theme palette with autothemer-generate-palette-svg
 Select colors from autothemer--current-theme with autothemer-select-colorand autothemer--get-color (which does a lookup by color name).
  
I&#x27;m also outlining a spec for TVA (Theme Variant Architecture), which will help define a clear path for creating themes with multiple variations. 
 Hope you enjoy the update.
 EDIT: BTW if you have published a theme using Autothemer, do let me know here or by posting an issue https://github.com/jasonm23/autothemer/issues

                              <span>Hi, we are looking for an experienced libraries developer to design and implement high-performance data processing libraries for Enso (https://enso.org, YC S21), a functional, hybrid visual/textual programming language with immutable memory. You will be working in an incredibly talented team with Edward Kmett (chair of the Haskell libraries committee), Jaroslav Tulach (founder of NetBeans, co-creator of GraalVM Truffle), and many more.
 What is Enso?
 From the business perspective, Enso is a no-code interactive data transformation tool. It lets you load, blend, and analyze your data, and then automate the whole process, simply by connecting visual components together. It can be used for both in-memory data processing, as well as SQL analytics and transformations on modern data stack (ELT).…</span>

 The above code will take an input of the form shown below, where the first integer denotes the number of testcases under consideration, and in each of the testcases the first line denotes the size of the list followed by the line under it which contains the elements in the list.
 3 3 2 2 1 4 3 1 2 1 5 1 2 2 4 4 
 and returns
 YES YES NO 
 I however want it to return something of the form
 Case #1: YES Case #2: YES Case #3: NO 
 I&#x27;m not sure what changes to make in the mainFun so that the benefits of using ByteStrings and Builders, in terms of the efficient time and space optimisations that they provide are still apparent. Moreover, I&#x27;m not certain how to use an efficient looping mechanism there.

                              <span>Hi there! 
 I was wondering whether anybody has already considered modifying GHC to build against Cosmopolitan (which produces an &quot;actually portable executable&quot; format). 
 The Esperanto project for OCaml (https://github.com/dinosaure/esperanto) made me wonder about this.

 Is Frege still state-of-the-art or should I better look at an alternative? (If so which one?)

                              <span>A new version of LeanCheck is out (v1.0.0). LeanCheck is a property testing library (like QuickCheck) that tests values enumeratively.
 Example. Here is a simple example of LeanCheck in action showing that sorting is idempotent and list union is not commutative:
 &gt; import Test.LeanCheck &gt; import Data.List (sort, union) &gt; check $ \xs -&gt; sort (sort xs) &#x3D;&#x3D; sort (xs::[Int]) +++ OK, passed 200 tests. &gt; check $ \xs ys -&gt; xs &#x60;union&#x60; ys &#x3D;&#x3D; ys &#x60;union&#x60; (xs::[Int]) *** Failed! Falsifiable (after 4 tests): [] [0,0] 
 LeanCheck works on all types that are instances of the Listable typeclass and is able to derive instances automatically using either Template Haskell or GHC.Generics. See LeanCheck’s Haddock documentation for more details. LeanCheck is compatible with Hspec, Tasty and test-framework.
 What&#x27;s new? Version 1.0.0 signalizes stability in the API. LeanCheck has not actually changed much in the past couple of years and there are no significant differences between the early 0.9 series.
 Installing. You can find LeanCheck on Hackage or GitHub. It is also tracked on Stackage. You can install it with:
 $ cabal install leancheck

                              <span>So this has happened a couple of times -- I&#x27;m not sure not how I&#x27;m triggering it -- but when saving a file I&#x27;ve accidentally gone into decipher-mode. Once in that mode:
  
I don&#x27;t seem to be able to exit it without killing the buffer and re-opening it.
 more dramatically, that mode seems to disable undo somehow and thus it permanently munges my file.
 decipher-undo doesn&#x27;t seem to do, well, anything.
  
So does anyone know how to unf*** the damage done by accidentally triggering decipher-mode? Alternatively, suggestions on how to make the decipher-mode function a noop in case it does get triggered?
 thx
 NOTE: 
  
(defun decipher-mode () t) 
  
thus making it non-interactive seems like it could help I have no idea what might be using decipher-mode under the hood.

 Can anyone tell me why the above raises embark/:catch: Symbol’s value as variable is void I understand the error but I don&#x27;t get why embark-act-all would be void, I don&#x27;t believe i need to include another package to make it work do I ? I have quoted it in my config to make the error go away for the moment.

 #(&quot;cell-contents&quot; 0 35 (fontified t face org-table org-category &quot;file-or-buffer-name&quot;)), but &quot;cell-contents&quot; is all I want.
 What kind of expression is this, and how do I extract &quot;cell-contents&quot; alone from from it?
 What is the syntax for including the file name in the reference, ie something along the lines of &quot;filename::TableRef&quot;?
 For now I have to test the function in the same file as the table, but I also want to do it externally.

                              <span>Hi everyone, new doom emacs user here, running macos 12.5.1 I installed emacs-mac via homebrew, following the doom emacs documentation:  brew tap railwaycat/emacsmacport brew install emacs-mac --with-modules ln -s /usr/local/opt/emacs-mac/Emacs.app /Applications/Emacs.app  because of that last command, i now have the Emacs.app link in the Applications folder. In /usr/local/bin i have two symlinks to contents of that Emacs.app, one is emacs and the other is emacsclient:  MacBook-Pro-di-Raffo:bin simone$ ls -lah | grep emacs lrwxr-xr-x 1 simone admin 44B Jun 19 16:30 emacs -&gt; /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs lrwxr-xr-x 1 simone admin 54B Jun 19 16:30 emacsclient -&gt; /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/bin/emacsclient  emacs is fine, the problem lies with emacsclient: the whole bin folder doesnt exist! This is the Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/ folder&#x27;s contents:  MacBook-Pro-di-Raffo:bin simone$ ls -lah /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS total 34296 drwxr-xr-x 5 simone admin 160B Aug 21 15:00 . drwxr-xr-x 6 simone admin 192B Aug 21 14:56 .. -rwxr-xr-x@ 1 simone admin 6.1M Aug 21 15:00 Emacs -rw-r--r-- 1 simone admin 11M Aug 21 15:00 Emacs.pdmp -rwxr-xr-x 1 simone admin 1.3K Apr 6 05:51 Emacs.sh  I can start the daemon server, i can run emacs alone and it seems to work fine, but of course if i try to run emacsclient it is command not found.
 Here the doom info: https://pastebin.com/C0714GXz
 If this is something straightforward that i should&#x27;ve just found around, i&#x27;m sorry. I googled all Yesterday but i don&#x27;t really understand much of it so im just circling around.
 Thank you all.

                              <span>Morning all,
 tldr; what are your tips for recording in emacs? 
 background
 I work in a legal environment. Sometimes I need to seek costs for time spent on a matter (&#x27;project&#x27; - I guess in emacs terms)
 I came to emacs a year or so ago via the Doom/org/org-roam popularity explosion.
 what I do now
 I tried using timers in org, but they are easy to forget to &#x27;end&#x27;
 So, I use an excel spreadsheet, which has the same issue, but the empty cell helps remind me visually to enter my finish time on a task.
 It also has validation, functions etc that let me analyse and summarise my data
 what I&#x27;d like to do
 My workflow really could use:
  
Automatic time recording, for time spent editing documents;
 something smart enough not to cause me to seek costs for making a coffee, or leaving my computer on during lunch;
 some kind of reporting on the time spent
  
I&#x27;ve seen a few solutions for emacs - wakatime, buffer timer, activity-watch-time etc, and was wondering what everyone&#x27;s experience of those, or any self-made systems, are

 I was searching some ways that I could do it and a find so many things that I could do to reach similar results that I&#x27;m curious about the possibilities behind it. How do you do it?

                              <span>I am able to test the following issue on Emacs versions 25 to 27. Due to the tramp connection crashing the entire Emacs instance for me on Emacs 28 and 29 using El Capitan on my mac, I don&#x27;t know if this particular behavior with directory-files-and-attibutes still exists. Before opening the proverbial &quot;Pandora&#x27;s Box&quot; by submitting a formal bug report, is anyone able to confirm whether Emacs 29 currently behaves the same and (if known) why that is the case? [It is a Pandora&#x27;s Box because I would potentially be assisting in debugging the crashes, before getting to the underlying issue.]
 Step #1: Establish a remote Tramp session over ssh.
 Step #2: Call directory-files-and-attributes using the following optional arguments:
 (directory-files-and-attributes &quot;/ssh:user@01.23.456.789:/home3/lawlist&quot; t nil t nil)
 Step #3: The return value includes both the starting directory, and the parent of the starting directory. [FYI: If there are lots of files/folders, the default settings of Emacs will truncate the list that gets returned ... so, either increase the print length or use something like (message &quot;%s&quot; ....) to avoid truncation.]
 /ssh:user@01.23.456.789:/home3
 /ssh:user@01.23.456.789:/home3/lawlist
 EXPECTED BEHAVIOR: Do not return the starting directory, and do not return the parent directory of the starting directory.

  (use-package gruvbox-theme :config (load-theme &#x27;gruvbox-dark-medium t)) 
 The problem is that the theme is loaded using the hardcoded load-theme function.
 I would like to use the modus-operandi as my default color scheme because it is part of Emacs. However, if I have a 3rd party color scheme installed and I enable that using consult-theme is it possible to make Emacs remember and load that the next time I restart the editor?

                              <span>I use org-roam-bibtex together with a helm-bibtex interface, and a master .bib file generated by Zotero. I&#x27;m able to comfortably create an Emacs frame, launch helm-bibtex and then select a paper I want to read. 
 Using the Fn keys, I can select whether I want to view the .pdf of the paper, or open the .org note file associated with it -- and if there are no notes, I am lead to an org-roam-capture template that creates a new notes file for me. From the notes file, I can invoke org-noter to view both the.pdf file and add notes to the note file at the same time.
 I would like to do something slightly different now. I typically use helm-bibtex to open the .pdf file of the reference directly, using pdf-tools. I browse the file, and add highlights, etc. I now want to open org-noter and view the associated notes, or if no notes file exists, use org-roam-capture to create it. 
 Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t see any way of doing this at the moment. The best I can do is invoke org-noter and add notes to files listed in org-noter-default-files-name, so that all the notes end up in the same file. 
 Is there a function or hack I can use to get org-noter to search for an associated notes file for my .pdf, or use my org-roam-capture-template to create such a notes file?

                              <span>I am trying to add a multi value property globally to make auto completion available while adding **Project** property to headings.
 ​
 (setq org-global-properties &#x27;((&quot;Project_ALL&quot; . &#x27;(&quot;business&quot; &quot;professional&quot; &quot;personal&quot;))))
 ​
 ​
 When I check the value of this variable, it is set. But while setting a property to **org-set-property**, property **Project** does not appear in the auto complete drop down.

                              <span>Hey friends,
 I&#x27;m using the following code in my init.el to build my agenda from all Roam nodes with the Project filetag:
 ;; The buffer you put this code in must have lexical-binding set to t! ;; See the final configuration at the end for more details. (defun my/org-roam-filter-by-tag (tag-name) (lambda (node) (member tag-name (org-roam-node-tags node)))) (defun my/org-roam-list-notes-by-tag (tag-name) (mapcar #&#x27;org-roam-node-file (seq-filter (my/org-roam-filter-by-tag tag-name) (org-roam-node-list)))) (defun my/org-roam-refresh-agenda-list () (interactive) (setq org-agenda-files (my/org-roam-list-notes-by-tag &quot;Project&quot;))) ;; Build the agenda list the first time for the session (my/org-roam-refresh-agenda-list) 
 The above is taken from a System Crafters video on YouTube. Show notes here.
 The problem I&#x27;m running into is that when I launch Emacs, I get an error that the symbol org-roam-node-list is void and my agenda launches as empty until I use org-roam-node-find to open up a node that has that Project filetag.
 After that point, the symbol I previously mentioned is no longer void and the agenda buffer is populated as expected.
 I should also mention that the code above is within the :config portion of use-package.
 Does anyone know what changes I might implement so that org-roam-node-list is not void upon launching Emacs?
 All the thanks in advance.

                              <span>One of the controversies I&#x27;ve set up elsewhere is the provocative statement that &quot;Haskell is for s-code&quot;. That is to say, since Haskell has a very low refactoring cost, it&#x27;s possible to just scratch out anything (this is a bit extreme) that works, then refactor it into clean code, something that is more difficult in languages with substantial refactoring costs.
 ​
 There&#x27;s also something that seems to be &quot;pseudocode-driven development&quot;, i.e, you scratch out something in undefined and error &quot;todos&quot;, and constantly branch downwards, and the type system might force you to play Type Tetris, but you can often hash something out before you work on refactoring and optimizing it.
 ​
 I wouldn&#x27;t call myself an experienced Haskeller; hell, by the definition &quot;you&#x27;re not a real Haskeller until you&#x27;ve written your first compiler&quot; I&#x27;m not a Haskeller. A question to more experienced Haskellers: is Haskell as a language for prototyping then refactoring a useful definition? If so, what are the limitations of such (a recent project had to be completely rewritten because I lost the ability to understand the code, despite constantly using long variable names)?
 ​
 And if only-okay quality Haskell code can be refactored constantly, can Haskell be sold as a language, for, well, s-code? That&#x27;s a bit too &quot;marketer-speak&quot;, as it completely upends common perceptions of Haskell, but the weaker and more polite &quot;prototype code&quot; or &quot;draft code&quot; might have sway. But the more radical terminology, one, attracts attention, and second, makes Haskell seem approachable (&quot;you mean I don&#x27;t have to be a rocket scientist to be productive in Haskell?&quot;).

                              <span>Hi everyone! 
 I&#x27;ve just released version 0.9.0 of the dunai libraries, which comes with version 0.13.6 of bearriver. 
 For those unfamiliar, dunai is a reactive programming library structured around a notion of Monadic Stream Functions. dunai can be used to implement other reactive and FRP frameworks on top, including Classic FRP and Arrowized FRP variants. bearriver itself is an API-compatible implementation of Yampa. All versions of GHC from 7.6 to 9.4 are supported.
 Release information
 This is mainly a maintenance release. Among other changes, this version improves the documentation in dunai-test. Additionally, a function that was exposed unnecessarily is being deprecated in preparation for its future removal.
  
Release: https://github.com/ivanperez-keera/dunai/releases/tag/v0.9.0.
 
Hackage:
  
dunai: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/dunai.
 dunai-test: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/dunai-test
 bearriver: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/bearriver
 
 
Repo: https://github.com/ivanperez-keera/dunai.
 
 Upcoming changes
 We are synchronizing releases with the Yampa project to ensure that bearriver incorporates any changes added to Yampa. Additionally, the goal is to eventually use Yampa&#x27;s tests also to give bearriver full test coverage.
 Two changes are being discussed that will potentially affect users:
 - The introduction of a new constraint in VectorSpace in simple-affine-space would alter the type constraints of some functions. See #298.
  
A re-structuring of the API to better reflect the purpose of the implementation. This could also lead to a division of dunai into multiple libraries. See #305.
  
The next release is expected to be published on October 21, 2022.
 Happy Haskelling!

                              <span>I am completely new to Haskell but not new to functional programming (I come form OCaml). Since I wasn&#x27;t sure how to unit test, I did the following:
 I created this method
 -- msg is the name of the test unit_test :: Bool -&gt; String -&gt; IO () unit_test cond msg &#x3D; if cond then putStrLn (&quot;\ESC[32mPassed: \ESC[0m&quot; ++ msg) else putStrLn (&quot;\ESC[31mFAILED: \ESC[0m&quot; ++ msg) 
 and my tests look like this:
 sumTest :: () -&gt; IO () sumTest () &#x3D; do &quot;sum 1&quot; &amp; unit_test (List.sum [1, 2, 3, 4] &#x3D;&#x3D; 10) &quot;sum 2&quot; &amp; unit_test (List.sum [1, 1, 1, 1] &#x3D;&#x3D; 4) &quot;sum 3&quot; &amp; unit_test (List.sum [2, 1, 1, 1] &#x3D;&#x3D; 5) &quot;sum 4&quot; &amp; unit_test (List.sum [3, 1, 1, 1] &#x3D;&#x3D; 6) &quot;sum 5&quot; &amp; unit_test (List.sum [4, 1, 1, 1] &#x3D;&#x3D; 7) &quot;sum 6&quot; &amp; unit_test (List.sum [0, 0, 0, 0] &#x3D;&#x3D; 0) &quot;sum 7&quot; &amp; unit_test (List.sum [-1, 1, -1, 1] &#x3D;&#x3D; 0) &quot;sum 8&quot; &amp; unit_test (List.sum [2, 2, -2, 2] &#x3D;&#x3D; 4) 
 This is testing a custom sum function. What do you think of this? While we are at it, what are some actual unit testing libraries I should look into. I have stack downloaded and I am using stack test to run my tests.

                              <span>After attempting to use the built-in breakpoints feature that GHCi provides (which seems to have been abandoned long ago) and running into several critical issues, I decided to write a GHC plugin that implements functionality for debugging Haskell programs using breakpoints.
 The result is the breakpoint package, which is available on github and hackage.

                              <span>The problem
 I might have found a way to make my config more scalable. For context, my config file is a 200LOC litterate config (I know. It&#x27;s not that bad) and I have a lot of packages that I use every once in a while that clutters my config and increases my startup time (3.61 seconds). Moreover, every time I migrate my emacs config, the initial startup time (use-package downloads everything) is annoyingly high (I just checked, it was about 7 minutes).
 The solution
 Lazy load (and install!) everything. nn I wrote a small library that lets you define your packages and their configuration as a dependency graph. A package will be loaded (and installed, if necessary) when a dependent package gets loaded, or when a generated placeholder function gets run.
 This is what it looks like in practic…</span>

 Firstly, how can I open a remote project.el project through ssh? So far, I&#x27;ve been using C-x C-f.
 How can I terminals through vterm once I am in the server? This part should be working, but when I toggle vterm, it just says, &quot;Tramp: Opening connection vterm for ... using ssh... done&quot;, and then nothing shows up.

                              <span>Hi all. I am using emacs in the terminal, mostly for quick editting of org files. I am on Linux, so I run emacs with:
 emacs -nw -Q --visit myfile.org 
 This opens up terminal emacs really fast, without any config. Here, I would like to:
 - disable menu bar mode (within emacs, it is M-x menu-bar-mode )
 - use evil mode and I dont want to reload the entire config file just to be able to use it 
 Is there a way to pass these arguments to the command line when open emacs? 
 Thanks

                              <span>I&#x27;m unable to understand this. I just installed a fresh copy of doom emacs. I haven&#x27;t changed anything other than enabling a few languages in the init.el file.I am coming from VS Code and honestly, the experience is just worse.
 Emacs is laggy as hell. Opening a file is laggy, code completion is laggy.I&#x27;m on Mac OS. My laptop is old now. 7 years+ but it does VS Code does work pretty well. No noticable lag anywhere and code completion is faster than emacs. What gives?

                              <span>How do you escape org-emphasis marker? Not sure if this is the intended use of verbatim, which has its own face defined, whereas escaping org-emphasis marker treats it a regular text you don&#x27;t want emphasized. I guess I can disable the face for verbatim, but that means losing a default marker.
 
Assuming org-hide-emphasis-markers is enabled, is there a way to yank the text without the emphasis-markers as is? In Evil, yanking the emphasized text includes the markers.
 
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hi there people. I’m fairly new to the zettlekasten system. I have some things to ask you guys.
Do you throw away your literature notes and fleeting notes after turning them into permanent notes?
I have been taking literature notes for a couple of days now and it’s getting difficult and difficult lately to organize them.
Should I just throw them away?
Or should I keep and organize them despite it taking a lot of time?
Or should I keep them without organizing?</span>

                              <span>Hi, I am facing some issues with both styles overlays and text-properties of org-fold-core-style.
  
For overlays mode: drawers are not hidden (not folded). I could not find how to hide it by default. I do have org-cycle-hide-drawer-startup set to True.
 For text-properties mode: search in a buffer does not unfold sub-headings. If a content is hidden in 3rd or 4th level, it is a pain to reach to it. Also, in org-roam backlinks, it does not hide backlinks id. I don&#x27;t know how to fix this.
  
Ideally, I would like to use text-properties since it is supposed to be fast but with the above two customization. I would appreciate any directions. An alternate solution is welcome too. Thanks!

                              <span>Hey friends, Just dialing in my agenda view, I&#x27;m wondering how y&#x27;all handle tasks that don&#x27;t necessarily need to be ticked off daily, but should hang around in perpetuity on your agenda for the sake of time tracking - for instance, general work on project a that may or may not happen on a daily basis. Let&#x27;s assume I&#x27;ll need to forward my org-clock-report to my boss at the end of the week to show how much time I spent on project a or activity b.
 I was thinking one way to do this was with a workflow state of something like DAILY or TRACK or ONG (ongoing) and a custom agenda view that compartmentalizes those tasks so I can clock in and out of them easily.
 Any other ideas on how to do this?
 EDITS: Silly mistakes and clarity.

                              <span>So, I&#x27;m 28, I&#x27;ve been coding since I was 14. started with easy-eclipse (I know, lol), then moved to eclipse. Used that for a while, even through college, although I also became really handy with Vim. In my first job, I started using IntelliJ and I just loved it (scala developer), as far as IDEs go nothing touches IntelliJ if your focus is deep git integration, debugging, code completion and stuff. Now, I use VSCode. 
 I have ALWAYS wanted to learn Emacs though. Always seemed so cool. Just seems like I need to learn to be an OG. It&#x27;s a stupid thought, I know, but it is nonetheless. Just that whenever I would try, I have twice, I would keep fighting with it for simple tasks and then some important work would come up and I&#x27;d jump back to a familiar editor to get things done quickly. 
 I&#x27;ve been reading a lot about how VSCode is just about a better editor than Emacs now. Many Emacs lovers are making videos or writing articles on how much they love VSCode now. I really want to try Emacs again. I&#x27;m asking the community to either convince me and welcome me to the fold or convince me to not use it and stay with VS Code. I am VERY sure I&#x27;m not the only person who would benefit from this post. Others must be in similar situations.

                              <span>Hi
 Can i use org-mode tables (or something like that for Emacs) for accounting trading transactions? (now i&#x27;m using Joplin with Markdown)
 https://preview.redd.it/cppm0oeamti91.png?width&#x3D;400&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;38970aeb6ae54c11871e7ce3f54e50638a3bf2c8
 Like on screenshot:
 - Save time
 - Summarize daily earnings
 e.t.c
 ​
 And most important: 
 1) I want it to automatically calculate profit / losses. I known that Emacs can do some arithmetic operations with tables, using patterns like that: 
 ​
 #+TBLFM: $3&#x3D;($2 - u/-1$2)/7::$5&#x3D;$Weeks*$Rent; %.2f
 ​
 2) And i want automatically create tables or just string that show me, how much i win and lose, summarizing week and month (profit / lose).
 Example:
 Week: -10$
 Month: +100$
 ​
 I&#x27;m just wondering, it is generally possible or not. I really like Emacs ecosystem and its flexibility. Markdown is very limited in comparison with Org-Mode, plus Joplin is pretty bloated software... 
 ​
 P.S. Sorry for my English, I hope, you understood me. Thanks! :-)

                              <span>I often start processes which print their progress on a terminal, but the output gets printed messily in the process buffer. For example
 Reading track 1 of 4 (1 of 9) ... 0 %^MReading track 1 of 4 (1 of 9) ... 1 %^MReading track 1 of 4 (1 of 9) ... 2 %^MReading track 1 of 4 (1 of 9) ... 3 % 
 Where the ^M is a newline character, I guess.
 How could I print progress like it does on a terminal into the process buffer, overwriting the previous % and respecting newlines? I have looked at process filters but cannot understand how I would write one.

 After further tests with a variety of numbers it is clear that emacs see a sequence of numbers with an e in the middle as a number in E notation format.
 How can I coerce the values in the columns to be seen as strings?

                              <span>I am very particular about how text appears in the text editor. I cannot compromise on poorly rendered font. In an attempt to make text in emacs on Windows look crisp, I tried several fonts. I blamed the fonts that they are not good and kept trying different fonts.
 Then I installed MacType. The before and after of using MacType is huge. I do not need any custom fonts out on the internet there and was settled on Consolas. 
 So if you are like me or having issues try installing MacType. 
 https://www.mactype.net/
 Note: Make sure that the MacType service is running before you launch emacs. I run the emacs server in the startup and it didn&#x27;t render the fonts properly. I had to make sure of this dependency.

                              <span>Solved https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wst1cr/how_can_i_uses_clloop_to_collect_values_from/il17k1i/
 I found this code on emacs stackexchange showing how cl-loop is used to gather information from an org-table
  #+NAME: my-filter #+BEGIN_SRC elisp :var tbl&#x3D;table1 val&#x3D;&quot;USA&quot; :colnames y (cl-loop for row in tbl if (equal (nth 3 row) val) collect row into newtbl finally return newtbl) #+END_SRC 
 I tried something similar with cl-loop but failed terribly, so I switch back to my trusty dolist.
 #+BEGIN_SRC elisp :var tbl&#x3D;ParedTable val&#x3D;&quot;.&quot; :results output raw (let ((somevar &#x27;())) (dolist (row tbl) (add-to-list &#x27;somevar (append (list (nth 2 row)) (nth 0 row)))) somevar) #+END_SRC 
 The code creates an alist from some columns of a table.
 How can I used the cl-loop to accomplish the same thing?

                              <span>I&#x27;m happy to announce that after 5 years in the works, a new major release of unix-2.8 is available: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/unix-2.8.0.0
 The changelog (https://hackage.haskell.org/package/unix-2.8.0.0/changelog) is full of improvements, big and small. Among most important ones are support for Abstract FilePath Proposal (say goodbye to type FilePath &#x3D; String) and compatibility with WebAssembly platform (stay tuned for GHC 9.6).
 This release would never happen without a new team of maintainers: Viktor Dukhovni and Julian Ospald, and is a culmination of contributions from 36 volunteers, who spent their time and effort to improve unix. Thanks all!

I have grasped the intuitive meaning of it, that it some sort of combo of Reader and Writer monads, but still struggling to understand technical details, like how bind operator works in that case. Maybe you know some decent videos/articles/tutorials/book chapters etc. on the topic?

 I find Haskell really interesting and I have been reading Learn you a Haskell, but I would like to start working towards some project-based learning. 
 I’ve been watching this Reddit and a few other languages (C, C++, etc) and once in a while I’ll see a post about someone learning for a year and then finding a job. I’ve always wondered, what types of projects would I need to master to put me at the level of being able to find work based on those skills?

 My main gripe is the handleKeys function in the end. I thought a Picture which is a simple window can be redrawn with a grid in it when an event is fired. That is about it. But I have not managed to change any simple event to a new Behavior which is a redrawn Picture.
 Can anyone comment ? I may have coded this completely wrongly.
 Compiler error is this.
  Couldn&#x27;t match type ‘Picture’ with ‘Behavior Picture’ Expected type: Moment (Behavior Picture)

                              <span>I am defining my org-agenda block view, inspired by the excellent YouTube tutorial by Protesilaos Stavrou.
 I would to filter the agenda view using a tag. I am looking for something along the lines of
 (agenda &quot;&quot; ((org-agenda-span 7) (org-agenda-overriding-header (format &quot;Weekly view of %s\n&quot; project-name)) (???org-agenda-include-entry-if-tag??? &#x27;ABC))) 
 where the (to me unknown) function ???org-agenda-include-entry-if-tag??? would accept entries tagged with ABC.
 How can I achieve this effect?
 Thanks,
 Mirko

                              <span>I am wondering if anyone has experience using Org-Mode for keeping notes during book writing and translating projects. In particular, I am considering undertaking a book translation project and am looking for ideas on how to set up the system. Any tips or advice are appreciated.

                              <span>Hey everyone,
 A couple of days ago there was a post about org-noter. It looked like not everyone is aware of the package and what it does so I recorded a short screencast to highlight it&#x27;s features. 
 org-noter is a annotation package that helps extract content from PDFs/Epubs/DjVus. It has a lot of promise for incremental reading/learning so I&#x27;m planning to work on it myself. My hope is that by making this someone else decides to contribute as well.

                              <span>Hello, I have this structure in an org file:
  * First Level Heading :first: ** Second Level Heading :second: *** Third Level Heading :third: 
 However, when I open the org file in a simple text editing software such as GNOME&#x27;s Text Editor, this is how tags align (notice the one character shift):
  * First Level Heading :first: ** Second Level Heading :second: *** Third Level Heading :third: 
 I&#x27;ve noticed that there is an org-tags-column variable in Emacs which is set to a value of -77 by default. I tried changing it and refreshing the tags list with C-u C-c C-q. The only thing it does is how things align in Emacs, but it doesn&#x27;t change the fact that the tags don&#x27;t align when viewing the document with a different text editing software.

                              <span>Hi to everyone, I am new to the forum, and I&#x27;ve enjoyed experimenting with The Archive.app
Has anyone tried using a cloud-based storage system, such as Dropbox, Google Drive, iCloud drive, or MS OneDrive as the place to house their Notes folder for The Archive?
I imagine it will work, but I wonder whether anyone can say from experience how well it works and whether they&#x27;ve encountered any issues.
thanks in advance

                              <span>I was watching a YouTube video by George Hotz @ 49:00. He introduced the distinction of object vs meta level knowledge. He altered it a little to describe it as learning from people vs learning from nature, arguing in favour of spending your time learning from nature.
In a programmers context, he argued spending your time learning React, Javascript etc. is less valuable than learning meta knowledge. Object skills help get a job, but are not timeless like statistics, math, algorithm analysis, physics (ok physics isn&#x27;t timeless but it is until a better theory comes along or assumptions are falsified) etc.
I googled this distinction and came across a LessWrong article titled Object level and Meta level. The topic introduces a distinction between knowledge: the object level and the meta level.…</span>

I&#x27;ve been wanting recently to do some remote development on an OpenBSD server, and TMUX was suggested to me. Is there any point in using TMUX for remote development when you could just use Emacs, Tramp, and Vterm? What about in local development?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been banging my head against this for far too long, so I come asking for some help.
 I want to define an export backend that will allow me to export individual subtrees to some particular format, using information from the relevant subtree properties. But I seem to be missing something and cannot get it to work.
 Here&#x27;s a very simple version of what I&#x27;m trying to accomplish. Given a simple file like this,
 * Heading 1 :PROPERTIES: ????STATUS: foo ????WHEN: today :END: * Heading 2 :PROPERTIES: ????STATUS: bar ????WHEN: yesterday :END: 
 I want to know what to place instead of ????, and how to define a suitable backend, so that:
  
If I call test-backend-export-as-ascii on the a buffer narrowed to the first subtree, I get a buffer whose contents are, say:

 Status as of today is: fo…</span>

                              <span>Hey, I&#x27;m trying to learn Emacs and I have the quest of changing the theme.
 Emacs creates an .emacs~ file automatically.
 I&#x27;ve also created an .emacs file, in both I have
 (add-to-list &#x27;custom-theme-load-path &quot;~/.emacs.d/themes/&quot;)
 But emacs can&#x27;t find shit. Any clue why?
 Edit:
 Somehow the custom-theme-load-path is somewhere else in Program Files instead of %Appdata%/.emacs.d/themes/.
 For someone stumbling across the same problem:
 Emacs\emacs-28.1\share\emacs\28.1\etc\themes
 Edit2:
 Solved by creating init.el instead of .emacs in /%appdata%/.emacs.d
 i.e. /%appdata%/.emacs.d/init.el instead of /%appdata%/.emacs.d/.emacs
 And inside .init.el:
 (add-to-list &#x27;custom-theme-load-path &quot;~/.emacs.d/themes/&quot;)

                              <span>Back in 1993 or 1994 I installed Linux on a home PC for the first time. I think it was Yggdrasil I got my paws on. I had to travel some distance to buy set of cds.
 The servers I had access to at work were huge and powerful but so many people were using them 24/7 that the interaction was slow. 
 Starting Emacs was slow.
 Eventually I got my Pentium PC to run Linux and that was a magical moment. I logged in and started Emacs. I was blown away It just popped up.
 So much power in my hands. 
 Pop forwards to today. I am running Ubuntu on a nice Core9 with 32GB. Immensely powerful. Starting Emacs takes time. How can it be that with all this power it is slower?
 Then last week I installed OpenBSD 7 on a much slower system. I logged in. Installed Emacs. I started it up and --bang-- it is up. Just like in 1993/4. 
 Now this is all using the standard OpenBSD and Ubuntu Emacs packages. With 0 customizations, configs, or anything else.
 My guess would be that if I dug into the packages I would find that the Ubuntu default has more stuff in it.
 It was a nostalgic feeling though.

I got back into reading this July, and would love to take notes while reading philosophy books, i came across zettelkasten while searching for a good note-taking style/method. I would love to get started, but I don’t know how. are there any tips, videos and/or books that i can read or watch as an introduction through zettelkasten?
if you don’t mind me asking, how did you start?</span>

                              <span>Hello, I am a graduate of Applied mathematics and computer science, have been passionate about Haskell for a couple years, it single-handedly got me into programming as a hobby and now I want to connect my professional career with it.
 About my qualifications. I took the MetaLamp education program which included a good set of books, for example Kurt&#x27;s Get Programming with Haskell. In my free time I also read a couple, like Functional design and architecture. Some codewars catas and video courses with tasks were also conquered. I completed two educational projects: multi messenger chat bot and news server. Both projects were reviewed by the company&#x27;s devs. Currently learning Plutus.
 So I am looking for the employer who will be willing to take an young and eager developer into their ranks, preferably on remote basis. I don&#x27;t have a specific technology stack or problem to work on in mind.
 Also worth noting that I am currently in Russia, but relocation to near abroad is possible.

 I click on it, it loads for a second and then nothing. 
 Everything is fine when I type emacs in the terminal.

                              <span>I am very new to Emacs, I see the potential it has, but I want to make sure I can accurately describe it to others. I have made-up my own explanation of Emacs, and I just want to make sure I&#x27;m not saying anything blatantly wrong. 
  
Emacs is more than a text editor, it&#x27;s a Lisp interpreter. Anything you can code with Lisp, you can do in Emacs. Much like how a web browser is just an HTML (&amp; CSS &amp; Javascript) Interpreter. Anything you can write in HTML, you can make a web browser do. 
 However, web browsers are external to your computer. You can use a web browser to edit a photo, but you have to upload the photo, do the edits, and then download the photo again, and that&#x27;s inefficient. Emacs works completely on your system, using your computer&#x27;s resources to their fullest potential. A web browser could never make files or folders on your computer, but Emacs can, and incorporate so much more into your system. 
  
This is the assumption I&#x27;ve managed to get out of my first few days with Emacs. Let me know if I&#x27;m letting some large component out, or if even this is just scratching the surface of what Emacs can do.

                              <span>Hi emacs friends,
 your expertise and wisdom is required.
 Please let me first describe my use case.
 I&#x27;m using electric pair (https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ElectricPair) and my humble init for this is like
 (electric-pair-mode 1) (setq electric-pair-pairs &#x27;((?\{ . ?\}) (?\( . ?\)) (?\[ . ?\]) (?\&quot; . ?\&quot;))) 
 Which is sufficient for coding and simple text. For org-mode however I also want to use the &quot;electric pairing&quot; for &quot;*&quot; (and maybe other markup features in org-mode like &quot;~&quot; for example).
 So I added
 (add-hook &#x27;org-mode-hook (lambda () (setq electric-pair-pairs (append electric-pair-pairs &#x27;((?\* . ?\*)))))) 
 Problem here is that is now set for all the other modes as well which I don&#x27;t want.
 I only want this to be appended for org-mode buffers nothing else.
 Due to a lack of fantasy I don&#x27;t even know how to approach this.
 ​
 Any help is highly appreciated. Thanks for your time guys!

                              <span>At one point I had been using an org file to keep track of my day, but didn&#x27;t really have a strategy. I would have a running org file that started with the week as a header, with some tasks, not really prioritized. I really have a hard time focusing my time to what I actually want to do, and the day just ends up jumbled. I even used pomodoro but haven&#x27;t found a &quot;system&quot; that I can stick to. I&#x27;m really looking for a few strategies that work for different people within org mode that make it easy to visualize and kind of alert me to my daily tasks and stuff I want to focus on, and what needs to be time boxed and re-evaluated (entertainment, non-productive hobbies, &quot;dead&quot; time etc)

                              <span>I have a map m of (string, boolean) and an object obj which contains one field of type string, lets call it x. I want to iterate over the map and set the value of x as one string which is concatenation of all the map keys for which the value is true.
 How can i achieve this without using var?

Dynamic Exception Reporting in Haskell by Matt Parsons

Exceptions kind of suck in Haskell. You don’t get a stack trace. They don’t show up in the types of functions. They incorporate a subtyping mechanism that feels more like Java casting than typical Haskell programming.

                              <span>I often wished to be able to define different boot entries for different uses
of my computer, be it for separating professional and personal use, testing
kernels or using special hardware. NixOS has a unique feature that solves
this problem in a clever way — NixOS specialisations.
A NixOS specialisation is a mechanism to describe additional boot entries
when building your system, with specific changes applied on top of your
non-specialised configuration.

When do you need specialisations
You may have hardware occasionally connected to your computer, and some
of these devices may require incompatible changes to your day-to-day
configuration. Specialisations can create a new boot entry you can use
when starting your computer with your specific hardware connected. This
is common for people wi…</span>

 #+date: %U 
 The %U to be filled with the current date and time.
 I want this to happen for every new .org file I create with Emacs. Is there any way of doing it without using YASnippet?

                              <span>Hallo!
 I&#x27;d like to make a presentation with org and beamer export with a lot of images. When writing beamer tex directly with \usebackgroundtemplate before starting the frame environment.
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; \usebackgroundtemplate{\includegraphics[width &#x3D; \the\paperwidth , height &#x3D; \the\paperheight]{./P8091762.JPG}}
 \begin{frame} ..... &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; Setting the background seems to be the easiest way to achieve what I want? Edit: That is, I want images that take up the whole slide without any margins.
 Is there any way to set the background per slide using org-beamer-mode? Seems I cant insert raw latex between the frame environments with #+latex:, the line will end up inside a frame environment and not work. Can I somehow tell the export to insert the line after closing the environment? Or is there an org-beamer-mode parameter I can set per heading that I missed?

                              <span>Hello to all,
 Currently looking for a new note taking system with pdf&#x27;s, the org-roam + org-roam-bibtex + citar + org-noter combo is perfect.
 However, I have the impression that org-noter is dead, and that using it now will cause me problems later on.
 Moreover, no changes have been made for about 3 years in its github repo..
 Do you have an alternative to org-noter, do you use a fork?
 ​
 Thanks you in advance for yours answers

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I am thinking about releasing a new library which is basically pandas for Haskell. It is built around a data frame type represented as a mapping from column names to column vectors.
 I am looking for suggestions for the name of the library and the name of the datatype.
 Similar existing libraries: tables (Data.Table) and Frames (Frames.Frame).
 My suggestions: 
  
pandas and Data.DataFrame
 hsPandas and Data.DataFrame
 handas and Data.DataFrame
  
Reason: Pandas and its DataFrame type are so ubiquitously used for and associated with the use-cases this library addresses, that I think discoverability of the library would benefit from having pandas in its name.

                              <span>Hey all, I am a Scala user of over a decade and a friend of mine has expressed interest in learning to program. Since we all know FP is the only right way to program I would like to simply start there with them and skip most of the OO stuff. I think the red book might be a bit advanced to start from scratch with, is there any kind of primer that may be more suited to beginners?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve seen a few different ways of binding an akka-http server and then keeping it alive:
 // &quot;v1&quot; val binding &#x3D; Http().newServerAt(host, port).bind(route) StdIn.readLine() // let it run until user presses return binding .flatMap(_.unbind()) // trigger unbinding from the port .onComplete(_ &#x3D;&gt; system.terminate()) // and shutdown when done 
 or
 // &quot;v2&quot; val f &#x3D; for { _  ??? // do Success stuff case Failure(ex) &#x3D;&gt; ??? // do Failure stuff system.terminate() } 
 The first two have a bit of code smell, so I opted for the third, but is there a better way? A prescribed way? How would you do (or how have you done) this in personal or work projects?

I have tried some that I just got from googling, but they are far from what I actually want. For example., any Enums I encounter should be converted to a sealed trait and case objects rather than a plan case class. Duplicate case classes should be avoided and so on. 
 Is there any compatible library already available that can do what I need?

                              <span>If you use Slick, please try 3.4.0-RC3 by changing the version in your build.
 After a week, if no regressions have been reported we will G-d willing release 3.4.0 (final).
 3.4.0 is mostly about moving to a more efficient community-maintained model. A huge number of community-contributed fixes and improvements are included. Furthermore, a ton of work has been put into automating things so that merging pull requests, keeping the documentation website up to date, and cutting releases can be done effortlessly.
 You can see the draft release notes here and the upgrade guide at https://scala-slick.org/doc/prerelease/upgrade.html#upgrade-from-3-3-x-to-3-4-0. The latest docs are at https://scala-slick.org/doc/prerelease/index.html.
 After 3.4.0 is released, the top priority is Scala 3 support, G-d willing. Stefan Zeiger, the original author of Slick, wrote an implementation already, but there is work that still needs to be done to get it ready for consumption. I plan to release the result as 3.5.0.
 After that, I would like to see Slick evolve freely.
 If you would like to get involved, feel free to DM me. Or, help fund Slick by sponsoring me: https://github.com/sponsors/nafg.
 P.S. GitHub Discussions is enabled and there is now a #slick channel on the main Scala Discord: https://discord.gg/yQheBhUtAa

                              <span>I love reading pdf inside emacs, but the annotations don&#x27;t always appear on other pdf readers.
 I&#x27;m studying with a pdf book and do the exercises on the pdf itself (inside a highlight&#x27;s notes usually).
 When I&#x27;m on out only with the phone, I would like to use foxit, and at home Emacs.
 Problem is, foxit doesn&#x27;t show all annotations that I added in emacs and vice-versa. (And sometimes they delete what they don&#x27;t see.)
 Is there a way to fix this?

                              <span>Hi,
 I want to do some scientific writing for fun, for which I want to be able to insert citations and bibliographies directly in org-mode. I don&#x27;t want to use latex and/or render org files in any other format; what I want to achieve is something like:
 * Some text [1] [1] - Full reference from a global bib file 
 where both the numbering and bibliography section are updated on a command/keystroke. I use citar to insert references into org files - that works great - but I have no idea how to generate bibliography and numbering. So far most of the advice I found online was related to rendering bibliography in latex / html, which is not what I need.
 I would be really grateful for some pointers. Thanks!

 const express &#x3D; require(&quot;express&quot;); const app &#x3D; express(); 
 I don&#x27;t get any autocomplete. How do I get it to autocomplete?
 In vscode, app. just works, so what do I need to do?

                              <span>in the config.el i set the minted color to eg &quot;yellow!10&quot; with setq-latex-minted-options.
 I would like to specify that color specifically using rbg instead of the above, how can I do that?

                              <span>A few years ago I was browsing the Evernote forum and I remember a member who described his method of organizing notes by putting all of them into one single folder called &quot;Inbox&quot; and he did not use the folder or tagging feature of the software at all.
 The only thing he did was attaching tags in the title of notes using hash signs (if I recall correctly) or he named the titles in such a way that they included the tags in the title, like so:
 Title of Note #tag #tag2 #tag3 Title of Note2 #tag #tag2 #tag3 Title of Note3 #tag #tag2 #tag3 
 I was thinking about using the same approach. For example, I just want some main headings (computer, health, home, etc..)
  * Computer :computer: ** Manage Your Email in Emacs With Mu4e 
 I would need to tag the second level heading but since I wrote the title in such a way that it contains the tags, does it worth it? The title already includes the relevant tags: email, emacs, and mu4e.
 Similar:
  ** How to Install Apache and PHP on Fedora Linux The keywords apache, php, fedora, and linux are all included in the title 
 This way I can search with swiper or consult-line and find the notes easily. The only thing is to write concise titles that are rich in relevant keywords.
 Of course tags have their own benefit but the more I was thinkering with them the more confused I got.
 What do you think about this approach? I would be curious about your opinion.

 The following shows the 10-day forecast all right, but doesn’t filter out DONE items.

 I&#x27;ve hit metaphorical MOD+x and am seeking info
 I am getting more and more information I need to tabulate, but org tables and the inherent formatting issues (on emacs and Orgzly) are making life difficult.
 I&#x27;m currently using google sheets for my table (and occasional spreadsheet) needs. 
 Does anyone have suggestions for an easier way to tabulate info natively in org-mode?

                              <span>Continuing the theme of me reading Algebra-driven Design, I tried to play around with the quickspec library. I set up a stack project, added quickspec-2.1.5@sha256:very-long-sha to extra-deps, and when I tried to build the thing, I got an error with a suggestion to add twee-lib-2.2@sha256:another-very-long-sha to me extra deps. So I did, and right now I&#x27;m getting this:
 Twee/Term.hs:92:28: error: Ambiguous occurrence &#x27;singleton&#x27; It could refer to either &#x27;Twee.Term.Core.singleton&#x27;, -- stuff here or &#x27;Data.List.singleton&#x27;, -- more stuff here 
 and the same in several other places when stack tries to build twee-lib. I have no fancy compiler options enabled, the whole stack config is pretty basic. Is anyone able to use this lib? What am I missing?

 This code compiles fine in ghci.
 func :: (Num a) &#x3D;&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; a func a b &#x3D; a + b func&#x27; :: (Num a) &#x3D;&gt; a -&gt; a func&#x27; &#x3D; func f f :: Integral a &#x3D;&gt; a f &#x3D; 2 
 But this gives an error saying,
  * Could not deduce (Integral a) arising from a use of &#x60;f&#x27; from the context: Num a bound by the type signature for: func&#x27; :: forall a. Num a &#x3D;&gt; a -&gt; a at test.hs:6:1-26 Possible fix: add (Integral a) to the context of the type signature for: func&#x27; :: forall a. Num a &#x3D;&gt; a -&gt; a * In the first argument of &#x60;func&#x27;, namely &#x60;f&#x27; In the expression: func f In an equation for func&#x27;: func&#x27; &#x3D; func f | 7 | func&#x27; &#x3D; func f | ^ 
 But if I change the second function as,
 func :: (Num a) &#x3D;&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; a func a b &#x3D; a + b func&#x27; :: (Integral a) &#x3D;&gt; a -&gt; a func&#x27; &#x3D; func f f :: Integral a &#x3D;&gt; a f &#x3D; 2 
 This compiles fine.
 I was expecting the second snippet to work, cause an Integral Instance is a Num Instance. Why can I pass a Num Instance to a function expecting Integral Instance (First code snippet), Since a Num Instance may or may not be an Integral Instance.
 Assuming I cannot pass an Integral Instance to a Num Instance, why did the third code snippet not throw an error? clearly func expects a Num Instance while it is given f which returns an Integral Instance.
 Any blogs or video links about the Haskell type system and how the type hierarchy works which addresses issues like this would be helpful. Relevant answers are also welcomed Ofcourse.

                              <span>I am curious to understand in what way, and also to what extent one could make theorem proving in Haskell. If I understand well, Haskell is not exactly implementing System F, since we can have non-halting functions. But on the other hand, can the halting of a function for another reason than laziness constitute a proof for the theorem corresponding to its type? I also wonder how can one implement the existential quantifier.

                              <span>Just in time for the start of the school year, I&#x27;m happy to announce the public release of hwtest, a Scala 3 library for problem sets (generically, &quot;homeworks&quot;). This is a near-total rewrite of a homegrown system I&#x27;ve been using with students since 2013.
 The basic idea is that the teacher creates some problems to solve, and some test cases for those problems. The students then implement the functions and can check their work against the test cases.
 A starter file might look like this: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; object hwExample extends hwtest.hw(&quot;CS123&quot;): def userName &#x3D; ??? 
 def square(x: Int): Int &#x3D; ???
 test(&quot;square&quot;, square, &quot;x&quot;) 
 def isOdd(n: Int): Boolean &#x3D; ??? ignoretest(&quot;isOdd&quot;, isOdd, &quot;n&quot;)  The student would fill in their name  def userName &#x3D; &quot;Margaret Hamilton&quot;  and then take a stab at the first function  def square(x: Int): Int &#x3D; x * x  Then run their code to check their work:  Margaret Hamilton Data source: hwExample.tests (remote) Begin testing square at Tue Aug 16 10:12:48 EDT 2022 ..... Passed 5/5 tests in 0.71 seconds. ***** Ignoring tests for isOdd.  Next they change the &#x60;ignoretest&#x60; to &#x60;test&#x60;, and take a stab at the second function. Re-running the code, they get  CS123: hwExample (hwtest 1.0.0) Margaret Hamilton Data source: hwExample.tests (remote) Begin testing square at Tue Aug 16 10:15:22 EDT 2022 ..... Passed 5/5 tests in 0.44 seconds. Begin testing isOdd at Tue Aug 16 10:15:23 EDT 2022 .... Test #5 *** FAILED *** n &#x3D; -21 Expected answer: true Received answer: false Passed 4/5 tests in 0.09 seconds. &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Obviously, we also want our students to learn how to make their own tests, so I wouldn&#x27;t use this ALL the time, but it works great for less experienced students who are learning to program.

                              <span>In the chapter 4, Binary Search, of the book &quot;Algorithm Design with Haskell&quot;, it says &quot;if f is a strictly increasing function, x &lt; f(x+1)&quot;. I do not understand that, because if I choose the square root, a strictly increasing function, as f, then this property does not hold.
 Can someone explain? Thanks.
 p/s: I created an issued on the author&#x27;s github repo https://github.com/jmgimeno/algorithm-design-with-haskell/issues/1
 Edit: my mistake, the GitHub repo is not from the author.
 Edit: sorry everyone, my mistake again, I missed the point that the domain and codomain of f are natural numbers.
 Edit: Thank you everyone. I think I understand the reasoning now. Because the domain and codomain are natural numbers, f can only increase its argument, so x &lt; f(x) &lt; f(x+1)

                              <span>... in a real-world (non-toy) setting?
 As toy-projects I consider the infamous quick-sort or primes example or stuff like unlimited queues. They are nice indeed, but shouldn&#x27;t be used to sell a language (so quick-sort and primes died in defending success at all costs).
 I sometimes use lazy eval to calculate small ad-hoc lists on-the-fly (which are mostly optimized out by GHC magic) to feed them to various functions, but otherwise I think I don&#x27;t benefit from lazy eval really? Mostly I hate that I don&#x27;t like when GHC magic kicks in and when not?
 Do I need to learn Core to write performant Haskell (because I didn&#x27;t have to learn intermediate compiler languages when I used OCaml, Java or Python)?
 Cheers.

I&#x27;m pretty sure theres a function for it and I can map through the entire image and get the values. Which function would that be and what is the syntax for it?

                              <span>I am getting into some complicated class instances and would find it useful to be able to share a constraint alias and an instance definition.
 Example &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; class Abc a b where ...

 instance Def a b where ...
 instance Def a b &#x3D;&gt; Abc (Vector a) (b,(b,b)) where ... &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Is there a extension or syntax that allows this?

                              <span>I know this might seem like a weird place to ask about Scala, but please hear me out. 
 In the past, I&#x27;ve seen various comments about how Scala 2&#x27;s type system was not sound, and several other scathing remarks from, eg Edward Kmett. See this quora post or this reddit comment for instance. 
 I&#x27;m curious if Scala 3 has overcome some of these difficulties, especially with how implicits have been reworked and enums have been introduced to implement ADTs. 
 Beyond that, I&#x27;m wondering how folks feel about Scala coming from Haskell. For the simple case, I like how close it looks to Python, which I write for work, but I worry that encoding of some abstractions is just plastered on -- I wasn&#x27;t very encouraged by Zio and Cats examples, I saw, for instance. Perhaps that&#x27;s just owing to a syntax as light-weight as Haskells, though?

                              <span>Hello, I&#x27;ve been lurking here as a non-dev, to try and absorb some technical knowledge about Haskell and what the community is working on and discussing. 
 Have also been researching smart contracts on Eth and trying to understand the possible implications of allowances, and spending permissions, say for staking on ERC20 tokens. 
 I was directed to some chain explorers to find and revoke these permissions on Eth. 
 Wondering a few things in relation to ADA. Does the function of staking and eUTXO make smart contract risks, or allowances any different than on other chains? 
 Are there any sort of tools or contract checkers on ADA for lookups? 
 Hopefully this isn&#x27;t an annoying or improper post. I understand Haskell is used for many other applications, but my question is ADA specific.

 Did anything changed in that area since Cabal-install 1.x? Back then I&#x27;ve used sandboxes local to a project which could be at least manually swept out, a crude but safe way. Can&#x27;t find that feature in 3.x versions. Now everything goes to cabal/store which bloats ad infinitum and can&#x27;t find any suggestion in user docs how to alleviate this problem. Any idea?

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently self-studying Haskell because it has long interested me to write pure functional code due to the guarantees on no side effects. 
 The concepts in themselves that I have learned till now are moderate on difficulty level. Things that I have studied till now are higher order programming, currying of functions, algebraic data types, map, filter etc. I have been following this course and doing the assignements and have done the first 3 of them : https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis1940/spring13/lectures.html
 The topics I have encountered but don&#x27;t feel very confident about are : how the laziness of Haskell works, estimating time/space complexity of functions that I&#x27;m writing. 
 My main concern is how do I go about reasoning about how efficient the functions that I&#x27;m writing are. In imperative languages like Java, C++ etc.. it&#x27;s so straightforward but it feels very tedious to think about in Haskell. Any tips on how to improve in this topic would be helpful.

                              <span>Does anyone experience rare hiccups using emacs. For example maybe once a day when writing, the cursor or a command might freeze for a second. I know it&#x27;s really nothing major, just bothers me a bit and i&#x27;m wondering if this is a common occurrence with emacs or is it just my system. It can happen more often when folding-unfolding headers in an org file, just a small delay (~1sec) at random, for the action to perform. Not searching for the magic solution, just wanted to see if it is just me or if i might be doing something wrong.
 Thanks for taking the time to read this.
 P.S. My config is really minimal, just the colorscheme, ivy, haskell mode, yasnippet, auctex and my key maps. Also my pc is 7 yo but its more than capable of running intense tasks, and i think vanilla Emacs isn&#x27;t one of them.

                              <span>As an INTP I know a big reason I love emacs is that it has this immense depth and complexity in the way it can be expanded and customized. I recently got to watching a video comparing INTJ&#x27;s and INTPs in computer programming, and some of the points the youtube creator made had me pondering if emacs use skews more heavily into any particular typing. 
 Clearly not the type of thing I&#x27;ll be able to easily google so I figured might as well make an informal ask on the sub. 
 So if you&#x27;re aware of mbti and care at all, what is your type?

                              <span>Hi there,
 I am an Emacs newbie coming from vim. So far I really like the Emacs experience! However, I still struggle with a very simple task: I like having an internal border around my frame, which I set via the default-frame-alist list. While that works fine I am not able to automatically adjust the internal-frame color to the theme&#x27;s background color. I can do it manually buy using
 (defun my/adjust_internal_border_color () &quot;Adjust the internal border color to match the theme&#x27;s background color&quot; (custom-set-faces! &#x27;(internal-border :background &quot;#FAFAFA&quot; ;; (format &quot;%s&quot; (upcase (prin1-to-string ((car (cdr (assoc &#x27;bg doom-themes--colors))))))) ;; (car (cdr (assoc &#x27;bg doom-themes--colors))) )) ) 
 Though, when I try to do it automatically by using one of the commented lines above instead of the color string, I get a Wrong type argument: strings, ... error. I guess this is due to my very poor knowledge of Lisp and probably very easy to fix. Maybe one of you can help me out?
 Many thanks in advance!

 Hi, this is my first Emacs package! It provides a transient wrapper for the qpdf command-line tool aimed especially at users of pdf-tools or at least DocView. With it one can, for example, remove/reorder/split/rotate pages of a pdf file, merge pdf files, remove annotations, and apply a range of transformations to a pdf file. See the qpdf documentation.
 I used this package to learn transient, so it may also be helpful for people looking to do the same. Comments and suggestions are most welcome. For example, I wonder if I should and how I could define custom suffix classes for better handling qpdf arguments like --collate[&#x3D;n] which are a switch but also optionally take a value, or complex ones like --overlay file [options] --?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve decided to give Emacs one last try, but need exact instructions for the following simple feature.
 You click a button / press a hotkey, choose a folder (not a file!), and Emacs opens up an Emacs window with a tree view of that folder&#x27;s contents. In this tree view, folders are expandable and collapsible. Clicking files in this tree-view opens them as buffers for editing in the main window. 
 In other words, I want the same basic experience as in Kate or VS Code when you click &quot;open folder&quot;.
 Please don&#x27;t answer with just &quot;projectile&quot; or &quot;dired&quot;. I need exact, detailed, reproducible steps, or an Elisp script. What to put into init.el after I install the packages, which hotkeys to map, how to make it all work together. Because last time I rage quit Emacs after spending a ton of time, and seeing that the different plugins (Ivy, Projectile, Treemacs) didn&#x27;t synchronize with each other.
 Or just tell me that Emacs can&#x27;t do that, so I don&#x27;t ever spend any time on it &#x3D;)
 Thank you

                              <span>Hey all,
 I&#x27;m trying to hack org-mode so that citations appear more compact unless I navigate into them for editing. In particular, I want citations to display as [@] ordinarily, but to show the full [cite:@supermegalongcitekey2000; etc...] when point enters the citation.
 I feel like I&#x27;ve seen this behaviour somewhere else in the org ecosystem, though it escapes me right now. Anyone know how to achieve this, or can point to a package doing this kind of thing? :)
 Edit: Got it! 🎉 Thanks for rubber-ducking dear reader.

                              <span>Hi all! I’ve spent last two years working on a lightweight library for configuring a http client and http server to communicate over tls/ssl. I have tested it with over 40+ http clients for java, scala and kotlin. The core library contains only one transitive dependency, slf4j-api, and the remaining part only uses the available classes within the jdk.
 In the past I was required to configure a http client with different configurations depending on the project requirements, such as:
  
One way authentication
 Two way authentication
 Using multiple truststores and keystores
 Using pem files
 Reloading ssl
  
To make it easy to reuse for myself and everyone I thought it would be good to make a library out of it and also contribute back to the community. I wanted to hide all the verbosity away and just provide easy to use builder methods without needing to know how to create SSLContext, KeyManager, TrustManager etc. I initially posted it on the java channel, but I thought it could also be intresting for scala developers. Hope you guys like it. Feel free to send my some critiques!

                              <span>Hello, I have a file notes.org which holds all my notes that I&#x27;m willing to keep for long term. Beside that, I would like to store temporary notes that I probably remove at some point. I would like to put the temporary notes in a separate file. I was thinking in creating a temp.org or misc.org file, even though I&#x27;m not sure if the names are okay. Do you use any naming for a notebook that works more like a temporary notebook for you?

 I tried emacs out in the late 90s, and gave up because I couldn&#x27;t remap &#x60;C-x&#x60; to &#x60;&#x27;next-line&#x60; (I still use WordStar keybindings, mock away). I thought I&#x27;d try again. It&#x27;s been 25 years. Surely you can re-map &#x60;C-x&#x60; by now? It even has evil-mode, so it might work.
 It doesn&#x27;t work. At least I can&#x27;t get it to work.
 It works fine if I open a file and do normal stuff. As soon as I try to use &#x60;counsel-describe-function&#x60; or really almost anything in the mini-buffer at all... blamo. &#x60;C-x&#x60; is mapped to something else, and I get &#x60;Key Sequence C-x X starts with non-prefix key C-x&#x60; 
 So, is there a way to fix this? Or should I just try again in 25 years?

                              <span>I already have the C-z binding disabled. But I was debugging a problem with my init file which hadn&#x27;t loaded completely, had the problem halfway solved but then accidentally suspended the Emacs GUI. Now I have to restart Emacs and redo that work for no good reason.
 Being able to suspend Emacs from a terminal makes sense, but why does this feature exist at all when running it in a GUI? If anything, it seems like some kind of practical joke.
 There doesn&#x27;t seem to be any way to recover the previous state of the program. I already tried all the suggestions on this page.
 I&#x27;m sure I can&#x27;t be the first to complain about this. Would a bug report be a waste of time?

                              <span>I like Steve Purcell&#x27;s SanityInc Tomorrow themes, but would like something between night and bright.
 I copied emacs/.local/elpa/color-theme-sanityinc-tomorrow-20220412.1643/sanityinc-tomorrow-night-theme.el and ./emacs/.local/elpa/color-theme-sanityinc-tomorrow-20220412.1643/color-theme-sanityinc-tomorrow.el to ~/.config/doom/themes and added my- to each. I then added a color definition I called dusk to my-color-theme-sanityinc-tomorrow.el:
  69c69,82  &#x27;((dusk . ((background . &quot;#1d1f21&quot;) &gt; (alt-background . &quot;#151515151515&quot;) &gt; (current-line . &quot;#2a2a2a&quot;) &gt; (selection . &quot;#424242&quot;) &gt; (foreground . &quot;#eaeaea&quot;) &gt; (comment . &quot;#969896&quot;) &gt; (red . &quot;#d54e53&quot;) &gt; (orange . &quot;#e78c45&quot;) &gt; (yellow . &quot;#e7c547&quot;) &gt; (green . &quot;#b9ca4a&quot;) &gt; (aqua . &quot;#70c0b1&quot;) &gt; (blue . &quot;#7aa6da&quot;) &gt; (purple . &quot;#c397d8&quot;))) &gt; (night . ((background . &quot;#1d1f21&quot;) 1651c1664  (defun my-color-theme-sanityinc-tomorrow (mode) 1676a1690,1695 &gt; (defun color-theme-sanityinc-tomorrow-dusk () &gt; &quot;Apply the tomorrow dusk theme.&quot; &gt; (interactive) &gt; (my-color-theme-sanityinc-tomorrow &#x27;dusk)) &gt; 
 And created this my-sanityinc-tomorrow-dusk-theme.el:  (add-load-path! &quot;/Users/aqjo/.config/doom/themes&quot;) (require &#x27;my-color-theme-sanityinc-tomorrow) (color-theme-sanityinc-tomorrow-dusk) 
 Despite my having defined it as shown above, the latest error I&#x27;m getting is Symbol&#x27;s function definition is void: color-theme-sanityinc-tomorrow-dusk.
 I feel like I might be making this more difficult than it needs to be. Is there a simple way to define a theme with the colors I want without all the intricacies that are in this set of themes?
 In fact, I might use afternoon or dark+ if I could make the alt-background (I think it is) more prominent.
 Thanks

                              <span>I am most sure that I am not using correct terms while asking this question because I don&#x27;t even know what the correct terms are. Maybe you can help as you read my question.
 I have encountered so many hooks in Emacs for different types buffers. Like ielm-mode-hook, term-mode-hook, text-mode-hook, prog-mode-hook. Sure there must be many more.
 While disabling or enabling some features using these hooks I am never sure if I have enabled or disabled it on all the hooks.
 Like I want to add line numbers to any &quot;text non-I/O&quot; buffers. By this mean only buffers where I write text or code but do not run REPL or any interactive tools. Are text-mode-hook and prog-mode-hook enough? Am I missing some other hooks?
 What if I want to add some function to &quot;interactive I/O&quot; buffers like REPLs, terminals, or other interactive tools? Like if I have line numbers enabled by default but I want to disable them in interactive buffers like this, is it enough to hook that function to term-mode-hook and ielm-mode-hook? Am I missing any other hooks?
 Is there a full list of hooks somewhere? At least the built-in ones? Is there some categorizing of those hooks like these ones are just for writing text and these ones are for interactive buffers?

                              <span>Hello, the use-package documentation says that when any of the following keywords are used: :commands, :bind, :bind*, :bind-keymap, :bind-keymap*, :mode, :interpreter, or :hook the packages get deferred automatically.
 I have corfu and cape and none of them contain any of those keywords:
  (use-package corfu :init (global-corfu-mode) :custom (corfu-auto t) (corfu-cycle t) (corfu-auto-prefix 1) (corfu-auto-delay 0.1) (corfu-quit-no-match &#x27;separator) (corfu-excluded-modes &#x27;(org-mode mu4e-compose-mode))) (use-package cape :init (add-to-list &#x27;completion-at-point-functions #&#x27;cape-dabbrev) (add-to-list &#x27;completion-at-point-functions #&#x27;cape-file)) 
 I don&#x27;t think corfu is something I need right when Emacs starts up so I think it is safe to defer both corfu and cape manually with :defer t right?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been using Emacs for a couple of years, slowly learning and tuning up my config. I was trying to fix a bug using emacs -Q and then evaluating a minimal elisp block to load the locations of installed packages, but I found I was getting an error when evaluating (package-initialize). 
  
 I&#x27;m now on Emacs 27.2, and I&#x27;ve found out that apparently (package-initialize) isn&#x27;t required for v&gt;27.0. If that&#x27;s the case, my first config.org block for packages must be a little incorrect. Here it is:

                              <span>I want to add a bunch of php files that are in a directory into an org document as separate code blocks. This is what I want to achieve:
 #+begin_src html :tangle &quot;/sudo::/srv/http/01.php&quot;  #+end_src #+begin_src html :tangle &quot;sudo::/srv/http/02.php&quot;  #+end_src 
 The idea is to have an org document with the php code imbedded. Then it is easy to create the website from one org document by running org-babel-tangle. Right now I&#x27;m using a bash code block to create results:
 #+name: php-files #+BEGIN_SRC bash :results output cd $HOME/Downloads/; for f in *; do echo &quot;#+begin_src html :tangle &#x27;/sudo::/srv/http/$f&#x27;&quot; paste /dev/null -  ,#+end_src ,#+begin_src html :tangle &#x27;/sudo::/srv/http/02.php&#x27;  #+end_example 
 This output is almost what I want. Except the comma prefixes (default behavior of code blocks ) and single quote instead of double quote. (the double quotes can be generated by the bash script. I will figure this out later).
 At the moment I am using a keyboard macro to remove the , and overwrite &#x27; with &quot;. This can also be done by evil mode. My question is if there are other ways to create these code block outputs? Preferably the code should be part of the org document, to make the document portable.

                              <span>In my git tree I have a commit 3a3fbf96ce at HEAD. From the command line I can create a patch for just that commit as follows:
 $ git format-patch &quot;3a3fbf96ce^&quot;
 or even:
 $ git format-patch &quot;HEAD^&quot;
 I can&#x27;t for the life of me figure out how to do this in Magit UI.
 When I Meta-Space on the one commit it gets highlighted, but W c still prompts me for a revision and I don&#x27;t know what to type at that point (3a3fbf96ce^ doesn&#x27;t work, unlike the command line).
 Note that W c does a great job creating multiple patches from a selected range of revisions. It is this &quot;single commit&quot; patch workflow that I can&#x27;t figure out.
 I&#x27;m running Magit 20220722.345 [&gt;&#x3D; 3.3.0-git], Git 2.35.1, Emacs 29.0.50, gnu/linux

                              <span>I have been practicing alot lately and was doing good with Scala arrays, lists and maps. But this new topic was all new to me, which is Tree topic. I&#x27;m stuck with this question and found no solution.
 object MTree {} trait MTree { def oddChildren: Boolean } case object Zero extends MTree { override def oddChildren: Boolean &#x3D; ??? } case class One(key: Int, child: MTree) extends MTree { override def oddChildren: Boolean &#x3D; ??? } case class Two(key: Int, c1: MTree, c2: MTree) extends MTree { override def oddChildren: Boolean &#x3D; ??? } case class Three(key: Int, c1: MTree, c2: MTree, c3: MTree) extends MTree { override def oddChildren: Boolean &#x3D; ??? } val t1 &#x3D; Three(0, One(5,Zero), Three(7, Zero, One(6, Three(2,One(5,Zero), One(7,Zero), Zero)), One(3,One(2,Zero))), One(1,Zero)) assert(t1.oddChildren &#x3D;&#x3D; true) val t2 &#x3D; Three(0, One(5,Zero), Three(7, Zero, One(6, Three(2,One(5,Zero), One(7,Zero), Zero)), Two(3,Zero,Zero)), One(1,Zero)) assert(t2.oddChildren &#x3D;&#x3D; false) 
 Any help how I should read this output and how to actually know the oddChildren?

                              <span>My note: Selection functions are interesting notion with tricky implementation
 The notion of selection functions is simple: scala type J[R, A] &#x3D; (A &#x3D;&gt; R) &#x3D;&gt; A  We have the evaluation function A &#x3D;&gt; R that tells how to judge an object. And we receive back &quot;the best&quot; object (possible options are embodied).
 The topic is being actively researched. And papers are not simple sometimes to start from scratch. I tried to make an introduction that will help to do the first steps.
 For instance, it was not so easy to understand (and implement, for sure) product to combine selections: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;scala def product[R, A]: List[J[R, A]] &#x3D;&gt; J[R, List[A]] &#x3D;
 (functions: List[J[R, A]]) &#x3D;&gt;
 (listEval: List[A] &#x3D;&gt; R) &#x3D;&gt;
 functions match {
 case evalFun :: restEvalFunctions &#x3D;&gt;
 val a: A &#x3D;
 evalFun((candidate: A) &#x3D;&gt;
 listEval(
 candidate ::
 product
 .apply(restEvalFunctions)
 .apply(
 restCandidates &#x3D;&gt;
 listEval(candidate :: restCandidates)
 )
 )
 ) 
  val as: List[A] &#x3D; product(restEvalFunctions)(rest &#x3D;&gt; listEval(a :: rest)) a :: as case Nil &#x3D;&gt; Nil } 
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 And the product is really useful. Playing games (like chess) or graph searches ofter really represent picking some &quot;best&quot; state.
 I hope somebody will find it useful.
 Thank you!

                              <span>Probably a nooby question, but I&#x27;m quite new to systems design. What is the point of things like Kafka if large applications usually have databases anyway? For example, why can&#x27;t microservices just talk to each other by putting records into a database like Cassandra, and reading those records from another microservice?

                              <span>I&#x27;m wondering about the trajectory of my zettelkasting. Am I just wandering around? Do I have a coherent path? I&#x27;ve been thinking about my ZK, whether it supports my goals, and if I&#x27;m feeding it appropriately. Maybe this is something I shouldn&#x27;t worry about. Does this resonate with you?
What are my feelings about my zettelkasting?
Please open up and share with the community what you&#x27;ve been working on and your plans for your zettelkasting this week.
This past week found me doing:
A deep dive into structured python programming. I&#x27;m using my &#x27;Rakusu Ring spreadsheet&#x27; as a foil for this project.
I received the course syllabus for &#x27;ENGL 463 Geographies of Nonfiction&#x27;, which has a hybrid writing and literature structure. I&#x27;ve started pouring the foundation in my ZK for this 20-week project: nine books, a dozen short stories, and a half dozen writing assignments. I started reading a couple of weeks ago, but now I must pour gas on the fire and read a lot.
Refactored my Keyboard Maestro note templates. I simplified them and made them more broadly applicable.
My current plans for this coming week:
Class starts on the 23rd, and I have seven more books to read in preparation. Lots of reading ahead with little time for zettelkasting.


When I&#x27;m procrastinating class work/reading, I&#x27;ll be reading:



Here are a few of the titles and one-sentence summaries of zettel I created last week.
I&#x27;m excited about &quot;Literate Programming,&quot; Donald Knuth&#x27;s thesis on this programming paradigm has arrived at the library on interlibrary loan. I&#x27;ll pick it up on Tuesday.

 foldl: (b -&gt; a -&gt; b) -&gt; b -&gt; [a] -&gt; b
 Why on earth are these function signatures different? 😭 
 You could simply keep the signatures exactly the same for both, without affecting the function body, nor the output. But having different signatures means if you swap from using a foldr to a foldl, you have to swap your own function that it calls too. 
 I don&#x27;t see the point.

 value1 :: T value1 &#x3D; D (C (Right (6, 9))) False value2 :: U value2 &#x3D; B (Just (E F)) 
 My Idea was something like this
 data T &#x3D; D T Boolean | C T | Right (Integer, Integer) | Left Boolean data U &#x3D; B U | Just U | Nothing | E U | F 
 but I only get this error
  Ambiguous occurrence &#x60;Just&#x27; It could refer to either &#x60;Prelude.Just&#x27;, imported from &#x60;Prelude&#x27; at 07haskelexampel.hs:1:1 (and originally defined in &#x60;GHC.Maybe&#x27;) or &#x60;Main.Just&#x27;, defined at 07haskelexampel.hs:5:16 
 So how do I actually implement these types?

                              <span>Hello. I have a stream of data which is mostly sensor readings, and would like to make a Haskell program to visualize those readings in real time. Some I would display in pretty much their raw value as text, some maybe in a bar graph, gauges probably... I&#x27;m not sure what exactly yet, and am happy to adjust to the library if worthwhile.
 Think of it as similar to a dashboard. No human input (mouse, keyboard...) present.
 The graphics library does not have to be super tailored for exactly that use case, if I have to come up with the &quot;widgets&quot; myself that&#x27;s okay. But then it should have a reasonable set of drawing primitives, e.g. for boxes and rendering text.
 Direct output to framebuffer preferred, but if it only works under X it&#x27;s not a dealbreaker. The output display is fixed resolution and the graphics would always be displayed full screen, so no real need for resizing or dynamic scale, distances and so on.

                              <span>Hey everyone, I want to ask for some guidance/opinions.
 I’m currently a “Data Scientist” with a decade of experience in statistics, analytics, machine learning, etc. But lately I’ve been exploring the possibility of switching paths towards a more engineering kind of thing. At least for a while, I’d like something where I get to focus more on writing good, tested, maintainable, reusable code (things that are valued but not prioritized in DS). I feel that focusing on those things would make me a better professional even if I decide to come back to a DS/ML job later.
 And it would be great to be able to use more Scala and FP (something that I get to do only rarely in my area, since Python is lingua franca).
 I guess that Data Engineer would be the most feasible role to switch into, since there is some intersection/synergy with the job experience I already have… although maybe not that much...
 So my question is, based on your experience actually working as engineers… do you think this is feasible? Are there some areas that I should focus on strengthening before being able to attempt this? Would I have to start at a junior role, or is my experience in DS/ML pertinent enough for me to aspire to a higher seniority?
 I know that this is pretty unorthodox, but hell, if it makes me enjoy my day to day work even more, then I think it’s worth considering. I just want to know how realistic this all is :P

                              <span>Scala is a great programming language for data related tasks. A good, Arrow-backed, dependency free DataFrame library would be a great way to make Scala even better for data programming. Spark is great for big data, but Scala would benefit from having a DataFrame library for small data tasks as well.
 I&#x27;ll quote one of the commentors in a recent thread I created: &quot;The real problem is that we have no simple alternative for Pandas and numpy&quot;
 I&#x27;d be happy to collaborate with someone on this effort if you&#x27;re interested. I am a dev advocate and am already working with the creators of Polars and DataFusion, two Rust based DataFrame libraries, to help them grow their projects. Interested if the community thinks this is a good idea. I don&#x27;t have the coding skills to build an Arrow-based Scala DataFrame lib myself, but would be happy to help out with the project evangelism.

                              <span>Hello, I want to create org headings that have these two properties attached:
 * Heading :PROPERTIES: :Created: [2022-08-13 Sat 23:41] :Modified: [2022-08-13 Sat 23:52] :END: Content of heading .. .. 
 Having these allow me to sort notes and stuff by recent modification date if I ever need.
 I just don&#x27;t know how to automate the updating of the :modified: field. Let&#x27;s say my cursor is inside the heading. I need something that searches backwards and updates the first occurence of :modified: and updates it with current date and time.
 I was wondering if anyone knows a package that offers such functionality?

                              <span>Hey everyone,
 I&#x27;m curious: I know that there exist many exporting features to sync org-mode agendas as calendar files (.ics etc...) to view your agenda in a calendar GUI. However, what I&#x27;m curious about (and wish to find) is a package which displays your org-mode agenda in an org table calendar? So that you don&#x27;t have to export anything. It would all be displayed in an emacs buffer with a table layout and links to agenda events? Does this exist?
 I figured since I&#x27;m doing almost everything in emacs now for organization, why not include a calendar view as well?

                              <span>Software monoliths are sort of an older way of building software, and making things small and single purpose has been Linux wisdom the Unix Philosophy that is usually right. Emacs is the biggest threat to hypocrisy here, since it can itself be considered a huge monolith that does everything. Aside from that, however, there are other remarkable monoliths (giant pieces of software with huge code-bases and broad functionality) in the emacs ecosystem, some of which are so big and established and useful that they are hard to replace. What are some of your favorites, and what do they do that is hard to replace for you?
 Here are some of mine:
  
Org-mode. It&#x27;s breadth is actually part of its value-proposition with literate programming in many languages, publication to a plethora of outputs, and rich note-taking (code notebook-style) to an extent unreached by any other tool of which I&#x27;m aware. Plus it&#x27;s really good for actually taking tech/class notes.
 Gnus. Letting me easily* do email across many addresses in emacs, and integrating well with the related monolith...
 BBDB. It has great support for all manner of contacts and, apparently, all sorts of exports, with prevalent and rich interfaces.
 Helm. Really a swiss-army knife of completion, but there have been a plethora of lighter more specific altervatives in the past few years. Nonetheless, my students loved the ease and &quot;do it all&quot; made possible by Helm.

 After some package update, my HD has started to fill with .~undo-tree~ files. I cannot find in the documentation of the package a way to tell undo-tree to put all the files in a directory (like the usual emacs ~ files).
 Does anyone has a solution?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hello, if I add this to my Emacs config does it cause anything wrong to the functioning of Emacs? I think forcing a GC beside the normal GC shouldn&#x27;t cause any issue, especially because when I force it is when the Emacs frame is not in focus.
 (add-hook &#x27;focus-out-hook &#x27;garbage-collect) 
 I also have Emacs set to save the file when the frame is out of focus, but I think the two shouldn&#x27;t collide.

                              <span>I am curious what your strategies/approaches are for using a literate org config.
 Currently I have the following in my init.el:
 elisp (require &#x27;org) (org-babel-load-file (expand-file-name &quot;/path/to/config.org&quot;)) 
 My whole configuration resides in a single, separate org file, including the early-init part (which is tangled to a separate early-init.el file in user-emacs-directory).
 Whilst this mostly works fine, this approach gives me issues when I try to use the latest version of org-mode via straight.el. I believe this is caused by the fact that I&#x27;m loading the built-in org version in init.el, and then trying to load/use an updated version in config.org (which causes some void variable errors for me).
 Alternative strategies are to put something like (load-file &quot;config.el&quot;) in init.el, and tangle config.org manually or on save.
 Just curious how you all are using your literate org config file, and whether there is anyone who was able to solve/avoid the issue with org that I&#x27;m having (I could stick to the built-in version, but I would like to be able to use the latest version).

 It seems like it&#x27;d work to me, but I&#x27;m getting an error:

 I have two questions here. One, how do I solve this (ofc). And two, why is this happening? I have a vague idea, but I&#x27;m not entirely sure. Thank u.

 ​
 I have been searching for good category theory books because I read that category theory can help you understand Haskells type system.
 ​
 So I was wondering if any of you can point to any books or papers where I can learn category theory and about Haskells type system and their intersection. thanks

 I&#x27;ve been working on this for some days now and I&#x27;ve got the basic framework. It is still very nascant and has a big enough TODO list. It would be awesome to have some feedback on how it looks so far.
 Cheers !

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking for beginner/intermediate courses (paid preferably (by employer)) and I like learning in the video format. I found the video courses at https://mmhaskell.com/courses but not really any reviews or feedback around it. So was wondering if any of you taken some of the &quot;mmmhaskell courses&quot; and in that case, you would recommend it or do you know some better paid video course you could recommend?

                              <span>I transitioned to (vanilla) Emacs two months ago, after using Vim for the last 8 years or so---I&#x27;m loving it!
 I also forced myself out of the comfort zone and practiced plain Emacs keybinding, and I&#x27;m quite comfortable with it.
 However, the only thing I miss from (Neo)vim as an ex-vimmer is C-o and C-i to jump back and forth.
 I found this better-jumper package and tried to use it: emacs-lisp (use-package better-jumper :ensure t :init (better-jumper-mode 1) :config (define-key input-decode-map &quot;\\C-i&quot; \[C-i\]) :bind ((&quot;C-o&quot; . &#x27;better-jumper-jump-backward) (&quot;C-i&quot; . &#x27;better-jumper-jump-forward)))  But it doesn&#x27;t seem to automatically record positions. For instance, I want to move back to where I was after I C-M-. via C-o.
 Is there a way to automatically do this without full-fledged Doom emacs or evil-mode?
 I&#x27;m fine with cherry-picking only this feature from evil-mode, btw.
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hi!
 Yes, this is another post about someone switching editors. I know, there are a lot, but I think those are important because that kind of posts drove my decisions in the past.
 I move constantly between editors (Vim &#x3D;&gt; Emacs &#x3D;&gt; Neovim &#x3D;&gt; Emacs &#x3D;&gt; Neovim &#x3D;&gt; Vscode (1 day) &#x3D;&gt; Neovim &#x3D;&gt; ...). The only thing that is nonnegotiable is modal editing.
 Last time I switched from Emacs because of the **huge** amount of time it takes to open (no, I do not like emacsclient). IIRC, it was taking 8s to start in my machine. Hence, I migrate to Neovim and Lua.
 Neovim is a fantastic project! Lua will bring it to a new level! However, I started to miss a GUI and some polished tools I had in Emacs. All GUIs in Neovim are almost a terminal in a graphical application. It really does not add something new. Furthermore, since Lua integration is relatively new, I often find some rough edges. 99% can be fixed relatively easily. However, I just do not have time anymore to tweak my configuration as I had back in the day.
 So, I heard about gccemacs and tried again. WOW! That&#x27;s a game changer!
 After 20 min compiling everything shipped with Doom emacs by default (yes, this is the bad side of the tradeoff), Emacs starts in less than 2s. It is even faster than my Neovim with all plugins. So, if anyone quit Emacs because of performance, give it one more try. Just do not mind the initial compilation time...
 Finally, I just want to thanks the amazing job of u/hlissner, Doom Emacs is amazing and you can use it out-of-the-box. Exactly what I need now.

                              <span>As of recent, all my bindings created with (bind-key*) just don&#x27;t work. (The star means, &quot;override all minor-mode bindings&quot;, if I recall correctly.) I don&#x27;t get any errors or warnings (the package gets loaded fine), but the bindings aren&#x27;t made.
 After lots of fiddling with my config and packages, I noticed that using the unstarred version does work: (bind-key). 
 Does anybody know what&#x27;s going on? Has anybody else notice this?

 So, I tried this, hoping to use a universal arg when I want to fzf-find-file, and normal without.
 (defun fzf-or-find-file () (interactive) (if (equal current-prefix-arg nil) (find-file) (fzf-find-file))) 
 This works with C-u M-x fzf-or-find-file (the fzf version runs), but when I DON&#x27;T pass a Ctrl-u, find-file ... fails. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m calling it incorrectly here, but pointers welcome.
 The failure looks like this
 What&#x27;d I do wrong?

 Are there starterkits/modes that help with the keybindings? e.g. simplify them as much as possible, use the :sadface: gui defaults, etc.?

                              <span>Ideally, I&#x27;d like to get credentials (e.g. for API endpoints) from my environment when developing in python. However Emacs doesn&#x27;t see them (I don&#x27;t run it from terminal).
 Now there is the package exec-path-from-shell that loads the PATH variable and that&#x27;s nice and dandy. But I need other variables (possibly dozens of APIs for different projects). 
 Is there any reasonable way to do it?
 Thank you!

 do you know any option where I can hide all results and see just the files where we have the found lines?
 Like a collapse all function in the grep buffer.

                              <span>I have seen a push toward native compilation with gccemacs. If i remember correctly, some common lisp implementations already compile lisp to machine code (like sbcl). Since elisp and common lisp are both in the same family, i was wondering how difficult would it be to compile the elisp libraries in emacs into common lisp, load them into an sbcl image, and obtain emacs with native compilation built in. 
 This could be further interfaced with other common lisp projects like Nyxt to provide further functionality. Would something like this be feasible?

                              <span>Everyone&#x27;s different. I would like to get a take from the community on my situation here.
 I&#x27;m approaching middle age and have always tried to use ergonomic tools &amp; techniques and yet I am developing RSI. My right hand is particularly bad. I have an appointment with my doctor to have a chat about it, but I am pretty sure that contorting my thumbs/hands in general to hit the meta/ctrl/shift keys have not helped me.
 I have enjoyed some modal editing in my journey. My current favorite packages for that are Meow &amp; god-mode. I honestly have not decided which I like better but both &quot;de-chord&quot; my commands. Meow does this with a &quot;keypad&quot; mode that is for all intents and purposes a leader key. This adds 1 additional key press in exchange for no modifiers. Meow has better text navigation, overall god-mode reduces key-presses much more dramatically.
 I am also considering learning/training myself to use both hands at all times and avoid pressing 2 keys with one hand at any given time. This only gets dicey with 3 key chords (like C-M-/M-S-/C-S/-).
 I&#x27;m trying to get a sense of which is the best course of action here. Heck, maybe I should do both?
 EDIT: You all have been amazing. Thank you so much for the advice! If I did not manage to respond to you please know that I am grateful

 I get this error:

 I get that what I am doing is nonsense. 10 is not a function so this can never run.
 But I don&#x27;t understand what&#x27;s with the error message. Why doesn&#x27;t Elisp interpreter complain about 10 not being a function? Why is it complaining about listp and 20?

                              <span>Connecting ideas along varied and novel paths makes them more memorable. How memorable an idea is equates to its meaning. It&#x27;s an ideas meaning that causes the it to stick in the memory.
With this in mind, I&#x27;ve been updating my linking practices.
Are you approaching linking casually as an afterthought?
I already have a summary (subatomic) and I could optionally add a &quot;Link Solidifier&quot; in () directly after the link.

  
Example
explains the importance of knowing why a link was created)

These are similar, but the subatomic summary is statically created when the zettel was created, and the &quot;Link Solidifier&quot; is more dynamic when the connection is created.



I have lots of thoughts about the value and practice of linking ideas. I want to start the discussion somewhere. What are your ideas? How do you work with the different types of links? It&#x27;s funny that we have hundreds of note types but a slim taxonomy of links.
Experiment! Let me know what you think.
Attached is my structure zettel on the topic of &quot;Establishing Firm Connections Between Ideas&quot; and all the first order linked zettel. All in markdown format.</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;ve started putting together a typeclass for differences in my current project. The simple example would be UTCTime and NominalDiffTime from Data.Time. The general structure that I have at the moment is
 -- | A type where we can reify changes class Diffable base where -- | The type of the changes type Metric base -- | Find the change between two values diff :: base -&gt; base -&gt; Metric base -- | Update a value with a set of changes move :: base -&gt; Metric base -&gt; base instance Diffable UTCTime where type Metric UTCTime &#x3D; NominalDiffTime diff &#x3D; diffUTCTime move &#x3D; flip addUTCTime 
 with a couple of laws
 move old (diff new old) &#x3D; new diff (move old path) old &#x3D; path 
 with the additional conditions for when Metric base is a Monoid.
 (diff a b)  diff(b c) &#x3D; diff a c diff a a &#x3D; mempty 
 I&#x27;ve searched for something like this in the past, but never found it. However, I&#x27;m not a clever person, so I fully expect that I might have missed something. Alternately, perhaps there&#x27;s a fundamental flaw with this abstraction that will come back to bite me? As it stands, my current project requires reifying the changes in a deeply nested structure and being able to create Diffable instances for the container classes has vastly simplified my code.

 If anyone wants to take a look and tell me what I did wrong/unidiomatically, I&#x27;d appreciate it. If not, thanks for reading anyway. I was trying to get it done quick(ish) rather than pretty, but it seems decent, and it works, which is neat.

                              <span>Hi - how can you search for tagless headings (headings without any tags added) in org files? All the search options/functions I can find allow filtering or selection by specific tags, but I can&#x27;t find a :no-tag or similar to use as argument
 (my org roam daily workflow involves tagging headlines by topic, sometimes i miss the tag on capturing the note, so want to go back and file all notes (headings within files) that don&#x27;t have tags)
 thank you!

I tried adding +fuzzy to ivy but I still can&#x27;t figure it out. I used to be able to press  then add **/ to search through all child directories for the file I&#x27;m looking for but now it just looks for a file with **/ at the start. I tried un-adding ivy to see if that would bring it back but nothing changed.
 Thank you for any help.

 Can anybody suggest what might be going on here? or just how to fix it?

 --with-native-compilation --with-pgtk --with-xwidgets
 Everything works fine, and I am even able to browse wikipedia. But when I try to open youtube within the xwidget-webkit browser, it loads to 89% and then crashes emacs. When I look in the terminal where I originally launched emacs, I find the error:
 Unable to configure xdg-desktop-portal access in the WebKit sandbox: GApplication is required. 
 I then recompiled by adding --with-x-toolkit&#x3D;gtk3 but I got the same behavior. Does anyone else run into this problem?

                              <span>I use Emacs mostly for research in the humanities. Linking to PDFs, storing notes, annotating documents, and writing and editing documents. 
 I think my key packages are pdf-tools, org mode, org-roam, org-transclusion, org-remark, and org-roam-bibtex with citar. I use straight.el + use-package to manage my packages.
 I do a lot of my reading Zotero and then export stuff to Emacs, but I&#x27;d be interested in moving more to Emacs too. 
 Currently using selectrum, but I hear that&#x27;s being phased out in favour of vertico. I&#x27;ve liked prescient and I believe there&#x27;s a hack to use it with vertico. I have consult installed too, although I haven&#x27;t used marginalia or corfu yet. Interested in using them though!
 Any other cool packages that might work for my use case of finding documents, writing documents, and displaying connections between them?
 Or just quality of life improvement stuff? E.g. Zotero or Firefox integration, better buffer management, better scrolling, UI stuff.
 I&#x27;ve heard a lot of great things about evil, so interested in adding that to my init, but I&#x27;ve never used vim by itself. Any cool guides to getting started with evil that don&#x27;t assume vim knowledge? 
 And what additional elements of the evil ecosystem should I add? I can&#x27;t tell the difference between org-evil and evil-org.

                              <span>Hello. I would like to ask whether it is possible to speed up the first GTK3 frame creation (not &#x60;init.el&#x60; loading)
 Background: Emacs 28.1 with GTK3 on ArchLinux (Awesome WM) and Ubuntu 20.04 (Gnome 3.36), both with Xorg. The config is on GitHub. On both machines the startup time for a non daemon Emacs UI instance is roughly the same and fluctuates between 0.46-0.55 seconds (depending on machine load perhaps, not sure), measured by &#x60;emacs-init-time&#x60;. The same measurement when opening a frame created from daemon (by &#x60;systemd&#x60;, but it shouldn&#x27;t matter) or in terminal is 0.104 sec. When using &#x60;emacs -Q&#x60; it is 0.319 sec.
 So, although the startup times are fine, I anyway would like to find a way to lessen the time it takes to draw a GTK3 frame which is roughly 0.3 sec. as far as I understand (this is by simply calculating the difference between non-daemon UI init time and a daemon one). 
 Why? Because I want it faster and because the frame flickers when it is drawn :)
 So, basically this is not about the speed of &#x60;init&#x60; loading, but UI drawing (although I will gladly accept suggestions to speed up the init as well [the config is in the works, I choose not to use &#x60;use-package&#x60;, but instead to employ manual tweaks]).
 Is it even possible to lessen this time? By the measurement of &#x60;-Q&#x60; it seems not...
 Thank you in advance

                              <span>Hi there,
 Currently, I&#x27;m updating my emacs config and trying to install a language server to python language.
 I did the following:
 https://preview.redd.it/nuz6c2dta3h91.png?width&#x3D;1920&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;53008de73f8266b2c124e7c251a301e5e89d1cfc
 The connection to lsp is going fine but stupid errors always occur, check it:
 ​

 As you can see, now I have a error and it isn&#x27;t displayed! Some one can help me with lsp config to use python?? 
 ​
 Thanks by attention!

                              <span>Puh, I tried to understand spell checking in Emacs and got overwhelmed by the possibilities I can find on the internet.
 I don&#x27;t know what to choose. After reading around I can define this minimals.
  
Spellchecking of by default.
 shortcut for toggeling on/off
 Switching between languages English and German
 Choose between suggested corrections
 Save &quot;new&quot; words
  
As and addon it would be nice but doesn&#x27;t have to: - Use German and English in the same buffer at the same time - Spell check docstrings in Python code
 Sidenote: I am not sure if this is relevant but in Python I use eglot as LSP which checks my code (via flycheck8 or flymake8 or something with fly...).
 Sidenote2: In some web source I saw that ivy and custom also are relevant here. I use both of them in my init.el.
 Sidenote3: 95% of time I use Emacs in terminal via SSH and not in gui mode.

 (defun custom/agenda/export-current-view () (interactive) (org-agenda-write &quot;~/NC/org/agenda.pdf&quot;)) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 If some text wasn’t in english in resulting pdf I get question marks instead of characters. Like it&#x27;s wrong encoding:
  Sched.12x: TODO ?????????? Sched.12x: TODO ?????????? ??????? Sched.11x: TODO ?????????? Sched.10x: TODO ????????? ?????? miniDV 
 I googled this, but found nothing helpful. Can anybody explain how to fix it?
 Upd. Just tried to set utf-8 for everything I&#x27;ve found.
  (set-language-environment &quot;UTF-8&quot;) (prefer-coding-system &#x27;utf-8) (set-default-coding-systems &#x27;utf-8) (set-terminal-coding-system &#x27;utf-8) (set-keyboard-coding-system &#x27;utf-8) 
 No success...

                              <span>According tothe docs, the c source files generate an executable called temacs which is just the lisp interpreter plus IO routines. This then loads the lisp libraries which provide the full emacs experience. The manual then says that temacs dumps some files according to the shell arguments it received.
 If it received pdump, it dumps an exact copy of itself plus the recorded routines from the lisp libraries it loaded (into a file called emacs.pdump).
 If it received dump, it dumps an executable lisp image of itself with all the lisp libraries already loaded.
 It would make sense to me that the 2nd option is the one used to distribute emacs via package managers, but according to the docs, this option is deprecated. 
 Does this mean that when i apt install emacs, I am installing the exact copy of temacs + an emacs.pdump file?
 Also, if using &quot;pdump&quot; the dumped executable is an exact copy of temacs, could I stop the build process right after the C source has compiled and use temacs as a bare bones emacs (maybe load the lisp libraries myself)?
 Im not planning to do this, im just curious about the mechanics of the process.

 For quite some time, I wanted to find a code editor that i am productive in. there are 3 main editors (Vim, VScode, Emacs) that I&#x27;m switching between constantly, i try using one editor, I feel annoyed / uncomfortable it, i switch to another editor, and the cycle continues. While i have some critiques for Vim and VScode, I&#x27;m only going to talk about Emacs, cause honestly, I don&#x27;t have time for the other two. I&#x27;m sure that some of you won&#x27;t agree with my points, so feel free to point out
 Emacs: Because Emacs is basically an elisp interpreter, and is written ~95% in elisp, It has a lot of moving parts, but its very extensible. if theory it should …</span>

 dvips: DVI file can&#x27;t be opened: _region_.dvi: No such file or directory DviPS sentinel: Opening input file: No such file or directory 
 However, when I run the command a second time, it works fine. I imagine that maybe there is some race condition where we are requesting info from a file that has not been created yet, but which is created by the time I re-run the command. Has someone else run into this error who can help me diagnose it?

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m trying to use Org-mode HTML export with Liquid tags which has been set up by my team. The final exported html should be something like this:
 {% extends &#x27;base.html&#x27; %} {% load static %} {% block content %} 
 ...blah ... 
 {% endblock %} 
 Now, I can easily use #+begin_export html in the beginning of my file to include the header tags. However, I&#x27;m unable to include the bottom liquid tag in the correct hierarchy, as Org export automatically adds a closing 
 after the included liquid tag. A minimal example:
 #+title: My website #+OPTIONS: toc:nil html-style:nil num:nil html-scripts:nil html-preamble:nil html-postamble:nil #+begin_export html {% extends &#x27;base.html&#x27; %} {% load static %} {% block content %} #+end_export * Welcome to my website Welcome to my small website. * Contact us Some info on how to contact us. #+begin_export html {% endblock %} #+end_export 
 I know Org treats hierarchies strictly, so that is why perhaps the last html_export is added to the Contact Us section. Any ideas how to avoid that and keep this tag as the last output in the html? Thanks in advance!
 Edit : Solved, check comments!

                              <span>I am using org-roam and org-agenda as part of my workflow to take notes, build my knowledge database, track todos and track my time spent on certain tasks (which are spread over multiple org-roam files). As part of this, I use the org-clock-report function quite a lot, which currently looks something like this:
 https://preview.redd.it/325j66e2r4h91.png?width&#x3D;760&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;ad1507cc943d327e2ffdc185d6db5b201a2ad948
 This serves its purpose for me, but I don&#x27;t like how it shows the full file name at the moment. Is there a way to make the report show the document title instead (i.e. the #+title: at the top of the org document)?

                              <span>Hello all,
 I&#x27;m trying to make a document with sub table of contents for subheaders and I have trouble showing the table of contents of a subheader being 3 or more depth 
 Here is what I mean: 
 When I do this and export it to html it works (even though I have only Aaa as subheader, despite the &quot;headlines 2&quot; in the TOC options at the end, I don&#x27;t know why) 
 #+OPTIONS: toc:nil #+title: Minimal example * A ** Aa :PROPERTIES: :CUSTOM_ID: test :END: *** Aaa **** Aaaa **** Aaab * B #+TOC: headlines 2 :target #test 
 But when I do this: 
 #+OPTIONS: toc:nil #+title: Minimal example * A ** Aa *** Aaa :PROPERTIES: :CUSTOM_ID: test :END: **** Aaaa **** Aaab * B #+TOC: headlines 2 :target #test 
 The html export doesn&#x27;t show the TOC... Why? It seems to only work with subheaders that are not too deep... 
 additionnal info:
 I used this manual section of the manual
 Emacs version: 27.2
 Org mode version: 9.4.4

 I am new using Scala, in my current project we have .scalm files and they are really hard to understand. It looks like a law book, does anyone know if there is an extension for VSC or something, to make the code more readable. 
 Thanks a lot!

                              <span>Hi all!
 I&#x27;m working on a project at the moment looking at setting up SAST/DAST security scanning where I work, and one language I need to support is Scala. Now, I&#x27;m a security engineer, not a software dev, and I don&#x27;t know a jot about Scala. I&#x27;ve heard some noise around Scala being a secure-by-default language thanks to it&#x27;s type safety, which I don&#x27;t totally buy (that is, I see how that could make it secure in terms of input validation, but security doesn&#x27;t just come down to input validation!) 
 Anyways that said, I have a couple of questions:
  
Can you point to me to any resources around secure software development for Scala specifically?
 Have any of you got any experience in using SAST tools like Semgrep, Snyk Code, Codacy, Checkmarx, etc? If so, can you tell me about that? Likes, dislikes, was it useful, etc?
  
​
 What I absolutely want to avoid is ending up rolling something out that ultimately wastes dev time and pisses people off :)

                              <span>We recently released a beta version of a web service called Chainsail, that helps with sampling multimodal probability distributions (you can check out our Chainsail announcement blog post for a quick introduction to this tool).
In parallel, this post aims to illustrate a use case of Chainsail with an example of probabilistic clustering with soft k-means.
You will see that the Bayesian model discussed here exhibits a multimodal posterior distribution, and whereas single-chain MCMC algorithms notoriously struggle to correctly sample similar posteriors, we will show how Chainsail improves on that state of affairs.

Soft k-means clustering
Soft k-means clustering, also known as fuzzy clustering, is the probabilistic version of the better known k-means clustering.
K-means algorithms are usuall…</span>

                              <span>Hi!
 When using Emacs, I notice that some UTF-8 characters has different spacing even with a monospaced font. This problems leads to misalignments in the text:

 It works fine in terminal:

 Is there a way to fix it in GUI?

                              <span>So I want to write an Emacs package to export org files to a format used in a website (the syntax is similar to html, but much more simple).
 I have some experience writing my own function in Elisp before, but I don&#x27;t know where to start writing a package.

                              <span>I want to share this small package that I wrote based on /u/nicolas-rougier&#x27;s code.
 It&#x27;s a simple package that modifies messages so that additional text is appended and right-aligned. I use it to show information that I want to see regardless of the current buffer (in my case, time a notmuch email indicator and today&#x27;s task statistics).

 You can use it as follows to show the time for example.
 (require &#x27;echo-line) ;; Enable &#x60;display-time-mode&#x60; to update the &#x60;display-time-string&#x60; (display-time-mode 1) ;; Optionally delete the time string from the mode-line (delete &#x27;display-time-string global-mode-string) ;; Update the echo-line every time the display-time is updated (add-hook &#x27;display-time-hook &#x27;echo-line-update) ;; Set the echo-line format (setq echo-line-format &#x27;((:eval display-time-string))) ;; Show the echo-line immediately (echo-line-mode) 
 The main changes from the original code is creating a global minor-mode, a slightly different way to right align text and other small checks to make sure that the messages are always displayed correctly.

                              <span>Hi all. I’m thinking we really need to split off the evil - and other specially packages - build posts. I’m an old-time, vanilla emacs user (who did start with ex and vi) but this has nothing to do with one of the other being better. It’s just there’s so much activity for evil and space, etc, that I keep end up reading long posts before I realize it doesn’t apply to what I use. 
 And thoughts on this? Since it’s basically voluntary on the part of all the specialty build users. 
 Thanks!

                              <span>Scala has a lot of data science users. An awesome localhost Jupyter notebook experience is a great way to attract more data science programmers to Scala.
 I was really excited to create a Jupyter notebook that showcases some Delta Lake functionality the other day.
 I had a nice workflow installing different Java versions using SDKMAN but switched to Coursier because that&#x27;t what&#x27;s recommended in the Almond installation guide. In order to run &#x60;jupter lab&#x60; and start up the notebook environment, I need to separately install Jupyter Lab via conda (and activate that conda environment).
 I&#x27;m a little stuck now because apparently Coursier doesn&#x27;t let me download a version of Java that&#x27;s optimized for the M1, see this issue.
 Let me know if you have any suggestions on the best way for me to setup my machine. It&#x27;s awesome how much progress has been made on tooling in Scala.

                              <span>Hey guys,
 I&#x27;ve been a Haskell consultant for the past 3 years. Before that I have 4 years of .NET (with a bit of F# as well), so I&#x27;m pretty comfortable with both FP and OOP concepts.
 I absolutely love FP and Haskell, but there&#x27;s so little work that it&#x27;s frustrating. I have been &quot;stuck&quot; on the same project for 3 years now, which is getting pretty boring.
 Lately I&#x27;ve started considering switching to something more popular like Scala, as there&#x27;s a much larger variety of projects and clients, but a call with a recruiter today confused me.
 I&#x27;m based in Europe and have a permanent contract at 450EUR day rate. The recruiter told me that transitioning to Scala would require a massive pay cut as no one would hire someone without production experience at that rate. He also said that usually Scala people&#x27;s attitude towards Haskell developers is hostile.
 Does that statement have any merit? It sounds to me that he&#x27;s just lacking technical understanding, but I don&#x27;t know.
 What is your impression about that? How would you go about transitioning?

                              <span>Hi there folks, I’m currently trying to do a little project in Scala to learn intricacies of the language and have run into a bit of an issue when trying to use Futures. I am using Akka HTTP and ujson.
 Basically, I am trying to create a backend API that acts as kind of a wrapper for a pre-existing external API (the MyAnimeList API, if of interest) and return specific information from that API to the user - I have set out the code below for reference.
 The specific things that I want my code to do is:
  
It should call the MyAnimeList API and, after some manipulation of the JSON data, get a list of String (representing IDs).
 Then, it should make a new MyAnimeList API call using each of those String IDs, and return a list of String containing the new information.
  
I am able to get the in…</span>

                              <span>Hello everyone, I have recently got into Scala and am really enjoying working with the language. I have been programming since 2011, as well as doing a lot of other things in computing including cyber security related things. I’m obsessed with learning new things and hope to obtain a remote internship or remote job in some domain that Scala is used in, as well as possibly getting to do some C++ or Haskell. I am in between dev jobs for now and did C++ related work at my last job.

                              <span>This is just for aesthetics. I&#x27;d like all commands that create drawers, such as org-id-get-create, to make them lowercase instead of uppercase.
 So they would be:
 :properties: :ID: 3c27eba8-8bc6-47f1-a177-3e3562eb17f2 :end: 
 Instead of:
 :PROPERTIES: :ID: 3c27eba8-8bc6-47f1-a177-3e3562eb17f2 :END: 
 How can I do that?

 Did you pay for things like Emacs / Org mode books, org file hosting services, courses?
 I know most of stuffs are FOSS. Just curious about any successful commercialization attempt in this space.

During my undergraduate program I focused mainly on algebra, type theory and category theory, so naturally Haskell is just a joy to use. However I can&#x27;t seem to find any positions in the EU that don&#x27;t require at least 4 years experience. Does anyone here know of such an opening?

                              <span>I&#x27;m learning haskell and a very common error that i have is this one:
 Occurs check: cannot construct the infinite&#x60; type: a ~ [a] 
 Someone know why this compilation error happen?
 Thank you forehand
 Edit:
 I&#x27;m trying to implement a merge sort where a i have to split a list in to smaller pieces, which that i later merge:
 split [x] &#x3D; [x] split lst &#x3D; -- The length of the split depends if its odd or even. let half &#x3D; if mod (length lst) 2 &#x3D;&#x3D; 0 then div (length lst) 2 else div (length lst) 2 + 1 in [ split [ lst !! x | x &lt;- [0,1..(half-1)]] , split [lst !! x | x &lt;- [half..(length lst - 1)]] ]

We are based in the Salt Lake City area but the position will be remote. Our stack is Javascript/Typescript/Elm on the front end and Haskell on the back end.

 I have a much improved version of Git Autosync, and would like to hear the opinions on the program and if you also find it useful. It&#x27;s proven to be a reliable little helper, keeping a lot of my repos up to date daily, including dotfiles, knowledge base, and others.
 Feel free to create GitHub issues if you have ideas, or comment it here. You can also find a pre-packaged version of it for GNU/Linux systems and for macOS.

 I learned haskell on/off for two or three years now. It looks very interesting, and I tried few pet projects, but I always get discouraged by ecosystem and, in fact, lack of any real project to actually invest any larger time in (this project should finally change that). And I fear debugging Haskell code (how do you do that without stepping though code?), albeit I never needed it, so maybe that fear is unfunded.

 https://haskell.mooc.fi/part1
 I&#x27;m not new to programming, and I think I have a decent grasp of the fundamentals of Haskell (I&#x27;ve tried learning the language several times), but I found the examples here lacking and some of the homework a little absurd. I could do most of the exercises, but not all of them, and I could do almost nothing with the final project on graphics.
 Are the exercises just difficult? Is it a poorly regarded resource, or am I just slow to learn?

                              <span>I absolutely hate when my projects leave traces of the tools I use. My projects should contain the source code of the program, and anything required for it to function, or directly related with it, nothing else.
 Emacs doesn&#x27;t seem to think the same. It litters the directory you&#x27;re editing with backup and lock files, and I don&#x27;t understand why.
 While I seem to have been successful in stopping backup files from popping up, I can&#x27;t do the same with lock files. Despite setting the variable create-lockfiles to nil, it still creates them.
 Ideally, I&#x27;d want these lock files to exist, just somewhere else. They shouldn&#x27;t be where I&#x27;m editing. I don&#x27;t really know how to control, this. There was a variable to change that but I always failed at setting it, complaining I was using the wrong type.
 Anyway, this code is what I have at the very top of my init file, this is all I need to keep my working directory (and my config folder) clean from Emacs&#x27; shenanigans.
 (setq user-emacs-directory (expand-file-name &quot;~/.local/share/emacs&quot;)) (setq user-config-directory (expand-file-name &quot;~/.config/emacs&quot;)) (setq native-comp-eln-load-path &#x27;((. &quot;~/.local/share/emacs/eln-cache&quot;))) (setq custom-file (expand-file-name &quot;custom.el&quot; user-emacs-directory)) (setq package-user-dir (expand-file-name &quot;elpa&quot; user-emacs-directory)) (setq url-history-file (expand-file-name &quot;url/history&quot; user-emacs-directory)) (setq delete-old-versions t) (setq create-lockfiles nil) (setq auto-save-list-file-prefix (expand-file-name &quot;auto-save-list/.saves-&quot; user-emacs-directory)) (setq backup-directory-alist &#x27;((&quot;.&quot; . &quot;~/.local/share/emacs/backups&quot;))) 
 Does anybody know why Emacs STILL creates lock files where I&#x27;m editing? It&#x27;s very annoying.

 My system-configuration-features includes LIBXML2
 My load-path includes &quot;/usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/elpa/nov-0.3.0&quot;

 My auto-mode-alist includes:
 (&quot;\.epub\&#x27;&quot; . nov-mode)
 The error comes up even with epubs that pass epubcheck.
 Any ideas for what else I might look at?
 Running with debug-on-error, the stack backtrace looks like:

 I ask because I need some help with formatting web development projects with Emacs easily.

                              <span>I am using multi-term to manage multiple terminals. When I open a new term with M-x multi-term RET, the terminal is in char mode which is good.
 I execute a command in the terminal like this:
 echo hello world 
 Then I type C-p but nothing happens. I check C-h v term-bind-key-alist RET and it has this info:
 term-bind-key-alist is a variable defined in ‘multi-term.el’. Its value is shown below. The key alist that will need to be bind. If you do not like default setup, modify it, with (KEY . COMMAND) format. You can customize this variable. Value: ((&quot;C-c C-c&quot; . term-interrupt-subjob) (&quot;C-c C-e&quot; . term-send-esc) (&quot;C-p&quot; . previous-line) (&quot;C-n&quot; . next-line) (&quot;C-s&quot; . isearch-forward) (&quot;C-r&quot; . isearch-backward) (&quot;C-m&quot; . term-send-return) (&quot;C-y&quot; . term-paste) (&quot;M-f&quot; . term-send-forward-word) (&quot;M-b&quot; . term-send-backward-word) (&quot;M-o&quot; . term-send-backspace) (&quot;M-p&quot; . term-send-up) (&quot;M-n&quot; . term-send-down) (&quot;M-M&quot; . term-send-forward-kill-word) (&quot;M-N&quot; . term-send-backward-kill-word) (&quot;&quot; . term-send-backward-kill-word) (&quot;M-r&quot; . term-send-reverse-search-history) (&quot;M-d&quot; . term-send-delete-word) (&quot;M-,&quot; . term-send-raw) (&quot;M-.&quot; . comint-dynamic-complete)) 
 So by default C-p is bound to previous-line. So when I type C-p in terminal (which is in char mode), the cursor should move one line up? But nothing happens when I type C-p in the terminal.
 What good is the entry for (&quot;C-p&quot; . previous-line) in term-bind-key-alist then if C-p does nothing? Anyone savvy can help me to understand what the use of this entry is?

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;d like to use the ryo-modal as a menu like hydra ...
 Do you use any packages to create menu where you can repeat the keys.
 Maybe the hydra is the best but the configuration is easier for ryo-modal :)

                              <span>Just an FYI that we&#x27;ve tagged v1.0, which is us concluding that Citar is basically feature-complete, and we&#x27;re comfortable with the API and keeping it more stable (sorry for the recent breaking changes!).
 Along with some major recent internal (in particular cache) and API changes, we&#x27;ve separated the embark-related code into a new package and minor-mode: citar-embark. I highly recommend it.
 Note: we do have a known performance issue apparent with large files that change frequently. The fix for this will mostly happen in parsebib.
 Also, I&#x27;ve updated the Doom biblio module to incorporate these changes, and updated all of its packages. This remains the easiest path to have a working citar-oriented system; just turn on the biblio and vertico modules, and set some paths.
 The note API in 1.0 in turn enables a small integration extension: citar-org-roam. This is partly a demo and test of the new API, but should also be useful for users, and developers that might want to build on it. This still needs a bit of work before I submit it to MELPA; PRs welcome.
 Any questions?

                              <span>I have tried these two lines. These two lines are the only lines in my ~/init.el:
 (global-unset-key (kbd &quot;C-j&quot;)) (global-set-key (kbd &quot;C-j&quot;) (kbd &quot;C-x&quot;)) 
 Now I edit a file hello.txt (so it&#x27;s fundamental-mode). I type C-j C-f hoping it will behave like C-x C-f and trigger find-file minibuffer. But when I type C-j C-f, the cursor moves by one place forward. The mapping of C-j to C-x has no effect.
 I check C-h k C-j and this help is shown:
 C-j runs the command &quot;&quot; (found in global-map), which is a keyboard 
 macro.
 It is bound to C-j. Macro: C-x Keyboard macro. 
 Obviously I am doing something wrong. Can I somehow remap C-j to behave exactly like C-x?

                              <span>My workflow is such that I use tramp-term to connect to a server with running docker containers and sometimes I want to read the logs, preferably with highlighting. What is a good way to do this? The logs can be fairly large ~35MB and I need to search through all of it for debug purposes. 
 I have tried logview-mode and log4j-mode, but it seems they can&#x27;t deal with the log output of docker. Or maybe I haven&#x27;t configured correctly?

                              <span>Hi, 
 just to start with, i see myself as rookie on the emacs platform - started to use emacs because org-mode, then terminale, then buffers for build/edit configs for network equipment.
 now the time is for mu4e and im already loving the way i can easily control my mailbox and add them to my org-aganda.. i only see myself using emacs more and more in the future.
 my question is: when i forward a email containing picture or other files - my mu is stripping my mail for these file - what im a missing, is that normal behavior or have i configured my mu4e wrong?
 if needed i can post the config.

 MS comic chat (https://www.kurlander.net/DJ/Projects/ComicChat/resources.html) seemed fun. If you want to take the idea further, this might help you get started https://github.com/statico/spittoon

                              <span>Context:
 E is used to mark an article as expired in summary buffer. But if I press E by mistake, is there a way to undo just the Expiry mark.
 ​
 If I use ~gnus-summary-clear-mark-forward~, it clears all marks, but is there a way to clear only just the Expiry (E) mark?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been fighting with clangd for a couple weeks, which was a big disappointment. For years I saw these interesting plugins to help code completion completely pass me by because converting the project I was on into a format understandable by clang was a huge hassle.
 Well, now I&#x27;m working on an Unreal project, and its build steps let me create a compile_commands.json file that works with clangd. 
 But the compile_commands.json file is about 745MB, and I was getting constant blocking stalls in emacs. If I opened up the eglot events buffer, it was scrolling endlessly, presumably because of background generation of semantic data that would be used for all the interesting stuff that you want to use clangd for.
 Hunting around, I found mention of clangd-indexer, which creates a static index.

 (&quot;b&quot; &quot;Bookmark&quot; entry (file+headline ,(concat org-directory &quot;/refile.org&quot;) &quot;Bookmarks&quot;) &quot;* %? %^a&quot;) 
 But it doesn&#x27;t trigger the org-store-link.
 I read on a page that %a is &quot;annotation, normally the link created with org-store-link.&quot;
 When I run the capture template I want to be asked about the link and its description (just like when running C-c l) and insert the link as the heading title.

                              <span>Hello, I added these to my init.el:
 (use-package org :ensure nil :hook (org-mode . (lambda () (org-indent-mode) (variable-pitch-mode -1) (display-line-numbers-mode -1) (set-input-method &quot;custom-input-method&quot;))) .. .. 
 The set-input-method loads some custom keys I defined to insert phonetic symbols:
 (quail-define-rules ;; Phonetic symbols (&quot;\\uh&quot; ?ə) ; UNSTRESSED SCHWA VOWEL (&quot;\\uH&quot; ?ʌ) ; STRESSED SCHWA VOWEL (&quot;\\ii&quot; ?ɪ) ; NEAR-CLOSE NEAR-FRONT UNROUNDED VOWEL (&quot;\\uu&quot; ?ʊ) ; NEAR-CLOSE NEAR-BACK ROUNDED VOWEL .. .. 
 I use these symbols quite often in my documents so I would like the input method to be enabled by default in Org mode which it works using the code above.
 I have two questions:
 When (set-input-method &quot;custom-input-method&quot;) enables the custom input method does that have any negative side effect on the default input method? or the custom input method will just add the additional characters on top of the default input method?
 Is there a command to disable the custom input method while in Org mode? I don&#x27;t think I will need to disable it but I&#x27;m just wondering.

                              <span>I&#x27;m having a hard time with the conventional guides - is there a newbie guide that starts with the basics of setting up emacs in simple language and walks me up until I&#x27;m using org-mode? 
 I&#x27;m not a computer newbie, btw. I&#x27;m a sysadmin of 10+ years, but I find it hard to just get used to emacs (coming from vim, nano, etc).

                              <span>Tweag is happy to announce the public beta release of a major internal project:
a web service called Chainsail that facilitates sampling multimodal probability distributions.
It is an effort to expand the applicability of Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling (MCMC), modern probabilistic programming tools — and, by extension, Bayesian inference — to more complex statistical problems.
Tweag provides the computing resources required by Chainsail (within reasonable limits) free of charge.
If you’re impatient, you can skip right to our walkthrough video where we demonstrate briefly what Chainsail does and how to use it.

                              <span>How do I use embark-live on the exported results of a vertico grep search?
 I would like to collect/export the results of the search (acting as a snapshot of my search state), and I would also like the embark export buffer to update. E.g. if I select a search result and change it so it no longer matches the search, it should no longer show in the buffer.
 ​
 Each time I&#x27;ve tried to use embark-act -&gt; embark-live; the focus stays in the vertico search. I&#x27;ve fumbled and tried a few things to dismiss the search and work with the embark-live buffer but can&#x27;t seem to figure that out.
 ​
 Any tips for what I&#x27;m doing wrong? (Does embark support this workflow?)

                              <span>I&#x27;m struggling a bit with the key binds system in Emacs. I&#x27;m aware, that my setup is probably pretty unique, but I hope someone might have at least some answers for me:
 Because I&#x27;m not using a standard QWERTY layout but instead a Dvorak layout, I have to rebind most of the normal binds. I&#x27;m doing this with evil-mode and a custom minor mode, through which I declare all navigation keys. This evil-dvorak-mode is turned on globally. The basic motion keys for me look like this:
 (evil-define-key &#x27;visual evil-dvorak-mode-map &quot;h&quot; &#x27;evil-next-line &quot;t&quot; &#x27;evil-previous-line &quot;d&quot; &#x27;evil-backward-char &quot;n&quot; &#x27;evil-forward-char ) 
 I&#x27;m also redefining most commands through a system of leader keys with the package evil-leader, which is also turned on globally. For example:

                              <span>Hi everyone!
 I&#x27;ve written a new package to track down the correct Python executables from the various virtualenvs that you might create for your Python projects.
 In short, the motivation for this package is that modern Python projects typically rely on a bunch of linters and formatters, and they can all be installed in different virtualenvs. This package will find those installed in pre-commit, then poetry, and then finally whatever is on your exec-path, and then assign the absolute paths to many of the supported Emacs package variables.
 This package is in early preview, but it&#x27;s perfectly usable for most situations by my estimate. If you run into any problems, please don&#x27;t hesitate to file an issue on the repo.
 Also, if you have any idea writing tests for this package without having me creating all kinds of a fixtures or mocking dozens of things, please let me know!

                              <span>I moved from using vanilla ansi-term to using multi-term.
 One very nice feature about ansi-term was how I could press C-c C-j to change from term-char-mode to term-line-mode and then press C-c C-k again to come back to term-char-mode.
 After installing the C-c C-j command does not work anymore when I am in term-char-mode. I have to run M-x term-line-mode RET now to change to term-line-mode.
 How can I get back the C-c C-j behavior to change from term-char-mode to term-line-mode?

                              <span>I use evil mode with emacs and in order to scroll up with C-u like in vim you need to set this variable. I have (setq evil-want-C-u-scroll t) in my config (before enabling evil mode, and before requiring it (if that&#x27;s even needed)) but it doesn&#x27;t work.
 Does someone know why? I know I could set the bindings manually but that&#x27;s not very clean and I&#x27;d prefer to use this built-in variable if possible.

 Pretty green on the scala front. I’m trying to calculate fill rate for each column in a dataframe without having to manually script the logic for each column
 Sample input:
  
 col1 col2 col3 
  
 value null value 
  value value null 
  value null value 
 
 Preferred output:
  
 col1 col2 col3 
  
 100.0 33.3 66.6 
 
 Please and thanks for the considerations

                              <span>Hi everyone, I have been trying to figure out a way to batch convert PDF Titles to their file names (or in sequence from a txt file). My ultimate goal is to find a way to batch change the Titles of PDF&#x27;s, the solution for which, I have not been able to find. So, I thinking about trying to come at it from another angle. I can batch change file names easily enough with an app, so I&#x27;m hoping that someone can help with a script that can batch change PDF Titles to match their file name. Anyone have any ideas?
Thanks,
Darryl</span>

 What&#x27;s new in v3.1:
  
finally, secret chat groups are supported in mobile apps! They are fully decentralized, and do not have any globally unique identifiers or server-side state - only their members know they even exist.
 supports accessing messaging servers via Tor using Orbot app (it works on both Android and iOS).
 2 new app icons - please vote in this poll which one you prefer.
  
Please see this post for more details about this release.

                              <span>I just want to make it possible for compiler to infer from instance declaration haskell instance MonadState&#x27; s m &#x3D;&gt; MonadState&#x27; s (ExceptT s m)  constraint haskell MonadState&#x27; s (ExceptT s m) &#x3D;&gt; MonadState&#x27; s m 
 As I understand, compiler can&#x27;t do it generally, because there can be other instances of MonadState&#x27; s for ExceptT s m. But in this case I definitely know, they should not exist. Is there any way to tell compiler &quot;for this class this is a single instance and you can add MonadState&#x27; s (ExceptT s m) &#x3D;&gt; MonadState&#x27; s m to your inferred rules list&quot;? As far as I see, there shouldn&#x27;t be any problems with that for typechecking, so I hope this has already been realized. Or there are some problems that I can&#x27;t forsee?
 Motivation: I try to make it possible to change, for example, type of error of transformer without decomposing whole monad. So, roughly speaking, I would like to have the function haskell mapError :: (MonadError e m, MonadError e&#x27; m&#x27;, ???) &#x3D;&gt; (e -&gt; e&#x27;) -&gt; m -&gt; m&#x27;  this can be done using type families (like MappedErrorMonad e e&#x27; m m&#x27;) for errors only. But we have a problem when there is some state both at the left and right sides. So we want to tell compiler something like MappedErrorMonad e e&#x27; m m&#x27; &#x3D;&gt; (MonadState s m &#x3D;&gt; MonadState s m&#x27;). For this purpose I&#x27;ve introduced haskell class (forall m a. (Monad m, c&#x27; (t a m)) &#x3D;&gt; c&#x27; (t b m)) &#x3D;&gt; MappableSave (t :: * -&gt; (* -&gt; *) -&gt; * -&gt; *) (c&#x27; :: (* -&gt; *) -&gt; Constraint)  And now want to inhabit this class by ExceptT:  instance MappableSave ExceptT (MonadState s)  But compiler failed with error  • Could not deduce (S.MonadState s m) arising from the superclasses of an instance declaration from the context: (Monad m, S.MonadState s (ExceptT a m)) bound by a quantified context  that&#x27;s where my topic started

 I take it that :async process probably runs another emacs process or session where those variables and functions may not be defined.
 How do I fix this?

Today, I customized an Ubersicht widget on my MacBook to open Emacs maximized (a pain in the Mac),and to open with various command line functions (run a “morning” keyboard macro that sets up buffers for my morning routine, open a new journal entry, and open my main agenda view). 
 Emacs is taking over!

                              <span>For those who don&#x27;t know, tree-sitter is &quot;an incremental parsing system&quot;. What it basically means is that it provides fancy syntax highlighting by doing a thorough analysis of the code.
 Emacs has treesitter integration via the tree-sitter package. I was using tree-sitter before on neovim and it really great. Well, I&#x27;m trying to set it up in emacs and it&#x27;s pure frustration.
 I&#x27;ve installed the package, and it says that you should also install a language pack. Well, since I was already using treesitter before, then I prefer to not have to compile the language parsers twice, so I decided to unify it in a single directory for both neovim and emacs. Making the change on neovim was a piece of cake. On emacs, I pushed to the tree-sitter-load-path list, and it seems to work... kinda. If I manually call tree-sitter-require &#x27;python for example, it does load the language parser, it even gets listed in tree-sitter-languages. However, it doesn&#x27;t get enabled, the syntax is the same.
 The variable tree-sitter-language is not getting set. Apparently tree-sitter should map each language major mode to a tree-sitter parser, but it ain&#x27;t doing it for some reason. Trying to enable treesitter on a python file results in the error &quot;No language registered for &quot;python-mode&quot;&quot;.
 Also what about these major modes for each language? I don&#x27;t want a major mode for each language. I want emacs to open a file, recognize what it is by its extension or otherwise, and that&#x27;s it. I want highlighting to be handled by treesitter, but it apparently needs to interact with these major modes (of which I need to install more if I want to support other languages) that don&#x27;t really add anything to me other than bloat. Is there a workaround?

                              <span>I&#x27;m using ivy and counsel for completion. When I M-x, I sometimes make small typos. For example:
 M-x descirbe function RET
 This of course returns no results, though the edit distance to the command &quot;describe-function&quot; is only 2.
 Is there any way to get graceful filtering to help filter out typos? basically something like vscode&#x27;s filterGraceful.
 I&#x27;m ok with switching from ivy to something else like helm as well.

                              <span>Hi everyone,
How to Take Smart Notes by Sönke Ahrens.
Digital Zettelkasten Principles, Methods, &amp; Examples by David Kadavy.
Introduction to Luhmann’s Zettelkastenthinking and its technical implementation Dr. Daniel Lüdecke.
In the beginning, I thought Zettelkasten is software to use for organizing notes, but it turned out to be a HUGE topic and watched too many videos on Youtube about it and I&#x27;ve set my mind on having a digital Zettelkasten system and syncing it across my computer, mobile, and laptop.
So far I am still looking for which tool to use to build this system because TheArchive software is a MAC version only. By the way, if you may suggest a tool or a scenario to achieve the Zettelkasten system that would be awesome.
I&#x27;ve found some tools like Notion, Obsidian, iAWriter ...etc, and also found some other tools for doing flashcards like Anki which I would like to use as well within the system, and I am still confused between them to pick one and learn it to make the best use of it on the long run.
All opinions and recommendations are highly appreciated.</span>

                              <span>Please tell the community what you&#x27;ve been working on and share your plans for your zettelkasting this week.
This past week found me doing:
On Friday, my ZK surpassed 700k words, and by the end of the month, it may surpass 3k zettel. I&#x27;m slowly developing a sense of progress.
      20220806 Zettelkasten Statistics
                    ★★★★★
        700803 Total word count
        11801 Total link count
        2905 Total zettel count
                    ★★★★★

I gave up on the &quot;Full Screen&quot; workflow. I couldn&#x27;t get it working with my Keyboard Maestro macros. I was having no fun.
Discovered a minor bug in my favorite advanced search querying macro.
My current plans for this coming week:
I will work all out on a minor bug in my favorite advanced search querying macro. It likely will require some more Regular Expression pixy-dust.
Reading - The Narrow Road To The Deep North by Matsuo Basho - Travel Journal
Reading - The Book Of Form And Emptiness by Ruth Ozeki - Fiction
Here are a few of the titles of zettel I&#x27;ve been working on last week.
These, along with the migration of 55 #code-snippets, make last week a ZK-focused week. Looking back, it feels like I only spent maybe two open and enjoyably stimulating hours per day working in my ZK. By working, I mean bathing in mind-weather and writing.

                              <span>Hi, does anyone know companies that hire scala developers in the uk / Ireland?
 Here’s what I know:
 Ireland - workday - paddy power?
 UK (not sure if they are hiring people outside the UK) - Disney - OVO energy - Sky has some scala that I know
 Not sure if there is a list of companies using scala in these places. 
 Appreciate any insights.

 I can use regex
 [A-Z]{2,} but emacs does not recognize, the editor online take this, but the terminal of emacs not
 so i needed to use some escape:
 [A-Z]\{2,\}
 ​
 Was original post:
 I found an easy way to highlight, namely i convert a word to all capital letters, selecting and using &#x60;U&#x60; in emacs-doom, but is not enough i want to use different colors or highlights 
 Now, as I use a lot of themes( working in sunlight and darker environment) I would like to &#x60;toggle on and off&#x60; an highlight function that find all the capital letters (if are more than 2) so that i can show my highlights when i want see key words in a doc

NeoOrg (or this one)
 NeoGit
  
Are there any limitations, whether performance, features, or anything else significant, with these plugins that make them inferior to the tooling within the emacs environment? Anything you can&#x27;t do with these?
 Or are they pretty much just as good and there really aren&#x27;t any significant penalties from implementing them for neovim?

                              <span>My elfeed is focused on finding papers and when I check out each entry, there is a PMID and DOI number at the end. 
 PMID:39334129 | DOI:10.1207/s12102-021-03242-8
 I wanted to call a function that records the entry into my .bib file and at the same time downloads the PDF of that paper if available using my python function. I cannot seem to do these two actions in a single function so I have to use two functions (one for PMID to get the pdf and other for DOI to get entered into .bib file) which work fine separately:
 (defun extract-PMID-DOI (regexp) (interactive (list (read-regexp &quot;Regexp: &quot;))) (isearch-mode t t) (let ((isearch-regexp nil)) (isearch-yank-string regexp))) (defun fetch-pubmed-pdf () (interactive) (extract-PMID-DOI &quot;PMID:&quot;) ;; puts cursor on PMID number (insert (shell-command-to-string (concat &quot;python3 /home/user/fetch_pdfs.py -out /home/user/papers/pdfs/ -pmids &quot; (current-word)))) ) (defun fetch-pubmed-doi () (interactive) (extract-PMID-DOI &quot;DOI:10.&quot;) ;; puts cursor on DOI number (doi-utils-add-bibtex-entry-from-doi (concat &quot;10.&quot; (current-word)) &quot;~/papers/ref.bib&quot;) ) 
 I wanted to know if there is a way for me to combine the two functions fetch-pubmed-pdf and fetch-pubmed-doi into a single function and also if there is a way to link the pdf that was downloaded in my /home/user/papers/pdfs/ to the .bib entry obtained from the doi?

                              <span>Preface: I don&#x27;t have AUCTeX installed.
 I have all setup so that a makefile compiles a latex file and creates a pdf. I also setup pdf-tools and synctex. I would like to bind to a key a functions that start to compile, wait for the result, if there is no error from make then it displays in a separate buffer the pdf, else it displays the buffer with the error (which are on stdout because I redirect them and grep the important bits).
 The makefile is important because there are other scripts that modify the latex before actual rendering. It also makes the setup more friendly with only the terminal.
 My experience with lisp is unfortunately very small, any suggestions for resources to read are welcome.

                              <span>So I only started using emacs a few days ago, but after getting over hating it for the first day or two, I learned how to do basic things from memory, like install packages, open text files, and use custom themes. I&#x27;m a fan now.
 I&#x27;d like to set it up to do the sorts or things an IDE would do, but the way I&#x27;m doing it doesn&#x27;t quite have the functionality I&#x27;m looking for.
 Currently what I&#x27;m doing is opening a buffer with a text file, saving it as &quot;somefile.c&quot; (because I mainly work in C), and using the C major mode by typing &quot;M-x c-mode.&quot; That implements syntax highlighting, which is nice, but there&#x27;s a few things it doesn&#x27;t do that I&#x27;d like it to do:
  
debugging/error correction - At the moment, if I type something like
 include &lt;stdio.h
 
 it doesn&#x27;t notice my dumb typo, and I&#x27;d prefer if it had some kind of feature to tell me what was wrong, rather than just getting a compilation error when I try to compile it. 
  
real time terminal - Ideally, I&#x27;d like to open a window with a separate buffer containing a terminal emulator so that I can compile+execute the code within emacs. 
  
Also, if anyone has configured their emacs so that it can be used as an IDE and has found some features helpful, I&#x27;d be interested in hearing about them!
 (N.B. I also work in Haskell. I&#x27;m having similar issues with the Haskell mode that I&#x27;m having with the C mode)

I recently installed Prot&#x27;s &quot;denote&quot; package and I noticed that his package inserts dates in this format: [2022-08-06 Sat 21:56] which I personally like more. Is it possible to make C-c . insert the date in the [2022-08-06 Sat 21:56] format too?

                              <span>use-package is not part of stock Emacs, so it can&#x27;t be assumed that it&#x27;s installed and available for an arbitrary Emacs user. Any use-package-based instructions for installing and setting up a package should also be accompanied by instructions that don&#x27;t require its presence. Otherwise, it might present problems for new Emacs users who aren&#x27;t using a use-package-based Emacs distro.
 (i don&#x27;t have use-package installed myself, not because i have anything against it, but just because i haven&#x27;t felt any need to move my decades-old config of thousands of lines across to using it.)

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I started using helm and I like it and can already feel its power. But there are two difficulties I am not getting solved.
 1) Is it possible to turn off the display of the full path and just show the base filename in Recentf and Files-from-the-current-directory in my helm-mini-buffer? I know it is done in helm-find-files, but I cannot find a way to turn off the path when using the former two.
 2) Helm-recentf and helm-find-files use icons, which I like, because it helps me find the right file quick and at a glance. Files-from-the-current-directory doesn&#x27;t show the icons. I would love to have it consistent, as I have both in a helm-mini-buffer, Recentf and Current-directory. Do you know a way to achieve this?
 Thank you so much for any advice!
 Best regards
 Titus

                              <span>I changed cl-pushnew to pushnew in a file which used it and it worked.
 After looking at the info it seems that there is some conflict between cl and cl-lib and having both installed seems to the problem.
 The conclusion for me is that although cl-pushnew is defined in cl-lib the loading of cl seemed to void it in some way.
 Every now and then I get a warning that I should use cl is deprecated. How do I get rid of it? I don&#x27;t think I have require&#x27;d it in my own code, but other libraries seem to depend on it.
 Info on pushnew
 pushnew is an alias for ‘cl-pushnew’ in ‘cl.el’. (pushnew X PLACE [KEYWORD VALUE]...) Add X to the list stored in PLACE unless X is already in the list. PLACE is a generalized variable that stores a list. Like (push X PLACE), except that PLACE is unmodified if X is ‘eql’ to an element already in the list stored in PLACE. Keywords supported: :test :test-not :key

                              <span>Hello, Ive been using ivy for a while now, and its been blooming smooth sailing. One thing i havent figured out though is how to prioritize specific completions; my search-fu is failing me here. What i want is to be able to provide a list of interactive functions (I only need this for executing extended commands) that, should they be in the list of completions, should be placed first in the completion list. For example, currently if i type in sly connect, the function sly-connect isnt first, that honor goes to sly-list-connections. As there ⠀isnt any way to narrow down completion to just sly-connect without replacing the space with a hyphen, i have to add it to the list of functions i have to type literally. So, is there any way to prioritize certain completions? Or, do you have other recommendations for how to solve this issue without needing to remember specific functions? Thanks!

                              <span>I wrote a package that uses ryo-modal in order to provide colon commands like in vim and kakoune. However, unlike other colon commands I have seen in Emacs, it is also compatible with interactive completion and marginalia. screenshot. So far there are only basic commands I put in as a POC, but I would like to reimplement more of kakoune&#x27;s functionality.

 I also have a repo for ryo leader keys that are similar to doom emacs, and my modified kakoune.el.
 I only have written lisp for a brief time, so these packages could probably be improved on.

                              <span>Since I&#x27;ve freed my Cmd key to be used as Super, I would like to build code with s-b.
 project-compile does a good job, but it&#x27;s interactive, and using it programmatically doesn&#x27;t seem to be an option.
 Unless there&#x27;s some weird overrides?
 Either way, I&#x27;ve copied and pasted the command to be non-interactive:
 (defun ct/project-compile (command) &quot;Run &#x60;compile&#x27; non-interactively in the project root with &#x60;command&#x27;.&quot; (let ((default-directory (project-root (project-current t))) (compilation-buffer-name-function (or project-compilation-buffer-name-function compilation-buffer-name-function))) (compile command))) 
 I&#x27;m then using it thus:
 (defun ct/swift-build-command () (interactive) (ct/project-compile &quot;swift build&quot;)) (define-key swift-mode-map (kbd &quot;s-b&quot;) #&#x27;ct/swift-build-command) 
 (Could also use a lambda, but I don&#x27;t mind the named function.)
  
How would you approach this? 
  
Not use (compile &quot;swift build&quot;), but drop down another level and use (compilation-start &quot;swift build&quot;) directly?
 Locally let-override compile-command to be the command I want, e.g. &quot;swift build&quot;?

                              <span>I decided to give FiraCode Mono a try. Since I&#x27;d like some extra glyphs I&#x27;m actually using the patched Nerd Font version. 
 I also like to have comment faces italic 
 (custom-theme-set-faces ... ... &#x60;(font-lock-comment-delimiter-face ((t (:foreground ,my/comment-colour :slant italic)))) &#x60;(font-lock-comment-face ((t (:foreground ,my/comment-colour :slant italic)))) ... ) 
 There is no italic variant of the font though. 
 Is there any way to simulate or fake italics?

                              <span>Hi all,
 I would like to keep two org-mode &quot;presets&quot;, one for outliners (with indentation, folding, lightweight headings, etc) and one for long form writing (where headings are sections, indentation is undesirable, etc). Startup options act very early in the initialization process and there is no hook to change them AFAICS. Furthermore, I would like to avoid changing the indentation/folding/highlighting state once it has already been wrongly initialized. And I don&#x27;t want to set all relevant options on a per-file basis. Ideally I would like to programatically match files based on their paths or even some new startup option or keyword, like say &quot;#+outline&quot;. So I thought of a before advice that sets the desired options as local variables, but to no avail. For example, here is the advice I use…</span>

                              <span>If you are using Doom Emacs, there are many goodies for org mode by just setting up the module flags https://docs.doomemacs.org/latest/modules/lang/org/#/description/module-flags
 The cool thing is if you enable other languages/config, for example rest client package &#x60;rest&#x60;, then the org babel package &#x60;ob-rest&#x60; will be automatically included.
 Here are my top 3 favorite list of flags:
  
+dragndrop: Enable drag-and-drop support for images and files;
 +pretty: Enables pretty unicode symbols for bullets and priorities, and better syntax highlighting for latex. 
 +roam2: Enables org-roam v2

                              <span>I’m trying to learn Haskell and I’m loving it so far. I just wondered if I really pursue this, will it improve my earning potential? I know it’s superficial but money can be a great motivator as well.
 Has anyone transitioned from imperative programming to functional programming (i.e, Haskell) professionally and made a significant improvement in how much they make? 
 I’m clueless on the job market for it and hoping to hear some personal stories.

                              <span>When newcomers begin with their first steps in Scala, for example building a simple rest API, they&#x27;re guided towards the Typelevel ecosystem, http4s or similar. While Scala itself is an advanced language that takes time to learn, adding functional programming on top of that is unbearable for like 99% of newcomers. Doesn&#x27;t seem like the Scala community embraces the standard Scala anymore, which makes this language for the &quot;elite&quot; only. Back in the day, Akka was sold a silver bullet to all problems and the overhead of complexity wasn&#x27;t worth it for most. It seems like those pure functional libraries have the same problem, they have an even bigger overhead of complexity. It would be nice to have an ecosystem of standard Scala libraries that don&#x27;t try to enforce a different style of programming and they will be the standard goto for newcomers. Otherwise, it seems like Scala will continue to decline in popularity since newcomers are not able to absorb the complexity of purely functional programming.

                              <span>I have been using org-ref to embed citations in files and I can open them up in a pdf by pressing the C-c C-o p command. But I think it would be more useful to automatically open it in org noter so that I can see the pdf on one side and my notes on the other side which is more readable and easier to understand than just displaying a pdf. I was curious to know how others have achieved this because often times I have citations in my notes and I want to refresh my memory so I would like to see the notes I took for that citation rather than just the pdf?

                              <span>Hi everyone, looking to use Anaconda Python in Emacs again. Several years ago I was using elpy and it was pretty simple to set up. Now following these instructions, I include in my .emacs file:
 (setq-custom python-shell-interpreter &quot;C:/ProgramData/Anaconda3/Scripts/jupyter.exe&quot;) (setq-custom python-shell-interpreter-args &quot;console --simple-prompt&quot;) (setq python-shell-completion-native-enable nil) 
 but then I get
 Error executing Jupyter command &#x27;console&#x27;: [WinError 5] Access is denied 
 So I run Emacs in Administrator mode, but then I can&#x27;t work with matplotlib.pyplot interactively because I think it&#x27;s using a temporary graphics directory that is not anticipated by the Administrator account. 
 Anyone know how to fix it, or have it working another way? Or I wonder if switching to eglot or lsp-mode is better. According to this post, it&#x27;s better to stick with language modes in Emacs if they exist and use the language server only for those that don&#x27;t.
 Edit in case this isn&#x27;t the case with everyone, using a regular python or ipython shell causes python to freeze when I generate plots wit the matplotlib.pyplot library.

                              <span>Hi I&#x27;m very new to emacs and I wanted to try some of the tools available. I saw it has an ebook reader called nov (which seems to be the only maintained one) so I gave it a shot. I immediately noticed some issues with the rendering of the document. Here&#x27;s a side by side of the exact same position in the book, rendered by nov on the left, and by zathura on the right, this is not a PDF, it&#x27;s an epub file: https://i.imgur.com/KcYblln.png
 Notice the complety lack of formatting on the first paragraph, or rather, at all. I don&#x27;t think I need to point out the problems, they are pretty clear on their own.
 How can I fix this? Is it even possible to fix it?
 This is all the configuration I have for nov:
 (setq nov-text-width 60) (setq visual-fill-column-center-text t) (add-to-list &#x27;auto-mode-alist &#x27;(&quot;\\.epub\\&#x27;&quot; . nov-mode)) 
 I don&#x27;t really know how to extend it to be honest, or anything at all. I understand very basic elisp (like function calls and setting variables) but that&#x27;s it. I do have plenty of programming experience, I just don&#x27;t know elisp well enough yet.
 I&#x27;ve searched through the internet but there&#x27;s very few results, and the few there were kinda went over my head. Any help is appreciated, thanks.

                              <span>Hi all, I&#x27;ve been a long time user of Ivy and Counsel but a couple of days ago I decided to give Vertico, Embark and Consult a try. I&#x27;m very joyful with them so far, however I&#x27;m having a couple of issues: - 1. I&#x27;ve read that using Embark to collect a list of grep results should result in a grep-mode buffer. I used to use Ivy to produce an occur buffer which I could then edit allowing me to make changes across multiple files easily. Getting a grep-mode buffer sounded good to me as I could then use wgrep to edit these‏‏‎‏‏‎‏‏‎‏‏‎­matches directly in a similar way. However, when I collect these results (via embark-collect-live, embark-collect-snapshot or embark-export) I always end up with an embark-collect-mode buffer. I cannot see a way from here to make this a grep-mode buffer or to make changes to these matches in the same way I would in an editable occur buffer. 2. In the collected results as mentioned in the first question, if I press RET on any of these results I get the following error: Error running timer ‘consult--async-after-change’: (buffer-read-only #). I&#x27;m currently using Emacs 28.0.50 and I use Evil mode. Any help on the above would be greatly appreciated!

                              <span>I have a data pipeline that does not use spark. A major challenge is debugging and replaying data. 
 I have buy in to refactor the data pipeline so that’s each steps inputs are serializable. I don’t really have bug-in to make everything truly spark based.
 My understanding is that spark works by essentially serializing objects and distributing them. It can even deal with functions (I’m aware of the memory consequences of poorly thinking about closure). 
 Would it be possible (relatively easy) to serialize instances of classes (steps in my data pipeline) to disk, and then build a test framework that deserializes those classes and allows me to debug and step through them later?

                              <span>It&#x27;s been a struggle trying to find an out-of-the-box APM solution for Haskell. I looked at New Relic and DataDog but nothing available out of the box. They have support for Ruby On Rails, Javas, C# .etc and it&#x27;s just a simple config change to get the whole thing wired up. DataDog provides some instruction on how to build our own span and add monitor where we need in codes but we just don&#x27;t have the bandwidth to take on another tool we have to build.
 Perhaps, I might have missed something but it shouldn&#x27;t be this hard to find an APM solution similar to what New Relic or DataDog offer for Haskell. Any suggestions, guys?

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I&#x27;m looking for a 6 month unpaid internship with a company using Haskell (or Purescript or Elm) in production. The reason that I&#x27;m specifying that it be unpaid is that I&#x27;m doing it through the DoD Skillbridge program, which allows separating military servicemembers to intern with a private company for six months prior to the end of their contract. 
 I have a background in web development using Rails and a little React/Node, and I&#x27;ve been learning Haskell in my spare time. I&#x27;ve begun reaching out to companies that are already postured to work with Skillbridge interns, but I&#x27;m most excited about working in Haskell. 
 Do you have any suggestions about where I can find companies that would like to have a ~junior Haskell programmer and can support good quality mentorship? That company would have to register with the program but it&#x27;s genuinely not difficult, just a bit slow.
 Edit: I would be available to start in May 2023; when a company signs up for the program, it can take 90-120 days to be approved, thus the lead time. I am a US citizen (in the US) but can relocate anywhere or work remotely.

 For anyone who uses it, PLEASE BACKUP YOUR FILES FIRST! I lost a tiny bit of data while I was developing this code because I didn&#x27;t follow my own advice :(. Also, please let me know if you have any problems -- just put a comment on the gist. And star the gist if you like it :)

                              <span>I apologize in advance if I happened to miss that in the documentation.
 What I am looking for is to customize Org that way so while being on a bullet point
 RET creates a new one (like it usually is the case on other programs like Obsidian or Logseq)
 and C-RET (or M-RET) continues the bullet point across multiple lines (like it is the case on Logseq).
 Thank you in advance. Any help is appreciated.

                              <span>I like the idea of only horizontally scrolling the current line, ie. (setq auto-hscroll-mode &#x27;current-line), but it has a few quirks.
 First, if you scroll to the end of a long line, and then move to the next line, it will horizontally scroll that line, even if it easily fits on the screen. This pushes most of the short line off the left edge of the screen.
 Second, It would be nice for point to stay as far right as possible (at the left edge of the right margin) when horizontally scrolling. This would make it so point would stay a few columns from the right edge the entire time the line is horizontally scrolled. So even when moving point left, the line under point would horizontally scroll to the right until the line is no longer horizontally scrolling, then point would actually start moving toward the left edge of the screen.
 Does anyone know of such a thing? or can anyone help point me in the right direction to create a minor mode that would do this?

                              <span>Recently I was having trouble with my qtile config, made some errors and got booted back to the tty... For ducks sake not again! I slowly began muttering to myself, until I realized there was no need for the bloat that is a window manager.
 startx /usr/bin/emacs -geometry 223x58-0-0
 This command is a gift from the gods, all you could ever want. Set as an alias to &#x27;emacs-tty&#x27;!
 The only downfall is the fonts... Not really sure what fonts can be used, and emojis aren&#x27;t working. If anyone knows how to solve this that would be great.
 Other than that, stop torturing yourself with a non-graphical emacs!!

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been using lsp for a while on my laptop to edit c files (clangd). It works brilliantly.
 ​
 I just started using it on another computer, and although it works fine for the first buffer I open in a project, every subsequent buffer that I open highlights an error that one of the included libraries is &quot;not found.&quot; I use CMake, so I&#x27;ve pointed to the build/compile_commands.json, which seems to be picked up when I open the first buffer, but for some reason, every other buffer after the first does not see it _unless_ I restart the workspace.
 ​
 Summary:
 I need to restart my lsp workspace in every buffer after the first in a project for it to pick up the correct compile_commands.json, but it seems to work on another computer.
 I&#x27;m not sure what I can do to debug this, since the logs printed to clangd::stderr and lsp-log don&#x27;t show anything abnormal. Anyone have any pointers on where I can look next?

 can anyone tell me how to fix that problem?

                              <span>Hey folks,
 I&#x27;ve recently been trying to get off dropbox and iCloud in favour of risilio sync, synching and seafile.
 I&#x27;m having a lot of trouble with conflicts though, it seems that every change causes a conflict that I have to resolve manually.
 I hate to say it, but dropbox was the most robust solution. I wanted to stop paying a monthly fee and own my data, but the friction it has introduced is unexpected. 
 What do you use and what&#x27;s your workflow like?

Then I&#x27;ve created a new C# project via dotnet new console and opened Program.cs via emacs -nw Program.cs. I&#x27;ve started company mode and lsp one via these consecutive commands: M-x company-mode, M-x lsp. I&#x27;ve expected to see list of available methods of Console class but nothing is shown except WriteLine. I use this LSP for C#. Is it normal behavior? Why Python support is better here? Maybe I have to configure smth to fix it?

 Just now I just get an empty file, and I can&#x27;t figure out why the &#x27;auto-insert&#x27; functionality does not work. 
 Any advice to have it work again?

                              <span>I am on emacs 29. I don&#x27;t have a fancy setup. I just start emacs with the &quot;emacs&quot; command. I still see the message &quot;For information about GNU Emacs...&quot; in the echo area. Why is it not working?
 I also used a string constant (of my username) instead of user-login-name, but it still does not work.
 Thanks!

 Never mind, it works if I try it on a new project created via &#x60;cargo new&#x60;. Probably shouldn&#x27;t have tested it on the &#x60;rustlings&#x60; exercises :&#x27;). Still just in the beginning of my rust journey so wasn&#x27;t clear when I could expect the completion to work (I presume it has to do with the &#x60;toml&#x60; file and the project structure, but happy to be corrected).
 Leaving my original post here though in case someone else faces the same &quot;issue&quot; as me in the future.
 Original post
 I am just starting to learn rust, and want to use eglot as my LSP client (as I am also using it for other languages). I am unable to get code completion and some other LSP features working. I have tried it with both lsp-mode and eglot and corfu and company, so I&#x27;m not sure which part of my config is causing the issue (and …</span>

 You can use this source to show the tab-line&#x27;s buffers in the consult-buffer.
 Add this source to the &quot;consult-buffer-sources&quot;.

                              <span>I have a question in regards to buffers when using multiple windows. Let&#x27;s say I have my frame split into 2 windows. Then, I have Buffer A displaying in Window 1. If I were to open Buffer A in Window 2, I am able to do so with no change to Window 1, etc. 
 This could be a odd late night thought, but is there a way to make Buffer A only displayed in one Window at a time? In my above example, Window 2 currently would display Buffer A and so would Window 1. I want Window 1 to display something else, perhaps another buffer I have opened or even some default value when Buffer A is opened in Window 2. 
 Thanks in Advance.

                              <span>I have to combined Maybe and Either into MayEither, with three constructors for Left, Right and Nothing called MyLeft, MyRight and MyNothing.
 This is what I did:
 data MayEither &#x3D; Maybe { myNothing :: Nothing } | Either { myLeft :: Left } | Either { myRight :: Right } deriving Show 
 But this gives me a Multiple declarations of ‘Either’ error.
 How can I properly combine the types?

                              <span>I am tasked with writing a functor instance for the MyList type defined below, leaving its original structure as is.
 data MyList a &#x3D; Elem a (MyList a) | Null (MyList a) | Done deriving Show 
 This is what I tried doing, by following this StackOverflow guide https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55191289/haskell-custom-functor-instance-on-data-type-with-function-constructor:
 instance Functor MyList where fmap f (Elem x xs) &#x3D; Elem x xs fmap f (Null x) &#x3D; Null x fmap f (Done) &#x3D; Done 
 But this gives these errors:
 Couldn&#x27;t match type ‘a’ with ‘b’
 ‘a’ is a rigid type variable bound by
 the type signature for:
 fmap :: forall a b. (a -&gt; b) -&gt; MyList a -&gt; MyList b
 at Main.hs:66:3-6
 ‘b’ is a rigid type variable bound by
 the type signature for:
 fmap :: forall a b. (a -&gt; b) -&gt; MyList a -&gt; MyList b
 at Main.hs:66:3-6
 Expected type: MyList b
 Actual type: MyList a
 • In the expression: Elem x xs
 In an equation for ‘fmap’: fmap f (Elem x xs) &#x3D; Elem x xs
 In the instance declaration for ‘Functor MyList’
 • Relevant bindings include
 xs :: MyList a (bound at Main.hs:66:18)
 x :: a (bound at Main.hs:66:16)
 f :: a -&gt; b (bound at Main.hs:66:8)
 fmap :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; MyList a -&gt; MyList b (bound at Main.hs:66:3)
 How do I write this properly?
 Edit: I&#x27;ve edited the functor code block after seeing u/TheSteelOverlord&#x27;s comment.

                              <span>I wrote a dieToInt function that converts Die values (that can be between One and Six) to an integer.
 This is a helper function for roll2int that returns the sum of a list of Die values.
 So, roll2int [One, Two, Three] should return 1+2+3&#x3D;3+3&#x3D;6.
 --{-3} data Die &#x3D; One | Two | Three | Four | Five | Six deriving (Show, Eq) --{-3a} type Dice &#x3D; [Die] --{-3b} Check roll2int definition dieToInt :: Die -&gt; Int dieToInt One &#x3D; 1 dieToInt Two &#x3D; 2 dieToInt Three &#x3D; 3 dieToInt Four &#x3D; 4 dieToInt Five &#x3D; 5 dieToInt Six &#x3D; 6 roll2int :: Dice -&gt; Int roll2Int _ &#x3D; 0 roll2Int dice &#x3D; sum (map dieToInt dice) 
 I tried using this print statement print(roll2int[One, Two, Three]) in the main function to test, but I get an error message:
 Main.hs:46:1: error: The type signature for ‘roll2int’ lacks an accompanying binding Perhaps you meant ‘roll2Int’ (Defined at Main.hs:47:1) | 46 | roll2int :: Dice -&gt; Int 
 I gave a definition and an implementation of roll2die, so what is the issue?
 This is for a homework assignment.

 I&#x27;m currently writing rust for blockchain applications at a high frequency trading firm and thinking about making the switch. I love the idea of 1) writing haskell all day 2) having flexibility to take significant time off between projects or during a slow period 3) learning about a ton of different problem domains and 4) learning from other great haskell engineers

                              <span>It&#x27;s been a few years since I&#x27;ve dove into Haskell, and I&#x27;m currently preparing for a role where I may get to do some Haskell (What?! I know.).
 With that said, assume I&#x27;ve been living in a cave since 2014. What are some of the major changes in GHC and the set of commonly used packages since then? Is there a list that someone is keeping up somewhere? That would be ideal. My google-fu is failing me.
 An example would be the use of the introduction of the ghc-bignum package. I recall reading about some kind of &quot;regression&quot; regarding the readability of some common compiler errors, but I can&#x27;t seem to find it now.

 I wanted to share a new tool I&#x27;ve created for playing around with the diagrams library (https://hackage.haskell.org/package/diagrams) to visualize an implementation of the scanline-stack flood fill algorithm.
 The core of the algorithm is borrowed from rosetta code:
 https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Bitmap/Flood_fill#Haskell
 Please check out the GitHub repository below for more details, and to try it out yourself!

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to, in a point-free manner, create a function that takes in an Int and a function (a-&gt;a) and that produces the list with the function applied to it. 
 This is the original function: g x y &#x3D; [ y z | z &lt;- [1..x]]
 My first thought was:
 g&#x27; &#x3D; flip take $ iterate (+1) 1 --This would create a partially applied function which takes in an Int to create a list of that length.
 However I&#x27;m not sure how to apply a function to this list. Since the value produced by g&#x27; is not an actual list, I can&#x27;t make it the input of fmap or map. I&#x27;m not sure how to continue from here. 
 In a perfect world I&#x27;d write
 g &#x3D; flip fmap $ flip take $ iterate (+1) 1
 and then call
 g (+1) 3 which would produce [2,3,4], but it doesn&#x27;t. Any help would be appreciated.

Diagnose memory leaks on PINNED values with GHC 9.2.1 and up by Ruben Astudillo
But there was still a thorn on this approach: ByteStrings. On the Haskell heap these are PINNED objects. What this means is that the copying garbage collector gives them special treatment when moving values between the from space to the to space and lets them fixed in place.

After more than a decade of slow but steady growth, Nix gained a lot of traction in the past few years, causing its community to expand at an astonishing rate.
But this growth hasn’t been without issue.
As consultants, we see that nearly all of our clients that are using Nix are, at best, annoyed by the accidental complexity that comes with it.
Some of them even decide to back off because of that, leaving with a nondescript feeling that Nix is not something to be used for solving real-world problems.
It appears the Nix ecosystem has now reached a point where it can either become a credible player in the industry or get stuck with being labeled “research-quality”, a proof of concept, not suitable for serious use.

                              <span>While operations like pulling in my Inbox causes everything to momentarily freeze, I could live with this.
 But, sometimes, Wanderlust will just freeze without provocation and I&#x27;ll end up having to dump my Emacs and open it, again.
 This can consistently happen, without fail, if the internet connection drops (which, unfortunately, mine does often).
 Does anyone know of any workaround for this? I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a fair comparison or not but I actually don&#x27;t remember Gnus locking up my Emacs, at all (or, at least, in any way that didn&#x27;t pass relatively soon), let alone causing a crash.

                              <span>Anyone happen to use minimap-mode (elpa)? I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot and it seems nice. But when I, i.e. split-window-right I find that the two vertical panes are not distributed evenly across the frame minus the minimap window. How would I approach fixing this?

                              <span>I would like to have a file posts.org and inside of it I would have multiple &quot;posts&quot; such as:
 * A post Some content * Another post some other content 
 The default result of org-publish-all is to build a single posts.html. Is there a way to split up top-level headings into their own html pages?
 One thought I had was to write an elisp function that does this prior to the publishing function being called, but I&#x27;d rather avoid that solution as it&#x27;s another step in the build process.

                              <span>curious on the specific workflows to fork a project on github all the way to contributing a pull request. The manual describes a lot of options, some steps can take place on github vs others on emacs - how do you guys normally go about it?
  
forking the repo - this you do on github then save the links to the original project and your fork? 
 clone your fork (or original?) regular magit can do the clone, or commandline, or forge?
 add the original project remote calling it upstream if you cloned your own copy (or perhaps adding your fork as another remote if you cloned the original?)
 hereafter everything can be done in forge or do any of you still switch to browser for some things?

                              <span>As the title says. I recently installed emacs 28.1 with native comp on Arch in wslg, and noticed that everything, even small files, were slowing to a crawl when scrolling. A profile showed that linum-mode was to blame. I disabled it and voilá, yeah, everything was smooth. That got me puzzled, since I expected that having linum-mode native would make it faster, not slower (though I understand things are not that simple, specially in a VM).
 Now I had to switch to display-line-numbers-mode, which works perfectly, but, as many others, I really don&#x27;t like the positioning.
 Any ideas? Either of speeding up linum-mode or changing position of display-line-numbers-mode,

                              <span>I am working with Ansible and want to see diffs in the ansible-vaults. The guide [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29937195/how-to-diff-ansible-vault-changes) 
 It is basically just to add your vault files to .gitattributes with something like /**/vault.yml diff&#x3D;ansible-vault merge&#x3D;binary and changing git settings with git config --global diff.ansible-vault.textconv &quot;ansible-vault view. This works perfectly in the terminal, but has the side effect that vault changes no longer appear in Magit diffs.
 Does anybody know how to make this work in our lovely Magit?

                              <span>I seem to have still a directory org-20171205 in my .emacs.d/elpa dir. Al of a sudden this seems to give problems when starting emacs on fedora36 (standard install from the fedora repos) stating the following error: org-compat.el: Error: Wrong number of arguments (3 . 4)
 I found some stuff about a change in a macro or function with the switch to emacs 28 but I do not understand why I start to get this now weeks after switching to fedora 36. 
 It also is not clear how I can solve this, how to get the latest org-mode (wasn&#x27;t that included in emacs ?) and why it only starts creating problems now 
 Can I delete the 20171205 version?

I have the &quot;web mode&quot; package installed and enabled even though I don&#x27;t think Corfu uses that for auto-completion like Company does. Beside Corfu I have the cape package installed.

                              <span>I am trying to make a GHC cross-compiler (i.e. runs on Windows, outputs Mac binary). I have followed the steps given in the official page, and I have everything set up fine, but I can&#x27;t find out which OS identifier I should use for Mac.
 According to the page, I need to specify the OS as -- or ---. After digging into the GHC source distribution, I&#x27;m pretty sure it is aarch64-apple-macos-*, but I can&#x27;t figure out what the ABI should be. I also see aarch64-apple-darwin14 in the source. What should I use?

(&quot;What is incremental writing&quot; )


This video demonstrates the critical idea of deconstructing or digesting reading and using the components or nutrients as building blocks for writing/idea creation and synthesis. It goes over the process with a lapidarist skill. Reading and writing are not something that abides by a deadline but is enjoyable without time pressures. It is rewarding to write on three-year-old ideas and see them pop up in a review queue. Reminiscence is falling in love all over again. New note:
What is meant by reminiscing 202207302048
I want to consider the prioritization aspects of zettelkasting in this video. I see his point about how with everything prioritized and working from a prioritized list, you can be sure what time you spend zettelkasting is in the areas you have made your highest priorities.
I&#x27;ve not felt the need to set zettelkasting priorities formally, have you?</span>

                              <span>Non-coder vim-enthusiast. New to zettelkasten. Actually struggling less with zettelkasten, at least at the moment, than vim. Specifically with getting syncing going between vim installations on iPhone, iPad, and MacBook.
Vim on the mobile devices is actually iVim, an amazing porting of vim to the iOS environment. It has a command (:iexdir) that, in spite of Apple’s sandboxing, makes it possible to establish connections with external directories. I’ve used it to set up a connection to iCloud Drive. My intention was to enable syncing between my iPhone, iPad, and MacBook..
I’ve adopted wiki.vim as my writing plugin of choice. I requires that I place a path to to the root directory in my .vimrc. With a lot of trial-and-error and pleas for help I’ve tried without success to identify a workable path to the directory I’ve placed in iCloud Drive.
At one point I thought I’d discovered a workable path in a file in iVim’s system directories. It is “ /private/var/mobile/Containers/Data/Application/BBD512C7-CCA0-47FD-B2F2-0AF17D9D03B5/Documents/wiki”. Alas, iVim does not recognize the path.
I desperation, wanting to move on from fiddling with technology to must writing, I’ve signed up for Bear Notes, mainly for the syncing between devices it provides. I feel like a traitor. I would much prefer to continue experimenting with zettelkasten with vim as my companion.
I write in the unlikely chance, and the desperate hope, that someone here might be able to point me to a solution.
Thanks in any case.</span>
