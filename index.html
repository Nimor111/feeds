                              <span>There is a little Org issue that has been bugging me for quite long. When using Org for task management, subheadings are typically used to define tasks, often grouped under one heading that defines a project. For instance:
 * Project 1 ** TODO Task a ** TODO Task b * Project 2 ** TODO Task c 
 Org folds blank lines at the end of any subtree into the latest subheading. So, when I start unfolding Project 1, Task b shows as Task b..., i.e. it seems to have some hidden description which is misleading. I always go to see what is under &#x60;Task b...&#x60; only to find its empty.
 A compromise is to set org-cycle-separator-lines to 1. However, this prevents the user from writing descriptions that are well spaced, as this will introduce unwanted blank lines in the folded view. For example:
 * Project 1 ** TODO Task a - [ ] Subtask - [ ] Subtask ** TODO Task b 
 The above code shows as:
 * Project 1 ** TODO Task a... ** TODO Task b

                              <span>The org-manual states that heading Python chunks with &#x60;:results value table&#x60; (see Python Source Code Blocks in Org Mode) will result in a pandas df being output as an org-table. However, that doesn&#x27;t seem to work on my machine.
 For example:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 +begin_src python :results value table
 import pandas as pd data &#x3D; {&#x27;State&#x27;:[&#x27;CA&#x27;, &#x27;TX&#x27;, &#x27;FL&#x27;], &#x27;Pop&#x27;:[39029342, 30029572, 22244823]} df &#x3D; pd.DataFrame(data) return df
 +end_src
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 results in:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 +RESULTS:
 | State Pop | &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 whereas I was expecting:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 +RESULTS:
 | | State | Pop | |---+-------+----------| | 0 | CA | 39029342 | | 1 | TX | 30029572 | | 2 | FL | 22244823 | &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 In order to get the above, I currently have to use this hacky solution with the tabluate package:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 +begin_src python :results value raw :return tabulate(df, headers&#x3D;df.columns, tablefmt&#x3D;&#x27;orgtbl&#x27;)
 from tabulate import tabulate import pandas as pd data &#x3D; {&#x27;State&#x27;:[&#x27;CA&#x27;, &#x27;TX&#x27;, &#x27;FL&#x27;], &#x27;Pop&#x27;:[39029342, 30029572, 22244823]} df &#x3D; pd.DataFrame(data)
 +end_src
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 which works as expected. So ... does org-babel support pandas tables and I&#x27;m just doing it wrong, or does it not actually support pandas tables yet?

                              <span>I’ve been happily using org mode for quite awhile now, but this is the first major downside I’ve come across in terms of how it compares to Obsidian. Collectively, these plugins seem to provide a nice way of enforcing a scheme of sorts on your notes and allowing you to surface a dynamic view of your data based on the values of your “schema fields”.
 Does org / org-roam have any analogue to these?

                              <span>Hi all!
 Thought I would showcase an early version of mouse, a small HTTP server library I have been working on this week.
 The general idea is that it&#x27;s supposed to be small and simple, not fully featured, but it&#x27;s also not supposed to get in your way, that&#x27;s why the &quot;DSL&quot; is pretty heavily ingrained into the regular usage. It also has no dependencies (aside from scalatest).
 I intend on improving things like performance and adding a few features to make it a bit nicer before making it to 1.0. A few things to expect:
  
HTTP Client library
 Route testing library
 WebSocket support
 HTTP 2.0 support
 TLS configuration
  
Please feel free to leave your thoughts and if you find any issues, please feel free to open one.

                              <span>I&#x27;m learning Haskell with an online course, there was a task to define this fibonacci numbers stream
 fibStream :: [Integer] fibStream &#x3D; 0 : 1 : zipWith (+) fibStream (drop 1 fibStream) 
 Since lazy evaluation seemed to me do the hard work here I figured I could throw together something similar with Python
 from itertools import islice def fib(): yield 0 yield 1 yield from map(lambda xy: xy[0] + xy[1], zip(fib(), islice(fib(), 1, None))) 
 However, Haskell easily handles even a 1000 elements, while Python is starting to crawl at 31. This doesn&#x27;t look like a tail-call recursion to me. What gives?
 EDIT: all zip, map and islice are lazy AFAIK. fib is a generator function that only evaluates when the next element is demanded.

If I now open org-agenda, it takes over the entire frame rather than appearing in one of the windows. Once I close org-agenda I lose the split window configuration. I have figured out how to restore it using winner package, but is it possible to restrict org-agenda to not take the entire frame?

 Your regular contacts show up in the inbox and you don&#x27;t have to do much for only real emails appear there. But also real emails from contacts you don&#x27;t know about show up. I assume they read the emails and do some type of automatic filtering. 
 Is this possible in mu4e and if so, now?

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking for a way to copy images to MacOS Photos App. I know this is probably a rather complex operation, but I also know that there are some die-hard Emacs users out there who use Mac every day. 🍎 So I&#x27;m curious if this is possible? Is there a package? I can&#x27;t seem to find one.
 I&#x27;m just looking for a way to send images via dired directly to MacOS library at the very least. Since I use dirvish to go through photo sets/collections (Color-tagging them with dired-delight), and I find it to be so much faster to do with dired than with a GUI, I&#x27;m just hoping that it&#x27;s possible for emacs to take me &quot;the next step&quot; to moving the marked ones to the photos libraries I have for MacOS. So, any feedback is welcome! thx! 🙃

                              <span>emacs_without_a_keyboard was an interesting read - so how about emacs on chromebooks?
 I had a cursory look at the chromebook keyboard and got scared - is it like Mac where the keys have different names but similar functions? 
 Perhaps there are config changes or packages needed? 
 Perhaps it&#x27;s as different as evil vs holy modes?
 Or is it basically impossible to use emacs on chromebooks?

                              <span>Hello everyone, 
 Hope your weekend is off to a great start. I&#x27;m starting my journey on Vim and possibly Emacs (although, who am I kidding, seeing some of its capabilities it seems an inevitability). One thing that would accelerate my timeline to jumping into learning Emacs is if it handled a particular use case that is crucial to me.
 See, I do a lot of work in Jupyter Notebooks (Python) for school and ML/prototyping in general. One thing I like about notebooks is that if you make a mistake and the program fails, well, your intermediate calculations are still stored in memory and accessible. It&#x27;s a graceful fail. If you fail through terminal, well, could be the end of what you calculated. 
 The problem I have with Jupyter Notebooks is that they do not support parallel processing conveniently. I saw that Emacs has some interesting capabilities around notebook support; I believe org mode is what&#x27;s used. 
 I was interested in knowing if anyone uses Emacs as a way to get the best of both worlds: a way to run things using multiprocessing, but should things fail, it store the states in memory to rerun it.
 I appreciate any/all insight you have!

                              <span>I&#x27;m using emacs 30 (current master) and the available zotxt mode. When I insert a reference, I get access to selecting it, but then I get a  [[zotero://select/items/nil]]  thing imported and a  [error] request--callback: peculiar error: 400  error. Any idea what that could be?

                              <span>Is there a solution for inserting a filename to a buffer (either to a normal buffer, or to the minibuffer) using a recursive fuzzy search, using the vertico + consult + corfu + cape ecosystem? Something like what consult-find does, but instead of opening the selected file, insert the path of it to a buffer.
 We have cape-file, but it doesn&#x27;t fuzzy search in a recursive way.

 wait, it was in the C-c keymap. Let&#x27;s cancel this keybinding by... um... pressing ESC repeatedly?
 C-x ESC ESC: executes (repeat-complex-command)
  
How can one cancel the current key chain in Emacs? I also tried C-x C-g but i get a message C-x C-g is undefined which makes me think that it isn&#x27;t reserved for this kind of purpose.

                              <span>After having used org-agenda just for my todos and scheduled events, I just found out one can use it to search one&#x27;s notes too. It works great! With one bad side-effect. I added several org directories using:
 (setq org-agenda-text-search-extra-files (directory-files-recursively &quot;~/Writer/&quot; &quot;\\.org$&quot;))
 Now, after searching, all the files the agenda had opened to look for my search string have been added to the list of recent files. So (find-file (completing-read &quot;Recent files: &quot; recentf-list)) becomes less useful because it doesn&#x27;t show the latest opened files on top of the list anymore, but instead a complete list of all my org-files.
 Is there a way to prevent agenda search from caching files into recentf-list?
 Thank you very much for any help!

 (not including the fact that Microsoft owns vscode and that some parts are not open source, im aware of that, so no need to mention it)

 I&#x27;m an elisp noob, and I recently wrote a function to get the references on a wikipedia page. I plan on using it for org-mode/org-roam so I can do research faster (even though there&#x27;s probably already a package for that sort of thing). Unfortunately, it&#x27;s probably not as robust as I would like to think it is, as some of the dois/isbns appear to be missing in some wikipedia pages I&#x27;ve tested. Here it is for reference:
 (defun get-wikipedia-references (subject) &quot;Gets references for a wikipedia article&quot; (let ((wikipedia-prefix-url &quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/&quot;)) (with-current-buffer (url-retrieve-synchronously (concat wikipedia-prefix-url subject)) (let* ((html-start (progn (goto-char (point-min)) (re-search-forward &quot;^$&quot;))) (dom (libxml-parse-html-region (1+ (point)) (…</span>

The general concept is to use existing projects to handle some of the details and make it easier to experiment with the unique features of the language. These ideas also try to avoid a lot of the standard web application implementation details that are usually covered in courses or books.

Write a ui for hledger https://hledger.org/ . One already exists, but if you store the transactions as text blobs in a database and dump out hledger text files based on different things you want to do you could experiment with: 
 Making projections by generating future transaction entries
 Running &quot;what if&quot; scenarios by filtering out past transactions and replacing them with generated transactions
 Different ways of tagging/categorizing/automating transactions 
 
 Write a toy version of Docker Compose https://docs.docker.com/compose/ . Create a file format that describes a set of containers, read the file format, and use the shell &#x60;docker&#x60; (or &#x60;podman&#x60;) command to poll/start/stop the containers. You can experiment with different ways to start up different subsets of containers, ways of swapping different types of containers for different roles ...etc.
 Write a ui for MegaMek https://megamek.org/ . One already exists but mostly the idea is to use the existing game rules implementation and focus on experimenting with language features. Not sure how feasible this one is.
 Implement the ActivityPub protocol to create a Mastodon server. Not sure how good this one is for learning but there are probably a lot of interesting choices to make.

 With the help and tips from you, I think I&#x27;ve managed to make this tic-tac-toe game look less Pythonic...
 I will let you be the judge of that, and I accept any and all criticism. I wish to know what I could do to make this look even more idiomatic. Go ham!
 Since I now use recursion instead of loops, and the way I handled certain statements, it is not exactly the same as my last version, but it plays virtually the same.
 The code feels much less verbose and much cleaner now. I love it, but I&#x27;m sure I can do better with a second refactor after gaining some insight again!
 I still feel like I&#x27;m underutilizing certain things like Option, but it&#x27;s a step up.

                              <span>Hi
 I have picked Scala as my first language, but am unable to find any courses/ resources that focus on functional programming for absolute beginners i.e. people who have no background in programming at all. There are beginner level courses that teach Scala with OOP. Courses/resources that teach functional style assume experience in Java or some other language. Why are there no Scala functional programming courses/resources for absolute beginners?

 Coming from mainly Python, I decided to look into Scala after having dabbled in some Ocaml and Haskell. I am still very FP-curious and my Python-code is starting to be cluttered with maps and reductions, not to mention lambdas. Scala looks to be very elegant, aesthetically and otherwise.
 I recently made tic-tac-toe in Python for a Uni introductory programming course, so that&#x27;s what I tried to make here, having barely looked at the &#x27;getting started&#x27;-docs.
 import scala.io.StdIn.readLine import Math.floorMod case class Pos(val x: Int, val y: Int): def fromInput: Pos &#x3D; Pos(floorMod(x-1, 3), floorMod(3-y, 3)) end Pos class Board: private var b: List[List[Int]] &#x3D; { for i &lt;- 0 until 3 yield { for j &lt;- 0 until 3 yield 0}.toList }.toList def board: List[List[Int]] …</span>

Another installment of the What Are You Working On? thread. Add to this thread by telling us what is happening in and around your ZK journey. Join the community and enlighten us about your knowledge path trajectory. I do this for selfish reasons. It helps me clarify my goals and visualize my thinking. And sometimes, a conversation sparks an idea worth exploring.
Ideas I&#x27;m exploring with my ZK:
I discovered that sociologists who study leisure classify me as a Literary Leisure Hobbyist. I had no idea. My PKM work feeds that part of my persona.
Rucking as an old man
How my Blind-side Bias develops and the effect it has on me.
If you do what so few people do, what you do can have superlinear performance returns.
Things I&#x27;m reading:
Calvino, Italo. Invisible Cities. 2013.
Attia, Peter and Gifford, Bill. Outlive: the science &amp; art of longevity. 2023.
Music I&#x27;m listening to:
Peter Pearson
Jazz Saxophone Playlist

                              <span>Probably better for r/showerthoughts - but is anyone using emacs without a keyboard?
 I assume the core audience of emacs is devs and sysadmins (and perhaps academics with org and org roam) 
 But surely somebody somewhere is doing those jobs / using assistive tech (dragon etc?) to interface with emacs?

                              <span>I came across citar, and I am trying to use citar-org-roam to take notes on academic papers. I must be missing something about usage/configuration. I get &quot;Make sure &#x27;citar-notes-paths&#x27; and &#x27;citar-file-note-extensions&#x27; are non-nil&quot; when I try to use citar-open-notes. If I set the &#x27;citar-notes-paths&#x27; variable, then citar creates normal notes without using the template defined above.
 Here&#x27;s what is in my init.el:
 (use-package org-roam :custom (org-roam-directory &quot;~/RoamNotes&quot;) (org-roam-completion-everywhere t) (org-roam-capture-templates &#x27;((&quot;d&quot; &quot;default&quot; plain &quot;%?&quot; :target (file+head &quot;%-${slug}.org&quot; &quot;#+title: ${title}\n&quot;) :unnarrowed t) (&quot;n&quot; &quot;literature note&quot; plain &quot;* Heading\n %?&quot; :target (file+head &quot;%(expand-file-name (or citar-org-roam-subdir \&quot;\&quot;) org-roam-directory)/${citar-citekey}.org&quot; &quot;#+title: ${citar-citekey} (${citar-date}). ${note-title}.\n#+created: %U\n#+last_modified: %U\n\n&quot;) :unnarrowed t))) :bind ((&quot;C-c n l&quot; . org-roam-buffer-toggle) (&quot;C-c n f&quot; . org-roam-node-find) (&quot;C-c n g&quot; . org-roam-graph) (&quot;C-c n i&quot; . org-roam-node-insert) (&quot;C-c n c&quot; . org-roam-capture) (&quot;C-c n j&quot; . org-roam-dailies-capture-today) :map org-mode-map (&quot;C-M-i&quot; . completion-at-point)) :config (setq org-roam-node-display-template (concat &quot;${title:*} &quot; (propertize &quot;${tags:10}&quot; &#x27;face &#x27;org-tag))) (org-roam-db-autosync-mode) (require &#x27;org-roam-protocol)) (use-package citar :custom (citar-bibliography &#x27;(&quot;~/bib/referencess.bib&quot;)) :hook (LaTeX-mode . citar-capf-setup) (org-mode . citar-capf-setup)) (use-package citar-org-roam :after (citar org-roam) :config (setq citar-org-roam-note-title-template &quot;${author} - ${title}&quot;) (setq citar-org-roam-capture-template-key &quot;n&quot;) (citar-org-roam-mode))

                              <span>I am trying to replace straight with Elpaca but I have some troubles with loading some of my local packages that are not from Melpa.
 The use-case is to load laas a package for latex snippets. I use the following code
 ​
 (use-package aas :elpaca nil :load-path (lambda () (expand-file-name &quot;custom/&quot; user-emacs-directory)) ) (use-package laas :elpaca nil :load-path (lambda () (expand-file-name &quot;custom/&quot; user-emacs-directory)) :config (aas-set-snippets &#x27;laas-mode ;; set condition! :cond #&#x27;texmathp ; expand only while in math &quot;On&quot; &quot;O(n)&quot; &quot;O1&quot; &quot;O(1)&quot; ;; bind to functions! &quot;Sum&quot; (lambda () (interactive) (yas-expand-snippet &quot;\\sum_{$1}^{$2} $0&quot;)) &quot;Span&quot; (lambda () (interactive) (yas-expand-snippet &quot;\\Span($1)$0&quot;)) &quot;lr(&quot; (lambda () (interactive) (yas-expand-snippet &quot;\\left($0\\right)&quot;)) &quot;lr[&quot; (lambda () (interactive) (yas-expand-snippet &quot;\\left[$0\\right]&quot;)) &quot;lr{&quot; (lambda () (interactive) (yas-expand-snippet &quot;\\left\\{$0\\right\\}&quot;)) ) (laas-mode) ) 
 ​
 Both files &#x60;aas.el&#x60; and &#x60;laas.el&#x60; are in my &#x60;(lambda () (expand-file-name &quot;custom/&quot; user-emacs-directory))&#x60; durectory and with straight these lines of code worked well but when I switched to Elpaca, laas was not loaded anymore. I tried to add :after tex, do not change anything. I tried to add a hook for latex mode and it also do not change, the laas package is not even loaded.
 Can someone help me with this please?

 (leader-key &quot;w&quot; elfeed)
 Is it possible to combine the two in a simple way? I tried using :general keyword in use-package ensuring that it loads after general, but it still does not work...
 Below is what I tried.
  (use-package elfeed :after general :general (:prefix &quot;M-m&quot; &quot;w&quot; #&#x27;elfeed))

 UPDATE: Thank you all for answers. I&#x27;ve worked around this issue by removing parts of the custom-theme-set-faces! and editing color values directly in the
 I still don&#x27;t understand how faces/fonts and their styles are supposed to work in emacs, but I&#x27;m in the middle of transition from KDE wayland to Hyprland and there are already way way way too many issues to deal with. Fingers crossed this won&#x27;t break this time.

                              <span>According to the GitHub page, the org-journal package does not (yet) support having multiple journals. But the author does say:
  
But it should be possible to switch the value of org-journal-directory using a custom function or directory local variables.
  
Has anyone done this, or something similar? I currently use journaling for most (generally basic) notes, but I am also working on a research project for which I&#x27;d like to keep the related journal entries co-located with the project files. That is, my &quot;primary&quot; journal is kept on Dropbox, but I&#x27;d like the project journal to be in the GitHub repo I&#x27;ve set up.
 Any thoughts?

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;m interested and new to learn the Clash for hardware development but I don&#x27;t have any functional programming experience. Thus, I jumped started from what the following article taught. First, it&#x27;s to install the stack and run the Clash over the stack as shown below.
 However, it seems the Clash version is really old. If I&#x27;d like to use latest Clash version which it may have latest library, what should I do? I&#x27;ve already install the following version and works in my Ubuntu environment. On top of that, is there any online cloud-based way to run Clash? Thank you

                              <span>So my BT keyboard + trackpad is looking worse for wear.
 It was cheap and cheerful with a winning form factor. Other KBs came and went, but it survived.
 I need a replacement.
 It&#x27;s been used with emacs (DooM) with my tablet and / or phone for a few years, and has a few shortcomings (see yellow sticker).
 I now also have a SteamDeck, which is basically an Arch box, and I&#x27;d love a BT keyboard with that.
 Does anyone have a portable setup they&#x27;d like to share? 
 Also, is there an emacs-y way to lisp my way out of things like:
  
keys being missing (#);
 ESC being on a function layer?

I&#x27;m wondering if it would be possible to speed it up using some other tool such as &#x60;fd&#x60;. I noticed that the consult README talks about &#x60;consult-fd&#x60; but I cannot locate that function anywhere in my version which is I think the latest &#x60;0.35&#x60;. Can anyone help with this?
 Also, similarly, consult-grep is a bit slow. Wondering if one can swap in &#x60;ag&#x60; for example?

                              <span>As the title says, when i run M-x ispell when it reaches a word under an org mode heading it won&#x27;t unfold the heading, so my cursor is just on the actual heading and not the incorrect word and then when i quit ispell i can&#x27;t unfold that heading with tab. I have to kill and yank the heading to get it working again. I pasted some of my init file below incase that helps.
  
I&#x27;ve tried this with flyspell disabled and get the same results, so i think it is an ispell issue.
 I have also tried this with emacs -q and running M-x ispell and get the same issue. 
 I&#x27;m using emacs+ on mac

In the theme code there&#x27;s a variable (mode-line-padding 10) which I assume sets the width of the mode line. Is there a way for me to reset this value in my init file, either before or after loading the theme code, to make it narrower? I&#x27;m using the code below to load it.
 (use-package adwaita-dark-theme :ensure t :config (load-theme &#x27;adwaita-dark t))

                              <span>Hi, I heard about Pieces.app on the Software Engineering podcast today, and I was wondering how others handle the logging or journaling of snapshot coding and research material in Org Mode. (I use org mode for practically everything in my note-taking, journaling and work tracking)
 I do, as the podcast describes, search for code snippets and pointers or ideas when prototyping code, sometimes it is content I can use right away or it can be something I just think is neat and possibly use in the future. But I don&#x27;t have what I think is a great way of storing and retrieving this material.
 I use org-dailies every day for journaling and tag the posts for high-level topics, and org-roam for my comprehensive reading and research. But for programming journaling this really is me remembering to file the write-up (in org-daillies) at the end of the day or work on a project on that day, but it&#x27;s not ideal for capturing quick text notes or excerpts from web pages etc. 
 Are there good ways to track short snippet-like research detail and even auto-tag the entries with language, target project etc. in org mode?

                              <span>I rather like the deadline functionality and it works great for most shorter term things. I&#x27;ve been building out a goals file that is working quite well. I don&#x27;t have any todo&#x27;s directly in the file but I do like using the deadline functionality to highlight upcoming goals. 
 This works quite well for shorter term goals where I might set it to be 2w - 1mo out to keep it on my radar. It would be nifty if I could map out a few milestones for a goal/project that is longer term such that it will populate on my agenda in a nice highlighted color. 
 I&#x27;ve tried recurring deadlines and setting multiple deadlines but those do not quite work. 
 Any ideas on how to approach this or a starting point to implement this?

                              <span>I wrote this little library to get a fast Haskell implementation of the Myers diff algorithm, which serves as the base of most diffing tools today. This version is basically an adaptation of some Python code from this excellent post, using as many performance tricks as I can.
 It has QuickCheck tests and I&#x27;ve just added some benchmarks to compare it to the existing Diff library. For any performance wizards out there, the core code is quite short and can be found here -- PRs welcome!

                              <span>When you are using a FUNCTOR you are mapping CATEGORIES. Think about that.
 You can think about.. each functor having one category for each argument/result.
 Let&#x27;s describe an arbitrary functor: FunOf (-&gt;) (:~:) () F, this notation describes the categories that F maps.
 The functor F maps three source categories (-&gt;), (:~:) @Type, () using the mapping function mapF:
 F :: Type -&gt; Type -&gt; Type -&gt; Type ^ ^ ^ ^ | | | | (-&gt;) (:~:) () @Type mapF :: (a -&gt; a&#x27;) -&gt; (b :~: b&#x27;) -&gt; (c  (F a b c -&gt; F a&#x27; b&#x27; c&#x27;) 
 Each category maps its respective argument/result: 
 F (a :: Type) (b :: Type) (c :: Type) &#x3D; (res :: Type) | | | | (-&gt;) (:~:) () | | | | v v v v F (a&#x27; :: Type) (b&#x27; :: Type) (c&#x27; :: Type) &#x3D; (res&#x27; :: Type) F F (a :: Type) -&gt; (a&#x27; :: Type) (b…</span>

 I&#x27;ve just begun learning Haskell, and when looking for ressources, I&#x27;ve seen &quot;What I wish I knew when learning Haskell&quot; from Stephen Diehl recommended quite a lot. However, it seems that the hosting site is down, and I&#x27;ve waited but it doesnt seem to come back up. Does anyone know what&#x27;s up, or could send it to me?
 Thanks a lot!

                              <span>So first off here&#x27;s the code
 import scala.collection.parallel.CollectionConverters._
 import scala.util.Random
 @main def main(): Unit &#x3D; {
 val size &#x3D; 1000000
 val tests &#x3D; 5
 val lists &#x3D; for _  x)
 (xs.min to xs.max).par.flatMap(cnts.getOrElse(_, List.empty)).seq
 }
 ​
 the sorting algorithm essentially just groups the input by the identity function and then flatMaps all the groups in order by key. The problem is though when I run this code, the first test finishes and then subsequent tests significantly outperform the first one normally by a factor of 2 or 3. For example on the most recent time I ran this the output was 1632, 904, 696, 605, 722. My only guesses as to why this is are either a caching issue, an issue with System.currentTimeMilis(), or perhaps the compiler being smart about how much space it allocates for the map on subsequent tests based on results from previous tests, but I really have no clue and am wondering if someone has a better guess than me.

                              <span>Hey everyone,
 I am a recruiter at a Signify Technology. I am sure most of you are familiar with us and have been reached out to by one or more of my co-workers in the past for a job.
 The market this year has a been a complete rollercoaster this year, with a ton of layoffs across the entire tech industry and people are struggling to find another role inside the Scala space. Because of the current market conditions, we have noticed inconsistencies between the skills of the engineers vs the compensation packages offered to candidates in this market.
 Therefore, we are conducting an anonymous survey surrounding compensation packages so we can get accurate data to reflect on from last year to see what the difference is. This is completely anonymous, requires no identifying information and only takes roughly 3 minutes to complete.
 If you have the time, we encourage you to take the survey and appreciate any responses to it. Thanks again and enjoy the rest of your day!

I know few apps have this feature but if you had to guess, what would be the &quot;ratio&quot; or read/write in your notes.
I ask this because I&#x27;m working on a [[Knowledge Management]] concept where this ration is extremely important.
I would say mine is 40/60. 40% writing and 60% reading the notes of total time.</span>

                              <span>I know this question has been asked before and I know about org-roam, I am just not sure if org-roam is the right solution for me. Right now, I use one big org file to take notes which I export to pdf. This works nicely, but it would be nice to also have access to the concepts in the larger org file at a granular level (ie. bite-sized notes which reference one another and are organized based on their subject matter). I would also like to tag information that is not in org format, if possible. I was thinking that org-roam &amp; org-transclusion could be used to make main subject files, while org-roam could be used to make a link to an embedded pdf that comes from the concept I am referencing, when I don&#x27;t need to explicitly review the material in whatever notes I am taking. Has anybody done anything like this? Any tips are appreciated. Thanks.

 Thanks to /u/alphapapa for good data for this purpose.
 I&#x27;ve attached what mine looks like, but basically just default modus dark theme.
 Why? If you live in your org-agenda, you probably care about how it looks to some extent.
 Maybe we can share cool parts that improve our living spaces :)

 Is there any version that works well on the older OSes?

 I tried the function suggested here, but I get the error message that says:

The use case is the following:
  
Export org as HTML (to a temp buffer);
 Render the HTML to a browser, my default browser or eww.
  
Any suggestions?

                              <span>Hi.
 Ainother day, another emacs doubt.
 I&#x27;m using ivy-mode, and when I do M-x and write, the order of candidates for completion seems weird for me. I figure it obeys some logic, but I&#x27;d like to change it. For example:
 I do M-x and write coun bu
 Results are:
 counsel-switch-buffer (this one is selected by default)
 counsel-ibuffer
 counsel-buffer-or-recentf
 counsel-minibuffer-history
 For me, counsel-buffer-or-recent should be the first candidate, since that&#x27;s the one with shortest &quot;distance&quot; between a match for coun and a match for bu. Is there a way to make results be sorted by this? So that those 4 candidate should appear like:
 counsel-buffer-or-recentf
 counsel-ibuffer
 counsel-minibuffer-history
 counsel-switch-buffer
 Another example. I make M-x package-install then write consu. There are almost 15 results before consult. Being the shortest one matching perfectly the string, IMHO this should be the first candidate.
 Another example, M-x dire. Results:
 A couple of logical results (because they start with dired-)
 tramp-crypt-add-directory
 dired-jump-other-window
 How is it that dired-jump appears after tramp-crypt-add-directory if the match for dire is further in the tramp-... candidate?
 Any hint on this? 
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>I just switched from neovim to emacs and one thing I miss is coc.nvim. It has a power to turn a barren neovim into anything I ever want from IDEs. I tried to do something like this and emacs learning curve got me. I cobbled together a simple config with eglot, company and rust-mode, but I can&#x27;t get import completion to work. Any suggestions?

 Checking here to see if anyone else has experienced this.
 I searched the GNU bug tracker and (tbh I might not have searched in the right way) but I didn&#x27;t find anything.

                              <span>I am trying to use dired on Windows. But, when I attempt to follow a shortcut in dired, it seems to open the shortcut file itself in a buffer instead of following the shortcut to the target directory.
 I attempted to follow the installation instructions in this file starting on line 51: https://github.com/hidsh/elisp/blob/master/w32-symlinks.el.
 When I byte-compiled the w32-symlinks.el file, Emacs informed me that there were incorrectly escaped quotes in the function located on line 171. I removed those parts of the docstring and byte-compiled the file without error. I also used the following code as specified in the directions.
 (add-hook &#x27;dired-load-hook
 (lambda () (require &#x27;w32-symlinks)))
 But, when I use dired to follow a Windows shortcut it still opens it as a file. 
 Is there another file explorer package that I can use? Is there another solution?
 Thank you for your time.

                              <span>Hey there.
 I&#x27;m a fan of Emacs, like you folks.
 I use Emacs org every day, mainly for my teaching class. Furthermore, I learn Emacs for three years ago.
 But I struggle to achieve my learning of Elisp. For example, taping lisp and elisp code with evil/lispy is a true nightmare (I use Prelude with few modes, btw), not to mention when I type code block within org.
 I knew the learning curve is hard. But I didn&#x27;t expect that much frustration to learn it. The documentation is austere. So few examples are given. There is too little blogs or books about Emacs, specifically about org and babel.
 To illustrate my point, let&#x27;s take the *this* variable in babel, that I found TODAY by CHANCE in this page : https://orgmode.org/manual/Results-of-Evaluation.html.
 It&#x27;s a game changer for a lot of my code, and would deserve a whole page to illustrate it. But no, it&#x27;s given in a «niche» example.
 Don&#x27;t be mistaken, I found Babel/Org/Emacs wonderful, but what a pain in the ass to learn it !
 For such an old and wise piece of software, I can&#x27;t understand why we don&#x27;t have a smooth learning experience with Emacs. A lot of people could benefit Org/Emacs, without the big hinder of the «lack» of documentation (mostly examples).
 Am I the only one to experience this ?
 Edit : *this* is not a &quot;kind of macro&quot; but simply a variable. Thanks u/oantolin.

                              <span>It seems Typelevel is having a diversity panel at their event. Here are a couple of relevant questions in case anyone attending wants to ask: 
  
Travis Brown and several Typelevel members have targeted individuals from minority groups as &quot;collateral damage&quot; in their disputes with JdG over the years. Considering the significant psychological distress this has caused on multiple occasions, and Travis&#x27; close association with Typelevel&#x27;s leadership, will the steering committee address and condemn his cyberstalking tactics? Should the community be concerned about it happening again? 
 
Over the years, Typelevel&#x27;s approach to cancellation campaigns has often been riddled by conflicts of interest, as targets were direct competitors. Are there plans to establish a more principled framework to govern such actions? Particularly when individuals from minority groups are involved, can the community expect decisions to be fair and thoroughly considered?

                              <span>At work we use Akka + zio-1 for our backend services and use datadog java agent to instrument our micro services. I couldn’t find any specific project in datadog agent code base that tries to instrument zio fibers for zio1. But automagically spans are created and propagated downstream correctly across forked fibers that are executed on different threads. I’ve been digging around , debugging to see how datadog is able to correctly propagate the spans but no luck. Can some one help me understand how that is possible? We don’t use zio telemetry or open tracing libraries in these micro services.

                              <span>I&#x27;m a data engineer who has worked mostly in Python. I have some academic experience in C/C++. I&#x27;ve tried learning Spark in the past through a book, but wasn&#x27;t picking up the concepts. I came across rockthejvm through this sub. He sells a Spark course, but in the FAQ, he doesn&#x27;t recommend doing the Spark course if you haven&#x27;t learned Scala. So I started with the Scala course. I&#x27;m finding the explanations to go superficially deep, and explaining a lot of concepts. I&#x27;m in the generics lesson right now, and I&#x27;m looking back at the older lessons, and I wouldn&#x27;t be able to complete the exercises on my own after some time.
 Is there a better way? The best way for me in the past is to just come up with a project and start coding. My ultimate goal is to learn Spark well. If that means getting a decent fluency in Scala, then I&#x27;m ok with it, but I&#x27;m just not picking up the concepts of Scala well with this learning method.

How do I dynamically extract title from EWW and force org-capture to place the note under that title and create an entry for that title if it does not exist in notes.org file. 
 Also is it possible to replace the static filename, and instead dynamically get current filepath so that the template can be reused without editing?

                              <span>Help!
 I have recently transitioned to a custom workflow that relies on org-agenda to track progress on all the projects my team is working on. Overall, I&#x27;m very happy about it: I have a cron job that polls the jira server for updated tickets and refreshes a cache of org files, one per ticket. I wrote my Jira-org bridge and I render jira comments and changelog items one per org item with timestamps, and org-agenda does a fantastic job at showing me all updates, from the respective users. I can open any day and see very nicely what everybody in the team has done. I press capital E and I can even see excerpts of the comments they posted. So far, absolutely fantastic. It&#x27;s literally better and faster than using the Atlassian tools in the web.
 Two things I don&#x27;t like:
 (1) - all the org files are opened as individual buffers. It&#x27;s hundreds of them. Low hundreds but still hundreds. I understand that org-agenda needs to index and reindex them, and also needs to &quot;remotely&quot; update their contents from the agenda view... but why keep them open in a buffer all the time? Can&#x27;t org be configured to lazy open them only on a change?
 (2) - initial indexing is slow and will likely get slower every week. I don&#x27;t mind it for now, because it&#x27;s a price I only pay on a monday morning, and I can even hide it under the emacs server start that I do in crontab @ reboot... but I&#x27;m concerned about the long term sustainability of the solution. By nature, jira tickets will keep growing and growing over time. I only index the ones incurring active changes... but still. Is there a way to better control indexing costs? Is there a way to speed things up? Navigating from one week to another is starting to be a little slow. Yes this is hundreds of tickets and thousands of events, but in 2023 that&#x27;s nothing in terms of data sizes contemporary software handles. Are there tricks to speed org-agenda up?

Diverk: a Reflex app to browse GitHub repos by jecaro
That’s a super simple app that allows you to browse and search in the default branch of a GitHub repo. It can render markdown files. I’m a big note taker and all the notes I take live in a private git repo in this format. That was an additional motivation for me to do this project.
More traversals and more Cabal SAT by Oleg Grenrus
In the previous post I discussed using traversals for batch operations. I forgot to mention any libraries which actually do this. They are kind of hard to find, as often the Traversable usage comes up very …</span>

                              <span>Tweag is excited to announce the first release of nixtract 0.1.0!
This is our first step towards a broader effort to make Nix the best tool to tackle tomorrow’s challenges of the Software Supply Chain.
In order to understand why we need nixtract, let me tell you about the “secret” value of Nixpkgs.

Is it a bird? A plane? It’s a graph!
The Nix language allows you to define the “recipe” to build anything into a package, like the sources and the steps to make the package, but also the dependencies it needs to build.
For instance we can define the recipe for a package that depends on zlib.

 Echo buffer status in minibuffer window, get rid of mode-line.
 features: - light-weight, very simple structure and no many configs compared to feebleline, mini-mdoeline, awesome-tray... - don&#x27;t use mode-line at all, same experience in terminal - port lots of segments from doom-modeline
 Have a try!

                              <span>I built Emacs 29.1 from source a few months ago and it was working pretty smoothly as far as I could tell -- I was mainly using the elfeed-webkit package -- until I tried to use it today and my Emacs session crashed. I was mainly using it in daemon mode, but evem just running emacs -Q and then M-x xwidget-webkit-browse-url RET wikipedia.org results in the error at the end of this post (sorry for the wall of text).
 From the EmacsWiki and from reading /etc/PROBLEMS, I tried to use xwidgets-webkit again with SNAP&#x3D;1 SNAP_NAME&#x3D;1 SNAP_REVISION&#x3D;1 emacs -Q, but it results in the same error.
 It&#x27;s probably an issue with my system rather than Emacs -- I&#x27;m running this on Manjaro Linux, and emacs-version gives:
 GNU Emacs 29.1 (build 2, x86_64-pc-linux-gnu, GTK+ Version 3.24.38, cairo version 1.17.8…</span>

                              <span>Thanks to Andreas (the original author of gccmacs), we can now &quot;redump&quot; Emacs even with some natively compiled elisp in the mix. I&#x27;ve been cautious in my experiments so far, but: this works on Windows!
 From a MSYS2/MINGW64 bash shell:
 $ bin/emacs --batch -Q -eval &#x27;(let ((custom-theme-load-path (list &quot;
/.emacs.d/elpa/cyberpunk-2019-theme-20191008.1133/&quot;))) (require &#x27;&quot;&#x27;&quot;&#x27;erc) (load-theme &#x27;&quot;&#x27;&quot;&#x27;cyberpunk-2019 t) (enable-theme &#x27;&quot;&#x27;&quot;&#x27;cyberpunk-2019) (dump-emacs-portable &quot;erc.pdmp&quot;))&#x27;
 $ bin/runemacs.exe --dump-file erc.pdmp -fs -l 
 This seems to get a &quot;fullboth&quot; frame with my theme pretty fast. Note, I can&#x27;t trigger connection quite yet at that point; the runemacs call is loading my full init, and some parts that take a further moment. 
 Also, the first command, which created the custom portable dump called &quot;erc.pdump&quot; loaded by the second command, was nearly instant. Here&#x27;s a look at what this did to size of the the pdmp file.

 emacs --batch --eval &quot;(while t (print (eval (read))))&quot;
 So I adjusted it to emacs --batch --eval &quot;(while t (print (read)))&quot; and the prompt Lisp expression: is always displayed.

 When I try a command like cat text1.txt | emacs --batch --eval &quot;(while t (print (read)))&quot; it barfs completely, so read is definitely not the function for this, unless I&#x27;m failing to pass some necessary options to it.

                              <span>I have been learning haskell through CIS 194, which was the first thing that was suggested on the Next Steps page on haskell&#x27;s official website. I&#x27;ve read the material for the introduction section, and I&#x27;m now on the first homework. 
 Among other things, one of our tasks is to create a function, doubleEveryOther :: [Integer] -&gt; [Integer], that multiplies every other element in a list by 2, starting from the last element. For instance:
 doubleEveryOther [8,7,6,5] &#x3D;&#x3D; [16,7,12,5] doubleEveryOther [1,2,3] &#x3D;&#x3D; [1,4,3] 
 As a side note, so far we have learned about basic the list operations (described in Learn You a Haskell § starting out): head, tail, last, ... as well as the colons operator : and the ++ operator. 
 So far, the only way I&#x27;ve been able to vaguely define this function is as follow…</span>

                              <span>I was poking around and opened up the README.org file in the Doom Emac&#x27;s faust module and i saw these nifty nagivation things that weren&#x27;t coming form within the file. I didn&#x27;t see anything in the directory that hinted at it (to me) either.
 Can someone please point me to instructions for this? I&#x27;m not ever sure what I should be searching for.
 ​
 edit: this file is where the things are coming from but i don&#x27;t understand how one would construct something like this from scratch or how the pieces fit together.

                              <span>This is going to be lengthy post. I hope someone can help me. I&#x27;m quite new to Haskell, and I&#x27;m not sure where to go from here.
 Recently, as a personal learning project, I decided to write a small virtual memory scanner PeepingTom, similar in behavior to ScanMem, or Cheat Engine.
 It works. I have managed to use it in several games to give myself money, points or whatever. I even have a video demonstration using Hotline Miami in the github page, and automatic tests to ensure that, under the default options, we match the scan results of ScanMem.
 There is one problem though: The initial scan is REALLY slow. 
 I just did a small test using Hotline Miami.
 Scanmem took about 3-4 seconds to scan the entire (filtered) virtual memory. Scanning for the same data types (Int8, Int16, Int32, Int64)…</span>

                              <span>In a 2 window setup, is there a way to make all temporary popup buffers (help, compile, occur, etc) always open in a specific window?
 For example, I have a left and right window. I do most of my work in the left window. When I lookup something in help it opens in the right window which is what I want.
 But let&#x27;s say I&#x27;m in the right window already and look up help, it will open in the left window. Is there a way to make it always open in the right?

                              <span>In Emacs&#x27; Dired, You could conveniently move files from outside into Emacs by simply dragging them there.
 Drag files into dired
 That is effective.
 Emacs has been my faithful companion for over 5 years, and I just stumbled upon this remarkable feature minutes ago.
 Typically, I rely on async-shell-commands to open the current buffer directory in Windows 10&#x27;s File Manager, then move files from folder to folder.
 But, now, this seeming-trival discovery has greatly enhanced my workflow, instill in me a strong sence that Emacs not only coexists within the operating system, but rather embodies the operating system itself.
 While it is true that Windows does not support dragging files from dired buffer to external locations, but I seldom encounter such a requirement in my day-to-day workflows.
 Have you ever had such an experience that discovered an amazing feature after a long time using Emacs？what is it?

                              <span>For about three years now, I&#x27;ve been using org-super-links, but I&#x27;m getting tired of updating its dependencies that I don&#x27;t use (such as helm, and now it seems to need org-super-agenda too). 
 Recently, its searches also started utilizing helm regex search, which is very slow crawling through all my files as it tries to find a match in real time. I&#x27;m unsure if this is a new-ish addition, or perhaps it&#x27;s because I integrated helm more fully within Emacs after org-super-links complained it needed it.
 I&#x27;m looking for a substitute, something that just creates backlinks from the org-mode header ID I&#x27;m standing on. I&#x27;m not interested in org-roam, a big new package that feels like a whole new org-mode built on top of the existing one; I want to go the other way and use something basic. 
 I wonder if anyone here knows of an Emacs built-in solution or something close to it? Does it exist? It feels like such an elementary thing these days it&#x27;s odd it doesn&#x27;t exist..?

                              <span>Is TypeScript a game-changer in web development? We believe, yes. This statically typed superset of JavaScript is designed to scale up the language, making it more robust and maintainable.  While JavaScript is known for its flexibility, TypeScript brings in the added advantage of type safety, reducing the potential for runtime errors. If you work with JavaScript and want to enhance the reliability of your code and provide more predictable and stable tooling to your customers, TypeScript is the right option.</span>

 Cloning or starting a new repo in a practical way to be used with worktrees, for me, always requires some manual process.
 First, I need to follow the recommendation I borrowed from this blogpost: How to use git worktree and in a clean way. It boils down to:
 mkdir my-awesome-project $ cd my-awesome-project $ git clone --bare git@github.com:myname:my-awesome-project.git .bare $ echo &quot;gitdir: ./.bare&quot; &gt; .git 
 But when I do that, git doesn&#x27;t see remote branches anymore. So some stuff won&#x27;t work as normally expected. For that, I have to follow this advice from SO, basically adding to ./bare/config:
 [remote &quot;origin&quot;] fetch &#x3D; +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/* 
 And now I&#x27;m thinking, before I try to automate this. Maybe Magit already does the right thing and I just never knew about it? Or maybe it&#x27;s much simpler than that and all that manual hocus-pocus is not needed?
 How do you use worktrees with Magit? And if you don&#x27;t use worktreees, why is that? Is there even a better way?

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 u/daviwil had released an excellent video in his System Crafters channel, where he showed how to hack org-roam:
 https://systemcrafters.net/build-a-second-brain-in-emacs/5-org-roam-hacks/
 I have copied his code into my config (the function that allows to create a TODO in a project file that we select (or create if not existing) is very useful.
 I want to create a similar one: I want to create an event in a select customer file and to create this customer file if it does not exist.
 The filter of the nodes with the tags &quot;customer&quot; works, but I am stuck with the definition of the content to insert as the event:
 - I want the events to be inserted as subheadings of the heading &quot;History&quot; of the customer file (easy)
 - I want the events to be saved as a tree structure:
 ** Year *** Month **** day ***** Event 1 ***** Event 2.... 
 I am trying to modify his code, but I always have errors
 - I have replaced plain with entry in order to get the content as a heading
 - I have replaced file+head+olp in the template definition by file+olp+datetree
  (org-roam-capture- :node (org-roam-node-read nil (my/org-roam-filter-by-tag &quot;customer&quot;)) :templates &#x27;((&quot;p&quot; &quot;project&quot; entry &quot;* %%?/n%i\n%a&quot; :if-new (file+olp+datetree &quot;%-${slug}.org&quot; &quot;#+title: ${title}\n#+category: ${title}\n#+filetags: project&quot; (&quot;History&quot;)))))) 
 But still I get the error save-excursion: Wrong type argument: integer-or-marker-p, nil&quot;
 What do I get wrong??

                              <span>I&#x27;m finding that defining outline-regexp does not do for me in python-mode what it does for me in other language modes. Someone else on Stack Exchange ran into the same problem, and a suggested answer to their question makes it clear that python-mode preconfigures some definitions for outline-minor-mode. But what those preconfigurations are, and more importantly how to use them, is not documented anywhere I can find.

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;m quite new to emacs. Using doom-emacs I have the following lines in my config.el:
 (after! org (custom-set-faces! &#x27;(org-document-title :height 2.0) &#x27;(org-level-1 :inherit outline-1 :weight extra-bold :height 1.75) &#x27;(org-level-2 :inherit outline-2 :weight bold :height 1.5) &#x27;(org-level-3 :inherit outline-3 :weight bold :height 1.25) &#x27;(org-level-4 :inherit outline-4 :weight bold :height 1.1) &#x27;(org-level-5 :inherit outline-5 :weight semi-bold :height 1.06) &#x27;(org-level-6 :inherit outline-6 :weight semi-bold :height 1.03) &#x27;(org-level-7 :inherit outline-7 :weight semi-bold) &#x27;(org-level-8 :inherit outline-8 :weight semi-bold) ;; Ensure that anything that should be fixed-pitch in org buffers appears that ;; way &#x27;(org-block nil :foreground nil :inherit &#x27;fixed-pitch) &#x27;(org-code nil :inherit &#x27;(shadow fixed-pitch)) &#x27;(org-table nil :inherit &#x27;(shadow fixed-pitch)) &#x27;(org-verbatim nil :inherit &#x27;(shadow fixed-pitch)) &#x27;(org-special-keyword nil :inherit &#x27;(font-lock-comment-face fixed-pitch)) &#x27;(org-meta-line nil :inherit &#x27;(font-lock-comment-face fixed-pitch)) &#x27;(org-checkbox nil :inherit &#x27;fixed-pitch))) 
 This works fine, but gives me a strange-looking columnview (because many todo-items do have different fontsizes now).
 How can I ensure, that - when using columnview - a monospace font with a fixed fontsize is used?

 If that is not possible the only way I see round it will be to replace better off replacing the whole line with a string splicing the replacements where the groups are.

                              <span>When local repository moved ahead and remote also moved ahead, the remote doesn&#x27;t allow Push. You have to first Pull. But sometimes pull doesn&#x27;t work straight forward, you have to specify the merge strategy. This happens when &#x60;--ff-only&#x60; doesn&#x27;t work for some reason.
 In such a scenario, I normally use &#x60;--no-rebase&#x60; option. It creates a new commit with the merge. I can use &#x60;--rebase&#x60; also. But that is my personal preference. I want to keep the history of changes as is.
 I couldn&#x27;t find &#x60;--no-rebase&#x60; option in the Magit interface. Any idea, how to do that using Magit?
 ChatGPT suggests that instead of direct Pull i.e. &#x60;F u&#x60;, I should first fetch and then merge i.e. &#x60;f u&#x60; followed by merging aka &#x60;m m&#x60;. Although, I haven&#x27;t tried it yet. But just wanted to ask, if there is a direct way to achieve &#x60;--no-rebase&#x60; in Pull.

                              <span>I want to build a full stack application with Scala. Just for fun and for learning. 
 The ideia is that it should work similarly as an ecommerce application.
 Do I have to do it with ScalaJS? 
 Should I use Akka (Pekko) or ZIO? 
 I plan to start it very simple and with time improve it. I would really appreciate suggestions and recommendations from people that already did something similar, and what you would have done differently from what you did.
 Thanks in advance guys.

                              <span>Hi, 
 I need an advice on picking up a library for simple asynchronous inter-process communication, preferably message queues or RPC. I have an application that launches background processes and would like to have bi-directional communication between them. All the processes are children of the same process, are running on the same machine, so ideally it could be something shared memory-based, for speed and simplicity. I am aware of the Cloud Haskell project but it seems to be abandoned and it feels a bit too heavyweight for the task. The bindings for unix IPC I could find on hackage look a bit half-baked or very low-level or don&#x27;t have queue functionality. ZeroMQ? Never used it, so no opinion. DBus seems to need the DBus daemon running. Any other options? 
 Thanks in advance.

 So I am trying to install Haskell on Windows 10.
 I run this script in Powershell:
 Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force;[System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol &#x3D; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; try { Invoke-Command -ScriptBlock ([ScriptBlock]::Create((Invoke-WebRequest https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/sh/bootstrap-haskell.ps1 -UseBasicParsing))) -ArgumentList $true } catch { Write-Error $_ }
 These are the steps I did after:
 1. I put the Haskell install inside C:\Users\F\Haskell 2. Confiremd the Cabal directory to be in C:\Users\F\Haskell\cabal 3. Said not to haskell-language-server (HLS) 4. Said no to stack 5. Installed the default MSy…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m maintaining a package and enjoy developing it with Haskell. But I&#x27;m thinking of expanding target audience via expose the package to other languages. 
 The primitive idea is: build package to a shared library ( .so/.dll ) , and expose it to C world and JVM world via JNI .
 I&#x27;ve lookup at https://wiki.haskell.org/FFI_complete_examples
 But seems that it require to &#x60;rewrite&#x60; all GADT fields from Haskell primitive to C primitive. ie.
 Int -&gt; CInt 
 So, this method requires to rewrite all GADT structures. Is there a way to expose functions and GADT to C automatically without changing current code ?
 Thanks for your help

                              <span>Hi all,
 I know that iCloud Drive is not the best product for this purpose, but I have to use it for other reasons.
 So, I learned online that the path to iCloud Drive is ~/Library/Mobile\ Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs However, I cannot find my beorg folder using this path either in terminal or in emacs. Actually, it is not just for beorg. About 1/3 of the folders in my iCloud which I can access from Finder do not show up if I use the path in terminal or emacs.
 Any solutions? Thank you!

                              <span>With every start of Emacs 29, native comp starts compiling the files cl-loaddefs.el and tramp-loaddefs.el, but I can&#x27;t find corresponding *.eln files in (all) native-lisp directories. (Native compiling other (internal &amp; extra) packages works, it is not an issue with access rights.)
 What is the use of that behavior?
 I could disable that native jit compiling, by putting following line in my early-init.el
 (setq native-comp-jit-compilation-deny-list &#x27;(&quot;.*-loaddefs.el.gz&quot;)) 
 Would that break some facilities within Emacs, if I do so?

 I was using my search engine to look for available Emacs integrations for the open (and local) https://gpt4all.io/ when I realized that I could not find a single one.
 Is there somebody who&#x27;s using GPT4All with Emacs already and did not publish his/her integration?

                              <span>When editing common lisp with slime and emacs, I&#x27;d like a speedbar listing, alternately, top level definitions in the file I&#x27;m editing, and top level definitions in the package I&#x27;m looking at (which may be a superset of definitions in the file). Preferably sorted by type of definition (function, macro, constant, etc) and/or alphabetically.
 Is there some emacs tooling for this? I haven&#x27;t found it.

                              <span>I hope every completion done inside minibuffer is repeatable by vertico-repeat, including commands invoked by M-x. Vertico, however, didn&#x27;t include execute-extended-command as a repeatable session by default. You can be seen it by examining vertico-repeat-filter variable. So I have to customize it like this in Doom Emacs:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;elisp
 (after! vertico-repeat (setq vertico-repeat-filter (remove &#x27;execute-extended-command vertico-repeat-filter))) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 The question is execute-extended-command seems to be a reasonable default completing session, why does vertico excludes it?

 If I were cool, and a senior developer with tons of experience, I would write blog post and would share my in-detail opinion. But I&#x27;m just gonna leave it at that, claim that I coined the term, and leave all the actual discussion to all of you who know more of what you are talking about.
 P.S.: Or maybe Scalanization? I&#x27;m open to suggestions :D\ P.P.S: I think I like &quot;Scalification&quot; best. Pioneered by IBM.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve tried on FreeBSD and Debian Linux. I have installed GHCup and used it to pull in GHC and Cabal. I&#x27;ve tried GHC-9.4.7 (installed by GHCup by default) and also versions 9.8.1, 9.6.3, and 9.7.2. I&#x27;ve tried cabal versions 3.6.2 and 3.10.1.0. I&#x27;ve combined these in every possible way. I managed to get haskell-language-server installed without headaches, but every time I try to install hoogle, I get errors. The below error is the most common.
 Please can anyone help me out? I&#x27;m desperate to learn Haskell, but I&#x27;ve been struggling for almost 3 full days just to get the tools built with no success.

                              <span>Hello everyone, 
 I have made a blog using org-publish, HTML and CSS nothing else and although it&#x27;s still a work in progress; today I feel comfortable enough to share it with you, the community.
 https://0xblockz.xyz
 I am a rust developer with a passion for cryptography, security and backend development. My first post is one about just that. 
 Since I&#x27;m not using a static site generator every time I create a new post I have to update the html of my homepage to include a link to that post but later on I&#x27;d like to add orgs sitemap functionality to handle that for me. If anyone has experience with elisp maybe you could help me write the function to do so.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve made a journalctl-mode package for viewing and monitoring typical Linux Journald service logs to get a richer experience than basic journalctl execution in async shell buffers.
 It&#x27;s in a bare-bones state, but I&#x27;ve been finding it very useful for almost a year now. I keep wanting to fix/enhance a few more things before I publicise, but ... I think others could find it as useful as I do already. It&#x27;s not yet published on ELPA etc., but I intend to soon.
 The stand out features are:
  
Multiple simultaneous journalctl processes may run simultaneously with the output interleaved. E.g.: 
  simultaneously view a broad query, say at &#x27;--priority warning&#x27; along with a more narrowly focused &#x27;--priority debug&#x27; query.

 I&#x27;ve been digging around to see if there&#x27;s a package for this but the closest I&#x27;ve found is expand-region and that&#x27;s not quite it...
 Take the indent level and block at the line where the point currently sits and set the mark region to the end of the current block + indent level. I hope that explanation is clear.
 This seems very much in the wheelhouse of Emacs and I&#x27;m guessing it exists -- maybe even in core as opposed to a package -- and I&#x27;m just not looking in the right place.
 thx

 when set arguments, it might requires one more line:
 #+BEGIN_SRC gnuplot :file images/sd01.png g(x) &#x3D; exp(-0.5*(x/s)**2)/s plot s&#x3D;1 g(x), s&#x3D;2 g(x), s&#x3D;3 g(x) #+END_SRC

 I feel frustrated, how I wish could acquainted with such a tool a decade ago while grappling with the challenges of visualizing mathematical formulas.

                              <span>I&#x27;m considering switching from Gmail to Fastmail, not necessarily due to privacy concerns but because I&#x27;m bothered by the fact that I need extra hacks and additional settings on both the Gmail and Emacs side to use their service properly with mbsync and mu4e. Also, I have the impression that Google will complicate access to IMAP in the future. They&#x27;re already starting with things like passkey. I might be talking nonsense, but that&#x27;s how I see things. Not long ago, they started detecting ad blockers in the browser while browsing YouTube, so as a company, they can change whatever they want overnight.
 I want to emphasize that I don&#x27;t have a lot of money to spare, and I&#x27;m taking this step more for my peace of mind, to make sure I won&#x27;t have any issues in the future. However, I would still like to ask for your advice, are you satisfied with Fastmail, have you had any problems with their service while using Mu4e and Emacs?
 I&#x27;ve noticed that they also support a feature called &#x27;masked mail&#x27; and an option to add additional emails. If, for example, I want to display an email address on my CV that isn&#x27;t my primary address and I&#x27;d like to deactivate it at some point, would it be better to use the option to add a new address or the &quot;masked mail&quot; option instead? Also, this separate mail or masked mail need a separate Mu4e context?
 I would be grateful for any suggestions. Thank you.

                              <span>What is your workflow of maintaining logs of literate scripts? I converted most of my scripts to org-mode and tangle them out to scripts for running them. I want to be able to run them within org-babel itself. I use mostly python and bash. I have two laptops one personal and one for work and a desktop. Mostly I want my laptop and desktop in sync so that I can work in either of them depending upon the need. When I want to install or update any of the tools I use in one system I want that to be replicated in the other, not automatically.
 I also need to version the literate scripts, in the sense with history visible in the org file itself. I want the org file to capture my thought flow and the evolution of the code so that I can understand it later by just looking through the file not by meddling with git.
 Does any have similar need and a workflow I can copy?

 Obviously one can solve the questions with Scala 2... But it&#x27;s been years. And the practice helps us juniors a lot.
 I&#x27;ve been building my own repo copy pasting the problems + copying them back and translating to Scala 2, and having fun building a framework to test and run all the problems as I solve them, because it&#x27;s fun, but I really just wanna see how I&#x27;m doing compared to the community, and then try to do better.

                              <span>What tools do you use to measure the performance of you JVM applications in terms of speed/memory usage? I am aware of the jmh project (https://github.com/openjdk/jmh) but I was wondering if there where other projects or approaches people use.

 Am I missing something?
 Kudos to Adam Warski and Softwaremill for creating such a great tool!

                              <span>Hi !
 I see that there are still frequent commits to the repo, but no release since May 2023. Releases were quite regular and frequent before that.
 Also, the docs seem inconsistent, switching versions from a page to another.
 I ask because I am considering a little side projet with zio, zio-http, zio-quill,... But I am wondering if the choice will stand the test of time. I am coming from Akka/pekko and I am doing this project also to learn zio and see if it is worth it.
 Thanks in advance ! ;)

                              <span>Hello Emacs Community!, 
 As everyone on this community, I&#x27;m an Emacs power user and have several niceties configured, gnus for Email, Doom Emacs, and I heavily use org mode, I recently used it for a &#x27;Incident Playbook&#x27; which was basically making an incident and responding to it following certain steps, more of a Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR) work. 
 So, I made a server in Ansible, made a test malware that will be ran in this server (delete a log file idk), and proceeded to do everything directly in org-mode, running every command via tramp to the server, getting any info from the disk and getting a dd and such. Finally I made a whole document with full details on the server in that point in time, which was pretty interesting as I could have this as a template for future incidents and have certain commands saved for this.
 And I got the idea, wouldn&#x27;t it be interesting to have org mode files like these but for testing specific vulnerabilities?, even using a tool like NixOS or Guix to make commands that will get the old version x.x.x of nginx and I could test a vulnerability there, so it is also reproducible and everyone can use the org file and test this vulnerability?, basically more of a study and proof of concept rather than something more &#x27;heavy&#x27; as in business related.
 ​
 Does anyone have a similar use case?, I would love to hear for them as I want to go into the DFIR route.
 ​
 TLDR. Not specific to an emacs programming or library question, but much more of a broader question about a cybersecurity workflow.

                              <span>Hi.
 Still learning Emacs but happy with it so far. One thing i&#x27;m trying to find out is this. I&#x27;m OK with Emacs creating recovery files from which i can, well, recover my work after emacs is closed. However, if I save my files, I have no need for these #filename# or filename~ files that populate my folders. Is there a way to make emacs keep creating these recovery files, but deleting them if I *save* my actual files?

                              <span>Hi there,
 I use orgmode links extensively. In particular, I have hundreds (our thousands) of links to emails (in notmuch). I would very much like to add a tag to any email that is being referenced from org.
 So, what I need to do first is be able to find all matches of a regular expression in all my org files. Non-interactively.
 I have been playing around with xref-matches-in-directory but that would not cover when multiple emails are mentioned in the same line...
 I have been looking and looking but everything I find missed the non-interactive part. 
 So: What is the function to &quot;search for this REGEX in FILES in DIR and return the first capture group&quot;? (the regex has a capture group for the msgid)
 The regex:  (rx-to-string (rx &quot;notmuch:id:&quot; (group (1+ (not &quot;]&quot;)))))

 Does query-replace-regex or some other function provide the ability to replace the match with the value of a function like something like (format-time-string (match 1))?

 I have accomplished the first part using the regex match [0-9]\{10\}

                              <span>hi everyone, I am working in IT support, and occur (and even more multi-occur-in-matching-buffer) ist my tool of choice.
 But I would like it to do more (because why not?) I would like to be able to ignore matches, if terms (let&#x27;s name them excludees) are found in the next 5 lines from the search string match or within a number of lines defined by a variable.
 It would allow to save excludees as a list, and ignore certain matches when for instance the &quot;ERROR&quot; relates to a known bug, and we do not want to see it in occur searches any longer.
 Ideally, this could be triggered by a keymap in occur-mode-map, (toggle-ignore-excludees), so that it is up to the user to activate it or not.
 is there already a similar function that does it? How would you proceed to achieve this?
 thanks for your feedback

 I assume this error only happens with emacs native functions, not with the most of the commands coming from other packages.
 How can I fix this? thanks for your help.

 Given that eglot has been part of the core emacs, I believe this is a long lasting wish for a lot of emacsers that has finally been fulfilled. (a stand alone DAP implementation that does not rely on LSP-mode)

 There are no updates in &quot;software update&quot; except safari which I&#x27;m guessing will not help this.

                              <span>We are hiring! My team (Plutus Core at IOG) is looking for up to two compiler engineers. Plutus Core is a smart contract language for the Cardano blockchain.
 The main responsibility of the role is to work with a team of experienced engineers and researchers in designing and implementing missing features in Cardano smart contract languages, compilers and runtime systems, and writing documentation for users of the languages.
 We love statically typed functional languages, and we are committed to building a friendly, welcoming, and diverse community of Cardano smart contract developers.

Job posting: https://apply.workable.com/io-global/j/3F1AAE5F43/. Note that the Location section, which currently says &quot;US only&quot;, is inaccurate, and I&#x27;m working to get it updated. We are certainly also hiring from Europe (in fact that would be preferred as most of the current team members reside in Europe, and most of the meetings occur in afternoons of European time), and we also have some flexibility to hire from other parts of the world.
 Codebase: https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus. The main components include four languages (Plutus Tx, Plutus IR, Typed Plutus Core, Untyped Plutus Core), compilers from one to the next, the Untyped Plutus Core interpreter, and Agda formalization.
 Doc: https://plutus.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html
 Plutus Core spec: https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus/tree/master/doc/plutus-core-spec

                              <span>We all read (???) the Steve Yegge post where he says he as &quot;hundreds&quot; of info manuals installed in his computer.
 The thing is, after quite a bit of web searching, I only managed to get git, gitman, Python, Common Lisp, and SICP. 
 Is there any repository/FTP/storage that has a treasure trove of info manuals ready to add to Emacs?
 Thank you!

                              <span>Ever since DistroTube finished his Configuring Emacs series a couple of months ago, I moved from using (the somewhat monolithic and impenetrable in my opinion) Doom Emacs every now and then, to seriously using Emacs with his config about a month ago, and I&#x27;ve fallen in love. So much so that I clearly wanted to start using Emacs as my window manager.
 I really like having a statusbar, so since I had been using dwm (also, if you want dwm-like window management, Edwina is the package for you), I figured it was finally time to set Polybar up. I did, but as many people experienced, Polybar had the issue of workspaces being off by one with the standard EMWH module. I looked around, and wasn&#x27;t able to find the solution anywhere else, so I&#x27;ll post my solution.
 The crux of the problem lies in an a…</span>

                              <span>Hello fellow emacs users, I&#x27;m having an issue setting up lsp-java (I&#x27;m pretty new to emacs, so there&#x27;s that) My config is &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; (use-package lsp-mode :hook (java-mode . lsp-deferred) :commands (lsp lsp-deferred) :config (lsp-enable-which-key-integration t)) (use-package lsp-java :config (add-hook &#x27;java-mode-hook #&#x27;lsp))
  and it seems to work well, but whenever i open an individual java file to test it, i get a prompt that this file is not a project file, and gives me options  test.java is not part of any project.
 i &#x3D;&#x3D;&gt; Import project root /home/maksatr/Documents/ I &#x3D;&#x3D;&gt; Import project by selecting root directory interactively . &#x3D;&#x3D;&gt; Import project at current directory /home/maksatr/Documents/ d &#x3D;&#x3D;&gt; Do not ask again for the current project by adding /home/maksatr/Documents/ to lsp-session-folders-blocklist D &#x3D;&#x3D;&gt; Do not ask again for the current project by selecting ignore path interactively n &#x3D;&#x3D;&gt; Do nothing: ask again when opening other files from the current project
 Select action: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; is there a way to set it up so that it works with just a java file as well, instead of working only with large projects? I tried eglot, and it seems to work well as a linter, but for some reason it does not have autocomplete.

                              <span>I have been experimenting with PlantUML in Org Babel recently, and it has greatly enhanced my ability to visualize concepts mentally. During post-meal walks, I often engage in mental planning exercises, such as sketching Gantt charts. However, my deficient drawing abilities consistently impede my progress, particularly when it comes to mentally manipulating lines, arrows, and objects. Since discovering PlantUML, the visualization skills have steadily improved, thanks to its intuitive text-to-graph syntax.
 When reading &quot;Marcovaldo: Or, The Seasons in the City&quot; before bedtime for sleep aid, I spend a significant amount of time immersed in its pleasing pages, sometimes without a clear sense of progress.

                              <span>I&#x27;m an Emacs newbie (using Doom Emacs with GNU Emacs 29.1). I came from vim, and battling with undo there was crazy enough, but I won using this:
 inoremap  u inoremap  u inoremap  u inoremap  u inoremap  u inoremap  u inoremap  u inoremap , ,u inoremap . .u inoremap ( (u inoremap [ [u inoremap &#x3D; &#x3D;u inoremap \&quot; \&quot;u inoremap  u inoremap  u 
 Also, I had autogroup that breaks undo every 4 seconds.
 Basically, this configuration breaks undo on almost every possible type command, every Spacebar, Enter, comma, bracket, moving up, down, everything. This is because I hate when undo deletes the whole screen of text.
 How do I replicate this in Emacs? I read this, but it doesn&#x27;t say what is considered a &quot;recent change&quot;.

 ;; older setting ;; ... (nnimap &quot;gmail&quot; (nnimap-address &quot;imap.gmail.com&quot;) (nnimap-inbox &quot;INBOX&quot;) (nnimap-expunge immediately) (nnimap-stream ssl)) ;; ... 
 I looked for a solution, or rather asked ChatGPT about the oauth2.el thing. And it suggested the following,
 ;; new settings ;; ... (nnimap &quot;gml&quot; (nnimap-address &quot;imap.gmail.com&quot;) (nnimap-inbox &quot;INBOX&quot;) (nnimap-expunge immediately) (nnimap-stream ssl) (nnimap-authenticator oauth2) (nnimap-oauth2-client-id &quot;client-id&quot;) (nnimap-oauth2-client-secret &quot;client-secret&quot;) (nnimap-oauth2-credentials &quot;~/.emacs.d/.gmail.oauth2-token&quot;)) ;; ... 
 I created a new project in Google Cloud Console, enabled Gmail API and generated client-id and client-secret for the above. But this doesn&#x27;t seem to be working. When I launch Gnus (M-x gnus), it is stuck at &quot;Openning connection to imap.gmail.com via tls...&quot;. Default browser is not launched for the oauth2 workflow.
 I have tested the following code. It launches the default browser and works just fine,
 (require &#x27;oauth2) (defvar my-oauth2-token (oauth2-auth-and-store &quot;https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth&quot; &quot;https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/token&quot; &quot;https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email&quot; &quot;client-id&quot; &quot;client-secret&quot;)) 
 Has anyone here done this kind of configuration - gnus+gmail+oauth2?

                            <span class="media-object__text">
                              <span>I&#x27;ve been using Rene&#x27;s Sublimeless Zettelkasten for a few years, building up a note archive that uses datetime ID links. I think The Archive follows the same convention.
For example, if I create a note called &quot;Test note&quot; now, the text file will have the name 202310191918 Test note.md, and the link inside the software will look like this: [[202310191918]] Test note.
It would be interesting to try an alternative app/software at some point. I&#x27;ve looked around quite a bit, and I&#x27;m surprised about how few there are who supports this link ID syntax. Most software like Obsidian, Roam, and the like, uses the &quot;[[full title inside the brackets]]&quot; style, making them unable to parse my note link syntax. Some allows for choosing slightly different ID types, but usually never this specific one which I thought was one of the simpler ones.
For example, clicking the &quot;test note&quot; link in Obsidian would just result in the software creating a blank note called 202310191918.md. The only software I&#x27;m aware of can parses the datetime link ID type, are these two:
1Writer for iOS mobile phone
The Archive for MacOS
I haven&#x27;t found anything that supports the datetime link ID for neither Android nor Windows. Are any of you aware of any software I&#x27;ve missed that can be used? All platforms are interesting, from iOS/Android to Windows/Linux/Mac. I&#x27;m aware it&#x27;s a possibility to edit all of my notes using a Python script or similar to make them compatible, but that would break compatibility with the software I use today. Happy for any tips. Cheers</span>

                              <span>So I&#x27;ll be joining a company in 10 days that primarily uses Haskell. I want to be better prepared when I join. 
 What&#x27;s the best way to go about it? I&#x27;m thinking I&#x27;ll do the following in parallel:
 SICP Haskell for Imperative Programmers (YouTube)
 My background: 1.5 YOE Previous experience in Java, Python and Javascript. Haven&#x27;t written pure functional code with any of them.
 Thanks everyone!

                              <span>I just got into Haskell, I&#x27;ve been going through the book &quot;Learn you a Haskell&quot; from the website. right now I am in the Higher Order functions chapter.
 The author talked about implementing a custom map function. I thought to implement it with the little knowledge I had and then compare it with author. I used the list comprehension and the author used the recursion. Same as the standard library 
 map1:me map2:author
 Why is recursion chosen above list comprehension? is it more performant ?

                              <span>Whenever I type a capital M in org, which-key pops up. Emacs thinks I want to type a key chord command. Before I go deleting parts of my config to identify the problem, does anyone know what setting might cause this? I definitely haven’t assigned M to a key chord...
 Thanks so much!

                              <span>Hi all,
 I have been using org-mode for a while. I use it mostly for academic-writing, but I plan to explore more possibilities. 
 If I posted this a year ago, probably I would say that I wanted some people&#x27;s settings and just borrowed them. But the more I use org-mode (and Emacs), the more I appreciate the space for personalized settings. So, I decide to start building up my own settings as a rookie.
 Here is my question. I feel that I understand some basics of org-mode, but I am not familiar with &quot;how powerful&quot; it is--with all the great things I can do in org-mode. So, I am looking for a comprehensive introduction or settings of org-mode. It does not have to be for beginners, but I would like to see how a powerful org-mode environment looks like, probably with many useful packages.
 Suggestions? Thank you.

Convenience in Haskell: Ergonomics of Cabal by Vance Palacio
Should we be trying to create some type of wrapper around hpack/cabal that focuses on user experience, avoiding the work of creating a cabal exact-printer, not burdening cabal maintainers with thinking about perfect UX, and leaving cabal alone to be a good packaging tool/power user tool?

 For everyone interested in Caprese, there&#x27;s Martin&#x27;s talk Martin Odersky - Scala&#x27;s Role in the Programming Languages Ecosystem which doesn&#x27;t go into technical detail, but explains the motivation for Caprese and how it can move Scala into a fresh spot that is not occupied by other languages.

                              <span>At Tweag we have been cooking up a JSON Schema to Nickel contract converter, that we’re excited to announce!

Background
Nickel is a configuration language being developed at Tweag. You can get some deep dives into its design from previous blog posts. I’ll summarize it here as JSON, plus functions, plus types and contracts. One of its main use-cases is generating JSON configurations for other programs (Terraform, GitHub actions, etc). Functions allow you to generate large configurations without repeating information; types and contracts help detect problems early when the configuration is malformed and determine where the problem is.
In the JSON world, the role of contracts is served by JSON Schemas, which likewise specify the form that some JSON-encoded data should have. It’s very natural…</span>

                              <span>I use pdf-tools for reading and recently started using bookmark+ and dired+ for navigating. Unfortunately these two great packages seems to conflict. 
 One of the issues I noticed was that the bookmark+ command for bookmarking a pdf location in a pdf-tools buffer didn&#x27;t work; it gave an empty buffer warning. Turns out bookmark+ creator Drew Adams had already suggested a workaround which I discovered here: https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/72786/bookmark-plus-and-pdf-tools-pdf-view-error
 So that solved or at least patched that issue. But then I noticed that with dired+ installed and any fairly large pdf opened in pdf-tools, emacs will freeze if you attempt to do dired-jump or helm-find-files. Dired-jump without dired+ is not affected by the size of the pdf at all and just opens the underlying directory immediately. But with dired+ anything above about 1mb or so hangs it for quite a while, anything around 10mb or more just freezes it for minutes on end to the point that unless you want to go make yourself lunch and coffee, you will have to force kill emacs to keep working.
 As a noob, non-techie, non-developer, I just wanted to ask, what is the right way of asking about possibly getting this issue fixed, because I love these two packages and would love to have both in working order, but obviously don&#x27;t have the coding know how to do it myself. Of course if anybody knows of a fix that&#x27;s already out there for this issue, I&#x27;d love to know about that as well.

                              <span>I have a bunch of one off functions to do frame/window layout. But an issue I run into is that if I do, say  (set-frame-size (selected-frame) 255 80) (some-other-function-that-looks-at-frame-size-to-split-windows)  Half the time the resize hasn&#x27;t finished by the time the split function runs, and so it splits incorrectly. I&#x27;m assuming the resize happens asynchronously, but I don&#x27;t see a hook or event I can make use of to make sure I&#x27;m splitting after the fact. Is there something I&#x27;m missing? Sleeping doesn&#x27;t seem to fix it because that just delays the resize as well.

 Has someone experienced something similar? Is there a way to improve this?

 I found code here dnd images into auxtex. I am using the excellent Zotra package. I modified the dnd to auctex code to allow drag and drop pdf files into bibtex. My attempt below works. It creates a bibtex &quot;file&quot; field and fills it with the link to the file. However, it would be nice if I could add the following functionality: change the path of the uri to the directory citar-library-paths, change the file-name (excl ext) to the bib-key, move the file to the new path and then sets the file field. This will be useful when one has to manually add files to the bibtex database (in case where the Zotero translation server doesn&#x27;t find the file. Any help or pointers to a package that works similarly would be appreciated.
 (defcustom BIBTex-dnd-protocol-alist &#x27;((&quot;^file:///&quot; . BIBTex-dnd-bibtex-file) (&quot;^file://&quot; . BIBTex-dnd-bibtex-file) (&quot;^file:&quot; .

                              <span>I have recently approached the world of Emacs, which I find great... The problem though is that I feel I&#x27;m wasting too much time trying to have it running in order to do the real work (and I&#x27;ve seen, there are several memes about it), so I was wondering what are the must-have extensions to quickly fire something functional (similar to vscode... Don&#x27;t make me get back to that please) for development.
 By the way, I&#x27;ve seen several configurations scattered around the web, and something tells me that I&#x27;ve ended up in another anarchic realm (which is, something I both hate and love), as if that of distros -being the same except for one thing- wasn&#x27;t enough.
 Of interest are: Python, Go, Bash, Clojure, Elixir, yaml (Docker, Terraform, Ansible), json, csv
 I would also appreciate the general must-have extensions, currently I&#x27;m getting lost navigating Doom Emacs and Melpa packages.
 Thank you!

                              <span>Hello,
 Anyone aware of any package/code snipped that could replicate the paste behavior of vs code? To elaborate what I mean by that. When I copy image in file manager and paste it in a markdown file in vscode it automatically converts it into relative path from the current file. Alternatively is there a way to auto complete in the &#x60;C-c C-i&#x60; mini buffer?

                              <span>Hey guys, took me a while to figure this out since there isn&#x27;t much information about this anywhere so I figured I&#x27;d leave this here for anyone else having the same issue.
 If you&#x27;re a terminal aficionado and you&#x27;re using Kitty, all you have to do is install kkp.el and enable it in your config and all keybindings will work properly.

                              <span>I am not skilled in drawing, but after trying PlantUML, I found that I can create visual representations directly using code. This has greatly aided my spatial imagination. 
 Take, for example, the usecases diagram:
 @startuml :user: -right-&gt; (Right) :user: -up-&gt; (Up) @enduml 
 https://preview.redd.it/1bx7h7sa7vub1.png?width&#x3D;152&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;6271256f6855b88a93a62abf63569f1bc542ded5
 With the use of directional terms like &quot;up&quot; and &quot;right,&quot; you can intuitively draw the diagram as shown. it lowers barrier for non-artists - no drawing ability needed and focuses thought process on structural elements and relationships. 
 When immersed in text, our spatial imagination can often become less active. For example, when trying to imagine the hierarchical structure of an article such as org-mode, our mental representation tends to be more like a bullet structure in an editor, rather than a graphical tree structure. 
 PlantUML addresses the challenge of limited spatial imagination by providing an intuitive text-graph syntax. One notable feature is the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) functionality.
 Consider the following example:
 @startwbs !theme mono Emamcs ** Texting Editing ** Note taking ** File Manager ** Literature Programming @endwbs 
 https://preview.redd.it/95b2mg6w9vub1.png?width&#x3D;567&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;2e0f00c54e4d411ec731eba7b23a46a665ed78fc
 The WBS feature in PlantUML facilitates the effortless transformation of a vertical structure into a horizontal representation. This allows me to mentally interpret and visualize the PlantUML code, automatically converting the vertical structure into a spatially-oriented horizontal structure in mind. Consequently, it effectively resolves the issue of my limited visual imagination and improving it continually.

                              <span>I&#x27;d like magit-status to open full frame, ie a single window. When I hit q to exit, I&#x27;d like my previous window configuration to be restored.
 What&#x27;s the best way to do this? Setting the follow var causes it to open full frame, but removes all windows except for one upon exit:
  (setq magit-display-buffer-function #&#x27;magit-display-buffer-fullframe-status-v1) 
 I can get to my previous window layout with winner-undo, but I&#x27;d like q to do the right thing in this case.
 Any thoughts?

(i am using doom emacs, btw)
 ​
 edit:
 answer to my own question, after a few hours of digging into &#x27;advice&#x27;, turns out it very simple, just 2 lines of code:
 (advice-add #&#x27;read-shell-command :filter-args #&#x27;(lambda(args) (list (car args) (car shell-command-history))))

                              <span>The org agenda can warn you about upcoming deadlines and scheduled items. It would be useful to optionally have warnings about other sorts of events. Birthdays are an obvious case but this should also include non-repeating events (e.g. a friend&#x27;s concert). Has anyone achieved this?
 As suggested here, you can use diary-remind for this. But this is an awkard general solution, as it requires these entries to use a different syntax to normal agenda items. I&#x27;m just wondering if anyone&#x27;s got a more integrated approach by now? I imagine this might use something like -7d in the timestamp, or a WARNING_PERIOD property.

I&#x27;m using doom emacs but can&#x27;t seem to find a built-in keybind and I can&#x27;t seem to find a solution in the docs or from googling. Thank you!

                              <span>Hello, redditors. Haskell beginner here. So I tried to solve this problem on codewars. And this was the best I could do
 ​
 module CalculatingWithFunctions (plus, minus, times, dividedBy, zero, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine) where plus, minus, times, dividedBy :: Int -&gt; Int -&gt; Int plus &#x3D; (+) minus &#x3D; (-) times &#x3D; (*) dividedBy &#x3D; div zero, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine :: (a -&gt; Int) zero _ &#x3D; 0 one _ &#x3D; 1 two _ &#x3D; 2 three _ &#x3D; 3 four _ &#x3D; 4 five _ &#x3D; 5 six _ &#x3D; 6 seven _ &#x3D; 7 eight _ &#x3D; 8 nine _ &#x3D; 9 
 When I try the following unit test:
 (one $ plus $ one) &#x60;shouldBe&#x60; (2 :: Int) 
 I get the following error message
 test/CalculatingWithFunctionsSpec.hs:9:19: error: • Couldn&#x27;t match expected type ‘Int’ with actual type ‘a0 -&gt; Int’ • Probable cause: ‘one’ is applied to too few arguments In the second argument of ‘($)’, namely ‘one’ In the second argument of ‘($)’, namely ‘plus $ one’ In the first argument of ‘shouldBe’, namely ‘(one $ plus $ one)’ | 9 | (one $ plus $ one) &#x60;shouldBe&#x60; (2 :: Int) 
 If I understand correctly, &#x60;one&#x60; expects some argument, but obviously nothing is provided. I&#x27;m just lost can&#x27;t figure out what to do next. Please help.

                              <span>Hey everybody!
 So I&#x27;ve been working with PostgreSQL and the JVM for very long now, and I&#x27;ve always been frustrated with the experience. The tedious manual writing, the ease with which you can break things, and the difficulty of testing have all been constant irritations.
 Some months back I started working towards my dream integration layer, with focus on type-safety and developer experience. Powered by cutting-edge code generation.
 I am excited to announce the first version of Typo, and invite you to have a look at what it can do. Through introduction and documentation at https://oyvindberg.github.io/typo/docs/ .
 Github repo with issues for future work here https://github.com/oyvindberg/typo . 
 Curious to hear thoughts on the direction this is headed in :)

                              <span>I have a pattern that I wanted help analyzing. It may be nothing but I wanted to give it more eyes. Applying it to the continuation Monad
 type Cont :: Type -&gt; Type -&gt; Type newtype Cont res a where Cont :: ((a -&gt; res) -&gt; res) -&gt; Cont res a 
 produces an equivalent definition using an existential Functor w. It does so by abstracting a -&gt; .. into a functor application w .., then adding an extra argument of type w a.
 type Cont&#x27; :: Type -&gt; Type -&gt; Type data Cont&#x27; res a where Cont&#x27; :: Functor w &#x3D;&gt; w a -&gt; (w res -&gt; res) -&gt; Cont&#x27; res a 
 Doesn&#x27;t this look weird? Basically translating from Cont ~~&gt; Cont&#x27; we decide what existential functor we want, and we instantiate w ~ (a -&gt;).
  Cont&#x27; @(a -&gt;) :: (a -&gt; a) -&gt; ((a -&gt; res) -&gt; res) -&gt; Cont&#x27; res a 
 This turns the first argument w a into into a -&gt; a a…</span>

 data Holder &#x3D; Holder {object :: Object} holderLength :: Holder -&gt; Int holderLength holder &#x3D; length object where object &#x3D; object holder -- Uh Oh 
 Uh oh! We named both the variable and the field accessor function the same thing. We have two options:
  
Rename the variable
  data Holder &#x3D; Holder {object :: Object} holderLength :: Holder -&gt; Int holderLength holder &#x3D; length o where o &#x3D; object holder 
 
Rename the field accessor function
  data Holder &#x3D; Holder {hObject :: Object} holderLength :: Holder -&gt; Int holderLength holder &#x3D; length object where object &#x3D; hObject holder 
 
 I know this is depends a lot on preference. Normally, when using other languages, I start functions with uppercase, and variables with lowercase, but I can&#x27;t do this here.
 What do you prefer?

 Scroll to the bottom, and you&#x27;ll see a new Functor-tier (10,000-24,999.99 USD / year) donor.

 Hopefully, if anyone is trying to push Haskell at work, Google&#x27;s presence and support helps.

 It seems as though this has been a thing since at least Sunday.

                              <span>First off, let me apologize if this has been covered ad nauseam in existing threads and I&#x27;ve missed it, but I didn&#x27;t see anything that quite fit the bill. So, here&#x27;s my question:
 Question
 In the context of having bigger hierarchical organizations of your files (around topic, context, purpose, whatever), how do you organize your org files specifically? 
 Background
 What I have now is shown below (edited for privacy and compactness).
 ​
  
I have one Git repository (&quot;academics&quot;) which is organized by projects and employers and topics, with .org files scattered kind of willy-nilly, the same way any other kind of file might be. This organization isn&#x27;t structured around taking advantage of org-mode&#x27;s inter/multi-file features at all.
 Within &quot;academics&quot; I have two directories that are (kind …</span>

                        class="article-expander"

                              <span>I am a total orgmode noob, and only use it as an outliner tool to create notes for a second brain system. I don&#x27;t really use it as a task management system that much. 
 I write walls of text so it becomes chaotic to know which is useful. I write useful notes next to useless notes because these notes share the same context. Example:
 * My first day at PizzaLLC
 ** The manager was my high school classmate! (layer 5 - archive/journal)
 ** I would potentially start my own PizzaLLC (layer 1 - idea)
 *** Hiring good employees is essential (layer 2)
 *** Can call my bank for a loan (layer 1 - todo)
 ** Don&#x27;t touch hot oven (layer 0)
 The layers are effectively a way to prioritize more important information. I want to be able to:
  
Only view certain layers at a time and hide the unimportant layers (e.g. hide layer &lt;&#x3D;4). 
 Sort &quot;ideas&quot;, &quot;journal&quot;, &quot;todos&quot; separately. I suppose the best way to do that would be to use tags?

                              <span>I use dwm in my laptop, but previously used i3wm for a few years. I&#x27;m curious about:
  
How well EXWM performs nowadays?
 Is it resource heavy compared to other tiling window managers?
 Is it still an issue EXWM not being multi-threaded?
  
My daily tasks involves just opening chrome, telegram and/or slack, watching movies and coding of course. Would it be a good fit for my needs?
 I&#x27;d love to know your thoughts if you use or have some previous experience with EXWM. Thank you in advance!

                              <span>Hey there,
 Maybe I&#x27;m just missing something obvious, but I&#x27;m a little bit confused as to how eat-eshell-mode works. If I, for example, fire up Eshell with Eat installed:
 emacs-lisp (elpaca-test :interactive t :init (elpaca eat (eat-eshell-mode)) (eshell)) 
 Then I try running e.g. top, I&#x27;d expect top to open in an Eat buffer, but it&#x27;s not doing that for me right now: it just opens in plain ol&#x27; dumpy Term mode.
 What am I missing? Is this not what Eshell integration is supposed to do? How do you use Eshell and Eat together?

                              <span>It might be a bit controversial notion. But when I try to look for extensions say for completion framework there are many available and I used ido and then moved to ivy. I knew helm existed and is much more powerful in terms of feature-set, but never used it. 
 I read that emacs can report on keyboard usage (I think from xahlee&#x27;s posts). Can it be repurposed to monitor which extensions are used often in users setup and they can share that report if they wish to public say via melpa like services. I suppose that melpa downloads can be used as a measure of usage.

                              <span>Hello, I&#x27;m currently experiencing a lot of input lag and slowness when working on javascript projects. May I ask what extra configuration I&#x27;m missing in order to fix this issue? I&#x27;m using doom emacs. My configuration looks as follows:
 (use-package! lsp-mode :hook (rustic-mode . lsp) (json-mode . lsp) (sh-mode . lsp) (typescript-mode . lsp) (javascript-mode . lsp) (js2-mode . lsp) (rjsx-mode . lsp) :commands lsp :config (setq lsp-log-io nil) (setq lsp-eldoc-render-all nil) (setq lsp-inlay-hint-enable nil) (setq lsp-lens-enable nil) (setq lsp-signature-render-documentation nil) (setq lsp-signature-auto-activate nil) (setq lsp-eldoc-enable-hover nil) (setq lsp-modeline-code-actions-enable nil)) (use-package! lsp-ui :hook (lsp-mode . lsp-ui-mode) :config (setq lsp-eldoc-enable-hover nil) (setq eldoc-documentation-functions nil) (setq lsp-ui-sideline-enable nil) (setq lsp-ui-sideline-show-diagnostics nil) (setq lsp-ui-sideline-show-hover nil) (setq lsp-ui-peek-always-show nil) (setq lsp-eldoc-render-all nil) (setq lsp-eldoc-enable-hover nil) (setq lsp-ui-doc-enable nil)) 
 As you can see, I have most lsp features disabled to improve performance, but yet I&#x27;m having a bad experience while working on JS files. I&#x27;d kindly appreciate any suggestion.

                              <span>I just read Mickey&#x27;s wonderful article on window management, and has given me the push I need to take control over my emacs windows/frames. I have an idea of what I will configure; maximum of two windows per frame, and if is my portrait frame split horizontally and split vertically for my landscape frame, plus some additional config for Magit. Before I take the plunge, I wanted to quickly reach out to see what other people have done for their configs to get some ideas. Figure might also be good to collect a few different configurations of window configs for people interested.
 Some configs I have found on the way and will update with any suggestions people have:
 *Edit - I will add some more here as I find them/people suggest them
  
Karthink&#x27;s config, good integration with the popper package
 emacs-pure - has some display-buffer-alist settings for magit which are of interest to me, as the built in magit methods for handling new frames isn&#x27;t exactly what I want.
 Sacha&#x27;s config using set-window-configuration and current-window-configuration more than display-buffer-alist. The Ediff settings stick out to me
 burly.el by u/alphapapa - might be an easier way to approach the current-window-configuration/set-window-configuration that Sacha has implemented
 Prot&#x27;s window config - A lot of custom functions to help tailor the window management experience to his liking. 
 eyebrowse - package to make Emacs be like i3. Example config from Karl Voit and the use of eyebrowse-restore to help make the configurations stick around.

                              <span>Hello and thank you for reading this. I&#x27;m starting my journey to study Emacs, and I&#x27;m interested in turning Emacs in my IDE (mainly C, C++, JavaScript, Rust, and Python, etc...) and taking notes. Could you please give me your best suggestion on how to accomplish my goals? Thank you once more, and have a wonderful day/night.

                              <span>In elisp, symbols serve as fundamental data structures that are more foundational compared to strings. This distinction often caused confusion for me until my encounter with the read function.
  ~ $ (type-of (read)) symbol 
 The fact that the read function yields symbols instead of strings from user-input was a delightful revelation. This discovery convinces me that the fundamental nature of symbols in elisp when compared to strings.

                              <span>I just tried out eglot today, and I must say that I am very very impressed. However, like all software, the julia language server has a few quirks that need to be worked around. Long story short, I have two folders (not nested or anything):
  
folder1 - A git repository of a large julia project that I cloned. Starting eglot here only works partially. Anything imported from other packages is a missing reference.
 
folder2 - A folder I created with various scripts that I wrote for the project in folder1. It contains a Project.toml detailing the necessary julia environment for those scripts to work. Starting eglot here works flawlessly. Both functions defined in folder1 as well as the other packages folder1 relies upon are referenced correctly.
 
 Is there a way for me to start eglot in folder2 but have it work as if I have started it in folder1? 
 I believe one potential solution might be to tell Project.el that the git repository in folder1 belongs to the project in folder2, but I couldn&#x27;t find a command for doing so.
 Alternatively, can I tell eglot in folder1 to connect to the language server that was started by eglot in folder2?
 edit: Hope the question makes sense, and apologies if not everything is phrased in the correct language. I&#x27;m pretty new to both eglot and project.el. Many thanks in advance for any help or hints!

                              <span>Hey everybody, first time poster here.
 I&#x27;ve been using Emacs for a while now, but just recently starting toying with configs, experiencing new packages, learning some elisp so I can customize my emacs experience and overall making it my own.
 A while back I noticed I needed some sort of dark mode functionality to change the theme to a darker one when there is less sunlight. After searching for some packages, I found none that really suited me.
 So I decided to write my own: https://github.com/pedroangelo/theme-rotation.el
 Check it out and tell me what you guys think. I&#x27;ve also included a sort of related work section in the README that discusses similar packages, and why I didn&#x27;t found them to my taste. 
 PS: I wrote this package for my personal use. But if more people find it useful, I&#x27;d be quite satisfied with myself.
 Also, do you think I should work towards getting it published in MELPA? I don&#x27;t mind the work if it something that potentially many people might enjoy using.

                              <span>While a for-loop is a straightforward construct in other programming languages, the loop macro, despite its power, can present challenges due to its intricacy. I find myself frustrated by its complexity.
 However, its conceptual abstractions are intriguing. Take, for example, the following code snippet:
 (loop for i below 10 sum i) 
 The utilization of the term &quot;below&quot; in this context is particularly striking. Contrastingly, in languages like JavaScript, I typically read &quot;i &lt; 10&quot; as &quot;i less than 10,&quot; pronouncing the two words &quot;less than&quot; in order to read the &quot;&lt;&quot; symbol.
 The act of reading &quot;&lt;&quot; as &quot;less than&quot; momentarily interrupts my cognitive flow between the two words. The loop macro condenses it as a single word, &quot;below,&quot; allowing me to pronounce &quot;i &lt; 10&quot; more succinctly and smoothly, without interruption. Another viable alternative could be &quot;under.&quot;
 Moreover, the expression &#x60;1 &lt; i &lt; 10&#x60; can be read as &quot;from 1 to 10.&quot;
 (loop for i from 1 to 10 sum i) 
 It enhance code readability mentally and streamline cognitive processing.

Long story short, Im stuck at this GIS job, massive computing experience under my belt, but close to 20% experience in GIS. Im playing around with SmallWorld locally and on a cloned repo. But they also have a Development environment on a remote server. Everyone here says theres no way to use your own Emacs version (28) on this one, except Emacs 23. Do you have any comment on this? Talk to me like Im a child. Im not sure if its an SSH setup. A senior told me it isnt (in a very thick accent). He might be bullshitting. (They use a VPN and sometthing called &quot;f5 networks endpoint inspector&quot;)

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to make my Emacs configuration more reproducible, in part by creating variables with paths to packages, directories which depend on what machine I&#x27;m on:
 (if my/laptop-p (progn ... (defvar my/mu4e-dir &quot;/usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/mu4e&quot; &quot;Location of local &#x60;mu4e&#x27; files installed by system package manager&quot;) ... )) 
  
 Here, my/laptop-p tests if (equal (system-name) &quot;my-thinkpad&quot;).
 This system works well, so that for the relevant example of mu4e (which is apparently quite tricky to set up in straight.el ) I can use:
 (use-package mu4e :straight (:local-repo my/mu4e-dir :type built-in) ... ) 
  
 The package loads and the configuration works fine.
 But doing straight-freeze-versions gives:
 straight--dir: Wrong type argument: stringp, my/mu4e-dir 
 This can be fixed by replacing my/mu4e-dir with the string &quot;/usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/mu4e&quot;, but I&#x27;d like to avoid this if I can.
   Is there a way I can keep using my defined variable my/mu4e-dir instead of the full path name?

                              <span>Once I saw nil or &#x27;nil from some (setq ..), it usually worried me.
 The barely nil appears to be a variable name no more than &#x60;foo bar zoo&#x60; and there shoud be a value it points to.The quoted &#x27;nil seems to be a data or a value in data mode and there might exist a name it is given.it looks no difference with symbols as &#x27;nilll &#x27;nilllllll or &#x27;nillllllllll as data.
 Every time see them, I find myself hesitating, uncertain and disturbing.
 This picture tells they are identical and comfort me to get an insight that lisp is much more pragmatic in evovling by patching up.
 As a result, I stop worring its theoretical consistency and confidently proceed with using &#x60;nil&#x60;.
 4 disguises of nil
 The wizard book SICP states it as:
  
Lisp was not the product of a concerted design effort. Instead, it evolved informally in an experimental manner in response to users&#x27; needs and to pragmatic implementation considerations.

                              <span>Hi,
 I have a pretty solid workflow now based loosely on GTD with TODO tasks in categories, projects and NEXT tasks, weekly and monthly reviews etc.. I have a good org-super-agenda config that I&#x27;ve been using happily for months.
 The issue I have is that out of the myriad of tasks I have available to work on at any one point, I am not good at just picking one and getting on with it. Almost like flicking through Netflix and never actually deciding what to watch.
 Might be more of a behavioral problem, but I wondered if anyone has a function or utility for picking a task at random from a given org buffer and highlighting it in a new buffer, or similar. Idea being this would force selection from a set of tasks you know you could progress.
 Or has anyone got good suggestions on how to tackle picking a next task on which to spend time? I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s necessarily bad task definition, and it&#x27;s also not that they should be someday/maybe tasks to which I&#x27;m not firmly committed.
 Thanks.

                              <span>I believe this is a bug, but I want to make sure I&#x27;m not missing something obvious. 
 I know I can kill entire trees by folding them and then calling org-kill-line with point at the beginning of the line where the heading is. I do this all the time (though I have set org-ctrl-k-protect-subtrees to t to avoid accidents). 
 However, if visual-line-mode is on and the heading text continues to a second visual line, this stops working as expected. 
 Take for example the following two trees: 
 * Heading This is some text * This is a heading on the longer side for an example This is some text 
 Now, using emacs -Q, evaluate the following code (I set the frame size as narrow as I did so that the second heading only wraps around to a second visual line): 
 (org-mode) (visual-line-mode) (set-frame-size (selected-frame) 30 50) (org-overview) 
 With point on the first heading, call kill-line. The entire subtree will be killed. 
 With point on the second heading, now, call kill-line. Only the first visual line occupied by that heading will be killed. 
 Am I missing something?

                              <span>I want to define the config for all the programs I use in emacs org-mode. One thing I need to be able to do, is to change the colorscheme of my system. I define a set of variables, that then get updated in the config of various different programs.
 For example, I have this code block:
 #+begin_src css :tangle ~/test.css .test_class { background: $color } #+end_src 
 I would like to be able to define the color variable, be it in the org-document, or somewhere else, and then when org babel tangles it, the resulting file should have the variable changed.
 So, if color&#x3D;&quot;#ffffff, then test.css should look like:
 .test_class { background: #ffffff } 
 Since I need to do this for many different programs, it needs to be language agnostic. Org babel simply needs to treat the code block as a piece of text, and replace the variables.
 What is the easiest way to achieve this?

 version: &#x27;3&#x27; services: mongo: image: mongo environment: - MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME&#x3D;${MONGO_ROOT_USER} - MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD&#x3D;${MONGO_ROOT_PASSWORD} - MONGO_INITDB_DATABASE&#x3D;badminton ports: - &quot;27017:27017&quot; mongo-express: image: mongo-express environment: - ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_SERVER&#x3D;mongo - ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_PORT&#x3D;27017 - ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_ENABLE_ADMIN&#x3D;true - ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_AUTH_DATABASE&#x3D;admin - ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_AUTH_USERNAME&#x3D;${MONGO_ROOT_USER} - ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_AUTH_PASSWORD&#x3D;${MONGO_ROOT_PASSWORD} - ME_CONFIG_BASICAUTH_USERNAME&#x3D;${MONGOEXPRESS_LOGIN} - ME_CONFIG_BASICAUTH_PASSWORD&#x3D;${MONGOEXPRESS_PASSWORD} depends_on: - mongo ports: - &quot;8888:8081&quot; ENV: MONGO_ROOT_USER&#x3D;devroot MONGO_ROOT_PASSWORD&#x3D;devroot MONGOEXPRESS_LOGIN&#x3D;dev MONGOEXPRESS_PASSWORD&#x3D;dev 
 And then this simple example:
 import Database.MongoDB mongo :: IO () mongo &#x3D; do pipe  show closed is_auth  show is_auth dbs &lt;- access pipe master &quot;badminton&quot; allDatabases print dbs close pipe 
 Which prints:
 &quot;Closed? False&quot; &quot;AUTH: False&quot; ingest-exe.EXE: expected (&quot;databases&quot; :: [[Field]]) in [ ok: 0.0, errmsg: &quot;Command find requires authentication&quot;, code: 13, codeName: &quot;Unauthorized&quot;] CallStack (from HasCallStack): error, called at .\Data\Bson.hs:113:10 in bson-0.4.0.1-5H36pPFgi2uLQl05dXyxb6:Data.Bson 
 I am sorry to just throw this code dump, but I have no idea what I am missing. I have tried &quot;
 setLocaleEncoding utf and ascii&quot;.
 EDIT:
 I just tried with version 3.6 of mongodb, and then it works. So it seems the library is not up to date with latest version of mongodb.

                              <span>Hello, when I read a paper about a operating system writen by haskell. I meet a piece of code about continuation, that I can&#x27;t understand it. So, I wish someone could help me, thanks a lot.
 If anyone is interested in the operating system, here is a paper.
 http://www-personal.umich.edu/~rsc/Resources/context-OS.pdf
 This is the piece of code
 open :: Tree -&gt; CC r (Z r) open tree &#x3D; promptP (\p -&gt; let visit n &#x3D; shiftP p (return . Yet n) in liftM Done (traverse visit tree)) 
 traverse is a procedure, and Tree and Z is a data type, see
 data Tree &#x3D; Leaf Int | Node Tree Tree data Z r &#x3D; Done Tree | Yet Int (Maybe Int -&gt; CC r (Z r))

                              <span>Hey all,
 I am pretty familiar with OOP &amp; imperative languages in general, and so my thought process is perhaps completely wrong, in the context of Haskell, when it comes to solving this :
 How would you go about managing an interface-implementation type of pattern?
 Let me give you a concrete example to illustrate : I have written two Window management abstractions for my application using GLFW &amp; SDL2, which are just defined as &#x27;Window&#x27;
 data Engine &#x3D; Engine { window :: Window } 
 Both of my implementations have the same function signatures and so for the moment I can decide which variant to use in my &#x27;Engine&#x27; / program by which module I end up importing ; obviously given they share the same function names, I can only import &amp; use one at a time.
 What I would like to do is be able to choose at runtime/dynamically or at least through a parameter.
 Now with my meager experience with Haskell &amp; functional programming in general, I can see two ways to achieve this :
  
Using typeclasses, i.e. have a class Window, which defines my &#x27;interface&#x27; 
 Then declare an instance for both my GLFW &amp; SDL2 version
 
 Or an abstract data-type which uses record-syntax to list the functions of that interface. 
 Then create a new value our of this datatype &amp; pipe the respective function implementations.
 
  
I realise the above probably makes more sense in an OOP kind of way, so I would be interested to know how this sort of pattern would typically be achieved the Haskell way?
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I&#x27;m creating a parser framework and am testing it on JSON. Currently, I have json &#x3D; object  array  string  number  bool  null which is fine if there is no parse error, but when there is one I only get the null error message which is not helpful. I need something like failIrecoverable for times when an opening array bracket has already been parsed so the next alternative is not run and the proper error is returned. Is there a transformer like this?

                              <span>I&#x27;m pleased to announce an even newer release of stan, a static analysis tool for Haskell. This release extends last week&#x27;s release by adding support for 9.6, extending the supported range to 8.8-9.6.
 About stan
 Stan is a command-line tool for analysing Haskell projects. It discovers which parts of the code can potentially be improved, and offers suggestions on how to do so. Read more about stan in its README.
 Installation
 I recommend obtaining stan from Hackage by following the installation instructions in the README.
 https://hackage.haskell.org/package/stan-0.1.0.0
 Help wanted
 stan lacks active maintainers and is currently in essential maintainance only mode. I am helping out to make sure stan can continue to build with newer GHCs. I would welcome assistance, particularly on the following issues:
  
Supporting GHC 9.8
 Prospective support for GHC 9.10
 Fixing caching on Github Actions
  
If you would like to contribute to Stan please create an issue on the Github repository.
  
[1] Some point releases are excluded because the GHC API doesn&#x27;t seem to provide enough type information, notably the later releases in the 9.2 series.

 I am currently learning functional programming and I am unsure how to implement this while following the paradigm. The problem I am facing is that I want to implement a function that stores an arbitrary large string (e.g. a sentence) by appending it to the data structure such that the system is building a text. The only operations that will be used is append and clear the data structure. 
 I have thought about implementing a rope data structure but I am afraid that it is overkill for this purpose. What do you think?

                              <span>One of useful properties of IO monad is that it is lazy: functions return not a result but wrapper that can be evaluated later and, more importantly, altered in builder style:
 doSomething().handle { case e: Exception &#x3D;&gt; &quot;oops&quot;}.timeout(10.seconds) 
 What&#x27;s interesting this behavior can be reimplemented on contextual functions, without syntactic and runtime overhead
 // contextual functions without context are not supported // so we have to add something here trait CanLazy // looks like eager evaluation but in fact it is not, like by-name parameter def doSomething(): CanLazy ?&#x3D;&gt; String &#x3D; throw Exception(&quot;my error&quot;) extension[A](v: CanLazy ?&#x3D;&gt; A) // classical error handling for IO monad but without IO monad def handle(f: Throwable &#x3D;&gt; A)(using CanLazy): A &#x3D; try v catch case e &#x3D;&gt; f(e) given CanLazy &#x3D; new CanLazy {} // handle will correctly wrap doSomething() invocation // prints &quot;my error&quot; to the console println(doSomething().handle(_.getMessage)) 
 In addition:
  
handle will not compile on &quot;totally eager&quot; functions like println()
 handle will work on context functions of several arguments.
 def foo: (CanLazy, Context, CanThrow[MyError]) ?&#x3D;&gt; Result. Doesn&#x27;t it look familiar?
  
As for overhead:
  
CanLazy parameter can be eliminated by erased definition (experimental)
 inlining handle together with erased reduces overhead to single val proxy &#x3D; () -&gt; doSomething()
 I believe compiler could be fixed to reduce overhead to zero
  
I find this fascinating and is wondering whether can new programming style emerge from this? To combine power of lazy evaluation and simplicity of eager functions.

                              <span>This is my attempt to account for primary sources on Luhmann&#x27;s zettelkasten, not secondary resources. Have I overlooked anything? I would appreciate any additional insights.
The slip box itself implicitly contains the techniques of work. However, extracting and analyzing these techniques is not an easy task.
Inside of Luhmann&#x27;s Zettelkasten there is a series of entries on the principles of note-taking.
Luhmann&#x27;s system theory has many parallels with his understanding of Zettelkästen, as the slip box is also a system.
The article “Kommunikation mit Zettelkästen. Öffentliche Meinung und Sozialer Wandel.” Here, Luhmann openly shares his thoughts on the nuances of the system.
Luhmann&#x27;s insightful interview with Dirk Baecker and Georg Stanitzek in the book “Niklas Luhmann. Archimedes und wir Interviews” delves into his writing practices.
Another interview that delves into Luhmann&#x27;s working style is his conversation with Wolfgang Hagen in “Warum haben Sie keinen Fernseher, Herr Luhmann? Letzte Gespräche mit Niklas Luhmann.”
There&#x27;s a three-minute segment in the documentary “Niklas Luhmann - Beobachter im Krähennest” where Luhmann showcases his system.
There are almost certainly scattered memories of Luhmann&#x27;s students and colleagues. He told many people about his Zettelkästen.</span>

 I&#x27;m back to Emacs after trying NeoVim for awhile and trying to make my config as minimal as possible. projectile-project-root is (I think) the only thing I&#x27;m missing from that package to get my old workflow back.

Denote is a wonderful package that I use to organize my notes, and having the possibility to have a code block with links to specific notes works well with my workflow (having rx conditions is great in Denote 2.0!). However, things would be perfect if there would be a way to have all the content of those links files (sans the front matter) in an org-mode buffer (or an org file). Can this be done? It&#x27;s Emacs, so I&#x27;m sure it can, but what would be the most elegant approach to this?

                              <span>Hello to all,
 I recently stumbled upon the setopt function introduced in emacs 29.
  
defmacro setopt (&amp;rest pairs)
 Set VARIABLE/VALUE pairs, and return the final VALUE. This is like &#x27;setq&#x27;, but is meant for user options instead of plain variables. This means that &#x27;setopt&#x27; will execute any &#x27;custom-set&#x27; form associated with VARIABLE.
  
So basically it looks like a customize-set-variable but shorter. Indeed, both are defined almost next to each other, with most of the interesting bits duplicated.
 After reading its source code, I have the impression that its only major difference with customize-set-variable (besides the fact that customize-set-variable is also a user command) is related to user theme.
 I am not sure about the impact of using one over the user, do you guys have an opinion about this ? Cheers

                              <span>Ok, I&#x27;m quite new to Emacs and have a hard time fighting the learning curve. I&#x27;m using Spacemacs now because documentation is good, although stability is abysmal. But I kind of managed to configure it to an extent.
 Here&#x27;s a problem. I need a tool that does basically this: I type a search phrase (name) and it shows every entry in an org file that contains this name, and if there&#x27;s no entry with this name (i.e. heading with this name), automatically creates it.
 So it&#x27;s basically deft, but deft works on multiple files which I find extremely inconvenient. I read the docs, but found no way to configure it to work on a single file.
 I believe it is possible to do with a simple org-capture using a custom function that checks if there is a heading in an org file and creates it if there is not. But elisp is high above my knowledge level right now and I don&#x27;t want to invent the bicycle given how simple my problem is.
 I am extremely overwhelmed with options, but I think there must be some simple way to do this that does not require writing some custom code and (preferably) installing more plugins than I already have.

 (use-package vertico :ensure t :init (vertico-mode)) (use-package orderless :init (setq completion-styles &#x27;(orderless) completion-category-defaults nil completion-category-overrides &#x27;((file (styles partial-completion))))) (use-package consult) (use-package marginalia :after vertico :ensure t :init (marginalia-mode)) 
 TIA for any insight.

                              <span>I recently update my whole Emacs installation on my Artix Linux box.
 The operation, apparently, went wrong because centaur tabs aren’t working, leaving a message
 Symbol function definition is void: left
 Running with —debug-init reveals the culprit is effectively in centaur tabs.
 Never saw this error before. Any hint?

                              <span>I want to embed my tex source and my org mode file inside a pdf. I use org 9.7 which allows for the building of a conditional preamble. It seems that when I compile an org mode with emacs, the jobname is not the file name., so nothing gets embedded. If I include...
 \begingroup\escapechar&#x3D;-1 \xdef\jobname{\expandafter\string\csname main\endcsname} \endgroup \usepackage[main,include]{embedall} 
 then if the org file my tex file compiles to is named &quot;main,&quot; then the file embeds successfully. I&#x27;d like to make it so that &quot;main&quot; is the name of whatever file I am working on at the moment.
 In my org configuration file, I currently have...

 This may be a silly question but I cannot figure it out, I&#x27;m using company-mode to autocomplete my C code, so for example I get this completion:
 ​
 https://preview.redd.it/cb45kdq9i9ub1.jpg?width&#x3D;1111&amp;format&#x3D;pjpg&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;d2bc3dd5b90fe0fccdb927603b0fe66178df92c4
 The first field is highlighted and when I start typing I replace the content of the placeholder with my code, but how can I move to the next one? or what&#x27;s the best way to deal with this situation if this is not possible? 
 Thanks!

                              <span>With the kitty terminal, I could control exactly how the font is rendered by using text_composition_strategy: https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/conf/#opt-kitty.text_composition_strategy
 I usually use it to make the fonts slightly thicker and easier to read. Is there anything similar in Emacs? For reference this is how my fonts looks in the terminal vs. Emacs:

 Emacs just looks so damn thin for my poor eyes. I can probably just increase the weight, but I&#x27;m wondering if there&#x27;s a better approach.

                              <span>I&#x27;m using vertico+consult+orderless.
 I&#x27;m not happy with the default completion behavior in find-file, which selects the first candidate instead of just completing what is common to all candidates like the default emacs behavior.
 
 Lets suppose I have a directory with the following files inside: myfile1 myfile2 and myotherfile.
 With vertico, when I use find-fille in this directory, if I press my then TAB then myfile1 will be added to the minibuffer prompt.
 What I want is the default behavior of emacs (emacs -q):
  
if I press my then TAB, nothing should happen, then I add f and the completion should be myfile.
 if I press myo then TAB, myotherfile should be added to the minibuffer.
  
 
Do someone know how I can achieve this ?

                              <span>Just trying out c++-ts-mode with Emacs 29.1 (now that I have finally updated), but one thing I can&#x27;t get to work is configuring directory-specific indentation rules.
 Previously I set c-file-style in dir-locals-set-class-variables depending on the directory and it all worked fine. With c++-ts-mode I have changed that to set c-ts-mode-indent-style instead, but it doesn&#x27;t seem the take effect (well, the variable gets set correctly for the buffer, but the indentation style isn&#x27;t applied). Only after using c-ts-mode-set-style in that buffer to set the style, indentation is set up correctly.
 Any idea how I can get this working?

 I have tried &#x27;pass&#x60; with &#x27;password&#x27; and &#x27;app password&#x27;, neither of them works. the error is: 
 mbsync -a -V
 Cannot connect to imap.gmail.com (142.251.163.108:143): Connection timed out
 ...
 Cannot connect to imap.gmail.com ([2607:f8b0:4004:c1b::6c]:143): Network is unreachable
 ​
 it looks like the internet doesn&#x27;t work, but I asked people in different countries to try, and get the same result. 
 after I added the &#x27;Port 993&#x27;, I get error 
 IMAP error: unexpected EOF from imap.gmail.com (172.253.122.109:993) 
 I&#x27;d like to know if anyone is still able to use mbsync with gmail? is anything wrong, thanks!

                              <span>Hi! I&#x27;m having some difficulty trying to create a helper function for a keyboard shortcut. The error claims that [init-ocaml-project] is void, so I assume I am mis-constructing it in some way? Thanks!

 I tried to get this into Melpa, but was rejected because it&#x27;s a smart-compile fork. I have extended its functionality so much it may as well its own project.
 I&#x27;ve been using this for many years, with enhancements along the way, like it,for example, being able to find the root of your github project to run compiles from there.
 You will need to manually install this, but that should be no effort for most Emacs users.

                              <span>Is it possible to modify Orgzly with Lisp? I want to add more functionality to Orgzly.
 Eg:
 (I) Repeat a task on every Monday, Tuesday and Thursday without having to add repeaters and then mark as complete every time I want the task to move forward (similar to how Google calendar or tasks.org can do it)
 (II) Configure in such a way that anything marked with specific tags (or a cluster of tags) should appear on a specific day/s of the week, such as all the tasks tagged with &#x27;backup&#x27;, &#x27;upkeep&#x27;, &#x27;repairs&#x27; and &#x27;meta&#x27;, appearing on Sunday
 (III) Add dates that denote &#x27;from&#x27; and &#x27;to&#x27; dates, and configure so that they appear that way on the agenda/schedule
 etc.
 If Orgzly does not support that, is there any other way I can do it? Another app maybe?
 Also, I am not super tech-savvy. I can read a documentation and understand stuff. I have done basic programming, but nothing with near-low-level type languages. As of right now, I know nothing about Lisp. So Orgmode enthusiasts, would you say that this is feasible.

                              <span>Hi !
 I made Horn, an org parsen written in typescript.
 I needed a js org parser for one of my PWA related project and I wasn&#x27;t happy with the ones I found (couldn&#x27;t parse large files, failed to understand /bold italic/, written in an alien-to-my-eyes js...). 
 I decided to build it myself; it is right now available on npm and github. It can parse 10mB files within 1-2 seconds, and it has a good support of org features.
 You can reach me here if you have some suggestion. I hope it may be useful to the community !

                              <span>Most of Will&#x27;s ZK focuses on self-improvement ideas. Is self-improvement a bad thing?  I don&#x27;t think so. He needs a lot of improvement. They are reminders. Once he hears or reads an idea, it seems so naturally intuitive. He thinks, &quot;I&#x27;ve heard that before.&quot; He&#x27;s unsure if capturing the idea in a note or writing it into the world makes a difference.
As soon as Will makes such a declaration, Will finds a truckload of notes that don&#x27;t exactly fit the self-improvement line of ideas. Notes on ideas from Python, materials engineering, atmospheric science, architecture, self-driving cars, dog training, uji, vision, and many others. These others only make up a fraction of Will&#x27;s ZK.
Will is hunting for interesting things to take notes on that are not philosophically based on self-improvement.
This evolving process is happening from the bottom up. He is finding it to be quite enjoyable and is training his mind, enjoying the journey rather than just the end result.
Is Will off base? Is this a thing? How do you view the mix of the content of your zettels?
He presently processed a self-help article 1 that pointed out three &quot;hobbies worth pursuing.&quot;

When I run &#x60;evil-tutor-start&#x60; using M - x, it says &#x60;Cannot open load file: no such file or directory, evil-tutor&#x60;.
 I did everything I was supposed to, I ran doom sync and restarted emacs. I don&#x27;t get why it hates me.

                              <span>Hello friends,
 I recently tried installing kde-plasma-desktop with sddm on an Ubuntu 22.04 installation with GNOME. I didn&#x27;t try it in a vm first and thought I could just get away with having both on my machine with no problems. Stupid, I know. I ended up removing KDE and reinstalling gdm, but now I&#x27;m missing all of my GTK icons when I start up Emacs.
 https://i.imgur.com/fRdlr8o.png
 The strange part is, that only sometimes the usual GTK icons will show up, and it&#x27;s always when I least expect it. I suspect that some of the config changes that happened when I installed KDE conflicted with my GTK and my QT themes.
 I&#x27;ve tried removing gtk3.0 and gtk4.0 folders from my ~/.config directory, removing ~/.local/share/icons, and inspecting ~/.themes, but I see nothing related to icons there. I&#x27;m just wondering what could be causing this behavior, and if it&#x27;s conflicting with other applications on my system I haven&#x27;t discovered yet. GNOME tweaks says I&#x27;m using Yaru-magenta-dark, which appears to be working everywhere except for Emacs.
 Interested what people&#x27;s thoughts are on this. I don&#x27;t care much for the icons in the first place, but I thought this behavior was strange. Thank you

                              <span>Hi. I have an issue with project.el (and projectile for that matter). They both seem to think they know better than me. They both try to auto-detect the root folder for a project, depending on if there&#x27;s some specific files present, or if the folder contains a git repository.
 I don&#x27;t like this. Why does it work like that? What I want about these packages is to let me define what folder is a project, explicitely. I want to tell them, &quot;hey, this folder is a project&quot;, even if its empty, and I never want them to automatically add any project.
 Is this possible?

 I started off with some basic packages like projectile, LSP, magit and evil. However I&#x27;m getting kind of annoyed using evil mode, because i have to consider stuff like deactivating certain keys wenn i&#x27;m in another buffer (e.g xref buffer) or undos that dont work out of the box properly.
 Furthermore I would also like start learning more elisp, for which reason I&#x27;m doubting if i should even use vim bindings, because paredit seems to be a thing that i cant get working with vim bindings.
 However I also dont want to leave my vim skills behind and would rather prefer a professional emacs config that is tailored around evil, if thats possible.
 Can someone recommend a lightweight emacs config repository for ergonomic evil usage? Something thats really small and easy to understand and extend (So no spacemacs or doom).
 ​
 Thanks a lot!

                              <span>Hi all,
 Seeing this post explain how to install and use Emacs on Android (native build), I wanted to share a tip on how to have a unified init.el file which can be synced across both Android and Linux so you don&#x27;t have to change anything manually.
 Here is an example for my org notes:
 ;; Setting the base directory for org files (setq org-directory (cond ((eq system-type &#x27;gnu/linux) &quot;~/Notes&quot;) ((eq system-type &#x27;android) &quot;/storage/emulated/0/Notes&quot;) (t &quot;~/Notes&quot;))) 
 Essentially, for each part of the init.el file which is different based on the system it runs on, you can detect the appropriate system and do a different configuration.
 This will resolve any of your Android specific changes you need to implement, like I have with my org notes location in the presented example.
 With this, you can have the same init.el file and simply sync it across your systems.

                              <span>Hi all. I&#x27;m a long time Spacemacs user who is just now transferring to a roll my own config. I&#x27;ve been using and loving Magit for years, and I&#x27;ve just discovered Forge while browsing packages to add to my config.
 My question is, can you use this for code review? I&#x27;d like to be able to view all of the code changes that a Pull Request (my team uses Github) contains and I&#x27;d like to be able be able to add comments to changed lines in the PR. I can&#x27;t figure out how to do that with Magit and Forge. Is this a workflow that&#x27;s possible and do you have any pointers on how I can achieve this?

 I learnt on IRC that Projectile is much older than project.el so there are more plugins for it. But I want to know some specific examples of things that Projectile can do but project.el can&#x27;t. And specific examples of things that project.el can do but Projectile can&#x27;t.
 Anyone has good experience with both to share this stuff?

                              <span>I&#x27;m exporting an org file with images to html, and using the #+ATTR_HTML attribute to resize the image. That&#x27;s having no effect, because the Emacs I&#x27;m using doesn&#x27;t have ImageMagick enabled.
 Yes, I can rebuild from source and enable it, but presumably the emacs devs disabled it by default for a reason. Furthermore, I&#x27;m finding that multiple sources that I might get a prepackaged Emacs from have this feature disabled. Rebuilding from source feels like I&#x27;m punching open a hole someone intentionally closed.
 Is there a workaround for what I&#x27;m trying to do? The best I can come with (other than rebuilding Emacs from source) is to use an external program to resize my image to the size I want it to be. That&#x27;s fairly cumbersome, and it will clutter my directory with various image sizes as I experiment and figure out what i want. Any suggestions?

                              <span>I&#x27;m pleased to announce a new release of stan, a static analysis tool for Haskell. stan now supports GHCs in the range 8.8-9.4[1].
 About stan
 Stan is a command-line tool for analysing Haskell projects. It discovers which parts of the code can potentially be improved, and offers suggestions on how to do so. Read more about stan in its README.
 Installation
 I recommend obtaining stan from Hackage by following the installation instructions in the README.
 https://hackage.haskell.org/package/stan-0.1.0.0
 Help wanted
 stan lacks active maintainers and is currently in essential maintainance only mode. I am helping out to make sure stan can continue to build with newer GHCs. I would welcome assistance, particularly on the following issues:
  
Supporting GHC 9.6
 Supporting GHC 9.8
 Prospective support for GHC 9.10
 Fixing caching on Github Actions
  
If you would like to contribute to Stan please create an issue on the Github repository.
 Credits
 Thanks to the Kowainik team for creating stan in the first place. Thanks to Veronika Romashkina for accepting me as a new maintainer for the project.
  
[1] Some point releases are excluded because the GHC API doesn&#x27;t seem to provide enough type information, notably the later releases in the 9.2 series.

                              <span>I&#x27;m having a very strange bug when using emacs remotely. Currently my .emacs file is commented out except the lines defining the theme:
 When i start editing a file, i experience a severe display bug that prevents me from reading an edited line until i quit and reload the file, It is difficult to explain, but i&#x27;ve attached a screenshot of a line of text before and after typing the string &quot;bannana bannana bannana bannana&quot; at the start of the line (and pressing no other keys). I can start emacs with the -q flag to avoid this error, but I would prefer not to as I very much like having the theme set. I&#x27;ve also tried enabling a theme after starting with -q (in case there is a typo in my emacs file), and I get the same errant behavior.
 Has anyone here encountered a bug like this before?

                              <span>Seems as if one wants to learn lisp, one has to learn emacs first. That said, I am looking for resources for the absolute beginner to learn emacs, looking for something along the lines of Common lisp A gentle introduction to symbolic computation., but for emacs. Something that assumes you know nothing, starts at the absolute beginningwith lots of exercise and answer to those exercise. Any help will be appreciated. 
 Thanks
 For the record I have been through search, but the signal to noise ratio is pretty high.

                              <span>I&#x27;m interested to know what the future of remove development with emacs might look like. I&#x27;m a long time emacs user, and use rust, lsp-mode, magit and projectile heavily. The remote experience with tramp just isn&#x27;t very good. I&#x27;ve had to work around several bugs that lead to hangs, and even though I&#x27;m only ~20millis away from my remote machine performance is pretty bad. I believe I&#x27;ve already done everything I can to make it fast (ssh control master, etc.), and I&#x27;m still not happy. On the other hand, VSCode (which I&#x27;m not familiar with) or IntelliJ make remote development a breeze. I really like how they hide latency, and handle reconnects well. I&#x27;ve also tried terminal emacs on the remote machine, but I just can&#x27;t deal with the input lag.
 It&#x27;s remarkable how emacs has been able to adapt over the years, and so I&#x27;m interested to hear about some ideas to keep emacs relevant for this usecase.

My main concern is whether it will be difficult to set up Emacs after such a long-term investment in my init files. I would love to hear from others who have made the same transition -- was it hard? Do you have tips to make it easier? 
 Thanks in advance!

 My story:
 Evil: I came to Emacs after a long time of using Vim. Everyone told me to just use Evil and be done with it. I tried Devil but I dont know what it is about it that it left me dissatisfied. There was this feeling that I need to learn Emacs way of doing things. Because all documentation or tutorials I get have Emacs keys. Virtually none of them tell how to do same things in Evil. Always felt like an outsider. Jokes like C-x M-c M-butterfly made me feel like I am not in on the joke because I use Evil. I wanted to learn the Emacs way.
 Pure Emacs: So I uninstalled Evil and went all in to pure Emacs keys. I learnt them quickly but key chords always felt difficult on my fingers. Then I found God mode and Devil…</span>

                              <span>Hi all,
 I recently did &quot;something&quot; in an emacs buffer and lost a bunch of text in different places, and I was unable to undo the deletions. I tried to use ediff (I guess I should have used ediff-backup?) to recover the lost text but not being competent I mixed up buffers &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; and ended up copying the deletions to the backup file and couldn&#x27;t recover from there .... :-).
 Now I am curious if there are recent &#x27;best practices&#x27; to 
  
Avoid doing &#x27;something&#x27; that causes text to disappear
 Have a more robust, for a beginner like me, set of autosave and associated settings.

                              <span>Hi! Seaman Emacs is my attempt at a literate, modular (module-layer), extensible Emacs configuration.
 Seaman makes it easy to add new packages or combinations of packages to your config and safely test them out, as well as phasing out unused packages and remove bloat from your config. Lastly, all source code is easily navigable and documented, with a single .org file in charge of running the show.
 If you use Emacs 29 it&#x27;s super easy to try it out with --init-directory !
 I&#x27;d appreciate any feedback/suggestions/contributions a lot :)
 https://github.com/alopezrivera/Seaman-Emacs/
 Design choices:
  
Source: seaman.org contains is the source of all modules and layers. All source files are asynchronously tangled when saving. config.org contains the source code of your (in this case my) config. All blocks inside are asynchronously tangled to init.el when saving
 Package manager: straight.el
 Key bindings: Emacs + custom
  
Out of the box:
  
Clean UI
 Homescreen
 Easy theme switching (light/dark)
 &quot;Full pack&quot; Org Mode with org-agenda, org-calendar, org-roam etc.
 &quot;Full pack&quot; PDF support with pdf-tools (highlighting, etc.)
 Magit for VC
  
Example config:
 My personal config built with Seaman is here:

                              <span>In my current job, I have to produce google slides all the time. But I still do all my text composing in Org-Mode. 
 ​
 WOndering if anyone has a workflow that gets you from org-mode text to Google Slides quickly and painlessly? I am not talking about anything fancy, and I&#x27;m also not talking about org-reveal or org-re-reveal -- just somehow getting to the point of having one slide per headline, with text. And I can apply templates and formats &amp; add pictures after I have a draft up. 
 Thank you!

                              <span>I&#x27;m getting interested in learning Haskell, and I&#x27;m trying to find a good first project to really sink my teeth into. Like the title says, I&#x27;m mainly targeting scientific applications -- nothing fancy right now, mostly just diagonalizing some matrices and numerical integration -- and I&#x27;m looking for some good libraries to use.
 I&#x27;ve already done a bit of searching on Hackage, but I&#x27;m mainly interested here in what people would recommend for N-dimensional arrays and matrix diagonalization. What&#x27;s the general feeling on HMatrix?
 I guess I should also mention that I&#x27;m coming from a Python+Rust background, where my workflow was to do all the heavy lifting in Rust, serialize the data to a npy/npz file, and then do all the plotting in Python with matplotlib. One thing I haven&#x27;t found on Hackage is something to handle the serialization step -- ideally, I&#x27;d like to take an HMatrix object (or some other equivalent) and just call a function to write it to a file. Does anyone know of a good solution for that? Otherwise, what are some nice, ergonomic (preferably matplotlib-like) plotting libraries?
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Hi, please bear with me as my core talents are not in programming but I’m interested in learning Haskell and generally inspired by the project and community.
 I have two projects in mind. One is to build a user friendly app on the web for general budgeting, and for more advanced cases; financial modelling and business use. This is a product idea, but my heart is really in number theory and various applied areas of mathematics. So second idea is to build a function library for a similar calculator catering to that. I know there’s good stuff out there but partly it is to develop my skills and understanding. 
 Is Haskell suitable for this? Would it be unwise to try hit two birds at once and just have a common library? Or should I keep the product idea seperate and use a more commonly understood language like python? Much thanks in advance!

                              <span>I&#x27;ve set up LunarVim for Scala programming, and I&#x27;m experiencing an issue where the Scala standard library provides autocomplete, hover, and definitions, but other packages, whether they are internal or external, do not display any information related to types or definitions. In the case of the Scala standard library, I only receive a message stating &quot;No information available&quot; (as shown in screenshot 3). Have you ever encountered this situation, or is there something I might be overlooking?

                              <span>Hey all - just throwing this out to see if anyone understands what is going on in the industry? At this time last year after my contract ran out recruiters were knocking down my door trying to get my 10+ years of functional Scala experience to one of their many clients that wanted it. This year after a similar situation I am being rejected by 9/10 applications off the rip and those I have gotten an interview with have either ghosted or rejected and my previous recruiters have nothing in their pipelines. Now I know there are several variables that could be at play but I can&#x27;t remember ever having such bad luck in my entire career at least getting in the door somewhere. Does anyone have any advice, commiseration or burning desire to team up and start a consulting company?

An alternative frontend for Haskell? by gilmi

In this blog post,
we will learn how to include Bayesian machine learning in a reactive rhine application.
Imagine a program that reacts in real time to a sensor input:
It might be a robot, an app using GPS data on a phone,
or a device to track an object’s location.
Also assume that we have some prior knowledge about how this data is produced,
so it makes sense to express this knowledge as a Bayesian model,
and use Bayesian machine learning to infer the best estimate of the state of the robot, phone, or object.
Then our program should be able to react continuously in real time to this estimate.
There exist numerous libraries for Bayesian modelling and inference, such as Stan, PyMC, and (in Haskell) monad-bayes,
but it is not straightforw…</span>

                              <span>I just configured eglot for C++ using clangd, and my eldoc buffers include some spurious characters rendered as two highlighted underscores after each symbol ( e.g., &quot;Foo__&quot;): https://i.imgur.com/Snqt9JA.png
 If I copy them to another buffer, they turn out to be a backtick followed by two spaces: &quot;&#x60; &quot;.
 Does anybody know how to get rid of them?
 I tried downloading the latest eglot (rather than using the one that comes with Emacs 29) and setting &#x27;eglot-prefer-plaintext&#x27; to &#x27;t&#x27;, but this got rid of all syntax highlighting.

                              <span>In my quest to create a personalized note-taking system, I chose to use Emacs. While I&#x27;m aware of various existing packages like roam, zk, and org-journal, I wanted a solution that precisely catered to my needs, without unnecessary features or the loss of essential ones. This drove me back to Emacs from Logseq, as I realized I only required a simple system for taking daily notes.
 With that in mind, I crafted a configuration to facilitate note-taking and accomplished a feature I had long desired: integration with Raindrop to fetch my bookmarks. Surprisingly, it was a straightforward process.
 This experience has reaffirmed my belief in the versatility of Emacs, allowing it to be tailored to meet one&#x27;s unique requirements. I&#x27;m now fully immersed in the world of Emacs.
 Feel free to take a look at my configuration and offer any tips, code suggestions, or ideas on how to further enhance, simplify, or expand it. You can find the configuration here:

                              <span>My eglot just stops working properly from time to time. Every once in a while, it&#x27;ll get &quot;out of sync&quot; from the buffer. i.e. even after I correct the syntax error it reports, it still sends the old code to LSP, and therefore keeps reporting the fixed errors.
 &#x60;elgot-reconnect&#x60; fixes it, but it&#x27;s really not a solution to call &#x60;eglot-reconnect&#x60; every 10 minutes.

                              <span>Hey friends! I&#x27;m using Doom Emacs and have vc-gutter enabled. When I make changes, a single character (for example &#x3D; pops up on the left side of the line numbers. This has the effect of shifting the line numbers and all content of the buffer to the right. Ideally, I&#x27;d just like the column to ALWAYS be present even if there are no changes. I tried modifying multiple variables, but I believe all the fringe ones are for graphical. Does anyone have guidance? Thanks! 
 Update: git-gutter:hide-gutter is already set to nil and it doesn&#x27;t seem to preserve that column.

                              <span>Hello to all, As some of you probably did, i jumped on the treesitter train with emacs 29.1.
 I replaced my major modes by their ts counterparts, and gave it a try. For the keywords colors, it was mostly fine, and at first I only checked that and was content with it. 
 Things went a bit sour when I starting writing code, in particular the indent-rules. I have used mainly the following so far : - cmake-ts-mode - c++-ts-mode - yaml-ts-mode
 Over the past two weeks there has not been a work day where I did not have to complete or &quot;fix&quot; indentation rules to my liking.
 On the one hand it is much easier than before to tweak things, where either there was a customizable variable, either you were screwed. Now you can add rich rules, kind of easily
 On the other hand, the out of the box experience was much worse, barely usable indentation especially for the c++ mode which, despites its 4 presets, lacks the many quick toggles from cc-mode. 
 I do commend maintainers though for their amazing core implementation, the api + utilities make debugging tree sitter rules a breeze. 
 How has your treesitter Journey been so far ?

 I would like to simplify my file and use variables for some file locations (using a variable in agenda section, etc).
 What is the right way to do that in lisp?
 Is it as simple as this?
 (setq win-file-location &#x27;(&quot;c:/Users/Username/Desktop/filename.org&quot;))
 (setq linux-file-location &#x27;(&quot;/home/username/Desktop/filename.org&quot;))

                              <span>Hi, 
 I have read (but not tested it yet) that logseq has a module to browse or search in the Discogs DB, and I thought &quot;pffff.... emacs has it for years already&quot;... but I hardly find anything on this topic.
 I have found an old project on github from Mineo regarding Musicbrainzm but I was expecting more.
 Is there any reason for this lack of solutions?
 I am no developer, I am not complaining, but I am surprised, this is probably the first domain where I can not find a good solution for my needs with emacs (I may also have poorly searched, would it be the case, please show me the path to the truth!!!!) 
 Any idea why? Thx for your insights!

                              <span>Hi folks,
 Does anyone know if there is a plugin for Emacs that offers like a popup where you search recent files.
 Right now I use counsel and it works in minibuffer below...but I saw a video where you could have that working like a mid-screen popup and search files.

 I guess a bash script could be an option but curious if others have this work flow and how it works ?
 Currently in a golang workflow but even better if there is a generic solution.

                              <span>I use Consult, Vertico and orderless in my config. But when I am looking for a file (consult-ls-git) I would like it not to include subpath or the path when filtering the results, or if it&#x27;s possible to show matches in filename first - so they have more score for the sorting. Is this possible. 
 /LoginView/SomeFile.swift
 /LoginView/LoginView.swift 
 Right now I would get this when I type &quot;Login&quot;, that fine but if it&#x27;s not possible to exclude non matching files, I would like the LoginView to be the first choice.

 but I rather have everything hapenning in one go, using the q letter for this. (lazyvim sems to have that setup by default which i seems to have got used to it)
 It&#x27;s easy enough to redefine an object like this:
 (define-key evil-outer-text-objects-map &quot;q&quot; &#x27;evil-a-double-quote) (define-key evil-inner-text-objects-map &quot;q&quot; &#x27;evil-inner-double-quote) 
 which obviously only select the double quotes, anyone would know how to extend this to backquote &#x60; or single quote &#x27;

                              <span>Hi ! 
 I am looking for a working example of an import of a package from Github Packages Maven repository using scala-cli. 
 My use case would be to import libs shared internally in my company org. And if I get it working for private packages, then it should work for public ones too ! 
 Currently I have :
 scala-cli config --dump
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;json
 { &quot;repositories&quot;: { &quot;credentials&quot;: [{&quot;host&quot;:&quot;https://maven.pkg.github.com/MY_ORG&quot;,&quot;user&quot;:&quot;value:PrivateToken&quot;,&quot;password&quot;:&quot;env:GITHUB_TOKEN&quot;,&quot;matchHost&quot;:true}]
 } }
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 and the following using directives 
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; //&gt; using repository &quot;https://maven.pkg.github.com/MY_ORG&quot; //&gt; using lib &quot;my.org::my-lib:0.1.0&quot;
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 which yields an unauthorized error on import.
 I also tried setting the repositories.credential.host to maven.pkg.github.com and maven.pkg.github.com/MY_ORG without success. 
 As for the repository in the using directive I have also tried ( not sure if I tried every combination of both ): - https://maven.pkg.github.com/MY_ORG/_ - https://maven.pkg.github.com/MY_ORG/REPO_OF_MY_LIB
 I am sure the token works. The unauthorized error seem to indicate either the crednetials are not passed or I am targeting the wrong URLs. Any idea on what&#x27;s wrong with my setup ?

                              <span>Slipped in between paragraphs about being worried that her family&#x27;s hiding place will be discovered by a new building owner and the fairness of rationing butter, Anne Frank mentions being gifted a zettelkasten to track her reading:

  
Father emptied a card file for Margot and me and filled it with index cards that are blank on one side. This is to become our reading file, in which Margot and I are supposed to note down the books we’ve read, the author and the date.


Niklas Luhmann (December 8, 1927-1998), famous for his own 90,000+ slip reading file, was a year and a half older than Anne Frank (June 12, 1929-1945) who received her first card index file in February 1943 (likely between the 27th, the date of her diary entry mentioning it and the prior diary entry on February 5th). It was given to her by her father at the age of 13. As would have been commonplace, she was intended to use it as a &quot;reading file&quot; to note down the books she&#x27;d read along with the author and the date.
One can only wonder at how many entries she would have made over the span of her life had it not come to such an abrupt end.

                              <span>It would be really nice to have everything in org mode, but I continually find myself coming back to planning with paper for all but the toy cases.
 It would be really nice, as a Computer Person, to have all of my notes and project management in a computer system. For instance, I have to manage my work sprints using Linear. But I find that org mode, and to some extent emacs, has too much friction for my liking.
 In the first place, it is not trivial to use with a mobile phone. Right now I have an emacs instance running inside termux, and notes have to be ported over with Syncthing. This necessitates (at least ideally) running a spare machine 24/7 to sync with. Not to mention that using my smartphone probably increases my risk of cancer at least slightly.
 If I have to write something down, I&#x27;m reluctant to open a new emacs window, navigate to my buffer, and then write down the point.
 Also, the default org-agenda views are much inferior to the typical calendar or timetable.
 Sorry for the emotional nature of this post. I&#x27;d be interested to hear if anybody was in a similar place, and where they ended up going.

                              <span>Some context: I&#x27;m a Java programmer, but I don&#x27;t like it. I have a background in mathematics so naturally I am interested in (pure) functional programming. At my dayjob, I have expressed my feelings towards Java and expressed I would like to do something more &quot;mathematically motivated&quot; and coined Scala and their effect systems as examples. My teamlead, who himself is a developer, wanted me to give him a bit more of an explanation of what I meant by this, so I set out to gather some information I can present to him.
 But
 I am confused as to how I can unite the following two descriptions of effects:
  
Rob Norris in his talk &#x27;Functional Programming with Effects&#x27; talks about mathematical functions and then talks about effects as basically ways to be able to do the stuff we&#x27;re used to in programming like functions not being total, mutability, ... He then talks about the 6 most known &#x27;effects&#x27; and wants to be able to compose them, then concludes that basically an effect is an &#x60;F[_]&#x60; which is a Monad.
 Cats-Effect, from the docs says that their typeclass hierarchy describe, fundamentally, what it means to be a functional effect. But their typeclass hierarchy is for their specific runtime and focusses almost exclusively on asynchrony, parallelism and concurrency. I don&#x27;t see &#x60;Option&#x60; or &#x60;Either&#x60; fitting in here.
  
So what gives? I am really confused at this point, but I would really appreciate if someone could shed some light on this. 
 Bonus question: In the same talk, Rob Norris says that there are a lot of other effects out there. How do I find them? This sounds silly, but does he just mean like &quot;custom monads&quot; that we might define in our business which are only applicable in our custom business environment, or does he mean more powerful abstractions which are just more complex than the ones he showed?

                              <span>Does anybody have a good resource about emacs29 tree-sitter indentation? In particular I&#x27;m interested on not indenting inside namespaces for C/C++ styles.
 With cc-mode this works: (c-set-offset &#x27;innamespace [0]), for example.
 This is what I have so far that, of course, it is not working:
 &#x60;&#x60; (use-package c++-ts-mode :ensure nil ;; emacs built-in :preface (defun my/c-ts-indent-style() (;; do not indent namespace children ((parent-is &quot;namespace_definition&quot;) parent-bol 0)
  ;; append to bsd style ,@(alist-get &#x27;bsd (c-ts-mode--indent-styles &#x27;cpp)))) :bind (:map c++-ts-mode-map (&quot;M-&quot; . treesit-beginning-of-defun) (&quot;M-&quot; . treesit-end-of-defun)) :config (setq c-ts-mode-indent-offset 4) (setq c-ts-mode-indent-style #&#x27;my/c-ts-indent-style)) 
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 SOLUTION: In another thread my question was answered, here&#x27;s the link to that thread if anybody is interested: https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/16zhgrd/comment/k4aw2yi/?utm_source&#x3D;share&amp;utm_medium&#x3D;web2x&amp;context&#x3D;3

I have been facing this friction when i want to switch editors from vim (neovim ) to emacs that i am very accustom to my keybinds in vim and i use those binds everywhere possible in my browser in pycharm , c lion , vs code if i ever have to use that Question i want to ask is this : if i use vim bindings inside emacs (i heard that you can do that and that made me want to try emacs) how far can i go before i hit the limit of what&#x27;s possible using emacs , will i have to switch back and learn normal emacs key bindings to use advanced features and configure it to my liking is there a hard limit to the customizations you can do with vim bindings this may seem like a stupid question but this thought of keep using vim bindings in emacs and then having to relearn all of the muscle memory again is keeping me from trying it , but i want to use something like emacs for my personal development all the time for now on to forever it is advisable to use emacs on windows system or should i get started with it inside my Wsl system any recommendations, suggestions , roadmap to learn emcas better and efficiently is very well appreciated ,any links to videos articles blogs and resources for learning are appreciated as well

                              <span>If you would have the power to change any Emacs-default setting, what would that be and why?
 What kind of setting do you think would be useful for a lot (or a majority) of Emacs-users?
 One of my examples:
 (fido-vertical-mode t)
 Because seeing a list of candidates as you type and being able to choose from it with meaningful key-bindings is way more convenient and efficient than the tab-completion-system (I think this claim is backed by the way all those external packages work; helm, ivy, vertico). This is especially suited for a default because you can still use the tab-completion-system with it. So nobody needs to change habits.

 I just fired up magit to merge my dev branch into master, and somehow the keys have changed or are not working. I used to hit &quot;b l&quot; to checkout a local branch (in this case master) where I&#x27;d then merge dev into it, push it to github, and then checkout out dev again.
 I get this message:-
 ​
  
&quot;transient-setup: Suffix magit-branch.
.merge/remote is not defined or autoloaded as a command&quot;
  
Hopefully someone here has recently done the slog and can save this lazy individual some time. What changed? I havent touched my magit setup for literally years.
 (magit-checkout from minibuffer works fine).

                              <span>In this post I share a basic model built in Haskell to help plan for education expenses (or other large, future, time-bounded expenses).
 This beginner-friendly post demonstrates many simple Haskell functions, especially for working with lists. It also shows how to build and execute stateful computations using State
 from mtl. I (mostly) avoid type signatures and just focus on defining the terms, but there are plenty of links to API documentation. At the end of the post I suggest some enhancements to the model that would be good exercises for learners (and might be fun even for more experienced Haskell programmers).

                              <span>I periodically run an emacs batch command using (org-store-agenda-views) to generate plain text and html versions of my org-agenda. This process works fine generally.
 However, some of my TODO headlines contain org-formatted links (i.e. within the headline). In both the .txt and .html generated files, these links appear with the full text of the org link - i.e. with [[link destination][link title]] visible in the generated/viewed file - rather than just &#x27;link title&#x27;.
 Is this expected behaviour? Are there any settings that affect this behaviour? I would prefer not to see the full org link source in the generated files.
 (I&#x27;m currently running org version 9.6.10 and emacs 29.1 on Linux. When I first started generating these agenda files, the links in headlines exported correctly. I suspect that the current behaviour began after an org version upgrade, but I cannot remember which one, and have just been living with it since.)

 *(p2+1)&#x3D;&#x27;e&#x27;; 
 end up w/ preceding commas. I&#x27;ve tried w/ emacs -q and I have the same issue. Is there any short term fix for this?
 ​
 UPDATE
 I realize now this is a quoting mechanism to prevent confusion inside an org document, and that this should not be removed. Instead is there a good way to font lock these commas so that they are barely visible?

I have this installed from Melba and when I do any sort of docker list commands images, containers etc the buffer opens with the correct headers but no content. I can run docker ps just fine on a term and get results, I’m in the docker group so no audio or root required. I have removed any options relating to docker from my init.el. Any thoughts on how I can debug this?

                              <span>In deadgrep, I&#x27;m having a hard time using the glob option to exclude files. Using rg globs, I can do something like rg Foo -g &#x27;!gtest*cpp&#x27; to exclude all of my gtest files.
 In deadgrep, the same glob filter, !gtest*cpp returns NO results. If I remove the exclude, !, I ONLY get gtest*cpp results.
 Does deadgrep handle excluding glob patterns differently?

                              <span>Hi fellow r/emacs ers,
 I am trying to have fzf working under windows 10 in emacs. So far, calling it with M-x only show errors:
 Debugger entered--Lisp error: (file-error &quot;Spawning child process&quot; &quot;Invalid argument&quot;) make-process(:name &quot;fzf&quot; :buffer # :command (&quot;/bin/sh&quot; &quot;-c&quot; &quot;stty -nl echo rows 20 columns 80 sane 2&gt;NUL;if [ $...&quot; &quot;..&quot; &quot;sh&quot; &quot;-c&quot; &quot;fzf -x --color bw --print-query --margin&#x3D;1,0 --no-...&quot;)) start-process(&quot;fzf&quot; # &quot;/bin/sh&quot; &quot;-c&quot; &quot;stty -nl echo rows 20 columns 80 sane 2&gt;NUL;if [ $...&quot; &quot;..&quot; &quot;sh&quot; &quot;-c&quot; &quot;fzf -x --color bw --print-query --margin&#x3D;1,0 --no-...&quot;) term-exec-1(&quot;fzf&quot; # &quot;sh&quot; (&quot;-c&quot; &quot;fzf -x --color bw --print-query --margin&#x3D;1,0 --no-...&quot;)) term-exec(# &quot;fzf&quot; &quot;sh&quot; nil (&quot;-c&quot; &quot;fzf -x --color bw --print-query --margin&#x3D;1,0 --no-...&quot;)) make-term(&quot;fzf&quot; &quot;sh&quot; nil &quot;-c&quot; &quot;fzf -x --color bw --print-query --margin&#x3D;1,0 --no-...&quot;) fzf--start(nil fzf--action-find-file) fzf(nil) funcall-interactively(fzf nil) command-execute(fzf record) execute-extended-command(nil &quot;fzf&quot; #(&quot;fzf&quot; 0 3 (face (nano-strong nano-salient)))) funcall-interactively(execute-extended-command nil &quot;fzf&quot; #(&quot;fzf&quot; 0 3 (face (nano-strong nano-salient)))) command-execute(execute-extended-command)  I do not know why /bin/sh is called
 I have Msys64 installed, fzf works in my terminal. I also have bash.exe working fine.
 In emacs, I have modified these variables in order to have bash.exe called instead of /bin/sh
  
sh-shell is set to bash
 sh-shell-file is set to the path to bash.exe
  
I have also search for mentions of /bin/sh using deadgrep... nothing useful. I do not know what to do.
 please help me fix this problem. thx

                              <span>Hi there,
 I am a big user of GMail&#x27;s &quot;Scheduled Send&quot; feature. It allows me to reply at my pace and make sure the thread does not become a ping-pong match and replies won&#x27;t come back earlier than expected.
 How to do that &quot;on my own&quot;? I use notmuch + msmtp (within emacs) to handle most of my email but like half of it I have to manage via Gmail&#x27;s web interface because of the scheduling needs.
 I know about msmtp-queue but it is a all or nothing solution. I would love to be able to schedule my emails, either at Emacs level or SMTP level, with some header or something.
 Any ideas?

                              <span>Has anyone been able to get xwidget-webkit to work under Wayland? I saw that support for pgtk was added a couple of years ago so I decided to give it a whirl. Compiled emacs 29.1 on Linux x86_64 with webkit2gtk-2.42.1 and the configure options &#x60;--with-xwidgets&#x60; and &#x60;--with-pgtk&#x60;. I tried opening a url with &#x60;xwidget-webkit-browse-url&#x60;, but emacs crashed with the error:
 &quot;ERROR **: 12:43:15.326: GDK is not able to create a GL context: The current backend does not support OpenGL.&quot;
 which is weird, because &#x60;eglinfo&#x60; does not report anything out of the ordinary. 
 xwidgets has always been finicky for me and there&#x27;s very little information available on the internet so I&#x27;d be interested in knowing if others have got it to work and it&#x27;s just a problem with my setup.

                              <span>I would like to use gnuplot to make a linear regression on data with org / babel
 I try to get the output of the fit function (it should be plain text), but there is nothing appearing
 Here is a sample for the source block in org file
 #+begin_src gnuplot :export both :results output $data &lt;&lt; EOD 140 492 150 482 160 474 EOD f(x) &#x3D; m*x + b fit f(x) $data using 1:2 via m,b #+end_src #+RESULTS: 
 No result is shown.
 If I type this into gnuplot directly I get following output

 which I would like to see directly inside of the org file. 
 Has anybody an idea, what I am doing wrong?

                              <span>I use org-roam-bibtex to manage bibliography notes, and use org-roam capture templates to create roam nodes associated with each reference in my bibliography.
 The org-roam-bibtex context allows for access to some bibliography entry fields like the path to the PDF file on my system. I&#x27;d like to org-attach this PDF to a heading that expands in the org-capture template while retaining the option :immediate-finish t. Is this a possibility?

                              <span>I haven&#x27;t developed or even looked at the source code of either. So I suppose I&#x27;m asking those who have.
 IntelliJ&#x27;s Scala plugin really doesn&#x27;t work too well. I really like IntelliJ&#x27;s IDEA, but it&#x27;s substantially harder to debug Scala 3 in my experience.
 I&#x27;m aware there are LSP servers for IntelliJ. How outlandish would it be use Metals in IntelliJ?
 (I&#x27;m asking out of curiosity, even if I could, I&#x27;m more of a VSCode user)

Ideas I&#x27;m thinking about:
Atmospheric Chemical Kinetics
OpenAI&#x27;s ChatGPT as writing tutor
Should I quit? It would free me to switch to a more worthy, interesting opportunity. Something more in line with my goals.
Do I know what it means to write for the benefit of others?
Interstitial Journaling
The Indian Monk Tilopa&#x27;s Six Nails and how they relate to mindfulness.
I&#x27;m thinking about the tension between what is easy, fun, and comfortable and what adds value to my life.
How do I physically review my ZK notes and journal entries? How do I make sense of this process? How do I connect with what is valuable in this process?
The ephemerality of thought.
Self-mentoring.
Things I&#x27;m reading:

The &quot;My rolling ten-day zettel production&quot; is produced by a script for attachment to my daily journaling template. I do my journaling in Bear to keep personal journaling separate from my knowledge work.
Let me know if you would like to discuss any of these notes.

                              <span>TL;DR Fairly new emacs user here. This is a story of how I recently had a problem and I came up with a cool way to solve it using dired, registers, regex, and macros. In particular, I realized I could maintain state during macro execution using a register. IMO I found a cool solution and I&#x27;m proud of myself.
 My problem: I&#x27;ve been attending a class and downloaded all the lectures. Unfortunately, each lecture is in a folder named [lecture-xyz], and its subtitle twin is [lecture-xyz]_subtitles. It was annoying to find the current lecture because nothing was sorted. I decided to prefix each folder with a number so they would sort correctly in my file manager (and dired).
 The Initial Approach: I&#x27;d jump between the course website and my file manager, renaming folders one by one. It was a tedio…</span>

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 Today I would like to share another package for FPGA &amp; ASIC development: fpga.el
 - https://github.com/gmlarumbe/fpga
 ​
 It provides features for major vendors and open source tools:
  
Xilinx, Altera, Lattice, Cadence, Siemens, Synopsys and Yosys tools
 Synthesis/simulation compilation modes for error regexp matching: 
 Colorize error codes and jump to files where errors appeared
 
 Interactive shells with syntax highlighting and auto-completion
 Major-modes with syntax highlighting and auto-completion: 
 Vivado XDC major-mode
 Quartus SDC and QSF major-modes
 Cadence vManager VSIF major-mode
 Yosys script major-mode
 
 Global Gtags creation from files in Vivado XPR and Quartus QPF project files
 And some others...
  
​
 A couple of demo videos and screenshots:

                              <span>I’m using a monospace font that supports variable weights. In some applications you can specify the weight as a number between 1 - 1000, similar to CSS. For example, iAWriter supports this.
 Is there a way to set a custom weight in emacs? I’d like more fine grained control than light, regular, medium, etc.

 Screenshot of Emacs with three Eat terminals and a Eshell. Upper-left: line mode Upper-right: Sixel. Lower-left: Eat running Emacs, using truecolor support. Lower-right: Eat inside Eshell.
 Eat 0.9 has been released! 🎉
 Notable changes include:
  
Support for Emacs 26
 Sixel support
 Line mode (like Term mode&#x27;s one)
 Various bug fixes (including that cursor jumping bug).
  
Eat is a reasonably fast terminal emulator for Emacs written entirely in Emacs Lisp, with various features like shell intergration, 24bit colors, complete mouse support and Sixel support, etc. It can run most (if not all) full-screen terminal programs. It also allows to run full-screen programs in Eshell.

                              <span>I am writing a small major mode in Emacs, and I want to add some support for when electrc-*-modes are enabled.
 In particular, I need the following functionality:
  
Automatic newline when | is typed; and
 Indent and newline when [ is typed.
  
I have been looking into different ways of doing this, and I have come up with the following:
  
Using electric-layout-mode, e.g. (add-to-list &#x27;electric-layout-rules &#x27;(?| . before)); and
 Using electric-indent-mode, e.g. (setq-local electric-indent-chars (append electric-indent-chars &#x27;(?\[))).
  
I have also read about the electric-pairs-mode which might be more appropriate for the latter. There are also more manual ways of doing this, with hooks (post self insert hooks?).
 However, I am struggling to find any documentation on any electric functions, and different other major modes do these kind of things in different ways. My question is: what is the best way to do what I am after? If there is one function that I can bundle both of these features in, then that might be better. But maybe it&#x27;s best that I keep these separate in case the user wants to enable, for example, layout mode but not pairs mode.
 I&#x27;d love to hear from developers of major modes with experience implementing such a feature!

                              <span>Typst is a very young but very promising markup language with use-cases similar to LaTeX. One big objective advantage of typst over LaTeX is compilation speed.
 For that reason alone, it would be nice to be able to export org to PDF through typst.
 Does anyone have a fledgling ox-typst implementation (open to contributions)?

But there&#x27;s one little annoyance that I&#x27;m not able to get rid off. That is, whenever I start emacs, it opens up with *elpaca-log* buffer. Is this the default behaviour? Or is it happening only with me because of my config? How can I fix this?

 In this post I will show how to significantly improve the performance of combinator based reducers by using a alternative abstraction algorithms. These algorithms are based on the paper λ to SKI, Semantically by Oleg Kiselyov and closely follow Ben Lynn’s implementation of Kiselyov’s ideas.
 I will also give detailed comparisons of the different approaches regarding emitted code size and execution performance on different reducers.

                              <span>TL;DR: New to Haskell and looking for an existing tool that can automatically insert traceShow statements for debugging. Also open to alternative suggestions or better ways to debug. Thanks in advance! 
 Hello, Haskell enthusiasts! 👋
 I&#x27;m new to Haskell and I&#x27;ve been exploring the language through a project I&#x27;m working on. To debug my code, I&#x27;ve been manually inserting &#x60;traceShow&#x60; statements from the Debug.Trace module. While I find this method effective, it&#x27;s also quite time-consuming.
 Problem Statement:
 I&#x27;m wondering if there&#x27;s an existing tool that can automate the insertion of &#x60;traceShow&#x60; statements into Haskell code at key points. This would significantly streamline my debugging process.
 haskell
 -- Example: Original Code getMiddle2 :: String -&gt; String getMiddle2 sourceString | isOddLength &#x3D; takeMiddle 1 | otherwise &#x3D; takeMiddle 2 where sourceLength &#x3D; length sourceString ... 
 What I Would Like the Tool to Produce:
 haskell
 -- Example: With traceShow statements getMiddle2 :: String -&gt; String getMiddle2 sourceString | traceShow (&quot;Checking isOddLength:&quot;, isOddLength) isOddLength &#x3D; traceShow (&quot;Taking middle 1:&quot;, takeMiddle 1) takeMiddle 1 | otherwise &#x3D; traceShow (&quot;Taking middle 2:&quot;, takeMiddle 2) takeMiddle 2 where sourceLength &#x3D; traceShow (&quot;Source Length:&quot;, sourceLength) length sourceString ... 
 What I&#x27;ve Considered:
 I&#x27;ve thought about crafting a tool myself that involves parsing the Haskell source code into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and then traversing this tree to insert &#x60;traceShow&#x60; statements. But before going down that rabbit hole, I wanted to consult the community. Is there already a tool out there that can help me with this?
 Open to Suggestions:
 Being new to Haskell, I&#x27;m also open to any advice or alternative approaches for debugging or learning the language. If there&#x27;s a better way to do things, I&#x27;m all ears! 🐰
 Thank you for any recommendations, experiences, or advice you can share. I appreciate it! 🙏

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I am delving into the development of a turn-based card game and exploring technology stack options. Considering the essential need for distributed, fault-tolerant, and high-availability systems in the game, I am leaning towards utilizing Scala and Akka. The revenue scope of the project stays within the bounds making Akka usage free. 
 Here are a few points I&#x27;m pondering upon:
  
How effective is Akka in managing distributed systems for a gaming application, especially concerning fault tolerance and high availability?
 
For a turn-based card game, does Scala (along with Akka) provide a viable and efficient development pathway, or should I be looking at different languages/libraries?
 
If you have experience using Scala/Akka in game development, are there any pitfalls or challenges that you encountered which might be insightful for a beginner in this stack?
 
 Any insights, alternative suggestions, or experiences shared will be incredibly valuable. Thank you!

 Quick question: why no colons in extension methods? Object and class declarations use colons to group things neatly (methods, fields), but extension methods don&#x27;t. What&#x27;s the rationale behind this syntax difference? Is it just a stylistic choice or something more?

                              <span>I am at a Russel Group University for computer science and physics and I haven’t done programming for around 2 years since school. I did good at computer science at school with an A aswell as an A at maths and B at physics. This being said however, I’m finding it really difficult to understand my computing classes. We are doing Functional programming with Haskell and the only thing I have programmed in was Visual Basic. Does anyone have any advice on getting good grades/better at Haskell programming

                              <span>I can fold functions/methods/classes but not code blocks (e.g. for, if, ...) or doc strings.
 How can I achieve the latter? Which component is responsible? Which doc I should read?
 I do use Emacs 27 and 29 with eglot and evil-mode.

                              <span>OK, first of all, I&#x27;ve tried the orgmode and I think it&#x27;s awesome. I like a lot of the advantages that emacs provides not being restricted to being a terminal app. However, despite it&#x27;s huge potential, I don&#x27;t know how people use it productively, I mean afaik it&#x27;s as potent as an OS so you can do crazy things like &quot;making a script to get code from anywhere&quot; so... Basically I want to ask you about the features that you like the most. I&#x27;m not a guy who is going to use just ONE editor tho, I have to use VSCode for several stuff, I use orgmode for... well documenting, organizing (I should use the code features that it provides, which blew my mind) and oc I use nvim. I want to know what are the things that people do that boosted their productivity in emacs vs other editors, I think each one has their strengths and weaknesses. Ty in advance.

                              <span>Is it possible to add vertical space at the top and bottom of the frame? I&#x27;ve found a mode for centering horizontally (thx, olivetti) but I&#x27;d really like something for vertical space as well. Preferably, buffer-local (specifically my org-mode buffers).
 Some searching showed me some really hacky things like creating two windows at the top and bottom, abusing faces, and other things.
 This seems like a trivial thing. Is this really not built in? I can play pong, run a terminal, manage X windows, browse the web, but I can&#x27;t add top and bottom margin without hacks?

                              <span>Projectile seems intent on sub-dividing my npm-based monorepo despite having placed this defun specifying that it should only consider a project root if it&#x27;s a vc-root-dir:
 ;; we need this wrapper to match Projectile&#x27;s API (defun projectile-vc-root-dir (dir) &quot;Retrieve the root directory of the project at DIR using &#x60;vc-root-dir&#x27;.&quot; (let ((default-directory dir)) (vc-root-dir))) (setq projectile-project-root-functions &#x27;(projectile-vc-root-dir)) 
 That was taken line-for-line from the Projectile docs. Despite this, and despite nuking all of my Projectile projects/caches (to be 100% sure), anytime I open a library directory within my monorepo; Projectile will consider that a new project and act accordingly (i.e. I can no longer search outside of that library&#x27;s directory). To put it more explicitly:
 / monorepo-root | |--libraryA |--libraryB 
 ... when I initially enter my project and search for a file, I can see that Projectile is correctly searching through all directories. However, when I then enter into, say, libraryA and again try to search for files in the monorepo, Projectile is only searching under libraryA (I understand it as being seen as a different project in Projectile&#x27;s eyes).
 Am I missing something?

                              <span>When doing some functions like (shell-command) or (project-compile) the minibuffer has control of the cursor meaning the text can be manipulated using the various text editing commands. 
 When in I-search though the cursor only flashes to the minibuffer and then returns to the buffer so whenever I do the text editing commands it edits the actual buffer and not the I-search target phrase.
 Is there a way to make I-search take control of the cursor in a similar way to the others? I tried swiper which takes control but it is very slow for me when search large files ~3000 lines.

                              <span>Hi,
 now that the Matrix bridge for libera.chat is closed, I&#x27;m trying to use irc the proper way with an irc client.
 I&#x27;ve a ZNC server running and it expects username and password in this format username:password , but ERC expects it in two seperate fields, one for each.
 This is what I currently have in my config:
 ;; C-c erc, keybinding will start erc (global-set-key &quot;\C-cerc&quot; (lambda () (interactive) (erc-ssl :server &quot;zncserver.org&quot; :port &quot;6697&quot; :nick &quot;nickiename&quot; :password &quot;password123&quot;))) 
 and this is the format ZNC server instruction page has:
 /server zncserver.org 6697 username:password 
 When I try the above ERC config, connection to the ZNC server fails.
 Then I tried using :nick &quot;nickiename:password123&quot; format in above ERC config, then connection was sucessful however ERC doesn&#x27;t recognize the second half as password and uses the whole as nick and ZNC server asks for the password again.
 How can I resolve this issue?

                              <span>I was recently looking through someone&#x27;s .emacs repo and saw they were using use-package chords for avy. I decided to give it a try. I can see the potential but it seems too slow. I&#x27;m forced to pause typing for a moment to allow it to register the chord before I can choose the char to go-to.
 I attached a gif below first showing what it looks like with a pause and then what happens when I type all the necessary commands in sequence. (in my case jw for avy-got-word and then o to go to words beginning with &#x27;o&#x27;)
 my setup is shown below
 (use-package avy
 :chords
 (&quot;jw&quot; . avy-goto-word-1))
 Is there anything i can do to make it more smooth and reliable?

 I recently hopped on the Emacs train and I came across an article where this screenshot was shared. I really liked the colors, fonts and the way it just looked. I was wondering if that was an available theme to download and if anyone could point me to it. I tried image searching, looking maybe the Doom Emacs themes, but could not find something that resembles it.

 This causes issues when working in org lists since the indentation breaks after the #+ lines. Is there a way to fix the rendering and indentation with org modern? Any help is appreciated. Thanks.

 I wanted to share a new emacs package I&#x27;ve been working on, which is built on top of another project I created ~6 years ago. I let vzi bitrot for too long. I live inside emacs to the extent that I can, but one of the areas I&#x27;ve long been frustrated in is the ability to visualize data controlled from an emacs buffer. I&#x27;ve lately been enjoying deno, and got inspired and decided to finally rewrite vzi using it. Of course, I needed to be able to control it all from emacs with a few keystrokes, and hence vzi.el was born. If you are like me, you might appreciate these packages.
 The rough architecture of vzi is that it controls the browser remotely using the chrome devtools protocol, and pipes data to a host page from stdin. A final html report…</span>

Diff view supports diffing a branch against master which opens up a side panel with the changes, with 2 code buffers- one old, one new/local - while having LSP support on the current branch. https://github.com/sindrets/diffview.nvim/blob/main/USAGE.md. Any idea if it’s possible to do something in Emacs?
 I’m not looking to leave comments directly in Emacs (yet). I just want to be able to compare the diffs with some code intelligence. Thanks!

 I often use the bottom of a table to calculate some statistics (here in this example it is always just the sum of the column). To easily deduce, what was calculated, I like to add a simple string to the result (in this example it is always &quot;Sum:&quot;). 
 Now here is an example with the various methods I know to achieve this:
 | just append | it fails | utilize calc | plain elisp | |-------------+----------+--------------+-------------| | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | | 3 | - | - | - | | 4 | 4 | 4 | 4 | | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | |-------------+----------+--------------+-------------| | 6 | 6 | 6 | 6 | | 7 | 7 | 7 | 7 | | 8 | - | - | - | | 9 | 9 | 9 | 9 | | 10 | 10 | 10 | 10 | |-------------+----------+--------------+-------------| | 55 Sum | m | Sum: 44 | Sum: 44 | #+TBLFM: @&gt;$1&#x3D;vsum(@I$1..@III$1) Sum #+TBLFM: @&gt;$2&#x3D;vsum(@I$2..@III$2);N Sum #+TBLFM: @&gt;$3&#x3D;&#x27;(format &quot;Sum: %s&quot; (calcFunc-vsum @I$3..@III$3));N #+TBLFM: @&gt;$4&#x3D;&#x27;(format &quot;Sum: %i&quot; (apply #&#x27;+ (mapcar #&#x27;string-to-number &#x27;(@I$4..@III$4)))) 
 As you can see, the first method fails in the second column, due to not all data are numbers.
 Now my question(s): How do you deal with calculating some column statistical data and what do you do to identify the results later? Have you maybe written a nice wrapper around those methods to make them easier to write/use them as table formulas?

 According to C-h and this website, one needs to set org-support-shift-select-mode to always. However, adding the following line to my init.el does not have the desired effect:

 It doesn&#x27;t seem like chatgpt is tailored to emacs well enough. But in theory this should be possible to do right?

 I got tired of trying different calendar solutions in the desktop to manage appointments, when I take notes I want to refer to the dates of events, so it makes sense to keep it all in Emacs.
 There&#x27;s a lot of calendar/appointment options for org-mode, but I am not an org user, and was intrigued by the built in diary/calendar pair. After experimenting with them for a bit, and finding out there are built ins for:
 1. converting ics files to dairy-mode entries
 2. displaying notification for upcoming events
 3. communicating with DAV servers 
 I decided to try to build a package to sync events between diary files and a CalDAV server. I never quite figured out #3 but I was already so into the package that it didn&#x27;t matter :)
 There&#x27;s a plan to…</span>

 And this is how it looks like when I &#x60;cat&#x60; from terminal, when I run the script it runs fine so it definitely has to do with the way emacs indents the file.

 Indentation in emacs just looks wrong, is there anything I can do about?

The arguments are the same as those of ‘completing-read’. Input multiple strings by separating each one with a string that matches the regexp ‘crm-separator’. For example, if the separator regexp is &quot;,&quot;, entering &quot;alice,bob,eve&quot; specifies the strings &quot;alice&quot;, &quot;bob&quot;, and &quot;eve&quot;.

                              <span>Org agenda is populated differently for today than for any other day. It fills the &quot;todo&quot; area with all the pending tasks. This is not done for any other day -- not for yesterday or for next month, when it shows only the agenda items that are active for that day or spanning that day. There are obvious performance reasons for this, and it is usually what I want -- except for when I am doing my daily journaling, when it would be massively useful to pull up the agenda AS IF I were on a previous day (usually &quot;yesterday&quot;). I only need this to be done once, for when I am journaling. How can I make a &quot;view as today&quot; command for my orgmode agenda?

                              <span>I use guix along arch, and I installed emacs-pgtk-xwidgets with guix but emacs doesn&#x27;t report the correct time (with org clocks or format-time-string function), $TZ is set to the correct time zone and reading $TZ with getenv in emacs reports the correct time zone and timedatectl shows the correct time zone as well.
 Does anyone know a fix for this.

                              <span>An active chat room helps a project grow and improve faster. The cabal project has been making great use of theirs (#hackage on Libera IRC), but it seemed to me that there was no equivalent for stack users and devs. I did some digging and discovered four stack-related chat rooms:
  
#stack-users and #stack-collaborators on the Haskell Foundation slack (the current maintainer is there)
 #haskell-stack on Libera IRC
 #haskell-stack:matrix.org on Matrix (created in 2018; was bridged to Libera for a while; the past and current maintainers are there)
  
All of these are currently low activity, but the Matrix room in particular has recently been spruced up and I&#x27;d like to invite you there to get and give help. Stack users, stack developers, stackage curators, haskell package maintainers, interested spectators - all are welcome. Hope to see you there!

Ian or &quot;zenhack&quot; may not have been the biggest name in the community, but I remember how obviously brilliant and eager to share with others he was. 
 Anyways, I guess I am just sharing because I hope that others can appreciate the work Ian has done and pick up the torch. Others who were closer have written kind words as well:

Convenience in the Haskell ecosystem by bradrn
My motivation yesterday was wanting to do a spot of data analysis. Nothing complicated: essentially, I just needed to plot some fields from a JSON file.
Episode 34 – Lindsey Kuper by The Haskell Interlude
In this episode Niki Vazou and Wouter Swierstra chat with Lindsey Kuper, Assistant Professor at University of California, Santa Cruz. They discuss what to do when your data center gets hit by a tornado, life in academia versus life in industry, and what is choreographic programming.

Command line interface (CLI) tools have a reputation for being difficult
to use.

Whilst powerful once mastered, a CLI inherently lacks a litany of user
interface “nice-to-haves”, simply by virtue of its medium:
Simplicity: Common tasks should be easy to perform. This is often
not the case, but worse is when tasks can be tweaked in myriad ways,
leading to a combinatorial explosion of flags, options and modifiers.
Memorability: How does one remember all those different options?
It’s not realistic, which is why we so often resort to double-checking
the usage text, man pages, or search engine/generative AI du jour.
Discoverability: Reminding ourselves how to perform what we know
(or assume) can be done isn’t the same as guiding us towards the full

                              <span>I am totally newbie to Haskell.
 I&#x27;ve written a function &quot;custoEnergia&quot; which receives two parameters: &quot;salário&quot; and &quot;energia&quot;. It is defined just like this:.
 custoEnergia salario energia &#x3D; salario/ 5 * energia * 0.85
 The &quot;problem&quot; here is that the result is being truncated up to 2 decimals. I&#x27;d like it not to behave like this and show all numbers after the decimal.

                              <span>Hey folks, I created a toy clone of git using Haskell. I have been on and off learning Haskell for a while but never really did anything practical using it. Most resources (that I encountered) just teach you what monads are and that&#x27;s about it. I had the hang of monads for a while but never really had the confidence to make something practical using Haskell.
 Recently I decided to change that by doing some practical stuff using Haskell. So I present to you Hagit: A git clone written in Haskell. It is fairly limited but if you really try you can actually do version control using it (at least locally). It can also clone a repo.
 I have also extensively documented what I have done. As for how my experience was, I really enjoyed it, baring a few annoyances. The code is probably not idiomatic, as this is more or less my first attempt at making something practical with Haskell. If you have some time at your hand and want to dive into git internals please give it a read (the readme has links to 3 articles that have the details) and if possible please suggest what I could have done better.

                              <span>Packages are also used for distribution: the idea is that a package can be created in one place and be moved to a different computer and be usable in that different environment.
  
But that&#x27;s not true! I can&#x27;t give you a Haskell library package, not even in source form, and have it be usable in your environment!
 Cabal packages can only reference other packages in one of three cases:
  
If the package is available on Hackage.
 If both packages are part of the same directory structure.
 If the referencing package hardcodes the exact path to the referenced package.
  
None of those is suitable for third-party distribution of packages outside of Hackage!
 How is a package usable on another computer if it hard-codes the exact location of every dependency it has?
 C has an include path. Java has an include path. Why does Haskell require a .cabal file to hard code the path to all of its dependencies?!

Passing arguments as header args, and 2.) Treating org files as executables without a harness (or maybe a very lightweight one).

                              <span>Looking for a comfortable way to use emacs for ssh-ing to the servers of our company, but still having issues. Non solution is ideal. I have to use a proxy command to login as a user and after logged in can use sudo to get root.
 My preferred solution in emacs would be eshells cd /ssh: way. With this I also have the default directory synchronized and can easily use C-x C-f to edit files. Tab completion works too, as long I do not sudo -i .
 If I do - completions will break, which is not ideal because I have several scripts in the root path which I need to complete.
 If I leave the eshell way and use mx-shell oder eat-shell etc. I will have tab completion everywhere but the directory is not synched.
 I know I can just type C-x C-f /ssh:user@host|sudo::/file
 But the hostnames we are using are quite long and generic. So this would be a bit of a hazzle.
 Does anyone has a hint for me how I could come around this?
 My last idea would be a small function which gets the hostname from the eat buffer and triggers find-files with the correct path. But maybe there is something better and yes - I would prefer eshell for the whole thing.

                              <span>I have a laptop, work laptop, and monitor all of different resolutions. The two laptops have different default font sizes in my init, and when they&#x27;re plugged into the monitor, I need to manually adjust each frame for the font to be readable. Is there any way to make Emacs automatically adjust the font-size so that it increases until it can fit fill-column within the frame?

 This is mostly to put a stable tag on a bunch of changes that have been in master for a while (and to justify some riskier changes next). But hopefully some will find this list useful anyway.

 But the port is always 25. If I manually run this code from the scratch buffer, it changes fine, and I can send mail correctly. Happens when using both mail and compose-mail.
 Anyone knows what might cause this?

                              <span>Since installing Firefox on Debian via flatpak, so that I can keep up with the latest version instead of the apt realease, Emacs is erroring whenever I try to open org links for example, with &#x27;Searching for program: No such file or directory, firefox&#x27;.
 Thanks to a helpful answer on StackExchange I&#x27;ve got both my shell and eshell aliases set up so that I can simply run firefox at the prompt, as an alias for flatpak run org.mozilla.firefox
 I guess the answer to my question probably likes somewhere in modifying the variables browse-url-firefox-program , or browse-url-generic-programme ?

 How much support for older versions of Emacs should I provide? Is it unreasonable to require version 27 or newer of Emacs for this simple mode?

                              <span>Hej fellows,
 through work, I have discovered TimeTimers some years ago. I have found it easy to work with, which is why I&#x27;ve bought one for myself. However, I&#x27;ve been meaning to have something like this in emacs, because I&#x27;ve noticed that no matter the package (be it built-in or tmr), I am missing the convenience that a TimeTimer provides.
 First off, I&#x27;d like to know if any of you know a package that does this or something like this: conveniently display (in the modeline, maybe?) a bar or clock that shows the passage of time in a continuous fashion, i.e. showing a graphic representation (like a bar going from full to empty or a pie chart going from full to empty) instead of changing numbers (the customary form of representing a timer in my experience).
 If that&#x27;s not a thing -- and I&#x27;d be flabbergasted about that to be frank --, I&#x27;d love to get some tips on how to implement this. If I were to choose, I&#x27;d preferably have a timetimer implemented as a decreasing progress bar in the mode line. The width would be depending upon the &quot;available space&quot; (dunno if there is a way to find that out for different configurations of modelines), the progress bar would be recalculated in regular intervals and the (pseudo-)continuous steps would be calculated depending on the time input when setting the timer. Maybe, the progress bar could &quot;blink&quot; (i.e. disappear and reappear) an amount of times to be set by a variable. For graphical representation, I am eyeing the SVG-LIB by Nicolas Rougier.
 I am grateful for tips and pointers, I am a bit at a loss as to where to start.
 Have a good day!

 Are there any tools to manage this? Like an auto formatter or something?

                              <span>Hi everyone! Last week I released version 0.4 of ekg, which is an extensible tag-based, sqlite-backed note taking application for emacs.
 This version has been in the works for months, and has notable improvements:
 Drafts! You can now save (with C-x C-s) long notes and they will be tagged with &quot;draft&quot; and not show in other places until you commit the note.
 Magic tags! You can now have tags that automatically execute some elisp, useful for special notes that need some different editing. The standard example is setting your input method for notes with a tag indicating it&#x27;s in a different language.
 LLM integration! Now you can have LLMs response to your notes inline, with prompts configured based on your tags. We use the new GNU ELPA llm package, so we support whatever it supports (right now Open AI and Google Cloud Vertex&#x27;s APIs)
 File notes! Just like you can have notes on URLS, can you now have notes on files! It&#x27;s basically a way to annotate any file. And because of how our prompt, template, and prefixing rules work, the directory structure can control the templates and prompts for any LLM integration you have.
 Also, here&#x27;s a video demonstrating these features!
 Thanks to everyone who contributed to this release, notably Jay Rajput, Umar Ahmad and Qingshui Zheng!

                              <span>Greetings All,
Is anyone else experiencing Marked 2&#x27;s Streaming preview feature crashing with use of the Archive? I&#x27;ve recently updated to the new OS and this is the only change I can think of that could be the cause of the error. Marked 2 still works if I go to zettle and open manually.
Anyone else having this issue?</span>

I&#x27;ve been trying to think of ways to connect experienced Haskellers with Haskellers-to-be in a lightweight, fun way. It&#x27;s more an idea-of-an-idea right now, but I wanted to share early to get feedback before making it more concrete.
 Haskell Camp will be a time-bound, online event where people who wish to learn Haskell (&quot;Learners&quot;) get connected with people who wish to help people learn Haskell (&quot;Helpers&quot;).
  
You can sign up either as a Helper or a Learner.
 Learners will be grouped and paired with a Helper.
 Each Helper will have a guided exercise meant to get a beginner&#x27;s feet wet in Haskell. 
 Think of it like a &quot;craft&quot; you&#x27;d do at camp as a kid. They have guided structure around the technical parts, but still allow for the pers…</span>

                              <span>So the problem is to find the length of the longest run of spaces in a string. Just out of curiousity, I wanted to know if there is a way to use optics to solve it. Now, I know that I could write a function like this: runs :: (a -&gt; Bool) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [[a]] that finds all the runs of elements, based on a predicate and make a traversal out of it, but if I already had a function like this, there would be no point in doing that. So, my question is: is there a way to use just optics to succinctly solve this problem?

                              <span>Let the following be functors
 newtype F x &#x3D; F x instance Functor F where fmap f (F x) &#x3D; F $ f x newtype G x &#x3D; G x instance Functor G where fmap f (G x) &#x3D; G $ f x 
 Then the following is a Natural transformation
 eta :: F a -&gt; G a eta (F a) &#x3D; G a 
 Which can be seen (though not proved, as it would require singletons) by providing the definition for the legs of the natural transformation.
 etaLeg1 :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; F a -&gt; G b etaLeg1 f &#x3D; eta . fmap f etaLeg2 :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; F a -&gt; G b etaLeg2 f &#x3D; fmap f . eta 
 Now, let the following be functors (The following does not type check. Or I don&#x27;t know how to make it type check.)
 newtype Monoid x &#x3D;&gt; F&#x27; x &#x3D; F&#x27; x instance Functor F&#x27; where fmap f (F&#x27; x) &#x3D; F&#x27; $ f x newtype Monoid x &#x3D;&gt; G&#x27; x &#x3D; G&#x27; x instance Functor G&#x27; where fmap f (G&#x27; x) &#x3D; G&#x27; $ f x 
 In both instances, f is a monoid homomorphism. The above can be seen to make sense by defining the following, which are basically restricted fmap&#x27;s:
 fmapF&#x27; :: (Monoid a, Monoid b) &#x3D;&gt; (a -&gt; b) -&gt; F&#x27; a -&gt; F&#x27; b fmapF&#x27; f (F&#x27; x) &#x3D; F&#x27; $ f x fmapG&#x27; :: (Monoid a, Monoid b) &#x3D;&gt; (a -&gt; b) -&gt; G&#x27; a -&gt; G&#x27; b fmapG&#x27; f (G&#x27; x) &#x3D; G&#x27; $ f x 
 Would, then, the following be a &quot;Restricted&quot; Natural Transformation?
 phi :: Monoid a &#x3D;&gt; F&#x27; a -&gt; G&#x27; a phi (F&#x27; a) &#x3D; G&#x27; a phiLeg1 :: (Monoid a, Monoid b) &#x3D;&gt; (a -&gt; b) -&gt; F&#x27; a -&gt; G&#x27; b phiLeg1 f &#x3D; phi . fmapF&#x27; f phiLeg2 :: (Monoid a, Monoid b) &#x3D;&gt; (a -&gt; b) -&gt; F&#x27; a -&gt; G&#x27; b phiLeg2 f &#x3D; fmapG&#x27; f . phi 
 It seems to be obvious that phi is a natural transformation, but I can&#x27;t shake the feeling that something could be wrong.

                              <span>A variation of this question have been asked before, unfortunately, I am not bright enough to understand them. So I am asking this question to hopefully get a more concrete answer from a particularly generous haskeller.
 When I researched the type of IO in haskell, I get this from ghci info:
 (GHC.Prim.State# GHC.Prim.RealWorld -&gt; (# GHC.Prim.State# GHC.Prim.RealWorld, a #))
 I am not quite sure what any of this means, but from what I gather, this abstracts to something like this: IO _ :&#x3D; (RealWorld -&gt; (RealWorld, _ )). This looks like the state monad, which has type: [W, W × _ ], for a choice of state handling type W. The StateT monad I see in documentation is a little different since it has monad composition StateT (s -&gt; m (a, s)), so I guess I should say that we require the monad m to be the idenitity monad. 
 My question is, why do we need to use these primitive types? Somehow, this makes it possible for IO functions to interact with the outside environment, like call other programs or writing to the file system. But how does that happen exactly? 
 Second, what is this RealWorld? Is it a bitestring? An integer? A constant? When updating the state, what actually happens? 
 Lastly, the ST monad, which has definition: ST s a. This type allows us to perform mutations to inside variables but it does not allow effects. From what I gather, this does in fact mutate memory. It also has a function to &quot;escape&quot; the ST wrapper, called runST. Obviously, this makes practical sense, but what is stopping up from simply writing a function runIO that escapes the IO. That would most certainly be a bug, but what is preventing us from doing it?

 I heard the Haskell online community was supportive so I decided to look for some help.
 For context: I have never touched Haskell or Prolong
 I just started a Haskell class last week and this is insanely difficult (for me). I don&#x27;t understand the Syntax of this language. Worst part is my exam is all code and i have 9 weeks to prepare :(
 Any good resources?

 As the VSCode Haskel extention now requires HLS 2.3.0.0, I updated it together with cabal and stack (both upgraded to the recommended version). Ever since though, the extention is not working. 
 I’ve nuked ghcup and reinstalled the extension to try to solve the issue, but it did not work.

 Any suggestions on what to do?

It seems like it &quot;solves&quot; many issues or annoying things from Haskell. I wanted to know the opinion of Idris in comparison with Haskell. Is there something Haskell can do better from a type-system perspective? If Idris had the same community size as Haskell and the same maturity, would you choose Idris instead?

 VSCode doesn&#x27;t recognize implicit returns so you have to unindent manually when you move to the beginning of the next line if youre starting a new function and indent manually when you start a function. Scalafmt doesn&#x27;t recognize bad indentation either.
 Intellij Idea object MyProgram: def abs(n: Int): Int &#x3D; if n &lt; 0 then -n else n private def formatAbs(x: Int) &#x3D; &lt;-- val msg &#x3D; &quot;The absolute value of %d is %d&quot; &lt;-- Metals doesn&#x27;t indent msg.format(x, abs(x)) &lt;--Metals doesn&#x27;t indent @ main def hello: Unit &#x3D; println(formatAbs(-42)) 
 I tried Idea and their support is even worse it wouldn&#x27;t even let me unindent the private which defaulted to the indentation level of the &#x60;else&#x60; statement in the abs function. 
 How can I get VSCode to behave correctly? I don&#x27;t really want to manually adjust indentation on every line every time that just seems tedious.
 Edit: from my research I can just use curly braces after the &#x3D; in definitions and this will enforce the indentation rules. https://docs.scala-lang.org/scala3/reference/other-new-features/indentation.html
 Is this safe/reasonable to do? I imagine it’s not idiomatic, but having to do this manually will drive me nuts. 
 I want to learn FP but this is really I convenient if this isn’t viable I’ll probably just opt to learn Ocaml instead.

 tree-sitter doesn&#x27;t recognize FOOPTY_API since it&#x27;s a dllexport, and I think it&#x27;s probably a windows-only construct. How would I go about making sure it parses that part properly?
 Also, the GENERATED_BODY() specifier is an Unreal-ism, and I don&#x27;t think it causes any trouble, but it would be nice if I could add it (and other Unreal specific identifiers) to a list for specific highlighting and/or indentation instructions. 
 Where&#x27;s a good place to start with these sort of small-scale tweaks? I&#x27;ve seen some links to posts with titles like, &quot;Let&#x27;s write a major mode&quot; but I&#x27;m really just trying to tweak the existing C++ mode to handle a couple weirdo special cases. (Though I think maybe the dllexport thing MIGHT be big enough that it should be included, so maybe I should file a bug?)

                              <span>Lots of people use python interactively through M-x run-python and send code to it with things like C-c C-c and C-c C-r. That&#x27;s fair enough, but it has it&#x27;s problems. When an imported library changes the only sensible way to deal with it is to stop the python process and start another one. (That&#x27;s because in Python the built in &quot;import&quot; statement doesn&#x27;t reload the file. You could reload each library with reload, but that would be tricky.)
 For that reason, I would like to use M-x compile. It&#x27;s suitable for that kind of thing and I&#x27;ve used it for running programs written in other languages. (I think this is a fairly well known Emacs trick).
 The problem is Venvs. My projects use venv. If I just start a fresh python using M-x compile then it won&#x27;t be in the right venv. I&#x27;ve thought about writing a batch file to solve this problem. I expect though, someone has already written a package to solve this?
 Is there such a package?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been trying for the past three days to get elfeed to display desktop notifications. It was suggested that elfeed-new-entry-hook can be used and it works, but parsing it is a painful trial and error.
 I&#x27;ve added https://lorem-rss.herokuapp.com/feed?unit&#x3D;second&amp;interval&#x3D;10 feed to be able to test it.
 This works for example:
 (add-hook &#x27;elfeed-new-entry-hook (lambda (entry) (alert (elfeed-deref (elfeed-entry-content entry)) :title (concat (elfeed-deref (elfeed-entry-title entry)) &quot; -_ &quot; (elfeed-deref (elfeed-entry-title entry)) ) :severity &#x27;high ))) 
 But changing elfeed-entry-title (on the 5th line) to elfeed-entry-tags or &#x60;elfeed-entry-feed makes it fail (no notifications appear anymore).
 Does anyone have any idea why?
 UPDATE: Solved it (defun created for debugging):
 (defun elfeed-desktop-notifications (entry) &quot;Parse and display new feeds as desktop notifications.&quot; (alert (elfeed-deref (elfeed-entry-content entry)) :title (concat (elfeed-feed-title (elfeed-deref (elfeed-entry-feed entry))) &quot;\n&quot; (elfeed-deref (elfeed-entry-title entry)) ) :severity &#x27;high )) (add-hook &#x27;elfeed-new-entry-hook #&#x27;elfeed-desktop-notifications)

                              <span>Hello guys,I sometimes use the windows version of emacs at work, and one neat feature of windows is Super (windows key) + V, which is like the traditional copy/paste except that it lets you browse your clipboard history before pasting.
 The menu does pop up but selecting an entry does nothing.
 I use it quite often for other programs, but emacs ignores it (vanilla emacs 29.1, launched without init.el (-Q option).
 Have you succeeded in making it work ? In general, I am curious as to how the sync between clipboard and kill-ring is done.

                              <span>Hello all. I&#x27;ve recently made another video about my 3D game engine project Game :: Dangerous (written in Haskell), which can be found as follows.
 Project repos: https://github.com/Mushy-pea
 Video: https://youtu.be/wOSQ1cYoZXM?si&#x3D;bF2UtM_zr8OYOPHi
 I&#x27;m interested in what people think about some of the design choices I&#x27;ve made. One of the most interesting things to me about software development is how design and implementation interact. So briefly, the engine is not a development framework such as Unity or Unreal (nor anywhere near that complex) but more similar to GZDoom for example. It&#x27;s a program that loads a text file, within which is encoded environment geometry, game logic scripting and references to asset files. The game logic scripting is implemented through a virtual machine in the engine that runs a bytecode form of the engine&#x27;s custom scripting language.
 I spent a long time deciding how to implement a map editor, when I probably should have decided early on and developed it in parallel. What I eventually decided to do (in June 2022) was to write a local web server that loaded the same map files as the engine, allowed their state to be queried and modified through API requests from a client and could save that state back to the same text file format. That server now makes up about 20% of the Haskell code in the main repo and shares some static libraries with the engine. I&#x27;ve also started writing the web client that provides a UI for the map editor, a prototype of which is shown in the video.
 Anyway, thanks for reading and looking forward to feedback if anyone feels like it.

                              <span>I want to make my code look consistent and neat. I don’t have any personal stylistic preferences at the moment – I want to pick a widely accepted style and stick with it. I’m used to tools like Rust’s rustfmt, which have a well-defined style with good defaults.
 What formatters does Haskell have that are similar to them? ormolu and fourmolu look like good options with sensible defaults.

 However I was curious if you guys have some more experience with libraries that are more suited for game development? Not necessarily engines (tho with would be nice if Haskell has them), but something that can handle more complex cases.

                              <span>This is a general question, though it comes up because I&#x27;ve started using Emacs 29 and tree-sitter.
 There are 4 presets listed for tree-sitter, with a few more for the standard C(++) modes:
  
Gnu
 BSD
 Linux
 K&amp;R
  
Where in any of the emacs documentation are these indentation styles explained? I eventually found them on wikipedia, but that&#x27;s frankly a terrible cop-out on the documentation side. The manual helpfully gives shrug-emoji style descriptions like this, for the BSD style: &quot;Also known as “Allman style” after Eric Allman.&quot; 
 Moreover, I&#x27;d like to know what exactly emacs (or tree-sitter) thinks these styles mean. Just because there&#x27;s a definition on wikipedia doesn&#x27;t mean that&#x27;s what&#x27;s being adhered to.
 But even better is if I could just use the clang-format style in real time, rather than waiting for it to clean up after me. Is there anything that already does that?

 Feedback welcome.
 Looking for a few brave souls to give it a try. Love to find bugs and functional improvements that my dogfooding hasn&#x27;t uncovered.
 Thanks!

                              <span>Does anyone else have the same problem?
 If I run sage-shell:run-sage to get a SageMath shell in Emacs, and run help(), I get the standard help message, which starts with &quot;Welcome to Sage 10.1!&quot;.
 But if I try help(diff) or any other specific function, Emacs hangs. Doing C-g allows me to use Emacs again, but the SageMath session is no longer responsive: trying to enter any other command results in hanging. Even C-c C-d no longer works, I have to try C-c C-\ and wait for the SageMath kernel to crash, or do M-x kill-process.
 This all seemed to work before I upgraded Emacs and changed my package manager to straight.el.
 I&#x27;m on Emacs 29.1, using sage-shell-mode v0.3.
 I&#x27;ve covnfigured it as follows:
 (use-package sage-shell-mode :straight t :defer t :custom (sage-shell:sage-executable (executable-find &quot;sage&quot;)) (sage-shell:set-ipython-version-on-startup nil) (sage-shell:check-ipython-version-on-startup nil) (sage-shell:use-prompt-toolkit nil) (sage-shell:use-simple-prompt nil) ) 
 (However, I find that the custom settings aren&#x27;t being respected either ...)
 I also use ob-sagemath, which allows me to use SageMath in org-src-blocks, which works fine as far as I can tell.

                              <span>I am using EWW to read articles and I want to capture notes into an exisiting file not part of capture templates. The overall workflow is as follows. Lets say I want to catch up on the GPT agents of generative AI and prompt engineering. I google the topic in EWW and just read with a org file open on the side buffer. I want to take notes and capture quotes into a that org file. when I select text from EWW, and intiate capture I want to insert text into the org file on the side where the point (cursor) is or even at the end of the file. How can I configure org-capture for this?
 EDIT:
 Think of it like this. I want to have a org file each reading session and I have have multiple reading sessions in parallel (session don&#x27;t mean single chunk of time). How can i configure org-capture so that I can create a new org file for each reading session. or org-capture is not the right tool for this? Some other workflow?

                              <span>Hello Emacs users, I&#x27;m currently trying to re-do my own emacs configuration but after facing thousands of issues, indenting buffers is the one thing that&#x27;s going to turn me bald in a matter of hours.
 I&#x27;m trying to work with multiple languages, Go, Rust, Python, JS/TS, etc. The one thing I haven&#x27;t figured out correctly is proper indentation without having to do keyboard gymnastics. I know that Emacs is more of a DIY thing, so any light shed here would be of great help. 
 I&#x27;ve already tried (add-hook …), using the :config section in my (use-package go-mode) declarations and more but none of them are having any visible effect. 
 Furthermore, I saw this issue with Go and I heavily suspect other programming languages won&#x27;t come out as clean as I think. 
 Every time I edit a Go file, when adding a new line to anything that needs indentation (e.g: a function body, if, for, etc.) Two “4 spaces” tabs are inserted no matter what. Even when I press the  key I have to backspace ALWAYS, also some closing delimiters like }) don&#x27;t align properly, but I suspect that&#x27;s another issue maybe fixed by puni.
 ​
 The “best” thing I could do to prevent newlines from getting messed up on creation was turning off electric-indent, I&#x27;ve heard mixed opinions on that, some say it&#x27;s great, some say it&#x27;s terrible, I don&#x27;t really know. Without electric-indent I don&#x27;t have to backspace two tabs on a newline, but TAB still creates those two tabs, even when my modeline reports (TABx4). Here is a snippet of the important stuff in my configuration file. 
 (setq-default c-basic-offset 4 tab-width 4 indent-tabs-mode t standard-indent 4) ;; jsjsjsjs (electric-pair-mode 1) ;; Disable electric-indent messing up my code &gt;:( (setq electric-indent-inhibit t electric-indent-mode nil) 
 If any of you could spare your elisp-fu powers to me, I would be extremely thankful. Thanks for your time in advance. :)

                              <span>Hi!
 I just stumbled upon a difference between the Scala 2 and Scala 3 compilers that originated in at least one bug in the form of NullPointerExceptions, that we didn&#x27;t have to worry about before.
 It&#x27;s super simple to reproduce, given a REPL:Scala 3.3.1
 scala&gt; val test: String &#x3D; test val test: String &#x3D; null 
 Scala 2.13.11
 scala&gt; val test: String &#x3D; test ^ warning: value test does nothing other than call itself recursively val test: String &#x3D; null 
 That warning is the difference between knowing that you are doing something weird or not. Although I&#x27;m not sure why this is even a warning and not an error, when would you ever want to initialize a variable by assigning to itself?Is this something that should be fixed in the Scala 3 compiler? 
 EDIT: this is already a known issue https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/issues/14429

                              <span>Dotty-cps-async 0.9.19 ( https://github.com/rssh/dotty-cps-async ) is on Maven Central.
 New in this release:
  
Optional loom support for JDK-21. With the help of Loom, we can transform arguments of high-order functions without requiring a shifted variant of this function to be available.
  
​
 def topScored[A](c:Iterable[A], n: Int)(score: A&#x3D;&gt;Double) &#x3D; c.map(a&#x3D;&gt;(a,score(a)).sortBy(- _._2).take(n) ... val top100 &#x3D; topScore(c,100)(a &#x3D;&gt; await(fetchScore(a.id)) 
 Note that this also works for effect monads.
  
Direct context encoding: it&#x27;s still under experimental annotation but much closer to full functionality. Now we can call a direct-encoded function over G[_] in the context of F[_] if the inclusion of G in F. This can be a foundation for the natural encoding of monadic effect stacks:
 type IOResource &#x3D; [X]&#x3D;&gt;&gt;Resource[IO,X]
 def open(name: Path, options: OpenOption*)(using CpsDirect[IOResource]): AsynchronousFileChannel &#x3D;
 .....
 def read(input: AsynchronousFileChannel, bufSize: Int)(using CpsDirect[IO]): ByteBuffer &#x3D;
 ....
 //Then later inside asyncScope[IO]:
 val channel &#x3D; open(name, READ)
 val data &#x3D; read(input, BUF_SIZE) 
 ....
 
A few bug fixes.

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I just published a new scala blog, especially for total beginners to the language. I explained about the usage of Scala-CLI, Scala Toolkit and Scastie to make the Scala learning easier for beginners. 
 With this, I am hoping that some of you who are starting out with the Scala journey might find it useful.

                              <span>As far as I understand function with class constraints are transformed into a function with an extra parameter being the typeclass dictionary. This allows the function to not have to be specialized and only decide at runtime what to do exactly (sorry for the bad explanation). In short Show a &#x3D;&gt; a -&gt; String is transform internally to Dict a -&gt; a -&gt; String.
 I have a discussion on discourse where people consider this extra parameter as part of the function: Show a -&gt; a -&gt; String has TWO parameters.
 My intuition is that this extra parameter is only the result of an implementtaion choice. An hypotetical compiler could work back from the main an instantiate all functions with required types. Therefore passing a class dictionaly might be needed for practical reason but not in theory.
 Am I right or is dictionary passin the only way to implement typeclass in Haskell ?

                              <span>Hi, Gnu Emacs noob here. I&#x27;m having trouble debugging AUCTeX. When I run TeX-command-run-all with C-c C-a Biber is not run for some reason I can&#x27;t figure out, and I must run it manually with C-c C-c Biber RET to have my citations properly compiled. 
 Does anyone know how I can forse C-c C-a to run Biber as well as the other commands? 
 My config is pretty vanilla and for AUCTeX is as follows: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; ;; Auctex (require &#x27;package) (unless (package-installed-p &#x27;auctex) (package-install &#x27;auctex))
 (require &#x27;tex)
 (push (list &#x27;output-pdf &quot;Skim&quot;) TeX-view-program-selection) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 I&#x27;m running Emacs 29.1 downloaded from MacPorts on a MacBook Air m1.
 thanks!
