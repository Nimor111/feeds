                              <span>Hi, this is something I have been struggling with for a while. Every now and then I accidentally rebind a key that I didn&#x27;t want to rebind. I could not figure out how to &quot;undo&quot; that. In some cases, if it is a simple command and I know which command it was before, I guess I can rebind it (although sometimes this is hard if it only applies to particular modes).
 But it just so happens that I now accidentally rebound C-h and I have no clue on how to fix that (other than completely restarting emacs, which does not seem like a very elegant and satisfying solution).
 Is there a way to &quot;restore&quot; a keybinding to its default state? Or (next best option) a way to &quot;save&quot; my keybindings, so I can restore from a restore-point?
 For now, I guess I will have to restart emacs (again....) which is always a bummer if you have 100 open buffers and a bunch of tabs with stuff you are working on.

                              <span>Hello everyone ! 
 This is my first time posting here to get some help from you ! :)
 As the title say, i&#x27;m a main vim user for the past year. But, for any reason, I wanted to try emacs (with evil mode of course aha). 
 I&#x27;m still a bit confused with some keybinding, not because of evil mode or emacs, but because i&#x27;m on a Mac. 
 So, the fact is that I mainly program in C. I see that there is something called lsp-mode here :
 https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/tutorials/CPP-guide/
 The installation process is really smooth and i&#x27;m now using a super duper cool looking IDE ! But here&#x27;s lay my problem :
 On the website, there is a lot of keybinding like this :
 s-l r r
 But even with this on my fresh init.el file :
 (setq mac-command-modifier &#x27;super)
 I cannot do &quot;super key&quot; command. Do you have any advice to help me ? :)
 (also, I you have any tips with evil mode, or with emacs itself, please don&#x27;t hesitate and tell them to me!)

                              <span>Novice emacs user here. I&#x27;m slowly starting to use org mode for TODOs, capturing fleeting ideas/ thoughts and structuring my notes.
 One thing that I&#x27;m struggling with is using the agenda functionality. I really like the idea of using it to get an overview of my events/ scheduled items, and I do schedule things, but I keep forgetting to actually look at the agenda view. I know that this is 90% a me problem, but I was wondering what the best solutions for this is, either packages or some custom elisp (although I don&#x27;t really know how write elisp yet).
 I would like the agenda to be a little bit &quot;in my face&quot;, in terms of making me remember to look at it, and it would also be nice to have some sort of reminder, notification or alert when there are events/ scheduled items in the next X days.
 If you have any suggestions, ideas for how to build a better workflow or just pointers to some resources, I would be very grateful.

                              <span>Hi all!
 This release has been in development for a while. Some eye candy there, but mostly it&#x27;s updated for the behavior basics and the backend protocol (e.g. full parity with completion-at-point-functions and adding some extras on top while staying mostly backward compatible with the original company-mode backends).
 Completion in the middle of a symbol, general &quot;expand common&quot; behavior, more consistent and powerful &quot;backend grouping&quot;, better rendering for the completions popup and support for completion-styles in more built-in backends.
 See detailed changes here: https://github.com/company-mode/company-mode/blob/master/NEWS.md#2024-09-21-100

                              <span>Not a Haskell-specific question, but I was wondering if anyone can point me at any resources to read about the background on subtyping and type variance. I&#x27;m vaguely familiar with the notion of (co|contra|in|bi)variant relation. The examples I&#x27;ve seen, however, felt very specific and naive. That gives me a rough idea, but am interested in knowing more on the theory (I must add, &quot;if I can&quot;, as the the literature on types and category theory often terrifies me).

                              <span>Bascially the title.
 I don&#x27;t have evil-collection to keep things minimized.
 But what I&#x27;ve been noticing is that when I run the following, there is a side-effect of dired-sidebar closing.
 M-x dired-sidebar-toggle-sidebar ;; dired-sidebar opens in the left of my window M-x evil-window-right ;; focus the buffer on the right side of dired-sidebar M-x evil-window-split ;; split horizontally so two buffers top and bottom M-x evil-quit (or M-x evil-window-delete) ;; delete the buffer I&#x27;m working on 
 I notice that both the buffer where the evil-quit/evil-window-delete was ran in, and the dired-sidebar buffer closing. Has anyone run into this issue?

                              <span>Is it possible to make eglot handle completions within an inferior-ess-r-mode? Most of my work I do in orgmode and I wanted to start eglot when opening org-babel-switch-to-session-with-code, which in my understanding opens an inferior-ess-r-mode. Now, this inferior mode is not associated with a file on disk, which makes it impossible to run the eglot lsp backend? 
 Is there a way to circumvent this?
 My eglot config starts with:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; (use-package eglot ;; no :ensure t here because it&#x27;s built-in :defer t ;; Configure hooks to automatically turn-on eglot for selected modes
 :hook ((org-mode . eglot) (ess-r-mode . eglot) (ess-mode . eglot)) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

                              <span>Hey there!
 I wrote an Emacs package for note taking (Zettelkasten). It is similar to u/protesilaos &#x27;s wonderful Denote, but a whole lot simpler.
 I found out about his package when I&#x27;d finished writing mine and, even though it&#x27;s simpler, I thought someone might find it useful. At least, I use it intensely :D
 You can take a look at https://github.com/villarragut/org-zk
 Also, here&#x27;s a screenshot:

 I developed a super-hint.el for emacs: https://github.com/eval-exec/super-hint.el
 I add a descriptino video in the github repo&#x27;s READMD.md.
 It can show which-function as hint for rg&#x27;s result buffer, or xref&#x27;s result buffer, like this:
 The bottom left provides a hint from super-hint, guiding you to understand the context of the line
 If you find super-hint.el helpful, please give it a star.
 Do you have any ideas or suggestions to improve super-hint.el?
 Thank you. 💙

                              <span>Hey all , recently I started as a Junior Scala developer using Scala and play , and wanted to know about everyone&#x27;s thoughts on Scala , particularly relating to the job market in the UK. 
 Is it worth going deep into and how fun is it ? 
 Any resources would also be greatly appreciated.
 P.S this is my first coding role

 Explore the compile-time arsenal that Scala 3 gives us without resorting to dirty tricks. (You may know them as macros ;)).
 I shouldn&#x27;t have to know what kind of syntax tree a constructor call desugars into, I just want to transform between two extremely similar data types because the Internet told me I should separate my domain models into layers before I shove them between curly brackets on a socket somewhere.
 Are these the kind of thoughts you entertain on a daily basis?
 See, you actually CAN have the latter without the former in Scala 3 with no loss to your compile-time comfort zone, so kiss your ASTs goodbye - we won&#x27;t be seeing them again. 
 With that in mind, you can strap in for a gauntlet style run through match types, mirrors, typeclass derivation and the new, exciting and experimental named tuples to build a micro-library that does one-liner conversions between similarly shaped data types with some live demos where we desperately try to make the compiler really mad at us sprinkled in.

                              <span>A while ago - perhaps a months ago - in this subreddit I came across a post mentioning a build tool(?) like Bazel that it can build different languages, the build syntax is like yaml, and it also integrates function for building docker IIRC. 
 I am sure it&#x27;s not mill, sbt. However, I tried searching again here with the keywords like build tool, docker, yaml, and so on but I no longer am able to find it now. Scrolling through the post does find related posts either.
 Anyone has read something like that? Many thanks.

                              <span>Hi all. I recently released Orgro 1.40.4 with probably the most-requested features since it launched ~4.5 years ago:
  
Full-text editing support: enter a separate editor view to freely edit the plain markup. Works on narrowed sections as well. [demo]
 id: link resolution across files. This has been most requested by Org-roam users. Requires directory permissions per the FAQ. [demo]
  
I&#x27;ve added lots of other improvements as well; see the changelog for details.
 Full-text editing is all well and good, but I&#x27;m still thinking about other kinds of &quot;structured&quot; editing operations and how they can be exposed comfortably in a mobile UI (especially one that tries to mimic the &quot;native&quot; appearance of an Org Mode doc in Emacs). If you have ideas, suggestions, or other feedback, please feel free to open an issue or start a discussion.

 Is it just me or &quot;#&quot; breaks the search in Consult? Both in grep and find file functions, I consistently can&#x27;t get any results. 
 Every time I open consult-find or consult-ripgrep, I have to delete the # character first;

 My consult config:
 (use-package consult :config (setq consult-ripgrep-command &quot;rg --null --line-buffered --color&#x3D;ansi --max-columns&#x3D;500 --no-heading --line-number . -e ARG OPTS&quot;) (setq xref-show-xrefs-function #&#x27;consult-xref xref-show-definitions-function #&#x27;consult-xref)) 
 Any ideas what am I doing wrong?

                              <span>If you always have to copy/paste lines and replace &quot;r&quot; with &quot;g&quot; and then &quot;b&quot;, or &quot;x&quot; then &quot;y&quot; then &quot;z&quot;, try my new dup-transform package. I just created it to save myself time while writing graphics code; maybe you&#x27;ll like it too. It&#x27;s not on MELPA or anything yet. It&#x27;s also the first public package I&#x27;ve ever created, despite being an Emacs user since around 1982. Comments/questions/PRs gratefully accepted of course!

                              <span>I have been trying to become more familiar with Magit as other options are less appealing currently. 
 I have a project that has a number of nested submodules. I didn&#x27;t structure it this way, it&#x27;s something provided to me. In any event I think I have all the submodules fetched, however I&#x27;m getting a strange reaction from magit on this last one I know about.
 In this directory, at the command line if I issue git status it comes back with information about the version controlled module. It&#x27;s in a detached HEAD state, but that&#x27;s alright for the moment. Basically it reports just fine.
 If I am in magit, and I start at the top, and then open submodules on the way down, when I get to this submodule it says &quot;Corrupt Git configuration&quot;. I find this puzzling since Git status seems to work.
 Any ideas on what is going on here? It&#x27;s an awfully short error message that doesn&#x27;t really let me know what the corruption is about (and there&#x27;s nothing further in Messages to explain further.)

                              <span>Hello, i have Doom Emacs installed on my Mac and i&#x27;d like to emulate the behavior of the red dot button on the top left of the tabs that kills the frame with a keystroke.
 It precisely means that the command has to: 
 &quot;Close the frame without ask for confirmation unless it is the last frame opened and there are unsaved buffers&quot;
 That&#x27;s the statement that describes the command. 
 Can someone help me? I&#x27;m new in Emacs. 
 Thank you in advance :)

 I&#x27;m a student using i3wm on Arch Linux, and I’m struggling to decide between Neovim and Emacs as my main text editor. I really don’t have much time to keep switching between editors, so I’m looking for something I can stick with long-term.
 Here’s some context:
  
I type at around 150 WPM, so I want something fast and efficient.
 I’ve been using both Neovim and Emacs for about two months, and I’m comfortable with the keybindings of both.
 I like Neovim because it feels simpler and more straightforward, which is great since I’m learning a lot of new things (programming, using i3wm, etc.).
 However, Emacs is appealing because it seems to be this all-in-one tool where you can do everything from text editing to managing your entire workflow. Plus, I have to admit, using Emacs makes me feel a bit superior, like it’s a “power user” tool, which makes my decision even harder.
  
One important thing: I also want to focus on building actual projects rather than spending too much time customizing my editor. Neovim feels more minimal, which might help me stay focused, but at the same time, I wonder if I’d be missing out on something Emacs offers, like Org mode for note-taking, which I’ve heard is amazing.
 Ultimately, I want to commit to one text editor for life. I don’t want to spend months switching between them or tweaking configurations. My goal is to focus on programming, taking notes, and building real projects—without getting too distracted by endlessly customizing my editor.
 So, should I stick with Neovim and its simplicity, or is it worth diving into Emacs for its extra features and potential? I’d really appreciate your advice, especially from anyone who’s been in a similar position.
 Thanks in advance for your help!

 I am a current university student and asked to set up environment for programming course, steps are shown below (Picture 1 ), it was said that there was a problem with HLS in the process. After doing all the stuff I found that visual studio code keep telling me to install ghcup, so I used the order &quot;Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force;[System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol &#x3D; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; try { &amp; ([ScriptBlock]::Create((Invoke-WebRequest https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/sh/bootstrap-haskell.ps1 -UseBasicParsing))) -Interactive -DisableCurl } catch { Write-Error $_ }&quot; in powershell to install ghcup, and then it says that ghcup was failed to install (Picture2).

 I&#x27;ve also tried to install ghcup using the terminal, but things did also go wrong

I really need some help, being a programming newbie, to find an easy to use bulk editor for Markdown files.
For instance my current task is to find this part of the .md file
Cross references
123, 567, 1240, 221
and convert it to Wikilinks ie:
Cross references
[[123]] [[567]] [[1240]] [[221]]
I have tried Visual Studio with soe help from Copilot AI and can identify the Heading , blank line and numbers but cannot get it to make the changes that I want.</span>

                              <span>Hello! I&#x27;d like to share my library for reading and writing Parquet files—ZIO Apache Parquet—which perfectly fits the ZIO ecosystem. It is built around ZIO Schema&#x27;s codec derivation mechanism. As a nice bonus, the filter predicates are type-safe.

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m a beginner fper and I&#x27;ve chosen scala because of jvm ecosystem. My background is python, JavaScript web stacks and a little bit of java in android development. I started learning scala a few months back using the following resources: Alvin Alexander&#x27;s fp simplified 2e ( Waiting eagerly for it to be completed :( ), Functional programming in scala 2e, Scala with cats, Essential effects. While those were great books, I still don&#x27;t feel confident about writing entire projects in fp scala. My end goal is to shift my algo trading system to scala, (from python) to take advantage of parallelism and spark. Are there any resources (books preferably) which teach, in a practical way, to write a server or a web api or any large project in a functional way? For beginner fper. Most of the videos on YT assume a high working knowledge of fp in scala already. I can write things in oop way in scala (tranlating code from python), however I would love to learn functional style. I know there are rockthejvm courses, but thats wayyy too expensive for me, since I&#x27;m not looking to use scala professionally, (I&#x27;m self employed) Thanks

                              <span>v0.4.0 of hyperdrive.el is available on NonGNU ELPA!
 hyperdrive.el is an Emacs interface to hyperdrive, a mutable, versioned, peer-to-peer shared filesystem. Among other things, hyperdrive.el has these features: Share unlimited files of unlimited size; Explore file history with built-in versioning; Stream video and audio; No signup or account creation; Free as in Freedom!
 Highlights of v0.4.0:
  
 Transclude hyperdrive content using org-transclusion (until hyperdrive-org-transclusion is available on NonGNU ELPA, please use package-vc-install).
  Easier installation of the external gateway program dependency with M-x hyperdrive-install.
  Save disk space by &quot;forgetting&quot; your copy of a file with M-x hyperdrive-forget-file.
  Security measures added to avoid loading major modes in potential unsafe buffers (hyperdrive-mark-as-safe).
  Improved, asynchronous interface for starting and stopping the gateway.
  See at a glance which files have been already downloaded based on their faces in the directory and history buffers.
  
For the full set of changes and fixes, check out the hyperdrive.el CHANGELOG.

                              <span>indent-bars: fast, configurable indentation guide-bars
 ➤ v0.7.4, now on ELPA!
 Since the last update a year ago, indent-bars has improved substantially. New capabilities:
  
Bar depth can be held fixed in parenthesized expressions (e.g. long function calls) and multi-line strings.
 tree-sitter support — with tree-sitter&#x27;s help, indent-bars can do more: 
 scope-focus: emphasize the current scope (e.g. function, if block, etc.),
 omit blank-line bar display in certain contexts (e.g. top-level module),
 and more.
 
 Fully configurable styling (colors by-depth, bar width, pattern, more) for both in-scope and out-of-scope bars.
 Auto-updating theme support.
 3 methods for depth selection for highlighting the bar at the current depth, including a new default.
 Immediate feedback when changing bar setting in the Customize interface.
 Support for lots of new languages.
 When showing the same buffer side-by-side, stipple bars are displayed correctly in each window.

                              <span>Last week I ditched Doom Emacs for Emacs Bedrock, and from there I carve my Emacs configuration to fit my taste and needs on another file that is loaded at the end of &#x60;init.el&#x60;.
 At first, I decided to install projectile because it appeared that project management was lacking in Emacs, and it didn&#x27;t come installed by Bedrock; however, I discovered that Emacs actually provides a built-in alternative to projectile called &#x60;project.el&#x60;. I implemented some enhancements that someone else kindly shared on the web.
 However, I noticed that there is no customization or command for discovering projects recursively. In project.el project discovery is something 100% manual, the user has to do. Thus, I wonder if someone else has already solved this problem and could share emacs-lisp snippets, maybe? :)

In the pdf file generated from org-mode, the spacing between paragraphs is the same as the spacing between lines.
 My question is: how to make the spacing slightly wider in the pdf generated from org-mode? I prefer not to manually set a number but to use a package or some other way? Thank you!

                              <span>I use yadm to manage my dotfiles. It works by setting up a bare git repo in ~/.local/share/yadm/repo.git, so the dotfiles themselves are not in a traditional git repo. (That&#x27;s nice because otherwise git would try to manage all of $HOME.) 
 I use built-in project.el, not projectile. I&#x27;m running a recent self-built emacs off master.
 When I edit my .bashrc, I use eglot with a bash lsp server. Eglot (or something called from it, maybe in project.el?) thinks everything in $HOME should be managed by this server, and runs a giant find . command, which eventually times out and restarts the LSP server endlessly.
 A possible solution to this is to tell emacs that my dotfiles are in an opt-in project that only contains those dotfiles, nothing else. (I&#x27;d rather not have to put all my other dirs under ~ into some ignore list -- that&#x27;s why yadm is so nice, because it&#x27;s opt-in, not opt-out.) If I could teach emacs that the dotfiles are backed by the actual bare git repo, that would be even nicer, but mostly I just want to avoid eglot trying to manage my whole home dir.
 Any advice? Anyone tried anything like this?

                              <span>Forgive me if this post looks messy/topicless.
 I was trying to style the sidebar notes of org-roam-ui. It&#x27;s been a journey but my finding is mainly that for any change(including style) to take effect, you have to run npm run build or next build in the repo to build a new ./out. That&#x27;s when I find out about that https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam-ui do not work (Node.js version Node.js v20.13.1, ▲ Next.js 14.2.12) anymore. I think it still works on lower version of node.
 The package still works now for me as emacs doesn&#x27;t build it and just use the prebuilt one(2 years old) included in the git repo.
 There&#x27;s 2 main things I found out about it:
  
Most of them on https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam-ui/forks don&#x27;t build now (on my setup) for the above reason. They have identical next.config.js. I don&#x27;t know how to fix it (so it build on my setup, which involves editing next.config.js and possibly the project to adapt for node20), so if someone knows please comment. I think it still build with node.js v12 because in odomanov&#x27;s fork, the build 3 months ago went through and that one&#x27;s using github action https://github.com/actions/setup-node/releases/tag/v2 which appears to use node12.
 
https://github.com/odomanov/org-roam-ui have built some interesting thing called &quot;desk&quot; similar to https://github.com/cpbotha/org-roam-canvas &#x27;s effect. the latter uses obsidian&#x27;s graph and emacs to make html, odomanov on the other hand made something like this:
 
 click on the \&quot;open desk\&quot; button
 will open this \&quot;desk\&quot; where you can have small snippet of node&#x27;s html previews to drag around
 and on a side note 3. That&#x27;s all there is. the only other works on org-roam-ui I&#x27;m aware of is https://github.com/ikoamu/publish-org-roam-ui (which builds on https://github.com/uncomfyhalomacro &#x27;s fork) which replaces the websocket communication to emacs to get org-roam-nodes with a js stub thus made org-roam-ui static.

                              <span>Problem Description:
 After the recent Denote upgrade, for some reason, using commands like M-x denote (see the issue: https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/440) does not display the list of notes.
 Since my notes rely on numbering, naming new notes has become a frustrating issue, as I don’t know when I accidentally repeat a number.
 I reported this to the plugin developer, Protesilaos (Port), and he asked if I had enabled savehist-mode. However, after enabling this mode, the problem persisted.
 Unable to tolerate this anymore, I decided to write my own function to solve the issue. I must say, Emacs’ flexibility makes me love it even more.
 Code:
 emacs-lisp (defun my-denote-with-preview () (interactive) (let* ((existing-notes (denote-directory-files)) (existing-titles (mapcar (lambda (file) (or (denote-retrieve-title-value file &#x27;org) (file-name-base file))) existing-notes)) (chosen-title (ivy-read &quot;Choose or enter new note title: &quot; existing-titles :caller &#x27;my-denote-with-preview :action (lambda (x) (setq ivy-text x)) :require-match nil))) (if (member chosen-title existing-titles) (find-file (car (delq nil (mapcar (lambda (file) (when (string&#x3D; (or (denote-retrieve-title-value file &#x27;org) (file-name-base file)) chosen-title) file)) existing-notes)))) (denote chosen-title))))

                              <span>Using shell-script mode, there are some constructs that result in very weird indentation in Emacs when capturing output. The two examples I could come up with (command part usually being multiple lines of code):
 # Capture output of multiline command into variable variablename&#x3D;$( ls -l ) # Capture output of command into array line by line IFS&#x3D;$&#x27;\n&#x27; variablename&#x3D;($( ls -l )) 
 More desirable would be indentation along the lines of
 variablename&#x3D;$( ls -l ) variable-name&#x3D;($( ls -l )) 
 I could not find any relevant options in M-x customize-group sh-indentation. Is there some other way to achieve it?

 I am using emacs 29.1 with native compilation enabled. I have tried to clear the eln-cache multiple times. I think it is possible that native compilation mess up some of the functions.
 But I have tried also emacs **without** native compilation. The phenomenon persists.
 I also tried emacs -Q and things didn&#x27;t get better.

                              <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;ve been using Doom Emacs since a year or so and since the beginning I&#x27;ve always struggled to understand how different pieces fit together in relation to projects.
 Perhaps it&#x27;s a &quot;me&quot; problem, but there seem to be many different concepts and interactions that I fail to even understand how I should go about them in terms of workflow:
  
Treemacs
 Projectile
 Workspaces
 Perspectives
  
I initially tried to simply add my projects/folders with &#x60;SPC p a&#x60;, but they don&#x27;t show up anywhere.
 I also tried &#x60;treemacs-edit-workspaces&#x60;, crafted a set of perspectives each containing a set of projects I&#x27;d epect to be grouped together, but then every time I open a new file everything gets replaced in treemacs.
 Hopefully somebody can shed some light on how all these modules fit together
 Thanks!

                              <span>I have a pretty simple approach to debugging: usually all I need to do to find a bug is insert a bunch of statements throughout the code printing to stdout the value of certain variables at various points:
 print(f&quot;keys : {keys}&quot;) console.log(&#x60;x : ${x}&#x60;) etc 
 I have written a few elisp functions to do just that (see here for example). Right now I&#x27;m only covering the few languages I&#x27;ve been working with lately, but I&#x27;m interested in expanding the approach further so it covers multiple languages and is easy to adapt.
 A few questions:
  
am I re-inventing the wheel? Is there already a package that provides this feature? The only similar one I found in package-list-packages is ll-debug, which seems simple but also not actively maintained, and adding modes to it isn&#x27;t super intuitive
 if no to the above questions: is this something people would be interested in? Ideally this package would be: simple to setup with minimal overhead, easy to customize and to add support for new languages. I can&#x27;t guarantee it will be ready soon, but I&#x27;m already working on it for my own workflows, so it&#x27;s in the early stages (unless I find a better approach: see questions above and below)
 I&#x27;m curious what approach to debugging you all use: am I making a mistake by keeping things so simple? what are some more complex debugging capabilities, and are there ways to run these in a way that is consistent across languages (like the debug-print approach)?

                              <span>Hi everybody,
 If your org-roam database is large, chances are you are waiting more than 1 second for org-roam-find-node to show candidates.
 This is a package that improves the performance of org-roam-find-node. It runs between 4-10 times faster, while maintaining total compatibility. In fact, you can enable/disable the package without any adverse effects.
 The package also extends the org-speed-commands with a hydra, accessible with the letter m. Only two commands are accesible: org-roam-refile and org-roam-extract-subtree (open an issue if you would like to see other commands).
 The only potential issue is if you use a custom template. One of the areas where org-roam spends a lot of time is formatting the template. To reduce this time the template can be a function (which is much faster than processing the template string). The template function provided in the package should be good enough for most users, but adding a new template function is easy. See code for details.
 It is a minor mode, so to enable and disable simply run org-roam-gt-mode
 https://github.com/dmgerman/org-roam-gt
 if somebody can point me to information on how to upload it to a repo of packages, I&#x27;ll do that. In the meantime, download it from github.

Don&#x27;t know if this problem belongs to Workflows or Research &amp; Reading category
As title says, how to manage such inflow of info and (lingering) diverse bits of info (and use them)?
I was researching this forum but couldnt find the solution.
I&#x27;m aware of collector fallacy and low value of inactive ideas.
I will name an item in the following text any atomic idea, observation, concept, relation, insight, fact, definition, tool, app, inspiration etc.
Even with filtering out the inflow the problems persist.
Situation:
Some amount of items impossible to relate anywhere at the moment.
So they stay in that big pile or amalgam inside inbox.
You are sure that those items are important, you have come up with usage for them. But it&#x27;s impossible because of missing parts you don&#x27;t know of (lack o…</span>

                              <span>I imagine that inlining everything will result in a higher-performance executable. First, is my premise wrong? Second, I see two practical problems: (1) looooooong compile times, and (2) huge size of the resulting binary executable. Problem 2 doesn’t sound like a showstopper to me, so is Problem 1 the only real barrier. Are there other practical problems I’m unaware of?

                              <span>Hey fellow Haskellers,
 I’m excited to announce that Functional Design and Architecture has just been released by Manning! 🎉 This project has been years in the making, and it’s finally ready to make a splash in the world of functional programming. 🌍
 Why should you care?
 For years, Haskell users have been asking for more guidance on best practices, application architecture, and design patterns—things we’ve seen abundant in OOP, but far less in FP. This book aims to fill that void. (You can find my article &quot;The Voids of Haskell&quot; very interesting in this regard; it&#x27;s about imaginary Haskell books we could have but don&#x27;t yet.)

                              <span>Hey everyone! I relatively recently developed an SBT plugin for Buf
 A quick primer as to what Buf is that shamelessly copies the docs:
 The buf CLI is a tool for working with Protocol Buffers.
  
The ability to manage Protobuf assets on the Buf Schema Registry (BSR).
 A linter that enforces good API design choices and structure.
 A breaking change detector that enforces compatibility at the source code or wire level.
 A generator that invokes your plugins based on configurable templates.
 A formatter that formats your Protobuf files in accordance with industry standards.
 Integration with the Buf Schema Registry, including full dependency management.
  
If this sounds interesting, and you want to delve further into all the things Buf can do for you, I&#x27;d recommend taking a look at Buf&#x27;s Do…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;d like to insert a template as a child in a current heading.
 I would like to use something like this target (from template elements@org-doc):
 (id &quot;id of existing org entry&quot;)
 which enters the template as a child of the current heading. But in my case my entries don&#x27;t (as a rule) have ID&#x27;s.
 So ideally, there would be target option in addition to (here) which will insert it at the point (which is close but not exactly what I want)
 (body-of-current-entry)
 I can try and write a function, but I&#x27;d rather not re-invent the wheel.
 Thanks!

 as not to repeat myself here is an issue I opened in their repo https://github.com/sourcegraph/emacs-cody/issues/40
 TLDR; cody runs for about a minute and then the node process is no longer responsive.
 if anyone has it working would you please post your requirements config, I would really appreciate that.

                              <span>Hello.
 I am currently in the process of deciding on my next long term working and development environment and Emacs is a hot contender.
 Due to specific personal interests and requirements, I would like to begin my Emacs adventure with a maybe slightly unconvential approach, that is, starting with nothing but the Emacs runtime and step by step adding all keybinds for commands that I require and desire, sort of a bootstrap process for building my own environment.
 As far as I can tell I would need the following:
  
Removal of all default keybinds
 Discovery of available commands (external is fine, I don&#x27;t care about &quot;purity&quot; in the boostrap)
  
Can you point me to any resource that would help me in my plan? Maybe someone with experience going for this approach?

 Not concerned, this is just an experience report. Emacs is 30.0.90 from homebrew emacs-plus@30.

                              <span>Hello,
 I&#x27;ve recently started using Gnus to manage my emails but haven&#x27;t been able to configure the Summary buffer exactly as I&#x27;d like. Specifically, I want all threads to be collapsed into a single article (the most recent one) and have the threads sorted by the latest date, in descending order.
 Here are lines from my config:
 (setopt gnus-thread-sort-functions &#x27;(gnus-thread-sort-by-number gnus-thread-sort-by-most-recent-date) gnus-subthread-sort-functions &#x27;(gnus-thread-sort-by-number (not gnus-thread-sort-by-date)) gnus-sort-gathered-threads-function &#x27;gnus-thread-sort-by-date gnus-summary-thread-gathering-function &#x27;gnus-gather-threads-by-subject gnus-thread-hide-subtree t gnus-thread-ignore-subject t) 
 With this setup, all threads are hidden behind their root articles and sorted by the most recent date. However, the issue I’m facing is that the Summary buffer shows the root article instead of the most recent one in each thread.
 I&#x27;ve tried to play with gnus-subthread-sort-functions without success.
 Does anyone know if it’s possible to achieve what I’m aiming for?
 Thank you!

                              <span>Hi there,
 It find myself, very often, in the situation of having to create CLOCK entries in LOGBOOK drawers by hand.
 Either because I forgot to clock in, or most commonly: because I was doing several things AFK and want to log them all when back.
 Right now I do it by hand, I tyope &quot;CLOCK: &quot; then the timestamps. Which feels... archaic.
 Does anyone have a nice cool function that will ask me for two timestamps (or an initial timestamp and a duration) and create the CLOCK entry?

 xmonad 0.18.0.9 (Ubuntu 22.04 underneath)
 GNU Emacs v29.4
 Doom core v3.0.0-pre
 Doom modules v24.10.0-pre 
 I&#x27;m struggling to get doom modelline to stop truncating my vcs branch name at &quot;-&quot;, which happens regardless of whether I set vcs-max-length to 1000000. When there is no &quot;-&quot; in the name, there is no problems.
 I have tried this whole scratch setup in config.el:
 (setq doom-modeline-vcs-max-length 1000
 doom-modeline-vcs-display-function #&#x27;doom-modeline-vcs-name)
 I&#x27;ve also tried to write my own version doom-modeline-vcs-name, but I&#x27;m not strong at elisp, and I&#x27;ve never managed to get a &quot;HelloWorld&quot; through on the modelline.
 Could somebody please help me? :)

 This might not be true for Traverse, instead.
 TIA! 🙏

                              <span>Hi everyone!
 I want to talk about lack of DevOps expertise inside the organizations. Not every company can or should have a full time DevOps Engineer. Let’s say we want to train Developers to handle DevOps tasks. With the disclaimer that DevOps is the approach and not a job position 😉 
 1/ What are the most common cases that you need DevOps for, but you&#x27;re handling it?
 2/ What kind of DevOps challenges do you have in your projects?
 3/ What DevOps problems are slowing you down?
 Is there any subject you want to know from scratch or upgrade your existing knowledge - with DevOps mindeset/toolset?
 Thanks in advance!

 A week ago I was interviewed by Frank Delporte about JavaFX, GraalVM Native Image, and how to make Android app in Scala. Here&#x27;s the link. I hope you enjoy. If you have questions, let me know, I&#x27;ll be happy to answer the best I can.

                              <span>Hi,
 I have been going over my config lately to simplify my first orgmode setup. The more I learn, the more I can see that I have been trying to reinvent the wheel. Anyway, I have been playing around with the clock, and the &#x27;effort&#x27; estimates and I am considering using effort to simplify some of my lists.
 The problem is that I use exclusively &#x60;org-ql-blocks&#x60; for my agenda views, and I was unsuccessful in my attempts at filtering them using &#x60;se&#x60; and then selecting some criterias. I tried some other filters too, and I could only restrict the org-ql-blocks within agenda views when using &#x60;sc&#x60; and &#x60;st&#x60;, respectively category and tags.
 Since I know from the documentation that &#x27;everything is supposed to work&#x27; in agenda views but not guaranteed to, I was wondering if the problem was on my side or if someone else could reproduce the error.
 When trying to restrict an org-ql-block using a regex for example, I do not get an error even if it does not work as I would expect, but when trying to apply an &#x60;effort&#x60; filter, I get the following error:
 Debugger entered--Lisp error: (args-out-of-range 0 0) get-text-property(0 effort-minutes nil) (let ((effort (get-text-property 0 &#x27;effort-minutes (org-get-at-bol &#x27;txt)))) (funcall op (or effort (if org-agenda-sort-noeffort-is-high 32767 -1)) value)) org-agenda-compare-effort(&#x3D; 30.0) (and (org-agenda-compare-effort &#x27;&#x3D; 30.0)) eval((and (org-agenda-compare-effort &#x27;&#x3D; 30.0)) t) (if (eval org-agenda-filter-form t) nil (org-agenda-filter-hide-line type)) 
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>Hi Org-Mode community! Long time lurker, first time poster. I&#x27;m using Org-Mode to produce LaTeX files. Basically, I&#x27;m looking for a way to export the &quot;+&quot; plain list item as &quot;\item[$\square$]&quot; and the &quot;-&quot; plain list item as &quot;\item[$\bullet$]&quot;, but I can&#x27;t find any way to do it. I tried using the variable org-latex-listing but it seems that this variable is obsolete.
 (defun my-org-latex-customize-lists ()
 &quot;Customize LaTeX export of Org-mode lists.&quot;
 (setq org-latex-listings
 &#x27;((+ . &quot;\\item[$\\bullet$]&quot;)
 (- . &quot;\\item[$\\square$]&quot;))))
 I did make my own latex-class. I suspect I have to change something here...
 ;; &gt; Creating latex-classes and adding them to org-latex-classes :
 (add-to-list &#x27;org-latex-classes
 ( list &quot;org-report&quot;
 (concat &quot;\\documentclass[10pt]{article}&quot; contenu-preambule)
 &#x27;(&quot;\\section{%s}&quot; . &quot;\\section*{%s}&quot;)
 &#x27;(&quot;\\subsection{%s}&quot; . &quot;\\subsection*{%s}&quot;)
 &#x27;(&quot;\\subsubsection{%s}&quot; . &quot;\\subsubsection*{%s}&quot;)
 &#x27;(&quot;\\paragraph{%s}&quot; . &quot;\\paragraph*{%s}&quot;)))
 In any case, I know you can do it, because I already do it in Org-Mode with Org-Superstar...
 (use-package org-superstar
 :ensure t
 :hook (org-mode . org-superstar-mode)
 :config
 (setq org-superstar-item-bullet-alist
 &#x27;((?* . &quot;•&quot;) ;; Puce pour les listes à puces
 (?+ . &quot;▪&quot;) ;; Puce pour les sous-listes
 (?- . &quot;•&quot;)))
 So I&#x27;m looking for a variable that look likes the superstar one to change the export. Any help would be greatly appreciated. ChatGPT didn&#x27;t help either.
 Edit : Correcting mistakes.

                              <span>I am surprised that no one has created a literal index card box, digitally. Rendering an actual box, actual drawers, and a search function to pick out a card.
I will say this, the closest I have seen is a small program on itchio called Decker
It is a recreation and expansion of the old index card mac program (back when Apple still looked like the fruit), very versatile, very user- supported.
I designed a primitive template to use as index cards. Linking cards is not fluid, but maybe someone will make a deck that does that.
Check it out.</span>

                              <span>I am an app addict.
Just when I get cozy with one app; I need a theme or extension or just a new experience.
I have gone from real index cards, bullet journals, tiddlywiki, feather wiki, trillium, zettlr, and now on Logseq. Then back and forth between analog and digital.
This movement gets in the way of the actual work; and unfortunately it’s worse for straight fiction- writing.
Anyone else have this problem? Suggestions?
PS: I tried hypernomicon too; and the only great thing it has is the name- so cool!</span>

                              <span>I’m very eager to start using zettlelkastan to help with generating new ideas and creating blogs and aiding me in my research. I’ve only watched a few videos of it and have a vague idea how it works but I don’t wanna end up overplanning and never doing it. I want to do a physical and digital zettlekastan system. I have bought post it tabs (not sure if useful but it could be used to tab my dividers) and index cards. How do I store my index cards? Are there places to buy boxes made specifically for storing index cards or will I have to make them?</span>

When I press  after I select some top level function, instead of jumping to that function, imenu present me a new list with variables names defined in that function, and so on....
 Is there a way to jump to a top level function?

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;m trying to get mu4e (latest version, using emacs 29.3) to show an email&#x27;s date/time in my local time zone. This works in the headers view, but not in the message view, where the time typically is shown in UTC time zone or sometimes in other time zones (it might be using the sender&#x27;s time zone?).
 While debugging the message view, &#x60;mu4e~headers-field-value&#x60; seems to return the time in my local time zone (correct behaviour), but something else seems to change it afterwards to a different time zone. I haven&#x27;t altered the values of &#x60;mu4e-headers-time-format&#x60; (&quot;%X&quot;) or &#x60;mu4e-headers-long-date-format&#x60; (&quot;%c&quot;). Also, &#x60;current-time-zone&#x60; returns the right time zone for my locale.
 Any ideas what is changing the time zone in mu4e&#x27;s message view, or how to force using my current time zone?

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I&#x27;d started writing some code to integrate the BiomeJS Javascript linter/formatter and having done most of the hard work (arguably a bunch of hacks, but it works) I was now writing here to tell you folks about it.
 I knew about the prior existence of https://github.com/cxa/lsp-biome, which I was going to mention here and explain I don&#x27;t use LSP hence why I&#x27;d written more code instead of using that package.
 But when I did search for lsp-biome, I actually stumbled upon two packages that do exactly what my package do but better:
  
https://github.com/yadex205/emacs-biomejs-format
 https://github.com/craneduck/flycheck-biomejs
  
I don&#x27;t know how the hell I missed them in my initial search but here they are...
 In the hope that it might prevent someone else from writing a bunch of hacks, I thought I&#x27;d keep writing this post anyway and leave the instructions to set them up together:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;elisp ;; BiomeJS Flycheck integration (straight-use-package &#x27;(flycheck-biomejs :type git :host github :repo &quot;craneduck/flycheck-biomejs&quot; :require t))
 ;; BiomeJS format-on-save (straight-use-package &#x27;(emacs-biomejs-format :type git :host github :repo &quot;yadex205/emacs-biomejs-format&quot; :require t :config ( (add-hook &#x27;js2-mode-hook &#x27;biomejs-format-mode) (add-hook &#x27;web-mode-hook &#x27;biomejs-format-mode)))) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

Ergonomic folds: generics-sop recursion schemes, without &quot;base functor&quot;
  
A previous post reminded me of the idea to improve the ergonomics of recursion schemes.
  
What exactly is the point of recursion schemes
  
I haven&#x27;t worked with plugins but I wanted to find a way to use recursion schemes by giving algebraic datatypes a virtual base functor. The base functor structure is already latent in recursive datatypes and can be recreated by abstracting out recursive positions:
 type Base :: Type -&gt; Type -&gt; Type data Base as a instance Functor (Base as) 
 This is an empty datatype declaration, Base [a] list is the base functor of lists. Then the way to construct values of type Base [a] is to use the constructors of the recursive type: [] and (:), obviously at a different type. This is more natural than dealing with a separate datatype and it helps keep it in sync, but to avoid confusion they can be renamed, Base.[].
 {- -- virtual datatype defined by the plugin type Base :: Type -&gt; Type -&gt; Type data Base [a] list where Base.[] :: Base [a] list (Base.:) :: a -&gt; list -&gt; Base [a] list deriving stock Functor -} -- project &#x3D; unsafeCoerce project :: [a] -&gt; Base [a] [a] project [] &#x3D; Base.[] project (a:as) &#x3D; a Base.: as cata :: (Base [a] res -&gt; res) -&gt; ([a] -&gt; res) cata alg &#x3D; res where res &#x3D; alg . fmap res . project len :: [a] -&gt; Int len &#x3D; cata \case Base.[] -&gt; 0 _Base.:n -&gt; 1 + n 
 Is there any way to make this work?

                              <span>We are working on a research paper titled “What about Haskell bugs? Adapting bug taxonomies to Haskell’s features and community”. The goal of this research is to investigate whether existing bug taxonomies from literature can accurately capture bugs in Haskell and assess their potential usefulness for the Haskell community.
 We are looking to speak with experienced Haskell developers or maintainers who are willing to participate in a short, 30-minute recorded interview (recordings and transcripts will remain private; only anonymized excerpts and quotes may be shared). During the interview, we&#x27;ll discuss your experiences handling Haskell bugs — how you identify, understand, classify, and fix them. We&#x27;ll also present some existing bug taxonomies for you to share your opinions.
 If you are interested or know someone else who might be you can contact me at [R3c55+HaskellDevCall@proton.me](mailto:R3c55+HaskellDevCall@proton.me) or my colleague, Leonhard, at [l.h.applis@tudelft.nl](mailto:l.h.applis@tudelft.nl).
 Thank you for considering this opportunity!
 All the best,

 Despite the long struggle to make streaming abstractions finalize (release resources) promptly (for example, by implementing special-purpose bracketing operations using ResourceT for conduit and SafeT for pipes), they still fail in this task. At best, they have &quot;promptish&quot; finalization.
 Streams implemented in Bluefin, on the other hand, do finalize promptly and can even use general-purpose bracketing!
 My article explains the situation.

                              <span>What is the syntax for org-mode to use a table&#x27;s values directly into an org-babel function?
 In the code below is the some syntax which allow the SQL command to be applied to each row.
 I have seen some examples which based on Elisp which use some mapxxxx and cl-destructuring-bind functions to obtain the values with Elisp and format them for other languages, but I think there is a syntax where org-mode recognizes the var used for the table and uses the values in the formula.

I have yet found anyone to fully explain the exact parts and function. I read Scott’s book but it is very confusing and elusive. The language littered with unclarified concrete explanations. I’ve tried to watch and read as much as possible but still very elusive. Thanks</span>

 Is it an attribute that the font itself needs to support?
 Does it depend on the particular type of font?

                              <span>On many modes, e.g. text-mode, M- calls ispell-complete-word. This function suggests word completions from a dictionary.
 In my case, M- yields an error: ispell-lookup-words: No plain word-list found at systemdefault locations. Customize ‘ispell-alternate-dictionary’ to set yours.
 However, I have Hunspell 1.7.2 installed (on NixOS) and spellchecking (M-$ ispell-word) works fine. But Hunspell dictionaries do not seem to work as plain word lists and I don&#x27;t really know how to set this up. Any ideas how to fix this?
 There are some related reports, like https://www.reddit.com/r/DoomEmacs/comments/qw8xn7, but I haven&#x27;t found a solution. In my case this issue happens on GNU Emacs 29.4 with no .emacs or init.el configuration.

                              <span>Hello, 
 I am trying to use the calendar/diary of emacs in italian, and so I set 
 (setq calendar-date-display-form (quote ((if dayname (concat dayname &quot;, &quot;)) day &quot; &quot; monthname &quot; &quot; year)) 
 which correctly shows me Lunedì, 16 Settembre 2024 if I press d on a day of the calendar where there is some data in the diary. This is the format I want on display.
 The problem is that if I set that variable, inserting a new appointment in the diary with i d, the date is inserted with this format:
 16 Set 2024
 and is not showing in the calendar (No diary entries for Lunedì, 16 Settembre 2024).
 Without that variable setting, instead I get in the diary entry the standard format:
 Set 16, 2024
 which is parsed correclty and shows in the calendar.
 How can I make the whole thing work in italian?
 thanks!

It takes a few seconds to a) show the result in Vertico and b) open the documentation. Even evaluating (describe-function &#x27;pcase) is extremely slow. I discovered that, for some reason, not loading lsp-mode and related packages improves the issue. I&#x27;ve also tried disabling and sequentially re-enabling packages from my config but couldn&#x27;t find the culprit. To do that, I tried to put my config in a catch statement (to stop the execution at a certain point), like this:
 (catch &#x27;my-exit ;; I want to execute this (throw &#x27;my-exit &quot;Stop here&quot;) ;; I don&#x27;t want to execute this ) 
 I&#x27;m pretty sure that what I did there is probably stupid, but I&#x27;m not an Elisp expert. Anyway, after putting all my config in the catch-throw statement (even with the throw as the last line), I couldn&#x27;t reproduce the bug.
 I initially experienced the (describe-function &#x27;pcase) bug on macOS and thought that this was in some way OS-specific, but I compiled Emacs 31+ on my Linux machine today and the same thing happens.
 At this point, I&#x27;m just very curious about what is happening. If someone has a clue, I&#x27;d appreciate it!

                              <span>Heya! 
 I’m curious if anyone in this community knows if it’s possible to setup a ctrl lock key instead of caps lock? 
 My hands don’t do chording too well and begin to hurt overtime. I know there is god mode which I can use to avoid it, but even better in my mind would be to set up a “ctrl lock” in the place of caps lock . That way I don’t have to install a plugin and complicate my .emacs.
 I am curious if anyone has any idea if that can be setup on Linux Xorg?

 It is not rare to have my macbook spinning fans at maximum speed, cpu usage high and battery going down, just because I loaded some file with a &#x27;not yet compiled&#x27; dependency.
 Also, a &quot;emacs --native-compile-all-packages&quot; to run in advance in order to reduce this sort of compilations while really using Emacs would be great.
 Is there something we can control about it?

 This lighter color line in the mode line is bugging me. Is it an extra border or is it misplaced?
 I really like Solarized Theme, but this thing keeps me away from it.

 Even if I start it without loading any configuration: /usr/local/opt/emacs-mac/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs -Q, it still takes about 3 seconds for the main window to appear.
 If I start it in the terminal /usr/local/opt/emacs-mac/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs -Q -nw, it takes about 0.8 seconds to show up. This is acceptable.
 I also tested https://emacsformacosx.com/ and got similar results.
 Why does the UI of emacs on Mac take so long to appear? Is there any way to speed it up? 
 For comparison, the UI of VSCode takes about 1 second, and Zed&#x27;s UI takes about 0.5 seconds to appear.
 My Mac is a MacBook Pro 15-inch, 2019 (2.6 GHz 6-Core Intel Core i7, 32 GB 2400 MHz DDR4).
 Please do not suggest using emacsclient; this post focuses on solving / investigating the initial startup window / UI display speed of emacs-mac.

 Thanks to Protesilaos (also known as Prot).
 When I use Emacs 29, I only used the default theme because it was simple and eased my eyes. I tried other light themes including Modus operandi but it&#x27;s a little high contrast to my eyes. But with Emacs 30.0.91 the modus-operandi theme is much better. Prot has included a total 8 modus themes on 30.0.91, all other Modus themes also have very good quality. Some pictures of the modus-operandi theme on my (Doom) Emacs:

                              <span>Compatible with Emacs 30 and later versions.
 Overview files now have more elegant names, reducing repetitive occurrences of the word “overview.”
 Fixed an intermittent (setq, 5) error.
 Removed the dependency on conda.el in org-zettel-ref-mode.el, and the detection of the Python environment is now entirely handled by convert-to-org.py. 
 Automatically sets up a virtual environment via the python venv command and installs required libraries. 
 Note: After updating to this version, running convert-to-org.py will reinstall third-party libraries. If you prefer a clean environment, you may want to manage this manually.
 
 
 Improved synchronization mechanism for overview files, preventing multiple overview files from being created for the same source file. Also improved the robustness and stability of this feature. 
 A hash table is now used to map source files to overview files. One great thing is that you don’t need to manually set the hash table file location.
 The overview file header now includes a new property block: #+SOURCE-FILE: to confirm the mapping.
 New commands: 
 org-zettel-ref-check-and-repair-links - Check and repair links between source files and overview files.
 org-zettel-ref-maintenance-menu - Display a menu for org-zettel-ref-mode maintenance operations.
 org-zettel-ref-refresh-index - Manually refresh the overview index.
 org-zettel-ref-rescan-overview-files - Rescan the overview directory and update the index.
 org-zettel-ref-status - Display the current status of org-zettel-ref-mode.

                              <span>Hey everyone, my first post in this community - the emacs fever has taken hold. I am currently holding my first weekly review with org-mode and was wondering if it is possible to display all the tasks I have completed in the last 7 days... of course, its emacs probably there is a function for it :D
 I enabled org-log-done and will now have my future DONE tasks logged. I found that by using the &quot;m&quot; option on the Agenda I can filter for TODO&#x3D;&quot;DONE&quot;&amp;CLOSED&gt;&#x3D;&quot;&quot; and the agenda shows me what I want.
 Now, I know we can run lisp in org-files and I want to add a snippet to my Weekly review template that queries the org-agenda and inserts the output under the current subheading. I have looked trough a few StackOverflow posts and I am quite frankly lost were to even start since I dont understand what Helm calls as a function to query the org-agenda. 
 I would love to learn what your process is when you create such a workflow, how can I solve this problem without just copy and pasting a solution? I really want to learn the mindset to get my hands dirty with future problems.

                              <span>Hi! I&#x27;m trying to install Haskell on windows and I followed these instructions from the official site (https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/install/). The install gets through the main phase, but then I get this error message:
 ERROR: The certificate of ‘www.haskell.org’ is not trusted.
 ERROR: The certificate of ‘www.haskell.org’ doesn&#x27;t have a known issuer.
 Anyone have any ideas on how to fix this? I&#x27;m very new to writing to the shell so I&#x27;m not really sure how to do the manual installation and which commands to change. Thanks!

                              <span>Hi!
 I have this guy:
 {-# LANGUAGE GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving #-} ... newtype Parser t &#x3D; Parser { parser :: ExceptT Error (StateT Input (Reader Config)) t } deriving (Functor, Applicative, Monad) 
 How can i write instaces for MonadReader / MonadWriter (if it&#x27;s possible), so i can rid of all lift (ask instead of lift . lift $ ask etc ...)

                              <span>Hello everyones, i do have recurrents issues with type in scala.
 I&#x27;ve started working on an open source code since a few week, that issue is keeping me back since a moment now.
 See the Github error : https://github.com/Eric1212/airline/actions/runs/10865774182/job/30152592989
 Could someone help me figuring out how to solve that type issue ? I&#x27;ve tryed IA but apparently it&#x27;s worse than me regarding types...
 Sincerely thanks, Éric

                              <span>I’ve always used scalafmt for my formatting. I’ve found that it doesn’t handle bracket-less scala3 well. It has been a few months since I did this so it could be a solved problem by now. 
 Has anyone else had this issue?

                              <span>During my writing code, sometimes I navigate to another source file in third party libraries by using Go To Definition command and I can go back to previous file by pressing q, which will close it and bring back to my code buffer.
 The problem is pressing q sometimes is not working and it is not closing the window, also the for some reason all my evil binding stop working and the only way to close it is to kill emac.
 Any solution or hints what could be the problem?
 Edit: Go to Defintion &#x3D;&#x3D; lsp-find-definition.

                              <span>I am trying to make a minor mode for my keybindings, but some of them don&#x27;t work. I am trying to make ctrl+c copy, ctrl+shift+c be the prefix key for the modes that need ctrl+c as a prefix key and ctrl+f do incremental forward search and on repeated keypress have it do repeated forward search (like ctrl+s used to, which I rebound to save-buffer). My problems are: 1. Every major and minor mode ignore my ctrl+c bind and treat it as if it were a modifier key. 2. I don&#x27;t know how to make emacs interpret ctrl+shift+c as the modifier key like cua did. 3. When I try to do incremental search I get the prompt &quot;I-search: [no previous search string]&quot; and when I try to type my search expression it just ignores, removes the prompt and writes my expression into the buffer. All of this happens on the first keystroke.
 Also I have tried to get used to the emacs default bindings and although I know how to use them I find them rather unplesant personally so I can&#x27;t give up on this.

                        <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/1fgllvj/a_question_about_how_a_sandboxed_emacs_via/">

                              <span>I thought the most glaring limitations of emacs to date is the fact that any malicious package can potentially gain unfettered access to system files and resources. But macports works by confining &#x27;ported software to a private “sandbox” that keeps it from intermingling with your operating system and its vendor-supplied software to prevent them from becoming corrupted.&#x27;
 I am no Emacs expert, but it does appear to work quite well on MacOS via Macports, so my question is whether it really behaves like Emacs does under the hood in this case. And if that is that case, why can&#x27;t mainstream distributions adopt the same kind of sandboxing mechanisms?

                              <span>Hello there Emacsen friends!
 I&#x27;m proud to announce auto-dark is growing to version 0.13. Just merged it.
 You may find it here:
  
https://github.com/LionyxML/auto-dark-emacs, or
 https://melpa.org/#/auto-dark (as soon as MELPA builds it)
  
With this version (shouts to sellout for the awesome work!), we are:
 1. Supporting the usage of multiple themes
 Example:
 (use-package emacs
 :custom (custom-enabled-themes &#x27;(bringhurst solarized inheritance)))
 (use-package auto-dark
 :init (auto-dark-mode))
 This will make use of various themes at the same time, while auto-dark-mode will also switch the light/dark versions of those themes.
 2. Changing the default way to set light/dark themes
 These variables are now marked as obsolete:
 auto-dark--dark-themes
 auto-dark--light-themes
 The right way to set the light/dark themes is now through:
 (setq auto-dark-themes &#x27;((wombat) (leuven)))
 3. Adding example configs on README:
 All examples updated!
 You may find the right way of doing your config on macOS, Linux, Windows, Android and Spacemacs, DoomEmacs, use-package, etc. right there!

                              <span>Running into a weird issue with a recent upgrade. So I upgraded from emacs 26 to emacs 28.1 on Ubuntu. Normally, I operate emacs in terminal mode (emacs --daemon, emacsclient -t) using Terminal.app from MacOSX.
 Problem I&#x27;m having is that as of this upgrade, I can no longer paste text into a terminal buffer in char mode. If I cmd-C &quot;hi&quot; and Cmd-v it in a buffer in &#x60;term-mode&#x60; in character mode, the console just freezes up (i.e. all further keys aren&#x27;t doing anything, I can&#x27;t C-x b to get to another buffer, etc.). I have to Ctrl-G to get back control.
 My lossage output looks like
 ESC [ 2 0 0 ~ h i ESC [ 2 0 1 ~
 Which is what I&#x27;d generally expect with terminal shenanigans, and lossage confirms that it invokes &#x60;term--xterm-paste&#x60;. So I tried manually invoking term--xterm-paste and, yep, that freezes up the console too.
 Invoking help on term--xterm-paste doesn&#x27;t give any obvious hints, and it&#x27;s a compiled C function so now I&#x27;m at a bit of a dead-end. Any suggestions for how to debug this further would be much appreciated!
 ETA: confirmed issue is happening with an &#x60;emacs -Q&#x60; run and &#x60;M-x term&#x60; running /bin/bash, so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s my configuration (at least, not my emacs configuration).

                              <span>Hello,
 I&#x27;m developing eee.el to launches excellent terminal user interface tools (such as yazi, fzf, lazy-git, etc.) with Emacs asynchronously.
 https://github.com/eval-exec/eee.el
 By combining Emacs with excellent terminal user interface (TUI) applications, I can achieve the following workflow:
  
Emacs asynchronously launches a terminal application (such as wezterm).
 
In wezterm, I run TUI applications defined in eee.el, such as yazi, ripgrep, fzf.
 
In yazi, I search/preview files, and upon pressing Enter, yazi informs Emacs which file to open and where to navigate.
 
Emacs executes a callback to open the target file specified in yazi.
 
 You can see a screen recording example in the GitHub repository mentioned above.
 What TUI applications would you like to see added? What workflows are you interested in? Feel free to raise an issue or submit a pull request, and I will incorporate them when I see them.
 Can you provide me with some suggestions? What tools do you want to see added? What kind of workflows do you prefer?

                              <span>Hej fellows,
 title basically says it all. I use emacsclient on the regular, with a systemd-Service starting emacs --daemon. I have been wondering why I can&#x27;t use dead keys when using emacs while it works just as intended in about every other program. 
 Deciding to test the issue, I started with emacs -Q, gradually adding more configuration to find the culprit -- only that I was unable to find any, because dead keys would work even with my full configuration. On the other hand, I commented out all my configuration and restarted the systemd-service, only to find that even with practically no configuration, dead keys don&#x27;t work.
 I am puzzled and have no idea how to search for the solution. If you have pointers where I can look to better understand the issue or might even have a solution, I&#x27;d be grateful.
 Have a good day, fellows :)

                              <span>I want to use LSP with single files. For example, I create a HelloWorld.java file in my home directory (~/), and I should be able to see completion suggestions and Flymake tips. However, I tested three different LSP servers (jdtls, Groovy, and Kotlin), and Eglot either crashes with these servers or Emacs itself crashes. I think it&#x27;s a common approach to test something without creating a Git repository or using any build tools. But I cannot find a solution.

 The relevant line in my config is:  (setq initial-buffer-choice &#x27;recentf-open-files)  There is no other part of my config that sets this variable

                              <span>Hi everyone!
 I&#x27;m looking for a way to log and track my running training sessions directly in Emacs. I&#x27;d like to be able to input and organize the following data for each session:
  
Date
 Resting heart rate for the day
 Average / Max heart rate during the session
 Duration of the session
 Type of session (endurance, resistance, etc.)
 etc.
  
Do you know of any tools, packages, or specific setups within Emacs that would allow me to do this? Any suggestions are welcome!
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>My mu4e setup has been working just fine for a while. But ever since I last updated mu (via homebrew, which I used to install version 1.12.6) I keep encountering this problem: after a while (sometimes a few days, sometimes a few hours), my inbox (in &quot;work/inbox&quot;) starts showing up as empty (&quot;No matching messages found&quot;) even though the corresponding directory contains plenty of messages. 
 I can fix this by running mu init and then mu index, but it&#x27;s getting to be quite annoying to have to do this so often. Is anyone else having a similar issue? Any suggestions on what the culprit could be here?

                              <span>I was playing aroung with org-attach features lately, and stumbled upon something that looked weird to me. When using the uuid method to create attachment folders, orgmode uses the first two characters of the uuid to create a first folder, then the rest of the ID to create the actual attachment folder. It fails if using a uuid of less than 2 characters as far as I could test.
 It is not obvious to the eyes, a bit like a phishing site, I noticed it while deleting all attachments on a node, Emacs yes/no prompted me if I wanted to use recursive deletion. I was surprised because I understood that the &#x27;uuid&#x27; method was supposed to store attachments in a flat directory structure named after the node&#x27;s UUID, under the &#x60;org-attach-id-dir&#x60; directory.
 At first, I thought it was a bug (most probably in my config as always), but I could track down the process to this function in charge to generate the folder name:
 (defun org-attach-id-uuid-folder-format (id) &quot;Translate an UUID ID into a folder-path. Default format for how Org translates ID properties to a path for attachments. Useful if ID is generated with UUID.&quot; (and (&lt; 2 (length id)) (format &quot;%s/%s&quot; (substring id 0 2) (substring id 2)))) 
 Looking at this function, the bug theorydoes not stand as it looks very intentional on the developers part. So I am wondering why it was built like that.
 It does not impair the attachment functionalities at all, everything I tested works fine, but first I am curious, and second the way I found out about it bothers me. I wonder if multiple nodes were to share the same first two UUID characters, would they all get their attachment folders deleted by a recursive deletion meant for only one of them ? If yes, I think that would qualify as a bug with data loss on top of that.
 The docstring does not help me understand its purpose any better, so I thought I&#x27;d ask.

 where Allergen is a type and allergies :: Int -&gt; [Allergen]. (How does this pointfree expression work?)
 It’s straightforward to rewrite this function pointfully, but doing so doesn’t help one develope an intuition for thinking about function composition, partially applied, on a higher semantic level. This post is my attempt at helping people develop that high-level intuition.

                              <span>Lambda calculus is the theoretical basis for functional programming languages like Ocaml, Haskell, etc. Therefore it is an interesting topic for me.
 Since Church&#x27;s lambda calculus, Gödel&#x27;s recursive functions and Turing&#x27;s automatic machines are equivalent, I was curious to find the analogue of a universal turing machine expressed in lambda calculus. I have found a quite simple universal lambda term which does the job.
 I have documented the construction of a universal lambda term in this paper.
 It gives a short introduction to lambda calculus. Then it introduces a programming notation for lambda calculus similar to Haskell/Ocaml in order to make lambda calculus more readable for functional programmers.
 In this notation some basic functions for booleans, pairs, numbers and optional values are introduced.
 In order to encode lambda terms the usual Gödel numbering has been avoided. Instead of Gödel numbers the basic idea of algebraic data types has been used.
 Based on the structure of an encoded lambda term, a lambda term is constructed which reduces an encoded lambda term to normal form or loops infinitely in case no normal form exists.

                              <span>We are trying to make Copilot easily available on Mac. For those unaware, Copilot is a runtime verification framework written in Haskell. There&#x27;s no Copilot executable or Copilot compiler as such: Copilot is an EDSL available as a Haskell library, so users still use GHC to compile Copilot modules.
 I assume homebrew is the easiest path, since we cannot add Copilot to Apple&#x27;s App Store without having to add GHC and Cabal as part of the same package, which would be a sizeable effort.
 I&#x27;m struggling to make that happen due to how GHC and cabal create package envs and package DBs. A lot has changed in Cabal and GHC in the last few versions.
 Any help would be really appreciated. A lot of people in aerospace and at NASA use Mac, so this would be really helpful to increase adoption of Copilot.
 If someone more knowledgeable than me can help, you can find a bit more info in this discussion: https://github.com/Copilot-Language/copilot/discussions/537
 Thanks!

                              <span>Initial Scala Native support: The modules kyo-data, kyo-tag, and kyo-prelude are now cross-compiled to Scala Native 0.5.5.
 Batch: A new effect that provides functionality similar to solutions like Haxl/Stitch/ZIO Query to batch operations. The effect can be safely composed with others without a separate monad!
 kyo-prelude: The kyo-prelude module contains the new kernel of the library and a collection of IO-free effects. It&#x27;s a quite complete effect system with mutability only to handle stack safety, tracing, and preemption. Other than that, the entire module is pure without any side effects or IO suspensions, including the effect handling mechanism.
 System: Provides access to system properties, environment variables, and OS-related information. A convenience Parse type class is provided to parse configurations.
 Check: A new effect that provides a mechanism similar to assertions but with customizable behavior, allowing the collection of all failures (Check.runChunk), translation to the Abort effect (Check.runAbort), and discarding of any failures (Check.runDiscard).
 Effect-TS-inspired pipe: The pending type now offers pipe methods that allow chaining multiple transformations into a single pipe call.
 ScalaDocs: The majority of Kyo&#x27;s public APIs now offer ScalaDocs.
 cats-effect integration: The new Cats effect provides integration with cats-effect&#x27;s IO, allowing conversion of computations between the libraries in both directions.
 New Clock APIs: New convenience APIs to track deadlines and measure elapsed time.
 Barrier: An asynchronous primitive similar to Latch to coordinate the rendezvous of multiple fibers.
 Integration with directories-jvm: The Path companion object now provides methods to obtain common paths based on the directories-jvm library: Path.basePaths, Path.userPaths, Path.projectPaths.

                              <span>I know this should be very simple, but for some reason I am stuck.
 I am trying to use this library https://github.com/gwlucastrig/Tinfour when I go to maven I get this set dependency 
 libraryDependencies +&#x3D; &quot;org.tinfour&quot; % &quot;Tinfour&quot; % &quot;2.1.7&quot; 
 I have added it to my sbt, when I check the sbt-tree, I can see it
 [info] +-org.tinfour:tinfour:2.1.7 
 My problem happens when I try to import it to use it in Scala, it fails no matter how I try (upper/lowercase, prefixed with org or no). For these one it says it is not part of org:
 import org.tinfour.* import org.Tinfour.* 
 For these , it simply says not found:
 import tinfour.* import Tinfour.* 
 Any suggestion?

                              <span>Hi everyone!
 I&#x27;ve been working on porting Scapegoat rules to Scala 3 using Scalafix and have currently ported 70 of them, with more of them to come (ideally, all of them). This linter is compatible with Scala 2.13 and Scala 3.
 The linter can detect quite a few bugs and has been tested with unit tests and on a large codebase.
 If you want to use it in your Scala 3 project / contribute, feel free to check out my repo.
 I&#x27;d be happy to get any feedback (positive or not) and potential improvements I could make.

 I&#x27;ve been having some very odd problems with my Org mode configuration and I was hoping somebody here could help out. Apologies for the length of the post, but there&#x27;s a TLDR before I go into my ramblings.
 TLDR: repeating tasks are no longer reset when marked DONE. Instead a CLOSED property is automatically added and they no longer appear in the Agenda for future scheduled dates.
 Below is the code for my Org mode configuration from init.el in its current state:
 ;; Org Mode (use-package org :commands (org-capture org-agenda) :config (setq org-enforce-todo-dependencies t) (setq org-return-follows-link t) (setq org-startup-with-inline-images t) (setq org-image-actual-width &#x27;(300)) (setq org-indent-mode 1) (setq org-agenda-files &#x27;(&quot;~/Documents/org/devices.org&quot; &quot;~/Docu…</span>

                              <span>org-table-sort-lines not sorting these lines correctly.
 Lines starting tsk_ and tskg_ are mixed up when they should be grouped.
 When they are not in the table they are sorted correctly.
  | tsk_description | | tskg_description | | tskg_id | | tskg_name | | tskg_project_id | | tsk_name | | tsk_task_id | | tsk_tskg_id | 
 What could be the problem.
 I have tested it in Org 9.3.8 and 9.5.5 on Emacs 28.2 on Linux and the problem is present on both. I will try in another session to find out why. For now I&#x27;m stumped.

                              <span>Trying to start using emacs, mainly for org. I want to create some org capture templates specific to my game, but ultimately want to be able to easily swap out the file later on once I move to a new project (or for example, I&#x27;m doing a game jam). It&#x27;s telling me the variable is a stringp and thus the wrong type.
 I&#x27;ve defined a variable for the filepath and am trying to. I&#x27;m pretty sure I don&#x27;t even need &#x27;~/org/since /org is my org directory. Here&#x27;s the variable:  (defvar game-directory &quot;~/org/radiant-bricks.org&quot; &quot;Directory for current game project&quot;) &#x60;
 Here&#x27;s the template. I suspect there&#x27;s more syntax errors, but I can figure those out next.
  after! org (add-to-list &#x27;org-capture-templates &#x27;((&quot;g&quot; &quot;Game Dev Todo&quot; entry (file+headline ,game-directory &quot;Tasks&quot;) &quot;** TODO %^{Game Function} [/] /n *** TODO %\\1 Art /n *** TODO %\\1 Code /n *** TODO %\\1 VFX /n %?&quot;)))) 
 I&#x27;ve done some searching, but haven&#x27;t really found much beyond trying to use a backquote or potentially a + I see there&#x27;s a function option, but not sure if I have to go that far just to get the filename.

                              <span>Hello! I saw in few TF+CE projects that programmers split initialization and logic to different HK types, like this:
 def initService[I[_],F[_]]: Resource[I, SomeService[F]] &#x3D; {
 for {
 ....
 someService &lt;- Resource.eval[I, SomeService[F]](SomeService[F]())
 ....
 } yield someService
 }
 I understand why we need a Resource (for gracefull shutdown), but i cant understand why we use different HK types. 
 Is it pattern or we trying to get some special behavior?

                              <span>It seems like a lot of doom and gloom recently in the tech sector and in particular it seems Scala is not as sought after as it used to be. 
 My question is twofold: Do you agree the market is getting progressively harder and finding a solid Scala job is more difficult (Europe market here) 
 And for those who have found Scala difficult to work in due to the market, what is your plan? Do you transition to another language? What languages/jobs do you think are a good transition? 
 I have a Scala job now, but everyone around me has been quite worried and it has rubbed off on me.

                              <span>I don&#x27;t want to revisit the flame wars about optional braces. I respect people who don&#x27;t like using braceless syntax but I personally love using it in Scala 3.
 My question is, Is there any scala syntax that allows you to pass multiple parameters to method calls without having to use open and close parantheses? This would be extremely useful in libraries such as the extremely practical lihaoyi&#x27;s scalatags. For example. Instead of:
  body( div( h1(id:&#x3D;&quot;title&quot;, &quot;This is a title&quot;), p(&quot;This is a big paragraph of text&quot;)&#x60; ) ) 
 If there is some syntax which denotes the indented lines are parameters, maybe something like
  body ~ div ~ h1(id :&#x3D; &quot;title&quot;, &quot;This is a title&quot;) p(&quot;This is a big paragraph of text&quot;) 
 In this case the ~ indicates that the following indented region is a set of parameters, so we don&#x27;t even have put commas after each parameter.
 I haven&#x27;t thought through this completely, so there might be flaws in this approach, but till now I haven&#x27;t been able to think of big issues except for ~ probably being used in some libraries already.

                              <span>Let&#x27;s face it: GNU Emacs is old. It was once a complete rewrite of Emacs. However, It was made for a very different world from the world today. I believe it&#x27;s time for another rewrite. I was brainstorming about some of the features this so-called rewrite needs: 1. Client-Server Architecture: Although Emacs has a client mode, it&#x27;s not meant to use with a server on another computer. 2. GPU Acceleration: This is the new cool trend. :) 3. Safe Multithreading: While Elisp provides facilities for multithreading, they&#x27;re practically useless because there is no grantee for a thread to give the process back. 4. Proper GUI Library: And better mouse support. It&#x27;s also impossible to write good GUI code for Emacs due to threading issues. 5. Image-based: This is also cool. Imagine installing an Emacs distribution just by installing an image. 6. Elisp Support: We need to keep it backwards compatible.
 Please share your thoughts. Thank you.

C-c C-c creates a png. When I open it I just see a grey area.
 C-c C-x C-l shows the preview content of the Tikz picture is done. I don&#x27;t see it.
 Tikz pictures inside \[ \] is converted into a different format. Nothing is shown.
  
What am I missing ?

                              <span>Hi everyone 👋
 Yesterday, we had a guest drop into one of the emacs channels on IRC and he was saying how Emacs should be better at some things (but wouldn&#x27;t give any concrete examples). It was all a bit stupid and we&#x27;ve all heard this before. But it did get me thinking this morning that I do have some questions about Emacs. Keep in mind that I&#x27;m a non-dev and some answers may be obvious to those who are but they aren&#x27;t to me. 🙃
 1) Why can&#x27;t we actually get multithreading built into Emacs? I don&#x27;t really understand why not. Could somebody please explain?
 2) I was looking at iTerm and Kitty (I use them both but rarely). I mostly use vterm in emacs and I was wondering: would it be really hard to get emacs using GPU acceleration? I know that all GPUs are different and Emacs needs to run o…</span>

I use the pattern below to alter process-environment in some directories, but when I tried it with vterm it doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything to vterm-environment or the environment variables in a vterm started within the tree. 
 I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m missing something obvious.

 Noob here. I&#x27;m using the native Emacs app on Windows and experiencing issues with font rendering. Certain letters and numbers appear as squares, which I assume is related to Unicode characters.
 I&#x27;m currently using JetBrains Mono, but I&#x27;ve also tried Ubuntu and Fira CodeFont with similar results. Some specific characters aren&#x27;t rendering correctly, as shown in the image below.
 I initially thought it might be a font support issue, but the same exact setup works fine on my Linux laptop. Any suggestions or troubleshooting tips would be greatly appreciated.

                              <span>Using evil mode on a DEC VT100 terminal has the odd behavior of not being able to meta-x. Without evil mode, I&#x27;m able to meta-x by holding escape and pressing x. With evil mode, escape works correctly to enter or exit insert mode, but it if I M-x it simply seems to recognize the &quot;x&quot; and deletes a character most of the time.
 Is there a recommended mitigation to this that doesn&#x27;t involve remapping?

 {-# LANGUAGE DataKinds #-} {-# LANGUAGE GADTs #-} {-# LANGUAGE TypeFamilies #-} data Type_ &#x3D; TInt | TBool data Expr :: Type_ -&gt; Type where ConstInt :: Int -&gt; Expr &#x27;TInt GreaterThan :: Expr &#x27;TInt -&gt; Expr &#x27;TInt -&gt; Expr &#x27;TBool ConstBool :: Bool -&gt; Expr &#x27;TBool typeof :: Expr t -&gt; Type_ -- I assume this needs to change, but how? typeof (ConstInt _) &#x3D; TInt typeof (GreaterThan _ _) &#x3D; TBool typeof (ConstBool _) &#x3D; TBool toBool :: Expr a -&gt; Expr &#x27;TBool toBool e &#x3D; case typeof e of TBool -&gt; e -- This is illegal, e is not Expr &#x27;TBool TInt -&gt; GreaterThan e $ ConstInt 0 
 I assume the signature of typeof needs to be something like Expr t -&gt; t, but that doesn&#x27;t seem to be allowed, since t has kind Type_, not kind Type.
 I DON&#x27;T want to match on the Expr itself, because that would mean way more work throughout my codebase. But I&#x27;m open to other solutions apart from data kinds and typeof.

Behaviour changes on flag day by Tom Ellis
At work (Groq) we recently upgraded the version of GHC that we use from 8.10 to 9.6, along with many of the Haskell packages we depend on. I wrote about the changes to our code that this required in “Upgrading from GHC 8.10 to GHC 9.6 – an experience report”. That article touches on the risks associated with being forced to make many changes at once: if a problem occurs it can be hard to diagnose and it can be hard to fix. After that article was written I discovered that such a problem, albeit a benign one, had occurred. The present article expl…</span>

Good news for you: formal methods have never been easier to leverage.
In this post, I will discuss the contributions I made during my internship to
Liquid Haskell (LH), a tool that makes proving that your
Haskell code is correct a piece of cake.
LH lets you write contracts for your functions inside your Haskell code. In other
words, you write pre-conditions (what must be true when you call it)
and post-conditions (what must always be true when you leave the
function). These are then fed
into an SMT solver that proves your code satisfies them! You may have to
write a few lemmas to guide LH, but it makes verification easier than
proving them completely in a proof assistant.
My contributions enhance the reflection mechanism, which…</span>

 Using helm as an example it would be a matter of typing C a to remove or add items to the list.

                              <span>Hi all, I have been using emacs for a few months (and loving it!), and I have recently run into some small trouble that I am not able to figure out. I was using emacs 27.1 all this which installed through apt, and needing a newer version of emacs, I recently installed emacs 29.4 through snap (and now through ppa). Some things broke, but with some time, I was able to get all my packages working again as I want them to. The main problem I am trying to solve now is this:
 Before, when I wanted to open a file or dired, I would just press &#x27;C-x C-f&#x27; or &#x27;C-x d&#x27; and the minibuffer would open with the path of the current buffer from where I have called the &#x27;find file&#x27; command. Then if I wanted to navigate to some other directory, I could just press backspace and go about finding the specific file I wanted. Now, with the new emacs I have (I have tried this with snap and it&#x27;s the same now with ppa), when I enter the minibuffer with &#x27;C-x C-f&#x27; and press backspace to go to the parent directories, it no longer deletes the text and gives the message &quot;Text is read only.&#x27; A similar problem I faced today was with mu4e, for which the attachment directory was set to &#x27;Downloads&#x27; folder. But I wanted to attach a file that was located in another folder, and when I tried to navigate in the minibuffer after calling the attach function &#x27;C-c C-a&#x27;, I was not able to move outside of the &quot;Downloads folder&#x27; and was getting the same message again. What I want is to be able to navigate through all directories in my home folder when I call these functions in any buffer. What is the problem and how do I go about solving it?
 I&#x27;d be grateful for some help with this. I don&#x27;t particularly understand code, and have been using emacs mainly for humanities research, and it has worked well for me. I am on Pop OS 22.04. Thanks!

                              <span>Hello! I recently switched from Debian to Devuan and I was wondering if anyone has a working init script for launching this as a user, I have looked at the Emacs Wiki Daemon and while they have some examples they do not work as expected, they do start the process as my user but for some reason when I use emacsclient -c it doesn&#x27;t find the socket. Right now I am using my wm to launch the server but I&#x27;d like to control it/restart it with sudo service, Thanks!

                              <span>The simple answer to that is the The 5 Monkeys Experiment.
 Political issues about software freedom, expanding Emacs beyond its role as a text editor and unwillingness to link directly with other programs and libraries even if they were GNU programs and libraries are the reason why.
 Emacs was a TUI program when the world began to switch to 50 years ago, and without modules and FFI Elisp utilities and programs were not going to get the graphics UIs that the world began to switch to back then.
 Other than Rust aficionados who develops TUI programs for the masses these days, assuming they are even for the masses?
 Emacs only got modules in 2017 with Emacs 25 and an FFI has been languishing on some Emacs core developer&#x27;s personal repo for reasons only God knows.
 Modules and FFI are the ladder for pushing Elisp beyond the TUI interfaces of Emacs, and the monkeys got drenched when they tried to use them. Actually they didn&#x27;t get drenched. They were not given the option at all and got used to not having them.
 The former is here now though having gone for years with them, they are not really missed. 
 Why would folks come up with the Python based Emacs Application Framework or the Javascript based Emacs-NG if the policies had been different years ago?
 Isn&#x27;t Elisp older than both languages?
 PS. What is the traditional way Emacs uses to connect to external programs called?

                              <span>Hi all, doing my weekly GTD review in Doom emacs right now. This is generating my usual &quot;how the hell do I do X Y or Z&quot; queries.
 Today&#x27;s is Avy. I&#x27;m trying to follow Karthinks How To Avy. Purely in order to speed up keboard navigation of a large org-file. 
 However, I am struggling to understand one thing, and to debug another. 
  
When I avy-goto-char-timer via M-x all is fine.
 When I use the keybind highlighted in the M-x menu (SPC g s /) then I get as far as SPC g s then the buffer reads &quot;here is not changed!!&quot; - I suspect this is because I&#x27;m using someone else&#x27;s config (Doom).
 With Avy I&#x27;d like to search the whole buffer for character patterns - but I can&#x27;t fathom how to cycle to offscreen options (maybe I&#x27;m using Avy wrong and need to isearch instead?)
  
Am I doing this all wrong?

                              <span>I frequently update my Windows Emacs using the latest build here[1], but recently the .exe binary release is no longer available. Instead, the emacs-04cfac4-ucrt-x86_64.msix package is being offered.
 I did some research, but it seems that MSIX packages cannot be installed on older versions of Windows, such as Windows 10. Is this correct? I would appreciate any help in installing the package on Windows 10.

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I&#x27;m trying to make my Scala code available publicly using the sbt-github-packages plugin. I followed the setup instructions and everything seems fine. My package appears on GitHub, and I was able to import and compile it in a test project.
 Here&#x27;s the output showing the package being recognized:
 $ sbt dependencyTree [info] welcome to sbt 1.10.1 (GraalVM Community Java 22.0.2) ... [info] default:mon-projet_2.13:0.1.0-SNAPSHOT [S] [info] +-blob:quadedgetriangulation_2.13:1.2 [S] [success] Total time: 0 s, completed Sep 11, 2024, 5:33:25 PM 
 However, I&#x27;m encountering an issue where sbt (and VSCode Metals) can&#x27;t resolve any classes or objects from my library. I&#x27;m starting to wonder if I&#x27;m building the library incorrectly.
 Here&#x27;s my repo: BlobTrigDelauVoro
 And I&#x27;m using this sbt plugin: sbt-github-packages
 Any advice or tips would be greatly appreciated!
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Hi, I mentioned some time ago that I wanted to write a small library to handle cartographic concepts. The basic concepts are Latitude and Longitude, that are a refinement of squats Angle.
 type Longitude &#x3D; Longitude.Type object Longitude extends Newtype[Angle]: override inline def validate(value: Angle): TypeValidation &#x3D; if (value.toDegrees &gt;&#x3D; -180.0 &amp;&amp; value.toDegrees &#x3D; -90.0 &amp;&amp; value.toDegrees &lt; 90.0) true else &quot;Latitude must be between -90.0 and 90.0&quot; 
 The idea is to prevent people like myself from swapping the coordinates when doing operations. A latitude is a latitude, a…</span>

 I understand it&#x27;s usefulness from an academic perspective, understanding the similarities between different types of recursive algorithms and their common patterns, but in practice, it just seems kind of... pointless?
 For example with cata, I still have to either write a TypeF by hand or use templatehaskell to generate the boilerplate for me, and what&#x27;s gained from it seems relatively minimal. Not only is the code longer, it&#x27;s more confusing to anyone not acquainted with this specific topic. On top of that, the example showing that it automatically inserts the missing fmap seems to be trivially caught by the type checker anyway. So I&#x27;m really not seeing what we gain here.
 I&#x27;m not not ripping on this particular library or it&#x27;s author at all, I think it&#x27;s worthwhile to explore topics like this, but as anything other than a mental exercise I struggle to see what the benefit is in practice. Personally I don&#x27;t understand what the aversion is to explicit recursion when the algorithm you&#x27;re writing calls for it. For other complicated ideas born out of Haskell like lenses I can immediately see the utility that outweighs any added complexity. Am I missing something here?

 (My use case was just to make emitting to markdown files easier, for storing in local knowledge bases or post-conversion to pdf or other mischief; fiddling with ox- exporters always blew up on my due to the ID based linking in org-roam; I know there are workarounds for that, but it all seemed painful and WIP)
 When run (tweak the first line for your own python interpreter btw) you point it to a source-dir and a dest-dir, and optionally specify if you want to convert along the way. I did not test much, and certainly didn&#x27;t test using the same path for source and de…</span>

 What is the general mechanism for a graphics program to be created in Emacs:
  
By Emacs interfacing into some graphics library or its graphics drawing system and drawing the window by itself
 
Having the graphical window created by an external app, embedded in an Emacs frame, but controlled by functionality exposed to an Emacs module.
 
By another program creating a window and having Emacs embed it in a frame, and enabling Emacs to manipulate it through some RPC mechanism?
 
 Emacs Application Framework seems to use Option 3, but I&#x27;m not so sure.
 1 and 2 are my interest though. Which Emacs packages are examples of these.

 There is the option to use the customize dialog to select a new one, but is there a tool that enables you to change the attributes further, ie a tool that enable changing of the font attributes here:
  Family: unspecified Foundry: unspecified Width: unspecified Height: unspecified Weight: unspecified Slant: italic Foreground: #808080 DistantForeground: unspecified Background: unspecified Underline: unspecified Overline: unspecified Strike-through: unspecified Box: unspecified Inverse: unspecified Stipple: unspecified Font: unspecified Fontset: unspecified Extend: unspecified Inherit: unspecified 
 PS. What is the syntax for setting a face color in a use-package :custom section.
 I prefer use-package :custom for the customization dialog.

                              <span>Hi all,
 Google recently announced the removal of the “Less Secure Apps” feature. While I can switch to App passwords for my personal Gmail accounts, my school accounts have 2FA disabled, which leaves me without that option.
 Has anyone successfully set up OAuth with OfflineIMAP? If so, could you share your experience, guidelines, settings, or any advice on the process?
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Have any one figured out how to setup lsp mode for arduino language server? There are related posts in the subreddit but none have a definitive answer. I am trying to setup arduino lsp for esp32 boards and I am facing the issue that the server starts but there are no lsp features available.
 I have the following lsp mode configuration:
 (add-to-list &#x27;lsp-language-id-configuration &#x27;(arduino-mode . &quot;arduino&quot;)) (lsp-register-client (make-lsp-client :new-connection (lsp-stdio-connection &#x27;(&quot;arduino-language-server&quot; &quot;-clangd&quot; &quot;/usr/bin/clangd&quot; &quot;-fqbn&quot; &quot;esp32:esp32:esp32s3&quot;)) :activation-fn (lsp-activate-on &quot;arduino&quot;) ;; :major-modes &#x27;&quot;arduino&quot; :server-id &#x27;arduino-language-server)) (add-hook &#x27;arduino-mode-hook &#x27;lsp) 
 And the arduino language server buffer provides the following logs:

                              <span>I am not sure if the emacs flatpak is a tui or a gui. If it is a tui that might be why I can not see images in the konsole terminal. 
 I am not sure if I would be able to see images using a terminal that supports images. If the flatpak emacs is a gui, is it missing a a dependency to view images ?
 [Edit: SOLVED The problem was that I had set the flatpak on flathub to use wayland instead of x11 which led that flatpak to open emacs in the terminal]

                              <span>[ Arch Linux, GNU Emacs 29.4 (build 1, x86_64-pc-linux-gnu, GTK+ Version 3.24.42, cairo version 1.18.0) ]
 I have a file containing all short lines, some of which have a lot of vertical space between them. When I move to the end of such a line, the blue box (in my case) showing the cursor position, suddenly jumps into a rectangle one character wide but about 5 lines high. It&#x27;s no good deleting this - which then joins the two lines into one - and putting in a new return, as the problem immediately comes back.
 I&#x27;ve never seen this before, and I have no idea either what&#x27;s causing it, or how I can remove it. Note that when I check the file in a terminal with a standard textfile viewer such as more or less, the file shows as it should, that is, without those large spacings. 
 How can I remove those spacings? Many thanks.

                              <span>Now, we split the distribution into two sets of artifacts:
  
 
&#x60;dotty-cps-async&#x60; for current scala version 3.5.0
 
&#x60;dotty-cps-async-lts&#x60; for users of scala-lts 3.3.3
 
  
Now it is possible to use await as an extension method (thanks, u/cornerman )
 
Multithreaded scala-native 0.5 is supported.

                              <span>I might get down voted to oblivion but I often hear how people use emacs for everything, spreadsheets, time tracking, note taking, task management but genuinely, is there not better alternative individual apps for these things? 
 Spreadsheets &#x3D; Excel or google sheets, its faster and supports better formulas.
 Time tracking &#x3D; Toggl Track
 Task management &#x3D; todoist, its better on mobile.
 Note taking &#x3D; Obsidian (better mobile app)
 what&#x27;s the appeal with everything being in one app?

Can you suggest, is there any rest client extensions for emacs, and what is your favourite tool to make http request, preferred in text style way.

 If you don&#x27;t know what it is:
 A simple, fast, asynchronous, customizable display, highlight all lines with the same commit information, view of git blame commit in Emacs.
 I think git blame is most useful in four ways:
  
author
 date
 time
 commit
  
So I extracted them and let the user choose how to display them.
 Provides global variables to let users choose how to display them:
  
emsg-blame–commit-author
 emsg-blame–commit-date
 emsg-blame–commit-summary
  
Users can use any display frame, such as message, posframe, overlay, popup.

                              <span>I know that the topic of multi-threaded emacs has come up a lot in the past, with the main objection being that emacs has a ton of global state that would be impossible to make safe.
 However, I have not seen a compelling argument as to why we can&#x27;t have multi-threaded garbage collection. I saw Julia has recently implemented this (relevant pr), and I struggle to see why something like this would be impossible for emacs.
 It seems that general emacs multi-threading is becoming less of an issue now, as emacs can offload a lot of workloads to asynchronous processes (LSPs, vterms, latemk, git, etc. all running asynchronously). This means that emacs is actually becoming more and more effectively multi-threaded. The downside of all this asynchronicity is that a lot of these programs communicate large amounts of data back to emacs (especially LSPs) creating a lot of garbage.
 Personally, I use gcmh-mode setting gcmh-high-cons-threshold to 10GB in order to avoid triggering the garbage collector often. Occasionally, I will get a 5-10 second freeze when GC is running on the full 10GB. I have CPU support for 20 threads, so I would imagine that multi-threaded GC would reduce the freezes to maybe 1 sec, which is a lot more reasonable.

 Firstly, I don&#x27;t understand why the repo&#x27;s releases don&#x27;t have an actual binary, but whatever, I&#x27;m sure they have some reason. 
 However, when I add c-sharp to treesit-language-source-alist and call treesit-install-language-grammar, I get messages that the repo is being cloned and built, but after it&#x27;s done and has put the binary in ~/.emacs.d/tree-sitter, I get an error about not being able to find the library when I try to enabled csharp-ts-mode. Specifically:
  Warning (treesit): Cannot activate tree-sitter, because language grammar for c-sharp is unavailable (not-found): (libtree-sitter-c-sharp.so libtree-sitter-c-sharp.so.0 libtree-sitter-c-sharp.so.0.0 libtree-sitter-c-sharp.dylib libtree-sitter-c-sharp.dylib.0 libtree-sitter-c-sharp.dylib.0.0) No such file or directory 
 This is really confusing. I can see the file right there.

 I leave an awkward image here to illustrate it:

 Any hint? thank you!

                              <span>I have been going in circles for I d not know how long. I am trying out a few ideas to buils new capture templates and this template just won&#x27;t work:
 (&quot;k&quot; &quot;Task&quot; entry (id &quot;58bb31db-d4cf-468b-9bf4-ae820157fbad&quot;) &quot;* TODO %?&quot;) (&quot;k&quot; &quot;Task&quot; entry (id &#x27;58bb31db-d4cf-468b-9bf4-ae820157fbad) &quot;* TODO %?&quot;) (&quot;k&quot; &quot;Task&quot; entry (id 58bb31db-d4cf-468b-9bf4-ae820157fbad) &quot;* TODO %?&quot;) 
 &#x60;debug-on-error&#x60; does not start thh debugger, and I always get a &#x27;wrong type argument stringp&#x27; message. This message is the reason why I experimented passing the ID in different ways. The three variations above have the same behavior:
  
The capture buffer does not pop up
 
The correct entry matching provided ID is found,
 
&quot;* TODO %?&quot; is litterally inserted under it.
 
 I would expect this template to behave like all other templates where I use &quot;%?&quot;, which is popping up the capture buffer with the cursor where &quot;%?&quot; is, let me edit the entry, then insert it after I hit &#x60;C-c C-c&#x60;.
 What am I missing here ?
 Thanks for your time.

                              <span>As the title says--
 Suppose I create a .org document and tag some sections as :noexport:. If I understand correctly, those sections will not show up in the exported file, .pdf or .html.
 Suppose I also want to export a file that includes those sections. Rather than deleting each tag one by one, is there a way to globally either delete all :noexport: tags or simply ask the program to ignore those tags? (the latter would be the best for me because I still want to keep those tags for later use)

 Sleep (6+hrs) [x] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [0/0]
 Yoga [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]
 Exercise [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]
 Evening routine [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]
 Journaling [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]
 The squares and columns correpond to week days. At present I have to manually input the &quot;x&quot; into the square to make it look like a checked check-box. That is inconvenient. What&#x27;s more, I am also liking the statistics cookies functionality, but I also end up updating it manually.
 Is there a way to get something similar to this visual layout working, where the squares are actual working checkboxes and statistics cookies would update automatically, as they should?

 isAllergicTo :: Allergen -&gt; Int -&gt; Bool &#x60;&#x60; Given the above type definitions, my initial implementation ofisAllergicTo&#x60; was as follows:
  isAllergicTo allergen score &#x3D; allergen &#x60;elem&#x60; allergies score 
 However, pointfree.io tells me that this can be simplified to:  isAllergicTo &#x3D; (. allergies) . elem 
 I&#x27;ve inspected the types of . elem and (. allergies) in the REPL, but having a hard time seeing how the two fit. I&#x27;m on my phone, so, unable to post those types now, but will edit if required.
 Can someone explain it to me please?

                              <span>Several years ago I settled on using stack when having fun coding in Haskell on my Mac. I am now starting to use Replit.com online IDE for Haskell (and a few other languages).
 I have found it to be faster building and running code just using cabal to build and run (all my personal Haskell projects have stack.yml and *.cabal files). Does anyone have any idea why using stack is slowing things down for me? This doesn&#x27;t make sense to me.
 Given that I already have valid stack.yml and *.cabal files, it only took me a few minutes to get back to using cabal directly.
 It has been a long time since I reviewed using stack vs. not using stack.

 data ABC f &#x3D; ABC&#x27; { x :: f Text, y :: f Text } deriving (Generic) instance FromJSON (ABC Identity) where parseJSON &#x3D; genericParseJSON defaultOptions instance FromJSON (ABC Maybe) where parseJSON &#x3D; genericParseJSON defaultOptions instance Show (ABC Identity) where show &#x3D; show 
 The above code compiles without any issues ,
 However at runtime, it is able to neither decode to ABC Identity or ABC Maybe type nor able to show the constructed type
 What is it that I am doing wrong here ?

                              <span>Hi, I am learning about Haskell exceptions. I read that when catching exceptions, there is no distinction between normal exceptions and asynchronous exceptions. I have written the following code, but it does not seem to work.
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;hs import Test.Hspec import Control.Exception import Control.Concurrent import Control.Monad
 data MySyncException &#x3D; MySyncException String
 deriving instance Eq MySyncException deriving instance Show MySyncException instance Exception MySyncException
 data MyAsyncException &#x3D; MyAsyncException String
 deriving instance Eq MyAsyncException deriving instance Show MyAsyncException instance Exception MyAsyncException
 forkThread :: IO () -&gt; IO ((ThreadId, MVar ())) forkThread action &#x3D; do var  putMVar var ()) pure (t, var)
 spec :: Spec spec &#x3D; do describe &quot;try&quot; $ do it &quot;catch a sync exception&quot; $ do e &lt;- try @MySyncException $ do void $ throwIO (MySyncException &quot;foo&quot;) pure &quot;bar&quot; e shouldBe (Left (MySyncException &quot;foo&quot;))
  it &quot;catch an async exception&quot; $ do (t, var) &lt;- forkThread $ do e &lt;- try @MyAsyncException $ do threadDelay 5_000_000 pure &quot;bar&quot; e &#x60;shouldBe&#x60; (Left (MyAsyncException &quot;bar&quot;)) -- let (Left ex) &#x3D; e -- void $ throwIO ex -- rethrow throwTo t (MyAsyncException &quot;foo&quot;) -- wait for the thread void $ takeMVar var 
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 The throwTo terminates my child thread and the false assertion e shouldBe (Left (MyAsyncException &quot;bar&quot;)) does not run.
 Thanks

                              <span>I&#x27;m happy to announce heftia-effects, a new extensible effects library for Haskell: https://github.com/sayo-hs/heftia.
 This library aims to provide users with predictable behavior when working with higher-order effects. It offers consistent continuation-based semantics similar to those found in the eff library. For reference, see &quot;The effect system semantics zoo.&quot;
 One of its notable features is the ability to combine higher-order effects with delimited continuations, which works on a standard GHC.
 Key Features:
  
Continuations &amp; Higher-Order Effects: Effects that require multi-shot delimited continuations, such as NonDet and coroutines, work seamlessly with higher-order effects.
 Purity: Built on a Freer-based system that does not rely on the IO monad, this library avoids the use of unsafePerformIO and similar functions. As a result, it can handle not only monadic but also applicative effectful programs.
  
For an in-depth explanation of how this library works, check out: Higher-Order Effects Done Right: How the Heftia Extensible Effects Library Works - Sayo-hs Blog.

                              <span>In this post, I looked for pointers on how to implement a function that can replace any case expression using GHC.Generics. This function will work the same as maybe and either but for any type.
 I managed to replicate either and maybe&#x27;s behavior, which is promising for the project, but I got stuck on the product type instance. Does anyone know how to properly write it? I&#x27;m pretty sure this should be the implementation:
 gCase (x :*: y) &#x3D; \f -&gt; f (gCase x) (gCase y)
 It makes sense that some function should be provided to combine the two types of the product type, but I couldn&#x27;t make it type check. I don&#x27;t know what the types in the instance declaration should be.
 Another problem is that I absolutely wrecked type inference so I have to declare the type of every expression I use. I imagine…</span>

Considering that you cna run elisp on mobile, there shouldnt be an issue for there to be mobile type packages right? For example, if we look at obsidian, they make plugins that add gui buttons which make commands easier to press since you dont have to open the command pallete, will this be something coming to emacs mobile?

 I&#x27;m an Emacs beginner, and I often hear about packages like Ivy, Vertico, and Helm that are &quot;completion frameworks&quot;. As I understand it, they help you seqrch for things like commands and buffer names in the minibuffer faster. But is that all they do? And if I&#x27;m a beginner with no bias, what is a framework that would work for me? Willing to learn if the documentation is easy to understand.

                              <span>I’m running into a weird issue and could use some advice.
 When I call a function or alias using M-x shell-command,
 I get shell errors that don’t occur when I run the same commands directly in my terminal.
 Here’s what I’m encountering:
 /home/ychaouche/.bashrc_custom: line 267: syntax error near unexpected token &#x60;(&#x27; /home/ychaouche/.bashrc_custom: line 267: &#x60; +([0-9]))&#x27; /home/ychaouche/.bashrc_custom: line 267: syntax error near unexpected token &#x60;(&#x27; /home/ychaouche/.bashrc_custom: line 267: &#x60; +([0-9]))&#x27; Thu Aug 22 09:34 
 The strange part?
 The function or alias still executes correctly,
 and I get the expected output (e.g., the date).
 But these error messages only show up when running the command from Emacs.
 I suspect the culprit might be related to extended globbing (extglob) since I’m using +([0-9])) in my script.
 From what I gathered here[1],
 it looks like enabling extended globbing with shopt -s extglob could solve the problem.
 I tried and added it at the top of my .bashrc_custom file,
 but then emacs freezes entirely when I try to run anything via shell-command,
 until I cancel it with C-g.
 So my question is:
 Where should I set shopt -s extglob so that M-x shell-command picks it up properly?
 Any pointers or best practices would be greatly appreciated!
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Basically, I want to press control D in multi-vterm or type exit and have the entire window close, just like it was normal terminal emulator. I don&#x27;t want it to close if there is another window open though. The ideal solution would be to allow C-x 4 0 to close the sole window/frame, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s possible. Has anyone done something like this?

Not that note cards are expensive, of course, but it is irritating. What should one do then? Leave the duplicate note? Annotate the first note with the fact that you had this idea again?

                              <span>Hi all,
 I give presentations using handouts rather than slides. I wonder if there is any way to create &quot;notes&quot; in ordinary .pdf files similar to notes in Beamer. What I mean is that I can create one single .org file with notes, and I can export to two versions of .pdf files, one without my notes and one with them.
 Thank you for your help!

                              <span>I’ve been playing around with the cooperative threading implementation in Emacs, and noticed that on C-g non-main threads are getting killed (whether or not they’re active).
 This means that normal usage (which, at least for me, often involves invoking C-g to switch what I’m doing) will constantly be killing background threads, either in the middle of important work or while waiting for some event to occur.
 How can we use the Emacs threading implementation in a manner that doesn’t fall prey to this issue?

                              <span>TLDR: How to have C-h commands open both the default Help page and the Helpful page?
 I love the Helpful help pages from the &#x27;helpful&#x27; package.. However sometimes I just want the more simple default help page. After I have invoked a help/describe- page I would like to be able to easily switch between these two versions of the help page. Either by opening them both and then being able to switch buffers or maybe in some other ingenious way.
 Any suggestion? 😊
 This is the relevant config I have at the moment (some may recognize it from the &#x27;emacs from scratch&#x27; series)
 :
 (use-package helpful
 :custom
 (counsel-describe-function-function #&#x27;helpful-callable)
 (counsel-describe-variable-functionn #&#x27;helpful-variable)
 :bind
 ([remap describe-function] . counsel-describe-function)
 ([remap describe-command] . helpful-command)
 ([remap describe-variable] . counsel-describe-variable)
 ([remap describe-key] . helpful-key)
 )

                              <span>Hello guys,
 I&#x27;ve tried Googling and trying to find other Reddit posts but I&#x27;m completely baffled as to why Emacs is not loading my init.el file.
 I&#x27;ve tried making an &#x60;.emacs&#x60; folder and an &#x60;.emacs.d&#x60; folder, neither of which is loading my init.el file on startup. I&#x27;ve been creating the folders in &#x60;C:\Users\laneb\&#x60;
 I&#x27;ve also tried running &quot;(message &quot;%s&quot; (getenv &quot;HOME&quot;))&quot; in the minibuffer which outputs &quot;C:\\Users\\laneb\\AppData\\Roaming&quot; which I thought was its home directory, so I created a &#x60;.emacs.d/init.el&#x60; file and folder and that doesn&#x27;t work either.
 At this point I&#x27;m completely lost as to what I should try next. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

                              <span>Same product:
 blamer
 On Windows display commit frequent display failure.
 sideline-blame
 No maintenance for too long, too slow.
 So I made an &#x60;emsg-blame&#x60; that is as simple and fast as possible and uses asynchronous.
 I think git blame is most useful in four ways:
  
author
 date
 time
 commit
  
So I extracted them and let the user choose how to display them.
 Provides global variables to let users choose how to display them:
  
emsg-blame–commit-author
 emsg-blame–commit-date
 emsg-blame–commit-summary
  
Users can use any display frame, such as message, posframe, overlay, popup.

 I made the appropriate property changes and added the PasswordAuthentication() method in the scala app for java mail, but I keep getting errors when calling Transport.send().
 Im not plugged into the scala community, so I wanted to ask if there is some kind of compatibility issue between versions of scala and java mail?
 Error: Failure attempting to convert connection to TLS Received fatal alert protocol version SSLHandshakeException: Received fatal alert protocol_version
 Scala 2.12.17 Java 11 Java Mail 1.6.2
 Appreciate any help!

 My main concern is how can I use the IO monad (zio or cats effect) in java.
 Is this possible or am I just better off learning new libraries for the scala ecosystem?

 I think I made the mistake of using haskell-stack back when... probably want to transition to good ol cabal.

 I&#x27;m working on a little turn-based game implementation in Haskell, primarily as a learning exercise, and I&#x27;m trying to focus as much as possible on leveraging the type system to make invalid states and values unrepresentable. Forgive me as I try to elide as much unnecessary detail as possible, to get at the core of my question.
 Here&#x27;s some types:

                              <span>ChatGPT failed to handle this.
 Can the case expression be replaced with a generic function? The function accepts an ADT value and a function for each of its possible variants, combining all the variants&#x27; values to some type.
 My motives are just fun and learning.
 The standard library already has maybe and either for this, but I want one function to work for any ADT.
 In the case of this datatype:
 data MyData &#x3D; NoArgs | MyInt Int | MyTwoStrings String String 
 It should have type: MyData -&gt; a -&gt; (Int -&gt; a) -&gt; (String -&gt; String -&gt; a) -&gt; a
 So overall, the function should behave like this:
 caseOf Nothing 0 (+3) &#x3D;&#x3D; 0 caseOf (Just 4) 0 (+3) &#x3D;&#x3D; 7 caseOf (MyInt 4) 0 (+3) ++ &#x3D;&#x3D; 7 caseOf (MyTwoStrings &quot;hello&quot; &quot;world&quot;) 0 (+3) (++) &#x3D;&#x3D; &quot;hello world&quot; 
 This stackoverflow answer mentions church encoding and implemented it in a library, but it wouldn&#x27;t compile for me
 Bonus: have the actual value be the last argument. For the above example, the type should be:
 a -&gt; (Int -&gt; a) -&gt; (String -&gt; String -&gt; a) -&gt; MyData -&gt; a

                              <span>Scala is still very complex for me. I don&#x27;t have a problem with the OO part of it, as I had many years working with mainstream languages. All the concepts of traits, the functions, pattern matching, etc.. this is all good. But I&#x27;m really STRUGGLING with anything related to for comprehensions, either, option, etc... Sometimes I need to do something really simple, like getting a value from the database, do some verifications, and then present to the user. But the code is full of &#x60;.eitherT().liftT().left()....&#x60;, it&#x27;s really really hard to understand what is happening.
 Most of the code base that I&#x27;m seeing is based on scalaz, but other parts of the stack is on akka/play, and there are a few cats as well.
 Any tips or suggestions on how to get better at this part? Books? Courses?

 On next Monday, 9th of September at 2PM CEST, I will be hosting another Scala Space Podcast episode. This time I will be joined by Olivier Melois, principal engineer working at Disney+ and the author of Smithy4s tool. Our discussion will regard the general concept of IDLs, how Smithy compares to alternatives and how to use it to improve productivity in your organisation. 
 The podcast will be streamed live on YouTube and Twitch so you can join and comment or ask questions in the chat, as usual.

                              <span>I don&#x27;t have lots of experience on JVM tuning but scares me to death the fact that here at the company that I&#x27;m working on everyone is just copying and pasting the settings blindingly from service to service without ever thinking why it was there. For example, the most common thing I see is setting the min memory higher than the auto scaling threshold, so on the first deploy, the service scales to the max and stays there forever.

                              <span>I&#x27;m a seasoned Java dev (15+ years of work experience). I started working in Scala a couple of years ago and I&#x27;m still grinding my way out of the learning phase.
 In my Java days, I had a few newsletters (from JavaCodeGeek, Dzone, JacaCodeRanch, etc.) I got plenty of input, tutorials, and learning stuff.
 Is there anything available for Scala? I already subscribed to Scala Times.

 I don&#x27;t have and I don&#x27;t want to pay for a Medium subscription.

                              <span>I know, I know. I have an old Asus x200ca that I would like to boot up in console mode, pretty much as a pure emacs laptop. If I run &#x27;M-x list-colors&#x27;, I get eight colors listed. Is there by any chance a dark theme I can use that might look nice? 
 Another question: I have some commands I want to run on init but only in console mode. Is there a way to check for this in the .emacs file?

                              <span>Emacs newbie here. I&#x27;m using Vertico + Consult setup for my minibuffer completion system. I am confused on why doesn&#x27;t &#x60;project-remember-projects-under&#x60; doesn&#x27;t have TAB completion. So for example when I want to navigate the path and type in a prefix (e.g. &#x60;~/proj...&#x60;) and press TAB to complete it (e.g. &#x60;~/projects/&#x60;), it doesn&#x27;t happen. But this does happen for example in &#x60;C-x C-f&#x60; and I assume this should be the case everywhere when I setup Vertico and consult. Another case is the &#x60;project-switch-projects&#x60; when I want to find a dir to add a new project to the list. I am confused about this and would appreciate some help.

                              <span>I have a custom emacs setup that I’m quite fond. I run no code of my own, it’s all just configuring of existing packages. 
 I experience extreme lagginess in some buffers after working in them for some time. My primary major mode is cider (clojure). The buffers are all fairly snappy after a fresh start and then some of them slow down after some time to the point where it could take a second for a cursor move to reflect. If I open the same file in a second buffer then sometimes the cursor is snappy in the second buffer.
 What is the process I must follow to track down the package(s) or config that is causing this lag to build? I’m not really familiar with emacs-lisp beyond basic configuring of init.el. 
 What must I learn, what must I read and what debugging technique should I use?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve got a bit of a frustrating story to share, and I&#x27;m hoping maybe some of you can offer some advice.
 For the past months, I&#x27;ve been trying to find a developer to create an open-source multi-language transliteration mode for Emacs. The idea is to have a mode that can transliterate Latin characters into various scripts in real-time. I&#x27;m looking to start with Arabic since that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m most familiar with, but the goal is to make it extensible to other languages in the future.
 The project would use Google Input Tools for the transliteration functionality. I thought it would be a cool project that could benefit many Emacs users working with different languages. The initial requirements aren&#x27;t too complex (or are they? More on that later):
  
Integrate with Google Input Tools API
 Provide real-time transliteration suggestions (starting with Arabic)
 Store common translations for offline use (like a dictionary)
 Allow manual editing of stored translations
 Design the system to be extensible for other languages through config
 Share the project commented and documented
  
I&#x27;ve posted the job on (a major jobs website) and tried to make it sound as approachable as possible. I&#x27;ve even revised the posting a few times to make it clearer and simpler.
 But here&#x27;s the kicker: I&#x27;ve run into two major problems. First, the developers I&#x27;ve hired often don&#x27;t seem to properly assess the project before accepting it. I&#x27;ve had three instances where they&#x27;ve abandoned the project shortly after starting. Second, and this is on me, the budget I can offer is abysmal. I&#x27;m realizing now that Emacs Lisp is probably not a beginner-friendly language, which makes finding skilled developers even harder, especially given my budget constraints.
 I am no dev but is this project really hard? How much should it cost? And would it be interesting/worth it for the community?
 Thanks for letting me vent a bit.

                              <span>Hi. I have been creating Zettels off and on for last 3 years (currently having 450 notes). Requesting your advice and suggestions on a confusion I often experience
I have heard that each note should only be about one idea. However, many times I am creating notes that might have multiple sub ideas but I don&#x27;t feel each sub idea should be separately made a note. For instance, refer to the attached note.

I am discussing two components about the nature of growth - but I typically prefer to put them in a single note only. Would it be more beneficial for me to put the subpoints in separate notes? If so, why?
If you guys were creating the note that I just pasted, how would you create it? Would you make it single or multiple notes? If multiple, what all notes would you make from it?
Thanks!</span>

                              <span>So I came across a YouTube video earlier today, where the speaker shows a Leetcode problem that goes something like this:
  
Given a non-empty floating-point array of even length n, calculate the minimal value produced when iterating n / 2 times, removing both the minimum and maximum each time and combining them [in a way I don&#x27;t recall].
  
I think in a procedural language we&#x27;d all intuitively sort the values and then iterate from the edges to the middle simultaneously. So in C++ you would essentially end up with something like this:
 // pretend I added constexpr, noexcept, assertions, requires, etc. auto min_extreme_comb(auto &amp;&amp; range, auto combiner) { using namespace std; // forgive me pls using type &#x3D; ranges::range_value_t; sort(begin(range), end(range)); return transf…</span>

                              <span>As a clojure programmer with fairly minimal Haskell experience (read LYAH, implemented an algorithm from grad school), I&#x27;ve been going through the lean 4 intro, and it seems pretty cool. It has many (most?) of Haskell&#x27;s features, while improving on Haskell in its handling of records/structs and namespaces, imho. That&#x27;s setting aside the obvious new features like dependent types and theorem proving (I have no interest in theorem proving, personally). It also seems to have a lot of interest from corporate research groups, or at least that&#x27;s what its wikipedia article claims.
 At the same time, it seems to have very little presence online, outside of its zulip chat group. I see basically nothing on reddit, almost nothing on youtube. I get the impression that very few programmers have picked it up independently or converted to it from other languages like haskell. Searching on the haskell subreddit, I see a post from two years ago where people showed a lot of interest, but not much since.
 So I&#x27;m curious, is there a reason it isn&#x27;t getting traction in the developer/fp nerd communities? Does it simply have too small an ecosystem to garner attention, or is there something else?

 This is a very simple code snippet demonstrating the basic syntax of Haskell, which is considered as the most &#x27;pure&#x27; functional language, as well as the most diffucult to read and understand without deep knowledge of its idioms.

                              <span>I have to develope some LIbre Office Macros (in Basic) and I&#x27;m curious if anyone has seen Emacs packages which implement a decent dev loop. So, for example:
  
edit w/ syntax checking
 
reload the macro in Libre Office when saved
 
some sort of test framework or command runner
 
 thx

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been working on creating a major-mode for running tests. I was inspired by how rg.el uses the header-line to customize ripgrep parameters, and I wanted to similarly use the header-line to customize test parameters.
 rg.el achieves this by propertizing header-line elements with keymaps that call functions that customize the compilation query and recompile: see rg-header.el, specifically rg-header-mouse-action. This works with their major mode, rg-mode, which is defined via define-compilation-mode. This macro wraps define-derived-mode to derive from compilation-mode. I was able to mimic this process and achieve the desired behavior for my header-line.
 The problem comes when I try to add interactivity. If what I&#x27;m running requires interaction, I typically call compilation interactively. This makes the compilation buffer use comint-mode and compilation-shell-minor-mode. I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to get define-compilation-mode to be interactive, so I instead just derived directly from comint-mode and activated compilation-shell-minor-mode. With this I can get interactivity in my major mode.
 However, the left click in the header-line no longer works. The hover help text still works. I imagine what&#x27;s going on is that comint-mode or some minor mode is overriding the left mouse button. How can I get around this? It seems the recommended way of overriding major/minor mode keybindings is to define your own minor mode, or use bind-key*. But I&#x27;m not sure how to apply this to my situation, where I want to apply a keybinding only to some text (in the header-line). I&#x27;d appreciate any suggestions.

                              <span>Hi people, I have this waring since I upgraded my lsp-mode package to version 20240823.746:
 Warning (lsp-mode): Unknown request method: workspace/diagnostic/refresh
 I think that other modes are involved in this issue too, but by now I can confirm that with json-mode and web-mode the warning appears.
 I have updated my language serves from the global npm installation:

 vscode-html-language-server
 vscode-json-languageserver

                              <span>I have started using org mode in Emacs after a long time using neovim. Almost everything I used in vim has an alternative or even a better option inside emacs... except snippets.
 I like the flexibility of regex snippets in UltiSnips and have tried to recreate this in yasnippet. Most of the things can be customized to emulate such as:
  
having snippet work without the leading space
 making some snippets auto expanding
  
However, I can not find anything about regex context snippets. There is an stack exchange topic about that from a few years back, but even using re-search--backward I cannot recreate the UltiSnips behavior. 
 So what I am trying to achieve?
 I have a snippet when I press the key ;, which:
  
if there are characters before the key it expands to x_{}
 if there are no characters before it (excluding space) it does nothing, so that another snippet, for example ;a can expand to \alpha
  
Most of the issues I have looked at are a few years old. A pull request that would bring that functionality has been abandoned a few years back. 
 I am fairly new to Emacs. Can this be achieved in yasnippet? Is there another plugin, that can achieve similar functionality?

 I use C-M-u to jump to left outer side and then C-M-f to jump to the right side.
 It there better way to achieve this?

 I have tried this in my config.el:
 (defun toggle-dired-hidden-files () &quot;Toggle hidden files in dired.&quot; (interactive) (if (string-match-p &quot; -A&quot; dired-listing-switches) (setq dired-listing-switches &quot;-Xlh --group-directories-first&quot;) (setq dired-listing-switches &quot;-AXlh --group-directories-first&quot;)) (revert-buffer)) 
 But it doesn&#x27;t work. New to Emacs, any help appreciated. Thank you.

 I installed emacs just to test it out on a computer that isn&#x27;t mine and I have to return (yeah I know). I removed emacs, but it left a bunch of files and directories.
 /etc/emacs
 /etc/emacs/site-start.d
 /etc/emacs/site-start.d/00debian.el
 /mnt/c/Users/pcste/AppData/Local/Yarn/Cache/v6/npm-node-gyp-3.8.0-540304261c330e80d0d5edce253a68cb3964218c-integrity/node_modules/node-gyp/gyp/tools/emacs

 And a bunch more. How do I remove it completely?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been thinking about a problem that&#x27;s been bugging me for a while, and I bet some of you can relate.
 We&#x27;re all drowning in a sea of different file formats. PDFs, EPUBs, HTML, plain text, you name it. Switching between apps for each format is a pain, and it makes building a cohesive knowledge base feel like herding cats.
 Imagine if we could:
  
Open ANY document format directly in Emacs
 Have a consistent interface for all reading materials
 Easily annotate and link between different sources
 Integrate seamlessly with org-mode or org-roam
  
Sounds nice, right?
 I&#x27;ve been working on a tool called &#x60;convert-to-org.py&#x60; as part of the org-zettel-ref-mode project. It&#x27;s not a complete solution (yet), but it&#x27;s a start:
  
Converts various formats to org-mode files
 Runs directly within Emacs
 Preserves document structure
 Plays nice with org-mode and org-roam
  
I Think This Matters:
  
Consistency: All your reading materials in org-mode format
 Annotation: Easy note-taking within converted documents
 Searchability: Emacs&#x27; powerful search across all materials
 Integration: Connect reading directly to your knowledge management system
  
And I have some questions:
  
What&#x27;s your current reading workflow in Emacs?
 What features would your ideal unified reading environment have?
 Any ideas on how to push this concept further?
  
If you&#x27;re interested in checking out the tool or contributing, star org-zettel-ref-mode on GitHub.
 Working on a tool to convert various document formats to org-mode, aiming for a unified reading environment in Emacs. What do you think?

                              <span>Hello, I&#x27;m a Haskell beginner, and this apparently minor issue is leaving me completely stumped.
 I used Haskell for a bit on a lubuntu VirtualBox, since it seemed by far the easiest way to setup BLAS and LAPACK needed for the hmatrix library (my PC&#x27;s operative system is Windows 10). On the virtual machine, I was able to setup my small project with no issues at all, using cabal init.
 Recently, I&#x27;ve managed to set up OpenBLAS and correctly install hmatrix on the host, but when I try to start a completely new project:
 C:\Users\User&gt; mkdir proj
 C:\Users\User&gt; cd proj
 C:\Users\User\proj&gt; cabal init
 after making me choose some set-up options, I&#x27;m inevitably hit by this message:
 git: readCreateProcessWithExitCode: does not exist (No such file or directory)
 I tried multiple combinations of options and the result is always the same.
 Every proposed solution to instances of this problem I&#x27;ve seen online doesn&#x27;t work, and I can&#x27;t figure out why. I&#x27;m definitely missing something very important here, could anybody help?

 data Value &#x3D; IntV Int | HashV (M.Map H.Hash (Object, Object)) | NullV | BuiltinV ([Object] -&gt; Object) deriving (Eq, Ord) 
 As i use Value as Map value, it has to be instance of Eq and Ord. LSP tells me about standalone deriving, but i have no idea about it.
 I solve it with wrapping BuiltinV function into another data type with string key, which i use for Eq / Ord instances, but is it possible to use it in the way i wrote above?

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I’m trying to use Org Mode in a way that’s similar to how you’d use an R Notebook or Jupyter Notebook. Specifically, I want to export the results of my analysis (including both code and images generated by that code) into a standalone HTML file.
 I’m running into two issues:
 1. Image Embedding: By default, Org Babel’s HTML export functionality includes a link to any images rather than embedding the actual image itself as Base64. This means that if I share the HTML file, the images won’t be displayed unless the image files are also shared. 2. Pandoc Issues: I tried using a package that integrates Pandoc for exporting, but it won’t export the results of my code snippets—it only exports the code itself. This doesn’t just break image exports, it also fails to include things like text and table results from my analysis, which is a significant issue. 
 Neither of these approaches works for me, and I haven’t been able to find a solution that allows for a complete, self-contained HTML file with embedded images and code results.
 My question: Is there a way to export an Org Mode file to HTML with all results (including images) embedded in the file itself? Any tips, solutions, or packages I should check out?
 Thanks in advance for your help!

 Can you please point me to some open source projects in need of such a help you are aware of?
 Yes, I know some bounties has been published here but since I haven&#x27;t delved too much into these libraries ecosystems I think I am more suitable for the migration efforts some open source may have at this point of time.
 Thank you very much.

                              <span>In the past I tried out some Database Libs for one of our projects, but none really catched well. Most were so complicated, that it began to feel like fighting the library instead of fighting SQL. Others had really long compile times.
 In the end I ended up with a small toolset on top of JDBC for Scala 3, called usql: https://github.com/reactivecore/usql
 So what is in there?
  
Interpolation: sql&quot;SELECT INTO Person(id, name) VALUES(${1}, ${&quot;Alice&quot;})&quot;.execute()
 These SQL fragments can be freely combined
 Macro-based DAO-Generators for Case Classes
 Dynamic generated extractors for ResultSets / Fillers for PreparedStatements
 Extensible using a small set of Typeclasses (especially DataType)
 Some helpers for writing Joins (not documented yet and a bit unstable)
  
A lot of stuff is not in there:
  
DDL Generation
 ORM
 Dependencies
 Effect system: the main use is in Loom Applications. But it should be possible to wrap it into your own effect system if necessary.
  
The library looks very similar to Magnum, which I was not aware of until late in development.

Getting Started with Nix for Haskell by Abhinav Sarkar
Nix is notoriously hard to get started with. If you are familiar with Haskell, you may have an easier time learning the Nix language, but it is still difficult to figure out the various toolchains and libraries functions needed to put your knowledge of the Nix language to use. There are some frameworks for setting up Haskell projects with Nix, but again, they are hard to understand because of their large feature scopes. So, in this post, I’m going to show a really easy way for you to get started.

                              <span>Our Nickel language is a configuration language. It’s also a
functional programming language. Functional programming isn’t a well-defined
term: it can encompass anything from being vaguely able to pass functions as
arguments and to call them (in that respect, C and JavaScript are functional) to
being a statically typed, pure and immutable language based on the
lambda-calculus, like Haskell.
However, if you ask a random developer, I can guarantee that one aspect will be
mentioned every time: algebraic data types (ADTs) and pattern matching. They are
the bread and butter of typed functional languages. ADTs are relatively easy to
implement (for language maintainers) and easy to use. They’re part of the 20% of
the complexity that makes for 80% of the joy of functional programming.

But I have one question: how do I create identifiers? Can The Archive create them automatically for me when I make a new note or do I have to manually add one (perhaps via text expansion) at the start of each new note?
Thank you for your help.</span>

 Here when I did a quick cmd+f I find three results
  
GHC.Natural
 GHC.Num.Natural
 Numeric.Natural
  
Are they same ? or different ?
 I don&#x27;t understand the structure

 As this was recommended on the haskell.org page their suggested way
 I am unclear about few topics still, also I want to learn some more in depth Haskell
 there are 3 books I am looking for now to give a read
  
concurrent and parallel programming haskell
 some intermediate book (can we read RED BOOK, is it good, is it for scala?)
 some resource for practical and industrial haskell
  
Thanks in advance fellow lambda enjoyeres

 Trying to achieve parallel bindings between org and various essenging systems that I now have to use daily at work.

                              <span>I am having issues getting syntax highlighting in a .jl buffer using treesit in emacs. 
 For example if i create a test.jl file using C-x C-f the buffer automatically enters julia-ts-mode and julia-snail-mode which is great:
 if I define a function:
 function main() nothing end 
 and run the command treesit-explore-mode then I get a buffer that displays:
 (function_definition function (signature (call_expression (identifier) (argument_list ()))) \n (identifier) \n end) 
 so I know that the syntax tree is working and I am able to get indentation, but no syntax highlighting what so ever. 
 with the command font-lock-update I get the following error: 
 treesit-font-lock-fontify-region: Query pattern is malformed: &quot;Node type error at&quot;, 177, &quot;(assignment (identifier) u/font-lock-variable-name-face (_)) (assignment (field_expression (identifier) \&quot;.\&quot; (identifier) u/font-lock-variable-name-face) (operator)) (assignment (bare_tuple (identifier) u/font-lock-variable-name-face)) (assignment (bare_tuple (field_expression (identifier) \&quot;.\&quot; (identifier) u/font-lock-variable-name-face)) (operator)) (local_statement (identifier) u/font-lock-variable-name-face) (let_binding (identifier) u/font-lock-variable-name-face) (global_statement (identifier) u/font-lock-variable-name-face)&quot;, &quot;Debug the query with &#x60;treesit-query-validate&#x27;&quot; 
 any help would be greatly appreciated!

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;m experiencing an issue with expiring emails in Gnus, and I&#x27;m hoping for some guidance. Here’s the situation:
 I’ve configured Gnus with (nnmail-expiry-wait &#x27;immediate) and (nnmail-expiry-target &quot;nnimap+gmail:[Gmail]/Trash&quot;) for my Gmail account, expecting emails marked as expirable (E) to be moved to Trash immediately after running the expiration process. However, after marking messages and pressing C-c C-x in the Group buffer, I see &quot;Expiring articles...done&quot;, but the emails remain visible in both Gnus and the web interface of Gmail.
 Interestingly, manually expunging messages one by one with B E works perfectly, and the emails are deleted as expected. However, my ideal workflow is to mark certain emails with a single press of E and then batch delete them all at once. Ideally, I’d…</span>

                              <span>Is it possible to save changes to a string&#x27;s text properties so that when the buffer is closed and reopened it may be redisplayed? I&#x27;ve been using the Elisp manual&#x27;s section on examining and changing text properties and while it does provide many functions to do so, none of these changes seem to remain once the file is closed, even if it was saved. Is it possible to save these changes so that they become a permanent part of the buffer and will be redisplayed upon opening the respective file/buffer? I&#x27;ve heard &quot;enriched mode&quot; provides this functionality, but I just wondered if this could be done simply through elisp or some setting configuration?

 I&#x27;ve noticed that some frames are being automatically killed, which isn&#x27;t ideal. I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s some kind of garbage collection issue, but how do I figure out why the frames are being killed, and where can I see information about which frames were killed previously (there&#x27;s no indication in the *Messages* buffer)?

                              <span>Hello,
 I&#x27;m using tab-bar-mode, and I have tab-bar-format-global in tab-bar-format. This will display global-mode-string to tab-bar.
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;elisp
 (setq-default tab-bar-format tab-bar-format-menu-bar tab-bar-format-history tab-bar-format-tabs tab-bar-separator tab-bar-format-add-tab tab-bar-separator tab-bar-format-align-right tab-bar-format-global )) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 But, in global-mode-string, I have mu4e. the tab-bar erase global-mode-string&#x27;s menu hover and mouse click action.
 It seems that its related to the &quot;ignore&quot; word. elisp (defun tab-bar-format-global () &quot;Produce display of &#x60;global-mode-string&#x27; in the tab bar. When &#x60;tab-bar-format-global&#x27; is added to &#x60;tab-bar-format&#x27; \(possibly appended after &#x60;tab-bar-format-align-right&#x27;), then modes that display information on the mode line using &#x60;global-mode-string&#x27; will display the same text on the tab bar instead.&quot; (mapcar (lambda (string) &#x60;(global menu-item ,(format-mode-line string) ignore)) global-mode-string)) 
 If I remove tab-bar-format-global from tab-bar-format, the global-mode-string will display on mode-line, and the global-mode-string&#x27;s mu4e indicator can use mouse to hover and click. I think if put global-mode-string to tab-bar, items in tab-bar should also be mouse hover / mouse click too.
 What do you think? How to quickly hack tab-bar to let global-mode-string accept mouse hover and mouse click in tab-bar?
 Thank you.

                              <span>I&#x27;m facing an unusal problem here. Normally I do software in emacs but today it&#x27;s this:
 I have a list of ~ 2k-5k text chunks, that are each about one or two sentences natural language. I need to review, potentially correct them and then save the results back. I know this is crazy, but if there&#x27;s one tool that can help me, it must be emacs. I conceptually of need a way to quickly go to the next unreviewed chunk, potentially edit it, mark it as reviewed and go to the next until done. Has anyone ever done something like this? Is there a tool? How would you go about it?

 I don&#x27;t. I already burned my fingers with adding complexity to emacs that I couldn&#x27;t handle. That included (among others) package management and as a consequence I try to keep additional packages (as well as configurations) to a minimum.
 What reasons do you have for one or the other?

                              <span>I had some automation tests written in Java which used to ping my services on Scala Play 2.8 once it was deployed to a dev environment. But now after I upgrade it to 2.9, I am getting connection terminated at all the tests.
 Weirdly enough this happens only with the Java automation test suites and nothing else. Like if I invoke the same API from swagger, postman or any other service it just works. The Java Test Suite is using Java 17 and is also using self signed https certificates. Can anyone help me figure out what maybe going wrong here and what all should I try to fix this?

 Just a note in case you have the same issue. I feel that updating anything on Emacs these days should be planned in advance and done on the weekends :)

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to take lecture notes using &#x60;org-mode&#x60; and &#x60;cdlatex-mode&#x60;. The problem I meet is when I try to use &#x60;Tab&#x60; to expand &#x60;fr&#x60; it doesn&#x27;t expand correctly.
 &#x60;\(fr\)&#x60; will become &#x60;\(\begin{frame}[]\frametitle{}\end{frame}\)&#x60; instead of &#x60;\(\frac{}{}\)&#x60; and there is a warning saying that &#x60;Warning (org-element): ‘org-element-at-point’ cannot be used in non-Org buffer # (latex-mode)&#x60;. 
 I&#x27;m using &#x60;doom emacs&#x60; and only open &#x60;org-cdlatex-mode&#x60; as a minor mode. How can I fix this problem to make &#x60;\(fr\)&#x60; works properly? 
 By the way, I also want to know how can I make an abbreviation like &#x60;fr&#x60;, which I can expand it in a latex fragment. I have try &#x60;(setq cdlatex-env-alist&#x27;((&quot;limit&quot; &quot;\\lim_{?}&quot; nil)))&#x60; and &#x60;(setq cdlatex-command-alist
 &#x27;((&quot;lim&quot; &quot;Insert fraction env&quot; &quot;&quot; cdlatex-environment (&quot;limit&quot;) t nil)))&#x60; but this seems only works for the abbreviation at the beginning of a line.

                              <span>I&#x27;m happy to share with everyone that org-zettel-ref-mode has been updated to version 0.3. The main focus of this update has been to improve its compatibility with org-roam. Additionally, the previously provided &#x60;convert-to-org.py&#x60; script can now be executed directly within Emacs, allowing for document conversion without leaving this productive environment.
 Although these are just two minor main updates, their impact is significant. It reminds me of a saying: &quot;No matter how simple the functionality, the complexity behind it is immeasurable.&quot; To ensure compatibility with org-roam, I&#x27;ve changed the working logic of org-zettel-ref-mode from generating a new file and directly overwriting it each time to incremental updates. I&#x27;ve also studied the org-roam API and managed to maintain stable IDs…</span>

                              <span>The native compilation thing in newer versions of Emacs creates a eln-cache directory under your config dir (unless you move it with startup-redirect-eln-cache).
 For me the directory looks like this:  ~/.emacs.d/eln-cache/29.4-95d1479c/ace-window-a4363797-e4f210e9.eln /aggressive-indent-eaef7fd5-fb4a240b.eln ... /yaml-mode-3ab646e7-6cc0bf46.eln 
 Basically the form seems to be eln-cache/-/--.eln.
 I am assuming these hexadecimal values are hashes, but I suppose they can be anything.
 If they are hashes, what are they hashes of? Can I reproduce these hashes somehow?

 describe mode and function work fine. But describe-key requires input in the function.
 Is there a way to run describe-key in a way where it prompts for input keys?
 (defun jv/describe (choice) (interactive (list (completing-read &quot;Choose: &quot; &#x27;(&quot;function&quot; &quot;key&quot; &quot;mode&quot;) nil t))) (cond ((string-equal choice &quot;function&quot;) (counsel-describe-function)) ((string-equal choice &quot;key&quot;) (describe-key)) ;; &lt;-- this part ((string-equal choice &quot;mode&quot;) (describe-mode))))

                              <span>I&#x27;ve recently stumbled upon &#x60;magit-diff-visit-file&#x60;, which is bound to RET in a magit diff view. When on a removed line, it jumps back to the previous blob containing that line, which is handy, yet it also seems to revert the worktree file to that old blob, even if I have uncommitted changes to that file.
 This happened a couple of times (magit 4.0.0 and 4.1.0), and I could not find any way to revert back to my (uncommitted) worktree file except for copying back the ~ backup file.
 There is a &#x60;magit-diff-visit-worktree-file&#x60; command, but that one requires the magit status buffer to still show the uncommitted worktree changes, which is no longer the case if closing the status buffer after invoking &#x60;magit-diff-visit-file&#x60;.
 Does anyone know an option to either (1) revert to the worktree version after &#x60;magit-diff-visit-file&#x60;, or (2) somehow warn the user before &#x60;magit-diff-visit-file&#x60; is about to execute?

                              <span>Sadly the Scala market in my region (LATAM) is almost nonexistent, my current contract is almost end so i&#x27;m looking for another opportunity, all that i can find are plain Java + Spring jobs, i found a startup that is using Elixir heavily in the backend.
 What would you do in my position? I want to go back to Scala as fast as posible, is Java an advantage for a Scala position? Is Elixir an advantage for a Scala position?:
 Bonus question; I have no idea of Elixir, is Elixir actually a functional language?

 GHC Haskell&#x27;s RTS is written in a mixture of C and Haskell. I believe a worthy goal should be to rewrite all C code (and any other code that isn&#x27;t memory safe) in a memory-safe language (e.g., Rust).
 The Haskell Foundation should make this a high-priority project, and it should seek funding from national and international agencies to staff it.

                              <span>Greetings,
 I am new to Haskell and when I code Haskell on vscode, an error message says &quot;openTempFile: invalid argument (Invalid argument)compiler&quot;. Even though there is no syntax error and I can load the file into ghci and run the functions, it&#x27;s annoying and I was trying to figure out how to remove that message.
 The image of error message is attached

 This is the Haskell extension that I&#x27;m using:

 I download Haskell using ghcup:

 Thanks in advance for any help!
 Edit: I notice that the error message occurs when the file name is long

                              <span>I am very confused about Haskell tooling system I installed Haskell from ghcup which was very awesome as it installed all the necessary things with one command I learnt basic haskell, now I am trying to make projects, so I want to know about which build tool to use Cabal or Stack, what&#x27;s the difference between them ? Why we have 2 of them? Are both from Haskell community? Whats the standard and quick way to start project? Also, I tried cabal, and to add a dependencies, you have to manually edit the .cabal file, can&#x27;t you do something like npm i 
 and it changes the package.json for cabal ?

                              <span>N.b. I mostly write Lisp and Go these days; I&#x27;ve only written toys in Haskell.
  
Naively, &quot;making invalid states unrepresentable&quot; seems like it&#x27;d couple you to a single understanding of the problem space, causing issues when your past assumptions are challenged etc. How do you architect things for the long term?
 
What sort of warts appear in older Haskell code bases? How do you handle/prevent them?
 
What &quot;patterns&quot; are common? (Gang of 4 patterns, &quot;clean&quot; code etc. were of course mistakes/bandaids for missing features.) In Lisp, I theoretically believe any recurring pattern should be abstracted away as a macro so there&#x27;s no real architecture left. What&#x27;s the Platonic optimal in Haskell?
 
  
I found:
  
Next Level MTL on tools for growing monad transformer stacks: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;GZPup5Iuaqw
 https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/4srjcc/architecture_patterns_for_larger_haskell_programs/ discusses e.g. memoization (can&#x27;t) and instrumenting observability, which makes &quot;functional core&quot; imperative monadic shell&quot; tedious(?). I suspect a deeper understanding of monads (e.g. Van Laarhoven free helps (like dependency injection as the code base evolves)
 Granin&#x27;s Functional Design and Architecture looks interesting

 The message says error, but I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s not because bug-hunter skips over it.
 I could be triggering this via (debug-on-message &quot;Package cl&quot;).
 I&#x27;m not an expert, but I can step through files and use bug-hunter, etc. This has me stumped right now. I want to eliminate or at least identify this last use of CL in my setup. This message will only appear once, during a fresh cold startup. Obviously, the Lisp engine&#x27;s PC (program counter) knows where this happened, but it doesn&#x27;t tell me anything useful. Any suggestions from people who debug regularly?

 functions used
 embark-select, so embark can later insert the regions in a buffer using embark-collect
 embark-collect,
 mc-mark-all-in-region, to match the string &quot;ms&quot; (also has a regexp variation)
 rectangle-mark-mode, to select the region in the buffer created by embark-collect
 calc-grab-rectangle, to send the region to calc v R +, as I understand it flattens the list of lists of numbers and them sum the resulting list
 Video has 45s, highly recommend to mute the audio.
 **How would you solve the same problem?**

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to get org-columns to show a column without the amount of hours clocked in the current week.
 I saw that org-mode has a function (org-clock-sum-today) that it uses for the CLOCKSUM_T special property:
 https://github.com/bzg/org-mode/blob/9183e3c723b812360d1042196416d521db590e9f/lisp/org-colview.el#L894
 I also saw that there&#x27;s a (org-clock-sum-custom):
 https://github.com/bzg/org-mode/blob/9183e3c723b812360d1042196416d521db590e9f/lisp/org-clock.el#L1951
 So I tried to overwrite the org-columns function in my init.el, adding a new condition for that function like: 
  (when (assoc &quot;CLOCKSUM_W&quot; org-columns-current-fmt-compiled) (org-clock-sum-custom nil &#x27;thisweek)) 
 But it does not fill the CLOCKSUM_W column that I added. Any idea on what I could try?

                              <span>I updated emacs today and reinstalled all packages and magit seems to be broken. When installing normally from melpa I get this error when launching magit-status:
 &#x60;&#x60; The &quot;git-commit.el&quot; library is no longer distributed as a separate package. It is now distributed as part of themagit&#x27; package.
 The git-commit&#x27; package now does nothing but display this warning. If it is located earlier on theload-path&#x27; than magit&#x27; is, then that prevents the proper &quot;git-commit.el&quot; libraries frommagit&#x27; from being loaded.
 Please uninstalling git-commit&#x27; and then restart Emacs. &#x60;&#x60;
 So, I go ahead and remove git-commit package with package-delete and after restarting Emacs I get the following on the Messages buffer:
  Unable to activate package ‘magit’. Required package ‘git-commit-4.0.0’ is unavailable 
 Is this some kind of chicken and egg problem? anybody experiencing this?
  
Ok, found the issue!
 The version of magit on nongnu is old, the new version is only on melpa, so, if you have this configuration magit will fail:
  (setq package-archives &#x27;((&quot;melpa&quot; . &quot;https://melpa.org/packages/&quot;) (&quot;stable&quot; . &quot;https://stable.melpa.org/packages/&quot;) (&quot;gnu&quot; . &quot;https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/&quot;) (&quot;nongnu&quot; . &quot;https://elpa.nongnu.org/nongnu/&quot;))) (customize-set-variable &#x27;package-archive-priorities &#x27;((&quot;gnu&quot; . 99) (&quot;nongnu&quot; . 80) (&quot;stable&quot; . 70) (&quot;melpa&quot; . 0))) 
 If melpa is configured to have a higher priority than nongnu then everything works...

                              <span>I am editing some files where if there is a change in a particular region, I am happy to commit all the changes there without inspecting them easily.
 The files are GUI design text files where items are outlined and nested underneath their parent containers, so if there is change somewhere, all I need is to go the outermost applicable parent and commit all the hunks there automatically.
 Not collapsing could result in large unmodified regions appearing in the display, but I&#x27;m happy for them to be shown if it helped keep my bearings within the file.
 It would also help if the line numbers where also displayed instead of the diff line number markers.
 I could also open the original file on the side, possible with diff-hl-mode or some other such plugin to help.

 According to the manual, you can make a &quot;datetree&quot; capture template ((file+olp+datetree &quot;filename&quot; [ &quot;Level 1 heading&quot; ...])), which works great, but I&#x27;d like to customise it for my use - I&#x27;d like it to align with my university schedule.
 Ideally, I&#x27;d like to have one heading per university week (starting at ISO week ~40 for this semester - so I&#x27;d like ISO&#x27;s W40 to be my Week 1), then one sub-heading per day. How would I go about doing this? Is there a way to create my own datetree type, or do I have to write my own capture template function? If I need to do it all myself, are there any guides/examples I can follow?

                              <span>I&#x27;m using the official Android port of Emacs using the companion Termux application for several month now.
 In summary, this setup allows you to obtain the full Emacs experience, with deep Android integration (e.g., resizing or navigating using the touchscreen), and leveraging Termux application sharing (i.e., Emacs can access all Termux installed binaries, such as git).
 In my daily usage, I successfully use org-agenda (and org features in general, e.g., refilling), dired, magit, eshell. Even the image viewer is working! My dotfiles are synchronized leveraging Syncthing between my Android phone and my computer, so it&#x27;s a breeze to configure.
 Did you know it was possible? Does anyone tried it successfully or had troubles?
 Here are a few screenshots:

                              <span>I just made the switch from Neovim a few weeks ago and I started using u/Nicolas-Rougier&#x27;s nano-emacs distribution. (Love the distribution btw &quot;) &#x27;god-local-mode) (define-key god-local-mode-map (kbd &quot;i&quot;) &#x27;god-local-mode) (god-mode)) (define-key global-map (kbd &quot;C-x r f&quot;) &#x27;recentf) (define-key global-map (kbd &quot;C-c c&quot;) &#x27;org-capture) (define-key global-map (kbd &quot;C-c a&quot;) &#x27;nano-agenda) (define-minor-mode divine-mode nil :global t :group &#x27;nano :lighter &quot; DiVine&quot; :keymap (list (cons (kbd &quot;C-S-h&quot;) (kbd &quot;C-h&quot;)) (cons (kbd &quot;C-h&quot;) (kbd &quot;C-b&quot;)) (cons (kbd &quot;C-j&quot;) (kbd &quot;C-n&quot;)) (cons (kbd &quot;C-k&quot;) (kbd &quot;C-p&quot;)) (cons (kbd &quot;C-l&quot;) (kbd &quot;C-f&quot;)))) 
 The thing I&#x27;m looking for is the ability to do something like &quot;Make C-j perform whatever function C-n does in the currently active major+minor modes&quot;. Also, since C-h is being rebound, I would like to rebind the help prefix key to C-S-h and so on for all the keys that I&#x27;m rebinding.
 Is something like this possible?

 (add-hook &#x27;before-save-hook (lambda () (when (and (boundp &#x27;eglot--managed-mode) eglot--managed-mode) (eglot-format))))
 but it doesn&#x27;t seem to even trigger the hook unfortunately. Can anybody please share a working snippet of this actually functioning? (Even a plugin that does this would be fine, I&#x27;ve tried emacs-format-all-the-code, but it&#x27;s not to my liking. I want something that calls eglot-format)
 Thank you so much for the help!!

                              <span>Hello to all, my config having reached a non-trivial length, I&#x27;m wondering what you guys use to manage your complex config ?
 On my side, I currently use a single file with outline-mode sections /sub-sections, but I&#x27;m feeling frustrated and considering switching to multiples files. This is mainly because I spend more time programming than note taking/config editing, so I&#x27;m having trouble building muscle memory for outline / org navigation. 
 What do you use and why ?

                              <span>I was just curious how folks are feeling these days about Reddit alternatives. I&#x27;ve been enjoying Lemmy, personally, and I find that for technical stuff in particular the communities are definitely growing, feeling less ghost-town-ish little by little.
 Haskell-wise, it seems like https://programming.dev/c/haskell has the most subscribers (see, e.g. this search on lemmy explorer), but is definitely still a ghost town. (And https://programming.dev/c/functional_programming is slightly less than a ghost town.)
 Philosophically, I&#x27;m very much in favor of Lemmy, or basically any other more &quot;open&quot; alternative to Reddit. But I get the challenges of hoisting and moving an entire community who all is here for different reasons, have different ideas, etc.
 By the way, people discussed this at length in these two posts a little over a year ago, which makes for good reading:
  
https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/146d3jz/rhaskell_and_the_recent_news_regarding_reddit/
 https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/14dqllb/vote_on_the_future_of_rhaskell/
  
There were plenty of folks in favor of jumping ship (whether to Lemmy or Discourse), but it seems that inertia may have won out, as it often does.
 How are folks feeling these days? Has Discourse filled the gap? Was it simply easier to keep on with Reddit? Anyone out there still pine for a different platform for discussion?

                              <span>So, I ended up writing
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; -- Comma Separated Tuple newtype CST a &#x3D; CST (a,a)
 instance Show a &#x3D;&gt; Show (CST a) where show (CST (a,b)) &#x3D; show a ++ &quot;,&quot; ++ show b instance Read a &#x3D;&gt; Read (CST a) where readPrec &#x3D; parens $ do a &lt;- readPrec Punc &quot;,&quot; &lt;- lexP b &lt;- readPrec return $ CST (a, b) 
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 How does Punc &quot;,&quot; &lt;- lexP even work? How is it that, I am able to control the behaviour of lexP by mentioning a value on the left side &lt;-? It feels like pattern matching in the works here, but I can&#x27;t explain it completely.

 When I tried entering &quot;ghc -- version&quot; like the website instructed me to, it said &quot;zsh: command not found: ghc&quot;. Why is this not working for me?

                              <span>It would appear by looking at SimpleX Chat github repo, the haskell backend can be used for the SimpleX Android, iOS and desktop app. Is this the case with Haskell?
 I do not know Haskell but how does it compare to other multiplatform frameworks like Dart/Flutter for making and deploying mobile and desktop apps?
 Can Haskell be uses to make front ends on desktop or mobile, or only back ends?

                              <span>Hi all. I have what I hope is a simple issue but it&#x27;s been really annoying me. I use the arrow keys all the time and, until recently, it was fine. However, sometime in the last several months (maybe a year?) ctl-left and ctl-right don&#x27;t do anything in my Linux (Centos 7) emacs (29.1 build 2). They don&#x27;t even show a key has been pressed with ctl-h k. However, chords like shift-ctl-left/right work just fine!
 Note: I access Linux via ETX remote desktop from my Macbook.
 I checked xev and Linux is seeing the keys. I also tried 29.1 (emacsformacosx.com) on my Macbook Pro M1 and it works fine. Any ideas? I&#x27;m pretty fuzzy on stuff like xmodmap. Haven&#x27;t had to mess with that for many years.
 Thanks for any pointer!

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been using elfeed and elfeed+org for about 3 years. In that time my feed count has gone from 0 to ~130 but it has been at ~130 for about the last 2 years. Until very recently (last 2-3 weeks), refreshing the feeds was an operation that took maybe 1-2 minutes but it was fine because I continued to be able to use Emacs while the operation was in progress. In the last 2 weeks or so that changed: now when I refresh the feeds Emacs becomes unusable for maybe as long as 3-4 minutes. As in even receiving keyboard input for M-x commands is unreliable. 
 I&#x27;m curious if anyone else has seen this behavior? And perhaps has identified a root cause? And a fix?
 Relevant info:
 - I do and have always run emacs-next from guix which currently sits at 30.6.0.
 - I run the latest elfeed and elfeed-org updated approx weekly via straight.el and then, about year ago, via elpaca.
 - I have always run elfeed with the default value for elfeed-use-curl (t).
 - My workstation is fairly beefy: 24 x i5s with lots of RAM. 
 thx
 EDIT: I&#x27;ve recently started running the profiler during elfeed refreshes to see if it might point me in a useful direction. So far, nothing.

                              <span>Okay, I have been looking for an answer for this for a couple hours now and cannot seem to find a sensible answer. I would like to download some class packages such as &quot;turabian-researchpaper&quot; from CTAN and then use them in an org doc which I can then export to LaTeX. I am coming from Rmarkdown, in which this was trivial: just put the class where LaTeX can find it and then call out the class in arbitrary LaTeX code within the .rmd file. However, with Emacs, this does not work.
 I figured out that you have to use an instance of (add-to-list &#x27;org-latex-classes ...) followed by some specifications for that class so that ox-latex can parse it. But I have only found examples of how to add common classes like report or book, not custom classes and downloaded classes. Is there some way to general…</span>

                              <span>I have finally completed the Emacs Writing Studio (EWS) book. This book explains how to research, write and publish with Emacs and was completely written using the EWS configuration.
 The e-book version is available for most e-reader bookshops. The source files for the book (full text) and the configuration files are freely available on GitHub.
 It has been great working on this project with help of the community. I hope this project can attract some new Emacs users.
 Next step is an enhanced second edition and publish a paperback version.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve noticed that some Zettelkasten practitioners use special symbols like &quot;!&quot; or &quot;§&quot; at the start of their Zettel file names, placed before the Zettel ID (e.g., &quot;§ YYYYMMDDHHmm&quot;). While I understand that these symbols can affect the sorting order of digital files, I&#x27;m curious about their specific usage within the Zettelkasten method, particularly when using apps like The Archive.
My main questions are:
I’d love to hear how others use these symbols or why you might choose not to use them.</span>

                              <span>The year is 2022, and after a long journey I arrive in the country I have been longing for. It&#x27;s the 2nd of March and I&#x27;ve been on solid ground for a long time. It&#x27;s not far from the beach to the next big settlement. Forum Zettelkasten is written on a big sign at the entrance to the village.
The street is a hive of activity. The people here seem very friendly and open. Small groups have formed on many corners, chatting animatedly. I approached them to listen to some of their conversations. They noticed me and greeted me warmly.
Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t understand their language. Some words sound familiar, others are completely new to me. Now I&#x27;m standing right next to them. The word Zettel is repeated several times - the word I had already read on the big sign. I try to say it in my own language. They don&#x27;t seem to understand me either.
Luckily I always have a piece of paper and a pencil with me when I&#x27;m out and about. I draw a few lines and some symbols. The joy is great. The others also know this way of communicating with strangers.
What does your journey look like? Do you have a map [1]? Where are you travelling from?

                              <span>Hello,
 We&#x27;re proud to release Helenus for Scala 3!
 Helenus is collection of Scala utilities for Apache Cassandra. Its goal is to make interacting with Cassandra easier, in a type-safe manner, while trying to avoid introducing a complex API.
 Most of the API stays the same as its Scala 2 counterpart, the only notable difference is how typeclasses are derived. Whereas in Scala 2 for a case class we&#x27;d do RowMapper[Hotel] in Scala 3 we can do case class Hotel(...) derives RowMapper.
 In future releases we hope to get these APIs much closer by providing similar methods.

                              <span>This is a very small script that one can use to lookup default Emacs keybindings. If your Emacs configuration changes some keybindings, using this script to look up the defaults might be more convenient than starting Emacs with no config and then looking them up.

                              <span>In my company, we use a code versioning system that heavily uses symlinks. Specifically: say I am in directory foo, and I modify bar.c. I can access the original bar.c in foo/.c_path/bar.c
 I like eMacs diff, so I open the file in .c_path and do ediff-buffers so I can review my changes. This requires opening the file, positioning the original file on the left, updated file on the right and then m-x edify-buffers. I have set ediff-split-window-function to split-window-sensibly
 I do this often, so I would love to automate this workflow. I’m not sure how to begin though - any suggestions?

                              <span>I opened up my package manager, and I got this cryptic message:
  Failed to verify signature archive-contents.sig: No public key for 645357D2883A0966 created at 2024-08-30T14:05:05-0700 using EDDSA Command output: gpg: Signature made 08/30/24 14:05:05 Pacific Daylight Time gpg: using EDDSA key 0327BE68D64D9A1A66859F15645357D2883A0966 gpg: Can&#x27;t check signature: No public key 
 When I look at where I am fetching packages from:
  &#x27;(package-archives (quote ( (&quot;gnu&quot; . &quot;http://elpa.gnu.org/packages/&quot;) (&quot;melpa&quot; . &quot;http://melpa.org/packages/&quot;) (&quot;melpa-stable&quot; . &quot;http://stable.melpa.org/packages/&quot;) ) )) 
 Commenting out the &quot;gnu&quot; line seems to make the loading error go away, but then there are tons of packages I can&#x27;t install, I guess because their dependencies are in the gnu repository.
 This is on &quot;GNU Emacs 28.2 (build 2, x86_64-w64-mingw32) of 2022-09-13&quot;.
 Any ideas? Any pointers for where I might look for clues about this?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been using evil for a few years but it never really &quot;clicked&quot; and I only ever used the main keybindings. I&#x27;m trying out Meow, since hopefully it will be more configurable, and the object-verb structure might be easier for me, and I like that you don&#x27;t have to define your own separate keybindings for every new package.
 I&#x27;m wondering if there are any guides for setting up leader-key and local-leader stuff with meow? I know that keypad mode is great for entering normal keybindings without cords, but I&#x27;m wondering how to add special keybindings to keypad mode?
  
Is there a way to have a &quot;local-leader&quot; key, like &quot;,&quot; which is the equivalent of doing &quot;C-c&quot;, so I can have a separate way to input mode-specific commands?
 How can I bind specific commands to key sequences in keypad/leader mode? e.g. I want &quot;SPC SPC&quot; to be like M-x, &quot;SPC b b&quot; to bring up the buffer menu, &quot;SPC w d&quot; to delete a window, etc. How can I do this kind of specific bindings for local-leader commands? But for everything I haven&#x27;t defined, I want to default to the usual meow-keypad stuff.
 Are there any configs/packages that are like evil-surround? Or embrace configs for meow?
 Are there any meow configs for LaTeX mode, for e.g. surrounding in commands and such?

                              <span>I have something on the order of 120 RSS/atom feeds for blogs, podcasts, YouTube channels. Since I started using Elfeed a few years ago, I&#x27;ve use cURL (i.e. had elfeed-use-curl set to t) as the feed-fetching function, but despite various tweaks (including some suggested here) updating elfeed always took at least 2 minutes, on average something like 4 minutes. And it would be quite resource intensive: CPU usage would jump up and my laptop fans would immediately start whirring.
    
 Recently, I tried to debug an issue relating to a podcast feed that kept failing to update, no matter how long I set elfeed-curl-timeout. I&#x27;d get the error (56) Failure in receiving network data. Going to a terminal and manually downloading the feed with cURL worked fine.
    
 I decided to switch elfeed-use-curl to nil to see if something was an issue. And incredibly, I found that the troublesome feed almost instantly updated. Updating all my feeds took a lot longer with much less resource usage.
    
 So ... is there possibly something else going on here, or is cURL less performant than url-retrieve, at least for large numbers of feeds? Can anyone else verify this?

                              <span>A good while ago I implemented a splay tree in elisp. It&#x27;s been serving me well and I&#x27;m curious what people think of it and/or if anyone else may have a use for it. The code is currently part of a package with another purpose, but is package agnostic and doesn&#x27;t depend on anything else in the package (or on anything outside of standard elisp constructs for that matter).
 My use case for it has been to keep track of token positions in buffers and efficiently determine the context for which to provide code intelligence. I needed an efficient data-structure that accommodates for localized &quot;hot&quot; access zones and doesn&#x27;t use an insane amount of memory. 
 I&#x27;d like to tell a little bit about my rationale and how it came to be. Initially, I tried to use hash tables. But a requirement for determini…</span>

                              <span>I tried to ask this question in a language-agnostic way here, and I&#x27;m actually using ReScript (a dialect of OCaml focused on the JavaScript ecosystem). But since the Haskell community probably has more experience with recursion schemes, I&#x27;m also asking here.
 In short, I&#x27;m writing a multi-stage compiler for a toy language, and I want to simplify folding and transforming my ASTs.
 Recursion schemes are perfect for this, but to use them I need to first &quot;functorialize&quot; my AST type, and then recover the concrete type by wrapping it into Fix. In ReScript syntax it looks like this:
 // &quot;Functorialized&quot; AST to allow recursion schemes inject custom data in place of nodes type exprF &#x3D; Id(string) | Int(int) | Call(exprF, exprF) // Concrete expression type of arbitrary depth. // We add an extra wrapper to avoid defining it like &#x27;type expr &#x3D; exprF&#x27;, // which would be self-referential and rejected by the compiler. type rec expr &#x3D; Fix(exprF) 
 The problem is, of course, that I now need to insert that Fix wrapper everywhere when constructing expressions or pattern-matching on them:
 let testData &#x3D; Fix(Call( Fix(Id(&quot;square&quot;)), Fix(Int(5)) ) 
 Is there a way to avoid doing this, or at least automate it? Does it require specific language features, like Haskell&#x27;s HKTs or OCaml&#x27;s [@@unboxed]?
 I&#x27;d appreciate any thoughts! There is a full example of defining a catamorphism recursion scheme in my linked post.

 It&#x27;s my first blogpost and I&#x27;ve forgotten that I should probably advertise it a bit. It hasn&#x27;t gotten much traction, which I find a bit sad considering I couldn&#x27;t find anything similar; it seems I&#x27;ve actually come up with something new.

 I have created a new module as below to do some test, in function rdwr an Eff is created for both Reader and Writer requests, then function runServer will be run to interpret the Eff created by rdwr.
 The function runServer is a composition of run, runWriter and runReader -- each of them handles specific Eff request and run handles pure result.
 As you can see in function rdwr, first two expressions are Writer requests, then a Reader request, and then another Writer request. Since the first two requests are Writer request but runWriter is the second handler so this line of function handleRelay

 I’m reaching out because I’ve hit a wall after spending 7.5 hours debugging what seemed like a straightforward issue but turned out to be a rabbit hole. I’ve been working on customizing org-agenda export to PDF and initially thought my problem was related to ox-texinfo. I spent half the night tweaking my Emacs configuration, digging through documentation, and adjusting settings in hopes of resolving the issue. I went down a lot of wrong paths before realizing that org-store-agenda-views doesn’t actually call ox-texinfo. That was my first mistake—not diving into the source code earlier.
 Turns out, the function calls org-agenda-write, which in turn executes something entirely different:
 ;; relevant part of org-agenda.el (require &#x27;ps-print) (ps-print-buffer-with-faces (c…</span>

                              <span>Near the end of the talk that introduces Shapeless 3, it&#x27;s mentioned that shapeless3.typeable.Typeable is probably going to be removed because there&#x27;s too much overlap with scala.reflect.Typeable. One feature that&#x27;s unique to the Shapeless variant is the ability to convert a type to a string. If that&#x27;s going to be removed, is there a more canonical way to do it in Scala 3? I haven&#x27;t seen a way to do it with mirrors, but maybe I haven&#x27;t looked hard enough. Rolling my own solution with macros is of course one somewhat cumbersome possibility.

 I needed to ask this question here too.
 Looking into the current and future job market is actually important. So what do you think about the job market for both languages in the next 2-3 or 5 years?

                              <span>Let&#x27;s say I have the following:
 trait Super { val a: Int val b: Boolean val c: Double } case class A extends Super case class B extends Super case class C extends Super case class D extends Super ... object Foo { def foo[T &lt;: Super](bar: T): T } 
 let&#x27;s assume T is an arbitrary case class with the attributes in Super and I want to be able to mutate those 3 fields in Foo.foo (by creating new instances with the mutated field). Assume I&#x27;m not in control of Super (it comes from a 3-rd party lib).
 Is there any way I can use the copy method available in case classes to mutate those 3 attributes? I have read copy is something the scala compiler creates on the fly and it is not really possible to override (doesn&#x27;t come from Product or anything else). Any reasonable alternative to copy (or any way I can use copy?
 I thought about an implicit class over Super and adding a method to mutate it via copy, but it being a trait it does not have a copy method. I could create a new instance of Super with one or more of the fields mutated (as in new Super {...}), but that would force me to down-cast to one of the child case classes right after.

                              <span>I’ve been using company mode with lsp for C++ and Rust for a while. It worked fine. I use this on both Windows and Linux. Last week suddenly the completions became unusably slow on Windows. It stutters after every character. Completely unusable. This is now an issue with both Rust and C++ projects. Seems to be independent of the project size, as small projects are just as bad. Everything is fine on Linux.
 I am guessing it is some update, or some silly change in the environment. Anyone have any ideas? I tried updating packages, I upgraded to Emacs 29.4, updating windows. Nothing helped. Any suggestions for fixing this are super appreciated!

 I&#x27;ve been using Emacs since 1983 and I spend most of my day in it; I think I qualify as an extreme power user. I just went through my init file carefully. It&#x27;s only a few screens long, and 95% of it consists of stuff like:
  (setq-default indent-tabs-mode nil) (setq-default major-mode &#x27;text-mode) (setq-default fill-column 70) (setq-default show-trailing-whitespace t) 
 or
  (global-hl-line-mode) 
 or
  (global-set-key &quot;\C-cz&quot; &#x27;compile) 
 Mostly I just use the defaults and things work fine. The file is not filled with complicated elisp code that requires deep understanding of the language, it&#x27;s j…</span>

 Here are the only Tramp settings i&#x27;m using: 
 (require &#x27;tramp)
 (setq tramp-ssh-controlmaster-options (format &quot;-i %s&quot; &quot;~/.ssh/privatekey.pem&quot;))
 (setq tramp-default-method &quot;ssh&quot;) 
 I&#x27;m able to enter the server with the private key set this way, but if i try to to use sudo, i get &#x27;permission denied (publickey)&#x27; error.
 I&#x27;ve tried different commands:
 (find-file &quot;/ssh:ubuntu@123.23.1.22|sudo::/&quot;)
 (find-file &quot;/ssh:ubuntu@123.23.1.22|sudo:ubuntu:/&quot;)
 (find-file &quot;/ssh:ubuntu@123.23.1.22|sudo:ubuntu@123.23.1.22:/&quot;)
 (find-file &quot;/sudo:ubuntu@123.23.1.22:/&quot;)
 Also tried to use &#x27;tramp-revert-buffer-with-sudo&#x27; with these parameters &#x27;(add-to-list &#x27;tramp-default-user-alist &#x27;(&quot;sudo&quot; &quot;123.23.1.22&quot; &quot;root&quot;))&#x27; and without them. Nothing helps.

                              <span>Title basically has it. I learned the hard way that Emacs has no regex lokkahead / lookbehind.
 I would like to replace every occurenc of &quot;typ&quot;, which is not followed by and [e] with &quot;Typ&quot;.
 I can do a regex-search for typ[^e] but when I use that, the fourth character is captured, thus a replace C-s M-r Typ[^e] M-% Typ will erroneouly replace typId as Typd (deleting the [I]) as it is captured.
 Without lookahead, behind, what is the Emacs way?

                              <span>Improved overall workflow, providing automated scripts to process different formats of electronic documents
 
Enhanced connectivity with other tools; through custom configuration, notes generated by org-zettel-ref-mode can be saved in denote or org-roam format
 
Added quick markup functionality; after highlighting a paragraph in the source file, you can launch &#x3D;org-zettel-quick-markup&#x3D; to quickly add bold, italic, underline, and other markups to the highlighted text
 
 See the new version on Github.
 Are there anybody has questions?

                              <span>Hello,
 Question as stated in the title - does elisp allow creation of aliases for specual forms, e.g. &quot;my_let&quot; to be parsed as standard &quot;let&quot;?
 Basically I&#x27;m looking for possibility to swap any text, kind of &quot;define&quot; equivalent in #c.
 Many thanks in advance to comminity for any help!

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been storing my emacs config in source control for ages and it works a treat. I set up a new machine this week and noticed org mode now has a directory called org-persist, but I can&#x27;t find any docs telling me whether this should go under source control or not.
 So, does anyone know if I should be storing org-persist in source control?

 Is there an option to display those two lines:

 2. In 4 d.:weekly review - rules
 In another section like &#x27;DOINGs&#x27;, &#x27;TODOs&#x27; etc.?

                              <span>I&#x27;m about to finish my book, and was curious what you guys use to publish your writing as an Ebook. Is it still Latex? I&#x27;ve got expierence with Latex, but maybe something better has come along in the meantime. I don&#x27;t know. (Hopefully this is not seen as off-topic, but since I use org to write everything, it kinda qualifies)

                              <span>I have pushed the first commit of a small Scala library that I used for several projects, and may be useful to someone else.
 If you ever need to use geographical points (with latitude and longitude) directly as keys you need to start playing some games as coordinates are floats, besides you sometimes want to aggregate with a certain resolution but later you may need a different one.
 I want to use modern libraries, and all the benefits of Scala 3, ergonomic is important too. I love the fact that Latitudes and Longitudes can not be swapped accidentally and all those little things.
 My biggest concern right now is that there many pieces (neotype, squats, Scalaz, even Cats) and maybe this can be simplified using Zio Prelude.
 It can be found here https://github.com/sisamon/geodesy_scala_3
 And this is the beginning of it, if you do not mind taking a look and providing some feedback I will appreciate it!

                              <span>Yet another SQL library, for scala 3.
 https://sake92.github.io/squery/index.html
 How is it different from others?
  
raw SQL with a string interpolator, thin layer above JDBC, no DSLs
 synchronous only, no Future/IO/F[_] stuff
 context function used to propagate connection/transaction
 handling results is name-based unlike some other libraries. So you don&#x27;t have to do tuples and _1, _2.. easy to make mistakes 
 composition is used for JOINs, so it’s much easier to extract the values
 has some nice helper functions for mapping flat results to structured objects
 
 has a code generator for table rows and CRUD DAOs. Very quick to get started
  
Mostly inspired by https://index.scala-lang.org/jodersky/simplesql and Doobie of course.

as well as using remote build execution (RBE) to offload builds to a remote
build farm. Our customers are interested in leveraging RBE to improve developer
experience and reduce continuous integration (CI) run times, giving us an

like to share how one can deploy one of them, Buildbarn, and
secure all communications in it.

What is it and why do we care?
We want developers to be productive. Being productive requires spending as

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I&#x27;d like to share a new paper we just published that explains how we are bringing statically typed logic programming into Haskell. You can find the paper at: https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20240010266
 https://preview.redd.it/bqorqqc63hld1.png?width&#x3D;800&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;90e2c3d4c6f0d93efebdfcb42192ca70fb79a781
 This approach uses extensible types, a design pattern based on higher kinds, and makes it possible to replace any portion of a value of an algebraic datatype with a logic variable. Here&#x27;s the abstract:
  
ABSTRACT
 Logic programming allows structuring code in terms of predicates or relations, rather than functions. Although logic programming languages present advantages in terms of declarativeness and conciseness, the introduction of static types has not become …</span>

If I&#x27;m using the normal Control.Exception ecosystem and I throw an exception, I can both run a finalizer and catch the exception:
 controlException :: IO () controlException &#x3D; do ref  controlException Left MyEx GOOD: Finalizer ran 
 but if I try the same with pipes-safe the finalizer doesn&#x27;t run:
 pipesSafe :: IO () pipesSafe &#x3D; runSafeT $ runEffect $ do ref  pipesSafe Left MyEx BAD! Finalizer failed to run 
 Am I making a silly error here?

                              <span>Anduril Industries is once again hiring Haskell engineers to work on electromagnetic warfare products. This is a unique opportunity to use Haskell to implement high performance applications in an embedded setting. Anduril has adopted Nix at large and we use IOG&#x27;s generously maintained Haskell.nix project to build all of our Haskell code and ship it to thousands of customer assets across the globe. If you have Haskell experience and are interested in any of:
  
Software defined radios
 
Digital signal processing
 
Numerical computing
 
FPGAs
 
Linux drivers/systems programming
 
Nix/Nixpkgs/NixOS
 
Dhall
 
 please do drop me a line at [travis@anduril.com](mailto:travis@anduril.com), and please also submit your application to our online portal here: https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/andurilindustries/jobs/4460811007?gh_jid&#x3D;4460811007
 To tackle a few common questions:
  
Yes, Anduril is an American defense technology company. We build weapons systems for the United States and its allies.
 
This is a _Haskell_ role. It is not a bait and switch. We are writing applications in GHC Haskell, not some homegrown Haskell-like language or some other programming language. That said, knowledge of C, Rust, or Typescript would be a valuable differentiating factor, as we often rub elbows with codebases that use these languages as well.
 
This is an on-site role at Anduril headquarters in Costa Mesa, California. Our team is building software for hardware products, so physical presence in our RF lab is often required throughout the course of software development and testing. Remote work would only be considered for candidates with something extraordinary to offer to our team.
 
 I&#x27;d be happy to answer any other questions in the thread below.

 (use-package which-key

 I can set up key bindings for instances using 
 (leader-key &quot;dtm&quot; &#x27;(display-time-mode :which-key &quot;display-time-mode&quot;))
 and this works fine .
 But I am trying to define a function which takes two inputs such as the key-bind and the associated command, and set up the key-bind and assign it to which key. Here is my code 
 (defun my-keybind (kb command)
 (leader-key kb command :which-key (symbol-name command)))
 and want to use
 (my-keybind &quot;dtm&quot; &#x27;display-time-mode)
 But the function is not working, I am not quite sure how to fix it.

 I recently rediscovered a small major mode that I had written a while back for dealing with PCGen LST files. This is the data format for PCGen, an open source project similar to HeroLab for building TTRPG characters. At the time, I had to input data for some content that wasn&#x27;t available yet, and I wrote a major mode to make it easier to deal with.
 If anyone is interested, I can pop it up on github to share. It&#x27;s pretty basic - a little bit of keyword highlighting, custom forward/backward -sexp functions, and setting up sane defaults to deal with essentially a TSV file with very long lines.It could almost certainly be expanded/improved, but it got the job done for me at the time.
 Anyhow, if you&#x27;re interested, let me know and I&#x27;ll make it available.

                              <span>Hello, 
 I am new to Emacs, and I frequently forget keybindings, so I often need to search for them by describing what they do. I use C-h d (apropos-documentation) for this purpose, but I find that searching on Google for specific tasks is usually faster. For example, when I was trying to find the mark-whole-buffer command using keywords like &quot;mark all region,&quot; I couldn&#x27;t find the information I needed. Instead I was getting a big chunk of irrelevant documentation. Am I using the approach incorrectly? 
 I would appreciate hearing about your experience.

 This is cute. Wonder if there&#x27;s anything like this for Emacs. Would be curious how fast some of you keyboard navigator wizards are. And compared to a VIM user.

                              <span>Hello there. Finale (music notation software) just died and I remembered how fast I was inputing notes with it. I thought it would be possible to have an input mode in emacs that emulate input mode in software like Finale, Sibelius, and so on, but writing LilyPond code. For instance, when in this mode, numbers select the duration, enter enters a note with this duration. Arrows up and down increase or decrease a half tone, etc. What do you think? Anybody interested?

                              <span>I swear this used to work and I&#x27;m baffled why it stopped.
 I&#x27;m using lsp-mode with company. The company completions do show function arguments, but when I pick a completion candidate, only the function name is inserted and the arguments are not. It used to be that the function name and arguments are inserted as a yasnippet-like snippet and I could fill out the arguments one by one using .
 I&#x27;m using: * lsp-mode 20240823.746, Emacs 29.4, gnu/linux * company version 0.10.2 * I&#x27;m also using company-posframe and company-prescient if that helps. * company-backends is buffer-local: ((company-capf company-dabbrev-code company-keywords company-yasnippet company-files :separate)) * lsp-enable-snippet is t * yasnippet version 20240406.1314 * lsp-clients-clangd-args: (&quot;--limit-results&#x3D;0&quot; &quot;--limit-references&#x3D;0&quot; &quot;--inlay-hints&quot; &quot;--function-arg-placeholders&quot; &quot;--background-index&quot; &quot;--pch-storage&#x3D;disk&quot; &quot;--malloc-trim&quot; &quot;-j&#x3D;8&quot; &quot;--header-insertion&#x3D;iwyu&quot; &quot;--completion-style&#x3D;detailed&quot; &quot;--clang-tidy&quot; &quot;--all-scopes-completion&quot; &quot;--header-insertion-decorators&quot; &quot;--header-insertion-decorators&#x3D;0&quot;)
 Any help would be appreciated, thank you.
 EDIT: I&#x27;m using clangd and this is where it&#x27;s broken. I tested with a Rust buffer using rust-analyzer and it works.
 SOLVED: I just replaced clangd with ccls and it works.

 i am trying to combine both the buffer local tabs and the predefined list but it seems its out of my expertise

                              <span>After using variable-pitch-mode in some buffers, now my minibuffer messages appear with my current variable-pitch face, whereas the minibuffer prompt and input use the minibuffer-prompt face as expected.
 The default face uses a monospaced font which is the same returned by (frame-parameter nil &#x27;font), so minibuffer messages aren&#x27;t using either the default face or frame&#x27;s default one.
 Where is the face for minibuffer messages stored? Thank you.

                              <span>I use org-drill for spaced repetition drilling, and often when doing a review session, during a question I think of something I&#x27;d like to follow up on later. Maybe add a new question, or investigate something related, or...whatever. Just some note to do later.
 The drill mode is extremely agressive about capturing all keystrokes, so if it&#x27;s waiting for the user to hit a key and then ask me how well I did, I really can&#x27;t do anything else with emacs. And of course I want to make these notes in emacs, and not switch over to some other editor like some kind of barbarian. :)
 Is there any way I can escape or bypass or otherwise allow myself to make notes during a drill session? 
 Ideally, I&#x27;d like something where the drill session only &quot;takes over&quot; the relevant buffer, but still allows other windows and for the user to switch to/from the drill buffer/session.
 Then I could have two windows, one with my drill session running, and during the session if I think of a note, I switch to the other buffer, make my note, and switch back and do more drill stuff.
 EDIT: as /u/queyenth points out, just doing e from the drill prompt lets you escape out of the drill prompt. The idea is to edit the question, but you can do off and do whatever you like, and then just do org-drill-resume and it, well, resumes exactly where you left off.
 So, the solution is: when I&#x27;m looking at a drill question and my ADHD brain spews a bunch of related things and I need to get them out of my head or I&#x27;ll forget them:
  
Do e, which org-drill says means &quot;edit&quot; but to me means &quot;escape the very agressive drill prompt&quot;.
 
Make notes, play Tetris, deflect cosmic rays to flip bits on my hard drive, etc.
 
Do org-drill-resume.

                              <span>To my understanding and for my use case, vscode-json-languageserver seems to be the most promising language server.
 According to the link, the language server supports formatting, renaming, completion using JSON Schema. Eglot seems to follow a conservative approach concerning LS features and none seems to work out of the box.
 For example when I open the Eglot menu, Find definitions, find references, Find type definiton all is greyed out.
 If point is on a sympol and I call M-x eglot-rename I am prompted to rename the identifier but after RET I get the error eglot--error: [eglot] Unsupported or ignored LSP capability &#x60;:renameProvider&#x27;
 I didn&#x27;t configure Eglot at all. I am also using the gopls LS for Golang development, didn&#x27;t configure anything either and featuers &quot;just work&quot;. Not so for vscode-json-languageserver. Here is my init.el
 Does anyone have a working example how Eglot needs to be configured to use at least a subset of this LS features?

                              <span>Holy dromedary. I spent hours trying to figure out why the heck Emacs for some reason would get stuck while I try to go to the next line, forcing me to press the key again and again.
 Ran the profiler a bunch of times, tried disabling modes, opened larger and smaller files, went through the git log, installed different versions of Emacs, switched machines and tried some other things. After two days of frustration, I noticed the problem worsening. As it turns out, a minuscule speck of dust was lodged in my key-well. Blast it! With Emacs, there&#x27;s almost always some bizarre shit, and the immediate knee-jerk reaction to anything unusual is to assume that it&#x27;s broken. Emacs is good, and Emacs is never broken (unless when it is 😀).
 Talk about confirmation bias.

 What&#x27;s the right way for title and heading? Depending on what style I use, I may get a duplicate heading or seeing table of contents in the weird place, or so.
 Option1:
 #+TITLE: title some text * Heading 1 content ** Heading 2 some others 
 Option2:
 #+TITLE: title * title some text ** Heading 1 content *** Heading 2 some others 
 Option3:
 #+TITLE: title * Overview some text * Heading 1 content ** Heading 2 some others

                              <span>Hi everyone.  I&#x27;ve mentioned a few times how an important purpose of my ZK is to help me write a personal/family history.  This has been an ongoing project in my ZK for 3-4 years.  The process so far has been:
Simply writing zettels on random topics of interest to me or based on memories that pop into my head randomly (or prompted by a conversation with a friend).  That continued for about three years without me doing much to integrate the information.  I was content to build my database, which had grown to about 400 zettels.
This year, I got a kick in the pants from a daughter who knew what I was doing and gave me a Christmas present in the form of a service called Storyworth.  Since then, I have been writing longer, more coherent stories.  Every week, I get a question, and I respond with…</span>

How would you incorporate photos into your zk?
I&#x27;d like to take 4x6 prints and incorporate them.  Would you use a photo editing program to put in the reference number or would you use a sleeve?
Seems a perfect integration to me.</span>

                              <span>Hello everyone,
Am new to the method, so naturally am still exploring its intents and purposes. I&#x27;ve decided to start using it for my research on courses about machine learning applied to geology, machine learning itself or geology itself. I&#x27;m used to writing stuff down linearly in my paper notebook - not only am accostumed to it, but I also feel pretty good doing so. It makes more sense to me, I guess, to jolt down in a notebook something thorough and linear as a course, more sense than writing atomic notes at least. I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m &quot;stuck to the hold habits&quot; or that&#x27;s actually somewhat the way to go. I wanted to try Zettelkasten to be more dynamic in my note-writing, as well as faster - for as much as I like and absorb better on paper, I roughly take one hour per page. Insanity.
My &quot;notes&quot; in my notebook are more of a summary of the thing I am consuming than simplified notes per se; I like to make them so that when I need to check the subject in the future once it is forgotten, I will be able to quickly comprehend it again. Which is why I am feeling using the notebook, rather than Zettelkasten, makes more sense.
Or perhaps I can make atomic notes on the subject and link them on an &quot;index&quot; of some sort in my Zettelkasten? An index such as &quot;Course X/Y/Z&quot; with the individual atomic notes?
Thanks for any input.</span>

                              <span>Hello everyone. I developed a small library based on quill, which is written in scala. It allows you to create correct SQL queries during compilation and display them to the user. I originally started this project because there is essentially no runtime overhead compared to the database driver. Although this approach has its problems, such as increased compilation time and sometimes the need to move code to different modules due to stage restrictions. However, I think this is an interesting approach that is worth considering.

 I am writing a client library for NATS topic based messaging. I am trying to define the API implementation through which to interact with the library, along with the data structure of the client. The client will need to 
  
read from a socket to fetch messages (this can be a single sync thread)
 
accept async requests to write messages to the socket, along with updating the client&#x27;s topic router
 
 Question
 I initially started implementing this functionality using the state monad, however this will cause problems as soon as async requests occur (e.g. one thread will be updating the client&#x27;s read messages into a buffer, another will be updating the topic router, overwriting the former changes)
 There appears to be a library for concurrent state, this feels like it could be a solution for my problem, but I wanted to check with those more experienced in Haskell - does this approach make sense, or am I missing a more simple solution? I assume adding more granular concurrency control over each resource would be lead to a more efficient, but more complicated implementation, so I&#x27;d prefer simple for the time being.
 TL;DR
 If I want a data structure that has &#x27;mutable&#x27; state, that will be accessed across threads/async, does the concurrent state library make the most sense?
 Thanks in advance

                              <span>Hey folks! I wrote Scala for nearly 7 years in my full time job as well as side projects. Since then, I&#x27;ve been working on other things and using other languages like Rust/TypeScript/Go, etc.
 I kinda miss Scala a bit though so thinking of coming back after several nearly 4 years long break. It looks like a lot has changed.
 What libraries/ecosystems are y&#x27;all using these days? What&#x27;s popular for HTTP, Database, etc? Back in my day, Doobie and Cats with http4s were considered cool. I&#x27;m wondering what&#x27;s changed.
 I also completely missed out Scala 3 and the transition. Where are we with that now? Is it still true that a lot of people still use Scala 2?

 Scala does not look bad in this ranking! Especially when it comes to jobs.

                              <span>After 8 months using emacs as my daily driver I still consider myself an emacs newbie. I came from Vim world (yep, it was preinstalled in my Linux since forever…long story) and after a long research I decided give a try to emacs, with evil package of course… I cannot forget my roots. So why not Doom? recommended for ex-vimers, fast, mature and it ships pretty sane defaults. Ironically the problem is that it does its job just fine! everything is already done, all plugins I can need now or in the future are well configured. But I want more: I want to configure it by myself, to understand elisp code and own my emacs.d, I want minimalism…and I feel I’ve failed.
 Any recommendation? anyone has felt like me? Thank you, this is my first post

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently using doom emacs with WSL. I have been using the (java + lsp) lang package and it has been working well. However, I can&#x27;t seem to get the lsp to work with the javafx libraries (i.e no autocomplete or syntax highlighting). I am also using a the maven build tool. 
 It is my understanding that if you have the javafx dependencies declared in your pom.xml file then it should work? I am aware a thread on this was made a year ago but according to those users it was simply a matter of updating the pom file? I think I&#x27;ve added the javafx dependencies correctly because I can run javafx applications.
 I&#x27;ve ran 
 mvn eclipse:eclipse 
 and generated a .classpath file. I&#x27;ve restarted the lsp server but the issue persists, I&#x27;ve also added this to my config.el file.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been using Emacs for all my (rather limited) text editing and bash scripting needs for years, and am finally getting round to seriously learning c++, partly thanks to the excitement in recent years over things like lsp-mode, eglot and tree-sitter. 
 A quick search through this sub, however, shows frustrated posts every couple of years over emacs&#x27; performance as a c++ ide. My (perhaps optimistic) suspicion is that it&#x27;ll be more than sufficient for my purposes, given that I&#x27;m a long way off from million line codebases and so on, so I probably won&#x27;t need or want full ide functionality for a while. 
 So, assuming that my needs are fairly simplistic, is it reasonable as a beginner programmer learning c++ to be using emacs for (more-or-less) my entire learning environment, or am I missing out in ways I don&#x27;t yet understand? I currently have pdf-tools for reading a textbook in one fullscreen frame on one monitor, and then 2 windows side-by-side on another monitor - the cpp file (or header or makefile or whatever) I&#x27;m editing on one side, and the other side for the output of M-x compile (which I&#x27;ve bound to C-c c) or a M-x shell (bound to C-c s).
 I would love some recommendations for things that I don&#x27;t yet know I&#x27;ll want. For example, syntax highlighting in c++-mode seems good enough so far - do I want to be using c++-ts? If so, is the grammar on the tree-sitter github page the one to use? Do I want ide style features like symbol/definition navigation, corrections, reformatting, completion as you type? Any suggestions for configs focused on those sorts of features? I&#x27;m not a fan of big starter kits like doom, but would love to read other people&#x27;s configs for things that I can apply myself.
 I know this is all a bit vague, so apologies for that. I guess I don&#x27;t really know what I&#x27;m looking for, which is sort of the point. Many thanks for reading this!

 It occured to me that the Orgzly app hadn&#x27;t been updated for several years, so I went looking. It turns out that the original project is no-longer maintained, but development is continuing in a fork.

                              <span>My Zettelkasten has been around for about 2.5 years now. After about six months, I had the idea of tidying up the Zettelkasten for the first time. Somehow it bothered me that parts of the box looked very tidy, while others looked quite chaotic.
Initially, my activities to improve this situation were still very sporadic and unsystematic. I lacked a ‘method for tidying up’. But it wasn&#x27;t so easy to find. Even my favourite source ‘How to take smart notes’ by Sönke Ahrens didn&#x27;t help me.
Why don&#x27;t I use Marie Kondo&#x27;s method? She already helps me tidy up my socks. Why can&#x27;t she also improve the situation in my Zettelkasten ? Thought, done: Since 14 May 2023 (create date, Zettelkasten), I have been tidying up using the method.
But I can do even better. Today, while I was tidying up my Zettelkasten, I was offered the note ‘Simplicity’. And Google was kind enough to point me to ‘The Five Elements’ within Feng Shui via ‘The Principle of Clarity’.
And yes, Feng Shui has been identified by scientists and philosophers as both non-scientific and pseudoscientific, and has been described as a paradigmatic example of pseudoscience. But it has helped me to find a different way of looking at my Zettelkasten. Looking at WOOD, FIRE, EARTH, METAL and WATER makes new connections that were invisible without this framework.
I also added &quot;The Five Principles&quot; which helped me to find the right balance to tidy up my Zettelkasten.

  
What experiences have you had? What is the best way to tidy up a Zettelkasten?</span>

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I&#x27;m trying to configure a Literate DevOps workflow using Org Mode in Emacs. My goal is to dynamically insert a password, retrieved via password-store-get, into a shell script. However, when I use the noweb syntax &gt; in my shell block, it just inserts the Emacs Lisp code instead of the evaluated result.
 Here&#x27;s what I have so far:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 +name: get-passwd
 +begin_src emacs-lisp
 (password-store-get &quot;my-pass-store/postgres/pass&quot;)
 +end_src
 +begin_src shell :shebang &quot;#!/usr/bin/env bash&quot; :tangle /ssh:remote-host|sudo:deploy@remote-host:postgres/secret-secret.sh :noweb yes
 export DB_PASSWORD&#x3D;&gt; podman secret create --env POSTGRES_PASSWORD DB_PASSWORD
 +end_src
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 When I tangle this, the generated script still contains the function call instead of the actual password:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; bash
 !/usr/bin/env bash
 export DB_PASSWORD&#x3D;(password-store-get &quot;my-pass-store/postgres/pass&quot;) podman secret create --env POSTGRES_PASSWORD DB_PASSWORD &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 I’d like the script to include the actual password rather than the function. Does anyone know how I can achieve this? Any tips or simpler solutions would be greatly appreciated!

                              <span>Here is my situation: I have a production binary that enters a rogue infinite loop, and that I have compiled with the appropriate options for time profiling. I want to get a .prof out of a test run where I will inevitably have to kill the binary. 
 Pressing ^C once does not seem to do anything, and a second ^C kills the binary and produces an empty .prof file. What am I missing? 
 For context, here the relevant part of my cabal.project.local file:
 profiling: True profiling-detail: all-functions 
 And I use the following options for all components of my cabal package:
  ghc-prof-options: -fprof-auto 
 as well as the +RTS -p -RTS CLI option.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve never really been satisfied with most terminal emulators (Warp is really good, but it&#x27;s not open source, and it makes you sign in to an account). I thought creating one would be a good first large project to do in Haskell. I&#x27;m looking for some direction on which libraries would be good to use - for rendering the text, communicating with pty/tty etc. One feature that is a must-have is having a real GUI textfield for inputing commands that works well with a mouse, allows selecting text and so on.
 I was thinking of using the Haskell bindings to Dear IMGUI.

 I discovered the bound library for handling bound variables - and i&#x27;ts great...one problem though: It seems to break writing algebras.

                              <span>Hello, can one make a completion-at-point function act as a Company backend? I looked at the cape package, but it only provides a cape-company-to-capf for the opposite translation.
 Why am I asking? I&#x27;m running both Eglot and Codeium and I&#x27;d like to keep completions by eglot-completion-at-point and codeium-completion-at-point separate. My current configuration is below. Thank you.
  
(setq-local completion-at-point-functions &#x27;(codeium-completion-at-point eglot-completion-at-point t)) (setq-local company-backends &#x27;(company-capf)) ;; I&#x27;d like to have &#x27;(company-eglot company-codeium) instead. (setq-local company-frontends &#x27;(company-pseudo-tooltip-unless-just-one-frontend-with-delay company-preview-if-just-one-frontend))

                              <span>hi i have been enjoying my time in eamcs , as a replacement of tmux i am using workspace feature of doom emacs (are u using any better alternative ?) and the only things i am missing are my commandline tui programs i really have a muscle memory of firing some tuis for quick work and eshell didnt allow it so i enabled vterm but many of emacs keybindings are conflicting with the tui ones . i just want to enable the most required keys and disable all other and disable evil as well. can u help me plz on this issue to just make me forget that i am using vterm or any other standalone terminal.
 I dont exaclty know what i may need to re-enable in future so is there a way to get do above and tackle this problem as well. I hope someone already have done this in their config

 lua is loading in org-babel-load-languages and org-src-fontify-natively is set to true but lua source blocks are not highlighted. 
 Other source blocks like python and c work as expected. Do I miss something in config file beside those two settings?

                              <span>When using emms with mpv, is there any way to get rid of duplicate music track notifications in gnome?
 I use emms with mpv as the player. It all works great. My only little issue is that in the gnome panel I always have two notifications of the current track. I run emacsclient and on startup that creates a notification automatically before running emms that just says &quot;unknown title.&quot; Then when I play emms, I get a notification that indicates the track and has a thumbnail, and a second duplicate notification, except without a thumbnail.
 I have tried turning off notifications in gnome settings for both emacs and for mpv and that has no effect.
 I am using Pop!_22.04 with gnome 42.9 and emacs 28. The relevant part of my emms config is the following:
  
(require &#x27;emms-setup)
 (require &#x27;emms-mpris)
 (emms-all)
 (emms-default-players)
 (emms-mpris-enable)
 (setq emms-player-list &#x27;(emms-player-mpv))
 (setq emms-source-file-default-directory &quot;~/Music/&quot;)
 (setq emms-info-functions &#x27;(emms-info-tinytag))
 (setq emms-browser-covers &#x27;emms-browser-cache-thumbnail-async)
 (setq emms-playing-time-display-mode nil)
  
I know this might really be a gnome issue. But I have searched and got no answers so I thought I&#x27;d try here. Rhythmbox also shows duplicate notifications, though both have thumbnails. The only music player I&#x27;ve tried that has just one notification with a nice thumbnail seems to be Lollypop.

                              <span>I mean a way to mark inserts and suggested removals. I don&#x27;t want a version control.
 Example
  Some text ~~this is a part that the editor marked to be removed~~, some more text ++and this is the editor addition++ [with the justification of the inserted text] and here is the rest.

                              <span>Title. Rather than executing the expected org-move-subtree-up, M-k does nothing. All the other directional keys work as expected with M. M-UP also works as expected. When looking at the Messages buffer, M-k produces no messages when operating on regular paragraphs, but when used on headings (and only headings) it produces this:
 Invalid face attribute :foreground nil [x times]
 The number of times increments anywhere from 20-40+ on each input of M-k. I am currently using DOOM Emacs, and have tried completely removing all Emacs files and then reinstalling multiple times with no luck. This has been a problem for several months now, and after looking on the internet and finding nothing of use, I decided I would finally post a question here.
 System: Ubuntu Studio 23.10 running on a Thinkpad P15 Gen 2i
 Please let me know any other information that would be useful to solving this. I am an Emacs newbie, so be kind.
 EDIT: Current troubleshooting data
  
Problem persists on both X and Wayland
 Problem persists when all packages except evil-org are removed
 C-h k M- returns expected information on org-metaup. Similar results for other directional keys 
 M-k is listed as an alternate keybinding
 
 C-h k M-k returns nothing. It seems that M-k never makes it to Emacs 
 This is strange, as M-k does produce text in the Messages buffer when used on headings
 M-k also causes the mode line to flash, if pressed repeatedly
 
 On my other system, running Artix and i3, this problem does not present

                              <span>Hi, everyone. I&#x27;ve been using a hybrid ZK system as my fleeting notes are on my notebook daily journals, reference notes on 4x6 cards, and main notes in Obsidian.
For the past few months, I&#x27;ve taken a lot of reference notes on 4x6 cards ranging from Coursera courses, academic journals to books and even my own daily journal.
After converting them into main notes for 3 weeks, I now have a question, which is hilarious but did bother me a lot. The question is how should I sequence my reference note cards for a course or a book because I might have notes on two cards for 2 chapters or for a combination of different lesson videos.
I watch some YouTube videos, but it looks like no one have talked about sequencing of reference note cards?</span>

                              <span>I know I&#x27;m late to the party but I wanted to share my experience for those who, like me, heard about it and thought it sounded nice but would be a lot of work to transition your existing configs.
 It integrates with use-package and straight so transitioning is surprisingly easy, for me at least. And now that I have transitioned, I can try packages quickly and easily, and best of all without stalling my session.
 Thanks very much u/nv-elisp, not only did he write elpaca, he&#x27;s also been really active on reddit, I came across many of his comments answering peoples questions when I was looking into switching to elpaca.

                              <span>Quick update on my Previous post, I am making progress - need to stabilize the api, make sure the svg drawing can work with any font/screen (currently it&#x27;s based on my 16pt font), and will test it for a while to see that it&#x27;s stable.
 I added a new design, with the title on the left. Let me know what you think and if you have any feedback/ideas on usability/features that you think would be important for the first release and I&#x27;ll try to incorporate it before releasing.
 Added a corfu (and corfu-popupinfo) mode, inspired by Manueljlin&#x27;s if emacs was made by zoomers post. Will try to move the icons on the title bar instead of &#x27;Corfu&#x27; before releasing.
 BTW any package name ideas?
 The new design + corfu:

 I do most of my development locally and test on a remote machine, where TRAMP is simply too slow for code intelligence and responsiveness. To improve this, I am sharing a mode for asynchronous file syncing using &#x60;unison&#x60;. I did so after trying several other similar approaches, including ones based on rsync (https://github.com/r-zip/rsync-mode).
 My solution is probably due to specifics of secure compute environments managed by coder, but it works well for me, and should be general purpose. Hope someone finds it useful, too!

 I implemented some of the solutions suggested in that post and I am getting new error message
 the code I am trying to run is this :
 val spark &#x3D; SparkSession. builder ().appName(&quot;MzMagic&quot;).master(&quot;local[*]&quot;).getOrCreate() import spark.implicits._ val lines &#x3D; spark.readStream.format(&quot;socket&quot;).option(&quot;host&quot;, &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;).option(&quot;port&quot;, 9999).load() val words &#x3D; lines.as[String].flatMap(_.split(&quot; &quot;)) val wordCounts &#x3D; words.groupBy(&quot;value&quot;).count() val query &#x3D; wordCounts.writeStream.outputMode(&quot;complete&quot;).format(&quot;console&quot;).start() query.awaitTermination() 
 but I am getting this error:

and I am running it with java enviorment variable --add-exports java.base/sun.nio.ch&#x3D;ALL-UNNAMED in intellij idea
 keep in mind I have tried to setup spark on both debian and windows with spark 3.3 and 3.5 with java 11 and java 17 and I am still getting the same error message

Also was trying to practice some functional programming, I am more into Java. Could you help me with review of my vector search on lucene prototype with Advanced Vector Extensions support. I implemented index writer and reader with REST API wrapper on Akka, my main doubts is should I use for web server something Cat Effects related or Akka is good enough? Any scala best practices comeents on my code are very welcome:)

                              <span>Hello! I am new to this forum and Zettelkasten. Do I take literature notes on permanent notes in my case? If not, how to convert literature notes into permanent notes?
Today I was reading the book Atomic Habits on my iPad in the kindle app and there was an option to take notes on a specific line/word in the book. I read about 20-25 pages and marked a lot of information (there is an option - I can mark lines and words in blue, red, orange and yellow colors). So, as I was reading I took a lot of literature notes in the app (in total 15-20) and it was not one note that contained all the literature notes. I wrote all these notes with my own words and I noticed that I was describing some ideas very differently but the essence remained the same and I referred to what the author wanted to convey, but in different words. And sometimes I even supplemented these ideas with my own thoughts.
Now I am using Obsidian and wrote down these ideas from my iPad to my computer in Obsidian as literature notes. Some of them were similar, so I filtered them out. But I do not think these are literature notes. They seem like permanent notes. In my case, when I make such notes, are they permanent or literature notes? And sorry for my bad English. If I made any mistakes, please correct me. I will be very grateful for any answer!</span>

 I just wrote small interpretator in Haskell (from Thorsten Bell&#x27;s &#x27;Writing interpreter in Go&#x27; book), code is here GitHub
 So far i just evaluate set of statements which are provided with getLine (or read from file) and next input is evaluated with empty initital state (so no variables from last evaluated set of statements are not keeped in state). I want it to be like ghci - endless loop of evalution with state kept. But i not very good in all transformers shenannigans so far, any help would be appreciated!

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been writing some scripts using scala-cli, but it seems that there&#x27;s no easy way to have a script which starts instantly. So I wrote a small wrapper script over scala-cli/GraalVM which reuses the compiled binary it detects that the script content hasn&#x27;t changed.
 https://github.com/jatcwang/instant-scala
 The script quite bare-bones as I&#x27;m hoping that scala-cli will have first-class support for this in the future. But meanwhile hope this can help someone else too :)

 and when I run the program with just a &quot;Hello world&quot; println it compiles and runs successfully and also when importing and referencing the spark libraries they are loaded without any problems
 the problem I am facing is in the begining when I try to create a SparkContext or SparkSession like this
 val spark &#x3D; SparkSession. builder ().appName(&quot;name-of-app&quot;).master(&quot;local[*]&quot;).getOrCreate() 
 and run the code an error is produced 
 Exception in thread &quot;main&quot; java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/apache/spark/sql/SparkSession$
 at Main$.main(Main.scala:8) at Main.main(Main.scala)

 what am I doing wrong?

 Flycheck is fine with the first line. But it flags the second line like this:

 Why is Flycheck fine with the first line but not with the second line?

                              <span>Fresh install of 24.04. Issue as presented in the title; hit Super to bring up overview, type &#x27;emacs&#x27;, hit enter (same issue with emacs (client) as with emacs): window opens but doesn&#x27;t receive focus. 
 If I pin emacs to the dash and open it by clicking there it does receive focus (emacs and emacs (client)). Double-clicking the binary directly in the file explorer and running emacs in the terminal both similarly give focus.
 I&#x27;ve searched for a bit online and the closest I&#x27;ve seen to this exact problem is this: (link) (although this: (link) suggests someone has the same problem).
 One thing to note: this problem only occurs under Wayland proper. When under X11 (Xwayland), emacs gets focus correctly (my machine switches if I enable/disable hybrid graphics and reboot). 
  
 Given what I&#x27;ve found, I think it&#x27;s clear the problem is something with Wayland and xdg-activation or whatever it is, meaning it&#x27;s probably something I can&#x27;t solve. But just in case, has anyone had this problem and figured out a workaround (other than just launching emacs any other way)?

                              <span>I&#x27;m know I&#x27;m asking this at a Scala channel but I&#x27;m counting on those who have experience/knowledge on both Scala and other FP languages. The intention is not to start a flamewar with things like x is definitively better than y, but just actual facts to understand where Scala sits compared to the other FP languages. I&#x27;m not a FP expert. I did a few things here and there, but for sure I don&#x27;t have solid foundations to take my own conclusions, yet.
 I would say that the reason I&#x27;m asking this is due to some comments I saw at the r/haskell. The main points were:
  
The mix between OO and FP. To some degree I find this odd as well and I still don&#x27;t see the value of it.
 How Scala had and still do lots of compromises because it&#x27;s so dependent on the JVM which has a totally different model. 
 Overall complexity of the language. I would say that this is better at Scala 3, but still, I find the language really, really hard.
 How easy it is to start mixing up functional and non functional code which defeats the whole purpose of writing the functional code. OCaml suffers from this as well, but I would say that is way harder to do the same on Haskell or Erlang.
  
Thanks!

                              <span>This is Kyo&#x27;s largest release so far! It contains a major redesign of the library, introduces several new effects, and is a significant leap towards Kyo 1.0 🚀
  
Layers: The Layer effect provides managed Env values inspired by ZIO. It offers APIs for manual composition as well as a macro-based Layer.init method that automatically wires multiple layers. Layers use a new Memo effect to manage the lifecycle of components and support any other effects that may be required by their initialization. Developed by @hearnadam @kitlangton
 Caliban Integration: The Resolvers effect integrates with Caliban and kyo-tapir to serve GraphQL queries. The integration is designed so queries can contain arbitrary Kyo effects. Developed by @ghostdogpr
 Combinators: The Zikyo project is now incorporated into Ky…</span>

                              <span>I posted this elsewhere (today), but I felt it deserved its own discussion thread, so I have kicked off that discussion here.
Recently, I&#x27;ve been looking for a solution to more fully integrate my ZK with my daily journaling, planning, and task management.  I came close to finding that in NotePlan, which I loved and have used for about three years.  It did a great job of integrating everything except my ZK, which I maintained in The Archive.  The hump there was that NotePlan used a somewhat different file format from The Archive (both used text files, but in different ways).  I was slowly trying to build up steam to write a Python script to convert from one format to the other, and due to other priorities, I didn&#x27;t get to it.
I came across Logseq (recommended by someone on this forum) and h…</span>

                              <span>The Hydrogen Framework for Emacs:
 https://codeberg.org/joe-adams/hydrogen
 Hydrogen is a very small framework that aims to make Emacs easier to use for people who are used to text editors other than Emacs or Vi. It gives you modern keybindings, improves the behavior of tabs and windows and a few other things.
 Some highlights:
  
Under 200k, including comments, the GPL, etc.
 The actual code is under 30k.
 No external packages, does not impose a package manager on you.
 Composed of several features that can individually be activated or deactivated.
 Modern keybindings 
 C-c for copy, C-a for select all, etc.
 
 Tab is just tab if no text is selected.
 Generally stops Emacs from opening new tabs when you open new buffers
 Closes windows when you close the last tab
 Dired doesn&#x27;t new buffers when you navigate to new directories.
 A splash screen
 Heavily commented code base
 Code says the default values of settings that are changed.
  
Please let me know what you think and if you have any suggestions. Please consider recommending Hydrogen to any new Emacs users you know.

                              <span>I have a project setup where all frontend development is fully dockerized: That means that node modules
 live inside a docker container so tide complaints for all imports that derive from installed packages,
 i.e Cannot find module &#x27;mobx&#x27; or its corresponding type declarations.
 Is there a way to setup tide to look for installed libraries inside a docker container?

 but the problem is I am using &#x60;q&#x60; too much for quitting, but for some reason it&#x27;s conflicting with macro recording, for that reason I would like to remap this functionality into another key. or maybe I am wrong and I should not use &#x60;q&#x60; for quitting?

                              <span>I’m trying to make the switch from VSCode to doom-emacs but when I run tests I can’t seem to jump from rust stack traces to the actual source, in my project or in dependencies.
 Is there any way I can configure emacs to do that?

                              <span>What is the best practice for using warp with sqlite to get the best write performance?
 First try was
 main :: IO () main &#x3D; run 8080 app where app \_ res &#x3D; withConnection &quot;/tmp/test.db&quot; $ \\conn -&gt; do execute\_ conn &quot;insert into message (id, message) values (1, &#x27;Some message&#x27;)&quot; res $ responseLBS status200 \[\] &quot;&quot; 
 after callling
 httperf --server localhost --port 8080 --num-conns 200 --rate 100 --num-calls 10 --timeout 2 
 i&#x60;m getting db lock errors and some messages are getting lost
 Using a resource pool doesn&#x27;t make things better
 I decided to write in one thread
 Second try
 main :: IO () main &#x3D; do chan  execute\_ conn &quot;insert into message (id, message) values (1, &#x27;Some message&#x27;)&quot; run 8080 $ app chan where app chan \_ res &#x3D; do writeChan chan &quot;&quot; res $ responseLBS status200 \[\] &quot;&quot; 
 after callling httperf no message were lost.
