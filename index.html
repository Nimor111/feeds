                              <span>I have two machines: my laptop and a VPS. They do not share a filesystem. I regularly ssh into the server from the laptop and work on the commandline. I use a terminal emulator which runs in emacs on the laptop. Sometimes this involves opening files, often automatically, in $EDITOR (e.g. for a git commit). I want to configure $EDITOR so that the instance of emacs running the terminal emulator is also used as $EDITOR on the server, when I&#x27;m sshed into it. Ideally, I&#x27;d like to set it up so that if I ssh from a terminal which isn&#x27;t running in emacs, a different program (one local to the server, e.g. nano) will be used, but that&#x27;s a later question.
 How can I do this? I&#x27;ve read a cursory explanation here, but that seems to require a shared filesystem, and it&#x27;s pretty brief -- I&#x27;m new to any kind of networking. I do like the idea of using emacsserver to achieve all this though.
 TIA!

                              <span>Im migrating from Jetbrains Pycharm into Emacs and I was wondering if there is a way I can get autocompletions similar to Pycharm, this is:
 1 - Some way of &quot;auto importing&quot; modules (or at least some way of given a class/function get the option to import it)
 2 - LSP for internal stuffs, atm my lsp desnt seem to &quot;know&quot; about many homebrew classes&#x27; methods we have in our project.
 Here is the current LSP cfg i have on my emacs
 (use-package pyvenv
 :config
 (pyvenv-mode 1))
 (use-package python-mode
 :ensure t
 :hook (python-mode . lsp-deferred)
 :custom
 ;; NOTE: Set these if Python 3 is called &quot;python3&quot; on your system!
 (python-shell-interpreter &quot;python3&quot;)
 (dap-python-executable &quot;python3&quot;)
 (dap-python-debugger &#x27;debugpy)
 :config
 (require &#x27;dap-python))
 ​
 ​
 (use-package company
 :after lsp-mode
 :hook (lsp-mode . company-mode)
 :bind (:map company-active-map
 (&quot;&quot; . company-complete-selection))
 (:map lsp-mode-map
 (&quot;&quot; . company-indent-or-complete-common))
 :custom
 (company-minimum-prefix-length 1)
 (company-idle-delay 0.0))
 ​
 (use-package company-box
 :hook (company-mode . company-box-mode))
 ​
 (use-package importmagic
 :ensure t
 :config
 (add-hook &#x27;python-mode-hook &#x27;importmagic-mode)) 
 ​
 ​
 Maybe I just need a clear example of how to set up LSP properly, thanks in advance guys, sorry if im asking anything too obvious/stupid

 I can&#x27;t see anything like that in the options.
 Is there some way to do that directly in Git?

                              <span>After installing themes from repos by cloning them mostly from Github into my themes directory it looks I need to copy the theme-xx.el files to the top-level themes directory to get them to be detected.
 I am not sure whether some or all of the files which remaining in the repo subdirectories need to be copied to the top level themesdirectory, but I presume that some of the files may be necessary to the full and correct functioning of the themes, such as the contents of their img directories.
 There is also the matter of not being able to commit their directories because they are git repos themselves and I don&#x27;t know how useful it may be to add them as sub-repos.
 How do I work my way around this?
 Is there some means of installing a theme by running some additonal code in some files it is associated with or is just copying the main theme files to your themes folder enough?
 Maybe my theme installation code needs to iterate every directory in the themes directory and execute a file .el matching the directory name, rather than just placing them in the themes directory?

                              <span>I have a file I depend on daily for a reference that is getting quite long. I export it as an html file with org-info.js. Because of how og-info.js works, it is loading slowly and flashes as the js waits and tries to determine how long the file is and all its headers (I think this is how it works).
 I was just reading about css :has() property and thought, why can&#x27;t that be used in loading up an exported html file?
 What I want as an end result is a Table of Contents, and then clicking on each link, displays the section under that org heading with links to sub-headings.
 I think the closest alternative is the ReadTheOrg theme, but I would like it without a sidebar.
 Anyone know any alternatives or js free versions?
 If not, any guidance on how I would approach this situation with my own css and if needed only minimal js?

I can see globals using ESS-rdired. But when I step through a debug browser(), I would like rdired to update to show only the local variables. I can inspect them via the console but the immediate overview is an RStudio advantage for me. Am I missing something? How do you R experts on Emacs deal with it?

 Everything is perfect. I am now stopped at this error. I have enabled this in my google settings but nothing.

                              <span>Hi everybody!
 I&#x27;m a Software Engineer Master student (2nd semester) located in Denmark, and have recently chosen to quit my previous student job meaning I&#x27;m currently looking for a new one. I&#x27;d love to get to develop in Haskell (I know it&#x27;s most likely not possible), and was wondering if anyone knows any company/project that may be willing to have a student worker, most likely remotely?
 I&#x27;ve programmed in Haskell for a bit more than a year now, and have recently passed a functional programming course at my university (1st semester on the master), where we programmed in Haskell.
 Please let me know if I should fill my post with additional info (experience, preferences, etc.).
 Thank you for your help!

                              <span>I do not know Haskell, or much functional programming, but I’ve been digging through research papers in a particular field of interest and Haskell is used in most of them.
 After further research, I’ve come to an assessment that Haskell is considered a “white paper” language that isn’t used outside of universities and enthusiasts. I’ve looked into it a bit, as well as other functional languages and realized I’ve been using functional programming for most of my career without really considering it. I use power query from excel for data migration, and it is a functional language called “m code” that is related to F#.
 I think it may be worth while to learn Haskell, mainly as it forms the foundation of many Domain Specific Languages in the research papers I’ve been reading, but it led me to think maybe Haskell has untapped potential on AI driven development.
 Because Haskell’s stigma as a “whitepaper” language, and often not used outside of the academic setting (just as viewed from outside observation), wouldn’t code quality in training datasets naturally be of a higher quality than the sea of sloppy JavaScript and terabytes of poorly written Python scripts?
 Has anyone experimented with ai generated Haskell code?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been fascinated by haskell for many years. Until recently, however, I didn&#x27;t have a compelling enough project for me to grit my teeth and work through all the issues associated with learning to program in a language properly.
 Last year, my wfie and I walked the Camino Santigo and, since I had plenty of time to think and not much else to do, I started to think about how to better plan the daily stages. It takes 30-40 days to complete and guidebooks tend to give stages for a &quot;normal&quot; pilgrim; we discovered that we started flagging at about 25km or so.
 So building a Camino planner that optimises the stages for the entire journey, based on people&#x27;s preferences in terms of distance, time, accommodation etc. became that project.
 You can give the result a spin at https://de-calixtinus.org It&#x27;s a yesod website that uses dynamic programming to plan out the route. The source code is at https://github.com/charvolant/de-calixtinus
 I&#x27;m painfully aware that this has been a learning project. You can see traces of it where, for example, I&#x27;ve become comfortable with something like applicative programming but haven&#x27;t got around to rethinking previous stuff in the light of my new knowledge. Yesod is a bugger to learn and the scaffolding makes it wilfully obscure, so you can see where I&#x27;ve been going through things in a step-wise fashion, slowly pulling stuff in from the scaffolding once I&#x27;ve understood what&#x27;s going on. The fields work, but there&#x27;s obviously more stuff needed. The configuration is trapped partway between where it was a stand-alone program and where it became a web application. And so on.
 If any kind soul wanted to look over the code and suggest improvements or completely better ways of looking at things, I&#x27;d be most grateful.

                              <span>Hi! I’m fairly new to org-mode, and trying to set it up for academic reasons. I’m studying engineering, so I’m seriously eyeing the inline LaTeX rendering capabilities of org-mode for notetaking. I first downloaded MiKTeX and installed it with the provided installer (it seems like dvipng is included in MiKTeX) then tried configuring org-mode to render with dvipng, by adding the following to my init.el file:
 (setq org-preview-latex-default-process &#x27;dvipng) (setq org-latex-create-formula-image-program &#x27;dvipng) (setq org-preview-latex-process-alist &#x27;((dvipng :programs (&quot;latex&quot; &quot;dvipng&quot;) :description &quot;dvi &gt; png&quot; :message &quot;you need to install the programs: latex and dvipng.&quot; :image-input-type &quot;dvi&quot; :image-output-type &quot;png&quot; :image-size-adjust (1.0 . 1.0) :latex-compiler (&quot;latex -interaction nonstopmode -output-directory %o %f&quot;) :image-converter (&quot;dvipng -fg %F bg %B -D %D -T tight -o %O %f&quot;)) )) 
 However, if I type some inline LaTeX in an org-mode file and try to compile it with C-c C-x C-l, I get the following message: 
 Creating LaTeX previews in region... org-compile-file: File &quot;c:/Users/USERNAME/AppData/Local/Temp/orgtexTelk2W.dvi&quot; wasn’t produced. Please adjust ‘dvipng’ part of ‘org-preview-latex-process-alist’. 
 Does anyone know what I might have done wrong? I read this post, but no log files seem to have been generated for me. If I run &quot;latex c:/Users/USERNAME/AppData/Local/Temp/orgtexTelk2W.tex&quot; in the command line it generates a dvi file of the same name; running &quot;dvipng c:/Users/USERNAME/AppData/Local/Temp/orgtexTelk2W.dvi&quot; seems to also generate a proper png image with the same name. When I check the log for generating the dvi file, it provides a bunch of information but seemingly does not show any errors.

                              <span>I&#x27;m just starting to learn org-agenda and I have a workflow in mind where, e.g., I need to install blinds in an apartment. So I begin with a heading. Then I do C-c C-t and choose TODO which adds TODO to the heading and opens an add note box. I write something preliminary, and this is added as list item with a timestamp
 * TODO APT B7 Blinds :sometag:someothertag: - State &quot;TODO&quot; from [2024-03-30 Sat 23:02] \\ B7 requested blinds. 
 Now, in my mind, I want to have a connected task such as &quot;order blinds&quot; somewhere relating to this particular TODO entry -- I&#x27;m thinking in another org file of just orders. This orders.org will then have a header 
 * Order B7 Blinds :sometag: 
 then I make it TODO and add details of the ordering to the note. I come from the relational database world where the instinct is not to crowd everything into one table, rather create a new table to normalize. But is that &quot;best practice&quot; with org-agenda? My instinct is to separate out all the stages, parts of the project install blinds. However, what I might have seen so far is people simply adding sub-headings for each sub-task, stage, etc. So the ordering blinds might be a sub-heading TODO? Or perhaps just more added list items? What&#x27;s the best practice here?

 When exporting (to PDF or HTML) an Org file containing lisp blocks, what might cause a lisp error that goes away without making any changes to the file in question, but only if I close and re-open emacs having first run desktop-clear?
 Details
 I&#x27;m converting my emacs config to use babel, and so I&#x27;m currently hacking and pruning and generally beating my init.el into shape in the new form of a new and nicely narrated config.org.
 From time to time, when I try to export the growing org file, I&#x27;m running into an error of the form: Wrong type argument: listp ... always in reference to the same setq of one particular variable. However, if instead of exporting I simply tangle the .org to produce the target .el, the tangling reports no error, and the resulting lisp is all fine too. Export …</span>

                              <span>Hello,
 I working on a personal project in which I am signing up users. I am taking their password, hashing it using password and wanting to store it in the postgresql db. I was using Generic instance so far. But it seems the &#x60;PasswordHash&#x60; type does not have instance of ToRow.
 One solution that is coming to my mind is to unwrap the PasswordHash type and store the text in the DB.

                              <span>I&#x27;m not 100%, but I believe after updating to Emacs 29.3 on Arch Linux, X11 instances and clients will only work for a few minutes until they freeze. After that, any attempts to create a new frame will result in frozen frames; I just see the &quot;When done with this frame...&quot; message in the minibuffer, and otherwise have no keyboard input. The same thing happens with emacs -Q. 
 If I open a client or instance in the terminal, however, everything works fine. With clients, I&#x27;ve tried looking at messages, but I don&#x27;t see anything out of the ordinary. Is there anything I can do to try to pinpoint the issue?
 I am using fcitx5, if that has any potential consequences.

                              <span>Whenever I press Enter to insert a new line org inserts comma before the asterisks making it look like the following After block.
 Before:
  #+begin_src conf :tangle ~/.config/excludes.conf *text_with_asterisk *some_file_extension #+end_src 
 After:
  #+begin_src conf :tangle ~/.config/excludes.conf ,*text_with_asterisk ,*some_file_extension #+end_src 
 When I use C c &#x27; to edit the block in its own buffer or tangle it out to a file the commas are removed.
 What is the purpose of this?

 The 2 most important features I am missing is
 I&#x27;d like to search for files from all 10 projects I have (they are somehow interconnected)
 I&#x27;d like to search and replace/ grep in all projects.
 Whenever im in a specific file I should get all the configurations of the specific project

In bspwm, plasma(X11) and plasma(Wayland) it just renders glitches, in dwm just a plain black screen. My primary card is the one that comes with intel, I also have an nvidia and I double checked but if you think that&#x27;s the problem give me a command and I&#x27;ll give you the output. Ty in advance.

                              <span>I&#x27;m new to using lsp, just set it up this afternoon based on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;Yah69AfYP34.
 I opened a file in my project and was prompted to import the project root, that worked great (that&#x27;s fll-sw/working-dir below). My project is built using gradlew.
 I then started a new git worktree in issues/1168... and opened a file in there. I got errors about all kinds of missing imports. When I run lsp-describe-session I get the output below. The file &quot;Playoff.java&quot; has been opened from issues/1168, the other files are opened from fll-sw/working-dir. I see that the jdtls process id is the same for both directories and that seems odd to me given that they are different projects.
 Can someone point me to documentation on what I&#x27;m not doing correctly here?

                              <span>Hello ! 
 I&#x27;m getting into FP and I was wondering of how hard &amp; practical it would be implement Leetcode type of questions in a purely functional way (Scala for instance).
 I do feel not using any mutable variable would make some algorithms more complicated to implement. The code would be perhaps harder to read. Sometimes less efficient as well. 
 What are your thoughts on this? Would you say FP and immutability make sense for some more or less complex algorithms? 
 Also, once again I&#x27;m no FP expert but I&#x27;d tend to think it&#x27;s okay to have mutable state if the method do not produce any real side effects. As long as no class instance variables or global variables are mutated by a method, having some &quot;var&quot; inside a method can be an okay choice if it makes the code more readable and efficient. Why would it be so bad to have a &quot;var&quot; inside a pure method? 
 I&#x27;d love to hear your thoughts. 
 Thanks in advance!

 I don&#x27;t see that it has a backend on &#x60;auth-sources&#x60;, and the closest thing I found is integrating keyctl in: https://github.com/jpathy/emacs-keyctl

                              <span>I&#x27;m wondering if anyone knows of an emacs package to support SysML?
 I use plantUML with org mode, and get great drawings (and terrible indenting) but its not really the same thing.
 Trying to stay as text-based as possible, with the ability to render docs and drawings.

 This does not happen with Emacs -Q. 
 In an elisp buffer, I checked flymake-running-backends and I got Running backends: elisp-flymake-checkdoc, elisp-flymake-byte-compile. And yes, it is indeed working. But it always pops up this error and it&#x27;s very annoying.
 Yes, I have tried bisecting my config but nothing seems to pop up.
 My flymake config:
 (use-package flymake :elpaca nil :hook (emacs-lisp-mode . flymake-mode) :custom (flymake-fringe-indicator-position &#x27;right-fringe))

                              <span>The title is mostly ironic. If you have reasons please share though.
 Emacs seems to have a marketing problem.
 Its almost everyday that I see videos that talk about using Vim and its derivatives and it&#x27;s generally positive.
 On the otherhand when I look on YouTube &quot;why use Emacs&quot;, the search indexes plenty of videos saying why you shouldn&#x27;t.
 Maybe this just says something about the recommendation engine&#x27;s belief about what I&#x27;ll watch is, but that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m making this thread.
 I&#x27;m a newb so I&#x27;m still learning a lot and that&#x27;s really the main drive for me. I can&#x27;t remember what made me invest into Emacs, but I think it had to do with Vim changing conventions every couple years while Emacs seems stable and centralized to its ways.
 What&#x27;s your experience?

 This prevents buffers that - i don&#x27;t want to get displayed as a tab - from getting displayed. How do i make every time C-x C-f is called open the file in a new centaur-tab instead of a normal Emacs buffer? I want multiple files to be open side-by-side...
 Thanks in advance, Emacs noob

                              <span>I have the following sample agenda items:
 * Future ** A meeting non-recurring :meeting: SCHEDULED:  ** Meeting recurring starting today :meeting: SCHEDULED:  ** Meeting recurring started before :meeting: SCHEDULED:  
 The resulted agenda view for today is as follows:
 Today&#x27;s agenda Saturday 30 March 2024 8:00...... ---------------- 8:10...... now - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 9:00...... Scheduled: Meeting recurring starting today :meeting: 10:00...... ---------------- 11:00...... Scheduled: A meeting non-recurring :meeting: 12:00...... ---------------- 14:00...... ---------------- 16:00...... ---------------- 18:00...... ---------------- 20:00...... ---------------- Sched. 3x: Meeting recurring started before :meeting: 
 Note, the same configuration, &quot;Meeting recurring started before&quot; does not have the expected timestamp shown. 
 Here is my settings related:
 (setq org-agenda-prefix-format &#x27;((agenda . &quot; %?-12t% s&quot;) (todo . &quot;%?-12t&quot;) (tags . &quot;%?-12t&quot;) (search . &quot;%?-12t&quot;))) (agenda &quot;&quot; ((org-agenda-start-day &quot;+0d&quot;) ; start from today (org-agenda-span &#x27;day) (org-deadline-warning-days 0) (org-agenda-block-separator nil) (org-agenda-overriding-header &quot;\nToday&#x27;s agenda\n&quot;) ))

                              <span>I was a heavy user of Emacs + org-mode. I really love(d) org-roam, had thousands of notes in it, would navigate them in a second, create powerful org-documents. But I felt the pain of not having access to my files on the go (both task management and notes). That&#x27;s when I heavy heartedly switched to Obsidian for note taking and OmniFocus for task and project management.
 So I took the plunge and invsted a good amount of time into migrating my org-mode files into markdown files, and migrate them into my vault in Obsidian.
 As I missed a good editor in Obsidian for long documents, I asked myself recently why not edit my markdown files in Emacs. After all Obsidian stores all files in markdown format in a folder that&#x27;s accessbile to any program.
 I realized that the tools I used previously in E…</span>

                              <span>Hi,
 this is something that is not a problem for me, but I would like to understand what is happening as this is very strange...
 When I run graphical emacs on Linux and do a describe-face on an org-mode TODO-item I can see that the color (ie the foreground-color of the string &quot;TODO&quot;) is configured to be &quot;Red1&quot;. This seems to be the default, I did not customize it.
 When I do the same thing in a terminal emacs (same config-file) with TERM&#x3D;xterm-256color I get the same, however if I run a terminal emacs with TERM&#x3D;tmux-256color this foreground color suddenly changes to &quot;Pink&quot;.
 So how does changing the value of the TERM environment variable change the color-name?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve started using the following to give me boxes around code blocks when exporting to PDF via LaTeX.
 #+BEGIN_mdframed #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp ;; Some lisp goes in here #+END_SRC #+END_mdframed 
 But I&#x27;m having to add those two additional lines around every separate block I want framed (which is almost all of them). Is there a way I can avoid that? 
 For example, is there perhaps an argument I can add to each #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp line itself, to say &quot;oh, and frame this while you&#x27;re at it&quot;? That would allow me to continue to exclude those few blocks that I do not want framed (mainly because I&#x27;m already using :exports none to stop them reaching the PDF at all). So, something like this for blocks to be framed:
 #BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :do-the-mdframed-thing yes 
 and for those not to be framed (because they&#x27;re not being exported to the PDF in the first place) just continuing with their current:
 #BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :exports none 
 Alternatively, is there perhaps some directive at or above file scope -- maybe something in a #+: line at the top of the file? -- which would make mdframing be the default for all code blocks, but for which there is an &quot;off&quot; switch that could be applied individually to the exceptions?

                              <span>For example, when calling consult-recent-file, if I use embark-act to call embark-collect, the resulting buffer cannot preview files. I also try to use embark-act to call embark-live, in this way, preview works well, but the minibuffer coexists with the embark live buffer. My question is can I make the live preview work, while avoiding the two buffers issue in embark-live?

 CUA works perfectly, but in ORG mode, in spite of

 Are there any special tricks? How can I make it work?

                              <span>You guys also?
 I&#x27;m using copilot system when I develop C++ 
 And so, I&#x27;m using copilot.el mode
 (https://github.com/copilot-emacs/copilot.el)
 But, I think that it&#x27;s to cause that to occur many times of garbage-collection
 When I only used eglot-mode, Garbage collections were not occured many times.
 Of course, I have set a big-value to gc-cons-threshold in my eglot settings.
 (use-package eglot :ensure t :bind (:map eglot-mode-map (&quot;&quot; . jo/company-complete-common) ) :config (require &#x27;eglot) (setq eglot-send-changes-idle-time 0.1) (setq gc-cons-threshold (* 50 1024 1024)) (setq garbage-collection-messages t) (setq original-gc-cons-threshold gc-cons-threshold) (setq gc-cons-threshold most-positive-fixnum) (add-hook &#x27;emacs-startup-hook (lambda () (setq gc-cons-threshold original-gc-cons-threshold))) ) (use-package copilot :quelpa (copilot :fetcher github :repo &quot;copilot-emacs/copilot.el&quot; :branch &quot;main&quot; :files (&quot;dist&quot; &quot;*.el&quot;)) :config (add-hook &#x27;prog-mode-hook &#x27;copilot-mode) (setq copilot-indent-offset-warning-disable t) (setq copilot-max-char 500000) ) 
 I don&#x27;t know What is the cause of the symptom exactly.
 I think It must be copilot.el Because
 When I enabled copilot.el, It occurred many times

 I am trying to setup markdown mode ts using only the default Emacs with treesit (not installing the markdown-mode package).
 Is it possible? I&#x27;ve been trying like this.
  (use-package markdown-ts-mode :ensure nil :mode (&quot;\\.md\\&#x27;&quot; . markdown-ts-mode) :defer &#x27;t :custom (markdown-indent-level 2) :config (treesit-parser-create &#x27;markdown) (add-to-list &#x27;treesit-language-source-alist &#x27;(markdown &quot;https://github.com/ikatyang/tree-sitter-markdown&quot; &quot;master&quot; &quot;src&quot;))) 
 But when I open a .md file I get:  File mode specification error: (file-missing Cannot open load file No such file or directory markdown-ts-mode) 
 I am not sure how to accomplish this manual configuration regarding a non pre-existent mode to &quot;remap&quot; into &quot;-ts-mode&quot;.

                              <span>I am presently using emacs 29.1 from railwaycat/emacs-mac and it works great, but I want to start using emacs 30.0.50, since it seems stable enough to be a daily driver for what I use and I want to use lldb, which is supported in emacs 30. 
 I tried emacs 30 from both emacsformacosx, as well as from d12frosted/emacs-plus, and both worked great, but the only thing that I miss is that they don&#x27;t recognize the back button on my logitech mouse.
 I don&#x27;t mind trying to build from source, but I want to know how railwaycat/emacs-mac recognizes the back button. I find it very helpful for using with lsp-mode to jump back to where I came from. (I know that I can use M-, for it, but it is not as convenient for me.) I use it as:
 (define-key prog-mode-map [swipe-left] &#x27;xref-go-back)

                              <span>There are many topics about the use of AI in our workflows. I&#x27;ve Initially started to write in one of these, but I think that this question could be considered on it own. With a well made title...
I&#x27;ve very negative thoughts about the use of AI in personal knowledge processing and development.
Maybe I could change my mind in the future, reasoning and contextualize better on different use cases.
Into my notes I&#x27;ve already put a set of &quot;notemaking fallacies&quot; regarding AI 
Automatic classification fallacy
Automatic linking fallacy
Automatic summarization fallacy
The underlying principle is the same for all of them.
The effort of doing these things is tiring and takes time, but it&#x27;s thinking itself. 
Discovering and using Zettelkasten in the last two years I&#x27;ve relearned to think. Before this time, I collected.
For me Zettelkaten and AI are highly incompatible. At least for the &quot;core tasks&quot;,  those in which we need to use a lot of thinking. 
It&#x27;s a strong opinion, maybe   Again, I could change my opinion in the future or listening other opinions.  AI could be useful in low-lewel tasks.
Someone already use AI assistance for something.
What do you think? Can be defined the right boundaries of this problem?</span>

 Why you should care!
 Biparsing is a bidirectional programming technique that specializes in constructing parsing and printing programs simultaneously.
  
Less Bugs, keeps the programs in sync so that when the biparsing code is modified both the parser and printer are updated
 Less Costs, reduces maintenance and upgrade costs since changes only need to be made in a single location
 Less Code, reduces project size in &quot;half&quot; (perhaps a third) since two parts are written simultaneously

 Release notes:
  
This release fixes potential bugs. Given the change in the default value of the urls key, Stack users are recommended to update to this version to avoid having to configure that key in YAML configuration files.
  
Changes since v2.15.3:
 Behaviour changes:
  
Following the handover of the Stackage project to the Haskell Foundation, the default value of the urls key is latest-snapshot: https://stackage-haddock.haskell.org/snapshots.json.
 Stack no longer includes the snapshot package database when compiling the setup executable for a package with build-type: Configure.
  
Thanks to all our contributors for this release:

 It was just rejected. I&#x27;m not going to lie, I totally forgot I had sent it during this time, as I had assumed nobody would ever see the request.
 I can understand not approving random people&#x27;s requests, but I can&#x27;t find any actual instructions on how to open an account, send PR&#x27;s, etc.
 Thanks in advance.

 If there are any org-contacts users out there, what do you do when you want to record multiple email addresses or multiple phone numbers?
 I guess I can just use :EMAIL1: and :EMAIL2: for example, but I feel like that doesn&#x27;t match the built in expectations of the org-contacts package.
 Any thoughts?

                              <span>Hi, I got aware of Idris a few months ago, and it grab my attention.
 As of now, it has a considerable amount of work to be put into its development till it reaches a state of &quot;release&quot;.
 Unfortunately, there&#x27;s not many people engaged in functional programming enough for Idris to get wide support on its development (both with volunteers and monetarily), so the development is way slower in comparison to languages like Rust (that got very popular).
 Do you expect Idris to &quot;release&quot; in the next 10 years?

                              <span>Hey guys! I have 6 years experience with programming, I&#x27;ve been programming the most with Python and only recently started using Rust more.
 1 week ago I saw a video about Haskell, and it really fascinated me, the whole syntax and functional programming language concept sounds really cool, other than that, I&#x27;ve seen a bunch of open source programming language made with Haskell.
 Since I&#x27;m unsure tho, convince me, why should I learn it?

 I&#x27;ve reached another milestone in my tinkering with tab-line. I now have integrated custom grouping with some extensions for project, basic integration with the desktop functionality to save tab info, some modeline integration and most excitingly views that mimic tab-bar and allow lightweight spaces that preserve window-configuration and tab lists. 
 Note: in the demo I am focused mostly on mouse based interactions but there are commands/initial keybindings too. 
 I&#x27;m still trying out the total ui experience on a day to day basis and tinkering with the code. But I think I&#x27;ve slipped part of the way over the line between configuration and becoming a full blown package.
 That&#x27;s also made me go back and look at other tab packages to see if I ended up reinventing the wheel. So far I think this is something a bit new. 
 Besides show and tell - I&#x27;m interested in feedback / UI thoughts.

                              <span>I have a problem that I can&#x27;t seem to understand how it&#x27;s caused.
 I have been using eglot for R programming localy and everything works fine.
 When I connect to a file at a remote server and start eglot, it reports that it connects to languageserver correctly, completions happen for a brief moment but then the server seems to hang.
 A big message that looks like a .json line appears on the echo area, that seems to be some flymake diagnostics among other things. I have managed to capture this on the Warnings buffer, if anyone is interested.
 I don&#x27;t know if I should make a bug report on the eglot project or on corfu (that I use for in-buffer-completions)
 My config can be found here if anyone is interested: https://github.com/Himsself1/My-.emacs-configuration
 *** IMPORTANT NOTE ***
 I start emacs with the following command: &quot;emacs -q --load ~/my-emacs-config/init.eglot.el&quot; so that it only uses the init.eglot.el file.
 Any advise would be greatly appreciated!
 Edit. Warnings buffer at: https://gist.github.com/Himsself1/b2338e54e4b9e98474aa344f84ebf668

 So here are some badges i made:

                              <span>I just started using source blocks in org-mode. I did the following steps 
  
Using M-x customize-variables RET org-babel-load-languages I added Shell, Python and LaTeX.
 Using M-x customise-variable RET exec-path I added the paths to python3 and my tex distribution. 
  
a) Now when I added a sh-source block and used C-c C-c the result gets printed as expected. 
 b) However when I do the same for a python-source block I got an error zsh:1: command not found: python [Babel evaluation exited with code 127]
 c) As for the LaTeX I am not sure if I am getting the expected result. Here is my source block
 #+begin_src latex
 $x^3$
 #+end_src
 and here is the output
 #+RESULTS:
 #+begin_export latex
 $x^3$
 #+end_export
 ​
 How do I get the python source block to compile properly? Is my LaTeX compiling as expected?

                              <span>So I&#x27;ve been synchronising my org-roam files between computers and mobile phone. For a while I&#x27;ve been mostly successfully being able to use Emacs in Termux for org-roam on my mobile phone. 
 However, in the past few months any org-roam &#x27;look-up&#x27; operations, like org-roam-node-insert, org-roam-node-find, &amp;c. have become slower and slower. Worse, in the past couple of months, after doing one or two such operations it seems to get stuck indefinitely, and trying to cancel out with C-g does nothing the first time, and kills Emacs the second time.
 I&#x27;m not sure whether the issue is that my org-roam file library has continued to grow or whether it&#x27;s to do with changes to Android (there have been a few Android OS updates in that time period). Or whether the issue is with accessing a larger sqlite database or whether it&#x27;s to do with the actual file-lookup operations (more org-roam files over time).
 Is anyone in a similar situation? Any ideas of how to resolve this? Maybe at the Termux level? (I saw, for instance, a Termux &#x27;no-root-ram-booster&#x27; [ https://github.com/White9shadow/no-root-ram-booster ] but haven&#x27;t tried it or know whether it would be at all relevant. But have wondered about things like this - some way of affecting things at the Termux-level.)

                              <span>I am having troubles understanding how the file handlers work from the documentation. Particularly in the make-process :file-handler.
 I understand that I should provide an alist with the form (regexp . handler) however, I cannot figure out how can I ask my handler to call the process in a given path.
 I have the following:
  (make-process :name &quot;my-R-async&quot; :buffer &quot;my-R-async&quot; :command (list &quot;Rscript&quot; &quot;app.R&quot;) :connection-type &#x27;pty)  However, this only works if I call make-process from the same dir where my app.R is. Therefore, I am trying to find a handler that can call make-process from a particular dir.
 I have tried a few things, including :file-handler (unhandled-file-name-directory &quot;~/Projects/myApp/&quot;) and :file-handler (&quot;~/Projects/myApp/&quot; . unhandled-file-name-directory), I have tried with other functions replacing unhandled-file-name-directory and sometimes writing the full path of the file rather than only the directory, but nothing seems to work.
 I have currently a solution by providing the path to R directly, sending the command setwd() but a workaround and I really would like to learn and understand how Emacs can handle this.

Announcing Imp, a GHC plugin for automatically importing modules by Taylor Fausak
Typically in Haskell you have to import things before you can use them. This is widely considered to be a good idea. However sometimes it’s convenient to use something without importing it, as long as that thing is unambiguous.
Neural Networks, Pre-Lenses, and Triple Tambara Modules by Bartosz Milewski

 I have a keymap that binds a mouse press to an interactive command:
 ;; keymap to wire the new desktop button to tab2-new-dektop (defvar-keymap tab2-new-desktop-map &quot; &quot; #&#x27;tab2-new-desktop &quot;RET&quot; #&#x27;tab2-new-desktop) 
 Where the command is really vanilla:
 ;; Create a new desktop and switch to it. (defun tab2-new-desktop (name) (interactive &quot;sNew Desktop name: &quot;) ..... 
 This all works as expected, except the focus doesn&#x27;t switch to the minibuffer automatically when the mouse is pressed. You have to do so manually. Does anyone know how to make that happen?

If that is true, how can I trick python into thinking it is? It is very normal practice to have this line in my code, and I would like to still be able to run my code in emacs without too much restructuring of my life.

Only gives me blank &quot; &quot; so it seems that Emacs can not find my home directory or my init.el file regardless if I load it or not. I know my file is loaded as it shows up in *Messages* but the variable is still empty.
 I have compiled Emacs from source using pgtk for Wayland along with native compilation as well as with json and a few others. My version is Emacs 30.0.50, at the moment I am starting Emacs via kde5 desktop, but if also had same problem running it in terminal.
 My environment variables are set even moved to the XDG standard, set XDG_CONFIG_HOME to proper location. But still getting an empty init-user-file, wonder exactly how to figure this out.

 After hitting C-c y C-h, the C-h page displays something like this 
 C-c y ( .. C-c y ) kill-region 
 It seems this only happens to ( and ) bound to the same command. E.g. If I bind both  to the same command, C-h displays correctly.
 (global-set-key (kbd &quot;C-c y &quot;) &#x27;kill-region) 
 C-h shows:
 C-c y  kill-region 
 Does anybody know this is by design or a bug ? btw, I&#x27;m running v29.2.

                              <span>Hi all, I&#x27;m running into the following issue with python windows in emacs 29.1 on OSX. Buffers end up being duplicated in certain conditions. I&#x27;ve started emacs using &quot;emacs -Q&quot; so this is all using the default settings. 
  
I like to have my *Python* shell buffer under my python code buffer. (see below)
  
1. Initial setup with Python source code buffer above *Python* shell buffer.
  
When executing the code buffer with C-c C-c the code buffer ends up being duplicated on the bottom right (see below)
  
2. Code buffer duplicated on bottom right after running C-c C-c
  
Even worse if I then move to the Python shell buffer and press , the Python shell buffer ends up being duplicated on the top right (see below)
  
​
 3. *Python* shell buffer is duplicated on top right when pressing  in bottom left window
 Obviously this isn&#x27;t what I&#x27;d expect, I&#x27;d like to keep the initial layout and end up with 
 ​
 4. expected layout instead of 2 and 3. 
 I came across this fantastic guide on managing windows https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/demystifying-emacs-window-manager#templates-examples 
 so I tried customising the display-buffer-alist variable using
 (add-to-list &#x27;display-buffer-alist
 \((or (derived-mode . python-mode) (derived-mode . inferior-python-mode))&#x60;
 (display-buffer-reuse-window display-buffer-reuse-mode-window)
 (inhibit-same-window . nil)))
 but that&#x27;s making no difference here, I get the same behaviour as before. 
 ​
 Couple of questions
  
Are others able to reproduce this issue?
 Is there a way to configure display-buffer-alist to avoid seeing my python source and shell buffers duplicated and get screenshot 4 instead of 2 or 3?
  
Grateful for any tips!

 But xcscope take a long time to search symbol &#x60;C-c,s,s&#x60; (60s) as if &#x60;cscope.out&#x60; was not used.
 If I use &#x60;cscope -d&#x60; or another editor to use cscope it is quick (1s) and it use only &#x60;cscope.out&#x60;.
 I tried also that with no effect : 
 (setq cscope-do-not-update-database t) 
 Is there a way to use xcscope plugin or other to use only &#x60;cscope.out&#x60; and have a quick search?

                              <span>I have a few questions for Elisp connoisseurs and Emacs package creators, do you test your code? What&#x27;s the best practices for testing Elisp these days? 
  
Do you use buttercup, ert, maybe something else? What are the reasons to choose one over another?
 
How do you structure the project? Most simple packages (at least the shit I come up with) fit in a single file. Where do you place the tests? In a file next to it, in a sub-folder? Are there any file naming conventions?
 
What do you use for CI? There&#x27;s a lot of Emacs stuff on GitHub (even though many advocates of FOSS trying use other places like Codeberg). Do you use GitHub Actions? Can you show me some nice examples to borrow ideas from?
 
 In general, I rarely see packages that have test coverage. I&#x27;m not sure why. Is it because of the dynamic, malleable nature of Lisp - you write a function, evaluate it on the spot, and if it works, you happily forget about it?

                              <span>I am running Arch/Xomand (so X) on an XPS13 laptop. I installed emacs 29.3 from the AUR, then doom emacs, accoriding to https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs/blob/master/docs/getting_started.org}
 When I launch the binary, my configuration is respected: for example: 
 ​

 But when I use emacsclient (with any of the usual flags), my comfiguration is not sourced entirely, I lose cursor size/shape, imeages etc. Like so: 
 ​
 https://preview.redd.it/sg14veh11tqc1.png?width&#x3D;1165&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;f5648dad587435fa5f265438dabfedd71ef1254f
 I tried downgrading emacs to 29.2, to no effect. I did a full reinstall of both emacs and doom but the problem persists. I can reproduce the issue on my other laptop which is also an XPS13, running Arch/Hyprland (so Wayland). 
 Is this a bug in the new emacs version? It is not a doom issue, the problem seems to be with the client.

                              <span>I have this annoying issue with Emacs server¹. I&#x27;m not sure if it actually dies or simply cannot be accessed for whatever reason.
 So, I very often call emacsclient from my WM to spawn a new buffer to edit something (the details of all that, I think irrelevant). After a while though, it stops to work. If I try to poke to it from the terminal doing something trivial like this:
 $ emacsclient -e &#x27;(message &quot;yo&quot;)&#x27; emacsclient: can&#x27;t find socket; have you started the server? emacsclient: To start the server in Emacs, type &quot;M-x server-start&quot;. emacsclient: No socket or alternate editor. ... 
 It doesn&#x27;t find it and I have to M-x server-start. I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s causing this. server-stop-automatically var is nil.
 Does anyone know anything about this? I&#x27;m using --HEAD version on Arch and I have experienced the same thing on Mac too, but it was a while ago. Any ideas how to troubleshoot this?
  
1 - Sorry, Reddit doesn&#x27;t let me change the title of the post. I meant to say &quot;server&quot; and not &quot;daemon&quot;. Apparently, there&#x27;s a difference.

                              <span>Hello I wanted to ask you all how you investigate a codebase with emacs?
 I’m reading book about code reading and the author suggests regular expressions, ctags and grep.
 This book is kind of old.
 Are there better tools now or are these still solid? Also can you describe how you investigate a large codebase? Thanks

                              <span>Hey Folks, I have recently joined an org which uses Scala only for the Backend tasks. I came from the Go Lang background where I can see hell lot of opportunities. But in Scala things are little bit opposite, you need to search for the job role and still there are less chances. I miss the motivation of work after thinking all of these things because of no such scope in future. I have worked on Kotlin earlier and liked that because that is high demand language. Can someone help me if I&#x27;m taking it in wrong way.... and sorry for such a noob question but it is something which disturb me sometimes 
 YOE: 3
 Edit: Thank you to the community for the comments, they are really helpful. I will strengthen and learn more about Scala language, as ppl are already loving it 🙌

                              <span>Hi.. I have seen others comment in many forums that Haskell has a repl and it’s a great tool for learning.. I have used ghci myself and I have two questions.. 
 Most of the code which is more than 10 lines or has more than two to three imports have to be script based.. so how is ghci load and run better than cabal run or stack run ? 
 Also I found multiline code and package import in ghci a lot more difficult
 I have been able to use ghci only where I want to test and isolated function before I type it into the main program.. 
 Are there any other ways to use repl better ? Or is this the best one can do ?
 In general how does a language which has a repl tool do better than one without ?

                              <span>Hi,
 unfortunately the normal orgmode-checkboxes do not work in tables or properties.
 What do you use as a replacement?
 I am looking for something that can represent a boolean value and can be toggled with a key stroke.
 Is there any package for that?

 #+begin_src jupyter-python :session *py* p &#x3D; ggplot(df, aes(&#x27;a&#x27;, &#x27;b&#x27;)) + geom_point() p.to_png(&quot;test.png&quot;) #+end_src 
 Which outputs a file path: 
 #+RESULTS: : /Users/elan_braude/test.png 
 Which I can then manually wrap in double brackets and get an image inline.
 ​
 So question number 1: How can I make code block automatically wrap file path in double brackets? Or more generally is there a setup where I can just eval the ggplot function and get an inline image? i.e. as opposed to calling .to_png() every time.
 Question number 2: lest-plot default output is html with tooltips, is it somehow possible to get org-mode to render this inline? or at least have it exported?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been an org mode user for around 3 years now, I use it for practically everything task- and note-oriented. I&#x27;m in it and emacs most of the day.
 However, the one aspect I have never quite understood is why TODOs seem the same as headings. My natural expectation is that when taking notes, especially with meetings, I want to slot in a TODO based on the context of the notes at that time. But with a TODO being a heading, all the plain text notes below it come under that heading. So I tend to have a heading at the bottom of the notes section called Tasks or something under which I enter the TODOs for that meeting, but that approach does lose the context location from the full notes--not a major issue, but flipping about to record TODOs does disrupt flow.
 So, what am I missing? I did search on this a bit and think identified that some people just use headings for the full notes, and any plain text under a heading is just brief explanation or extra detail for that heading but may be omitted altogether. However, the way headings are formatted by default with bold doesn&#x27;t feel natural for note-taking (I use Prot&#x27;s Modus themes, and then a mixture of formatting from System Crafters videos).
 Or maybe I have missed something really obvious. Whatever, any thoughts and guidance appreciated. Thanks.

                              <span>I would like to do a debug-like &quot;step through&quot; of a 3.5K-line elisp program. It&#x27;s org-brain and I can&#x27;t really figure out where/what the first function call is. org-brain works by having a set of org files and the headings in org files to be ID&#x27;ed (UUID in a PROPERTIES drawer) then create a quasi-graph view of the org files and heading hierarchies in a graph/network-like child, parent, friend relationships between files and headings. So I&#x27;m trying to figure out how this whole thing starts. My guess is it takes org-element to parse out the ID attached to a file or headings, then creates some graph store cache. Or maybe not...
 Investigations found a use of org-refile here that will gather up all the headings in a designated directory, and, yes, org-brain does utilize org-refile, but just for actual refiling. Dead end. The org-brain author, who wants to not maintain anymore did say this:
  
The entries are cached and stored in memory after the first &quot;scan&quot; of a session. I think there are ways to store the cache to disk.
  
but I can&#x27;t find how this is being done. AFAICT, org-brain simply starts with some location entry, a file or heading, and simply works-crawls in whatever direction from there, i.e., there is no cache in memory or hash table. That is, org-brain is nothing but the visualization and not a graph database management app. There is something referring to .org-id-locations, but I don&#x27;t believe this is used in org-brain to create a cache. Any ideas? I basically need to step/trace through this monster. I&#x27;m guessing if I can find it&#x27;s very first action, I&#x27;ll have my best shot at figuring out if indeed everything is read and cached.

                              <span>Hi! I access my home RaspberryPi (Raspbian) from my office through my Windows 11 laptop via SSH through port forwarding. It works well. However, when I try to use Emacs on the RPi through the terminal window, the &quot;active&quot; keybindings are the Windows terminal ones. So, when I press C-v, instead of moving page down, it pastes whatever was in the Windows clipboard at the time.
 Any ideas on how to get &quot;proper&quot; Emacs behaviour? Thanks!

 Distributor ID: Ubuntu
 Description: Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS
 Release: 20.04
 emacs: V 26.3 with ido-mode enabled.
 When I ssh (or connect via VMWare) to my virtual machine, and try to open any file in emacs it just hangs on me. This wasn&#x27;t happening till a few weeks ago. Over the last couple of weeks, the response was slow and emacs used to start working after some delay (of few seconds to minutes), but now it just hangs (or maybe it needs more time). 
 I am not clear about where to start debugging it even. Any way to solve/debug this issue?

When a headline has vanished from the feed it is automatically marked as “obsolete” unless it has the status “immortal”. “Obsolete” headlines get removed automatically after a certain time.
  
However, in other feed readers, these headlines are, in fact, still there and have not vanished. In particular, it seems to be keeping the latest ten items as &quot;new&quot; and marking the rest as &quot;obsolete&quot;. I have searched &quot;newsticker&quot; in M-x customize, expanded every option, and C-s&#x27;d &quot;10&quot; to see if I could find a match, with no luck.

 Uncomment all the deb-src lines in /etc/apt/sources.list and run an apt update
 # Make sure to uninstall all the emacs packages if you already have it installed sudo apt-get install build-essential git gcc-version # Take note of the version here. If it says 11, for example, you need to install sudo apt install libgccjit0 libgccjit-11-dev # or if it&#x27;s 10, substitute libgccjit-10-dev, and so on sudo apt-get build-dep emacs cd ~/Downloads git clone --depth 1 -n emacs-29 https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/emacs.git emacs-29 cd emacs-29 ./autogen.sh ./configure --with-native-compilation # Check to make sure ./configure confirms that you have native compilation available make -j[however many cpu cores you have +1] sudo checkinstall 
 And that really is all there is to it. If you&#x27;re running this on Windows 11, running emacs &amp; from a command line will launch Weston and Emacs.

                              <span>Some time ago, i wrote myself a little Neovim plugin and i&#x27;m trying to see, if this already exists for emacs, before i go off writing a whole bunch of code.
 The idea is this: You define a regex/word to match and set a message to display next to matches. Similar in look to line-blame or such. I use this, to add custom reminders/todos/notes to a bunch of code files at once.
 An example usecase: I work with 50 or so Ansible Environments. All of which share common Group and Hostvars. Sometimes, Variables change, get deprecated or we change how certain things work. In those cases, i add a note that get&#x27;s displayed next to that variable. That way, when i&#x27;m working with an environments Group Vars, i can see when there&#x27;s &quot;stuff to do&quot;, changes to make or such. Having this done this way, allows me to make that note once and have it work across all my files.
 Does a package like that already exist? Or am i looking to write this myself?

                              <span>I just posted a question on r/vim regarding .asv files, i.e. ASCII-separated-value files.
 Basically, I want to enter ASCII separators easily, control how they are displayed on screen (e.g. choose to display the Unit Separator as 8 spaces), and make switching displays easy.
 As a bonus, I am trying to do the following: automatically encode an .asv into the POSIX portable set (e.g. via base64) to embed it as a field in another .asv and vice versa: take an encoded field, open a buffer with the decoded .asv where it can be viewed/edited, and then automatically re-encode and re-embed into the original .asv.
 I am sure emacs can do the above as well, but I am a complete newbie when it comes to this editor, so I have no idea how it can be done. If there are any interested experts here, I&#x27;d love to learn how to do something like this; especially the customization of how separator characters are displayed in the editor.
 Thank you all!

                              <span>I use Eglot and Clangd on a code base that partly consists of Objective-C code, the rest is plain C++. Clangd crashes immediately when I open an Objective-C source file in Emacs. Apart from this, Eglot and Clangd is working very well for me, I have never seen Clangd crash in any other situation.
 I have tried both LLVM&#x27;s Clangd installed using homebrew (I&#x27;m on macOS) and the one package with Xcode, both of them exhibit the same behavior and crash when I open an Objective-C file.
 I haven&#x27;t analyzed the log from Clangd yet (available in the *Eglot events* buffer) in any detail, I first wanted to check if this is a common problem. Anybody else experiencing this?

                              <span>I’ve been an on again off again emacs user for awhile, and I’m falling into a pattern of mostly using emacs for things like org mode and heavy text editing (refactoring a file with lots of moving text around and/or macros) rather than for all development work. 
 I find a more complete IDE a better workflow for my normal development work with autocomplete, renaming symbols, building and package management, and debugging. Not that emacs can’t do all those things, just that getting things configured, set up, and working through issues is never worth it to me when I have keyboard layers that keep my hands off the mouse 90% of the time. 
 It’s got me curious how much other people use emacs in their day to day. I know the meme is that emacs in the only program you’ll ever need, and that’s true for a lot of people, but I’m curious what the numbers look like.

                              <span>I have a file, agenda.org, that contains my agenda items. Right now it&#x27;s just a few things like holidays, birthdays, and work events. When I view the agenda the work events aren&#x27;t showing up. Have I entered the events wrong? Here&#x27;s a snippet of my agenda file:
 #+TITLE: My Agenda #+AUTHOR: Brendan Leber * Holidays :PROPERTIES: :CATEGORY: Holiday :END: %%(org-calendar-holiday) %%(org-anniversary 1892 03 25) Tolkien Reading Day %%(org-anniversary 1934 09 09) Carl Sagan Day %%(org-anniversary 1937 09 22) Hobbit Day (%d%s) %%(org-anniversary 1999 09 13) Breakaway [Space: 1999] (%d years) * MCC :PROPERTIES: :CATEGORY: mcc :END: 2024-03-14 Payday 2024-03-28 Payday 2024-04-11 Payday 2024-04-25 Payday 
 And here is what I see when I view the agenda:
 Fortnight-agenda (W13-W14): Monday 25 March 2024 W13 Holiday: Tolkien Reading Day Tuesday 26 March 2024 Wednesday 27 March 2024 Thursday 28 March 2024 Friday 29 March 2024 Saturday 30 March 2024 Sunday 31 March 2024 Monday 1 April 2024 W14 Holiday: April Fools&#x27; Day 
 You can see that the &quot;holiday&quot; I&#x27;ve added on the 25th is there but the payday event for the 28th isn&#x27;t. How should I create these entries so I can have them show up in my morning review of my agenda? Thanks!

Automatic updates for agenda views and to-do list are now supported. Whether you edit files in Metanote or use other app to edit files in external folders, or retrieve updates from iCloud or Git, Metanote can now automatically detect changes to files and update them accordingly. Your content will always stay up to date.
 Agenda Filter support is now available, allowing you to filter schedules and to-do items directly by category, todo keyword, and tag.
 Buffer outlines now support clicking to jump to a specific headline.
 Customization of Todo Keyword icons and colors is now possible.
 More intuitive and convenient multi-buffer management is now provided. You can now directly switch buffers from the Buffer list.
 Various other optimizations have been made, resulting in increased stability.
  
​
 Regarding file synchronization, Metanote can add any external directory that supports folder-level File Provider and automatically detect file updates. Unfortunately, many cloud drives only support file-level File Provider. We have implemented the ability to add individual files to Metanote, which is still in testing and is expected to be launched in next version. Therefore, the best regular file synchronization solutions for now are:
 ​
  
iCloud, which supports folder-level File Provider and can be directly added to Metanote.
 Git, where most Git app&#x27;s directories can be directly added to Metanote. For example, with PolyGit, when you git pull, Metanote will automatically update the file content.
 Other apps that support synchronization. Most document editing apps can be directly added to Metanote, such as Obsidian and Logseq. When files in these apps are updated, Metanote will automatically handle the edited files.

                              <span>I am one of these &quot;Scala as better Java devs&quot;, working like that for years, but from time to time I am trying to explore more of Scala world with Cats Effect.
 Everytime I try to make some basic apps with Cats Effects by myself, I end up thinking that it provides a lot of great solutions for the problems I introduced by using it.
 What I understand is that making my code pure functional, will make some things like - testing or blocking IO handling easier, but at the cost of wrapping classic lines of codes in framework specific constructs. Is it worth it? I don&#x27;t feel that my code is better and more secure when I use Cats Effect compared to my FP+OOP Scala mix.
 I am used to Akka stack for backend - mostly classic actors, cluster, Akka Streams for data processing (like IoT management system for example), and just Scala for internal tools and game development. I don&#x27;t see what is the benefit of dropping my current way of using Scala and use Cats Effect/Zio instead.
 The worst thing is - that pure functional programming with Cats Effect or Zio is so popular in Scala world, that I can&#x27;t find any job not mentioning it (well, maybe some big data ones).
 Do you have any suggestions that could help me find answers for my question? Maybe effects are not suitable for my use cases? Are they better for solving some special niche problems? Which ones? Thank you in advance!

                              <span>I&#x27;ve written a custom eshell-prompt-function (https://bpa.st/IUXQ) but I&#x27;m having trouble getting the eshell-prompt-regexp to match. When I change directories then the prompt is not updated to reflect the change of the proper directory that I&#x27;m in. Instead, the prompt continues pointing to my home directory and then changes to &quot;text is read only&quot;.
 I&#x27;ve tried matching in re-builder, and fiddled with rx, but I&#x27;m still not getting the expected outcome. I&#x27;d appreciate any help as I&#x27;m not very good with regex.
 All I want the end result to look like this:

                              <span>Following up on my previous post, with WSL version 2.1.5.0 and WSLg version 1.0.60, it appears that the network connection issue killing the X(Wayland) window has been remedied as per this post. The connection is restored and the X window reappears automatically (it changes the position of the icon for Emacs on the taskbar upon reconnection). So compiling from source with with-x-toolkit&#x3D;lucid seems to be a workable solution and now appears to work better than the X410 (and likely VcXsrv) solution.
 Sometimes, the X window GUI still does crash or whatever and I cannot bring it back - in which case I restart WSLg by opening a PowerShell terminal and enter wsl --system and kill the process associated with ps aux | grep /usr/bin/weston. My Emacs daemon remains running (though it seems to kill off the Python or whatever shell that was running from it, unfortunately) and I can reopen my GUI with emacsclient -c.
 The pure GTK build still hangs and becomes unresponsive as before (presumably from a network disconnection) so that does not appear to be fixed; for the time being the Lucid build is a workable solution. Hope this helps others looking for a solution on their Windows 11 laptops.

                              <span>Just like save-window-excursion but with buffers, I needed to run some code and then close any buffers that got opened during that moment.
 Apparently nothing like that exists already in Emacs so, here&#x27;s my take. Any feeedback on the code is most welcome:
 (defmacro killing-new-buffers (&amp;rest body) &quot;Run BODY and kill any buffers that were not already open.&quot; (declare (debug t)) (cl-with-gensyms (initial-buffers) &#x60;(let ((,initial-buffers (buffer-list))) (unwind-protect ,(macroexp-progn body) (dolist (b (buffer-list)) (unless (memq b ,initial-buffers) (kill-buffer b))))))) 
 EDIT: The code above was updated with your feedback, mainly u/nv-elisp, bellow is my original code:
 (defmacro with-save-buffer-list (&amp;rest body) &quot;Run BODY and kill any buffers that were not already open.&quot; (declare (debug (form body)) (indent 1)) (cl-with-gensyms (initial-buffers final-buffers new-buffers buf) &#x60;(let ((,initial-buffers (buffer-list))) (prog1 (progn ,@body) (let* ((,final-buffers (buffer-list)) (,new-buffers (cl-set-difference ,final-buffers ,initial-buffers))) (mapcar (lambda (buf) (kill-buffer buf)) ,new-buffers))))))

I use this for all kinds of little things like &#x60;pdb&#x60; adds &#x60;import pdb; pdb.set_trace()&#x60; when I am python hacking. Or loading a template of a common bit of code for work. Is there something better these days?

 I&#x27;m fairly fresh into my Emacs experience but have been working through the configuration. I&#x27;ve been working on a function that checks the extension of the open file, and if it matches one of the ones I&#x27;m interested in (cpp, el, python) then it returns the Org Capture Babel src language. When I evaluate the function in my init.el, I get &quot;emacs-lisp&quot; - that&#x27;s what I want. When I attempt to put it in a template, I get an error where it says it&#x27;s expecting stringp but got nil. Toggle Debug on doesn&#x27;t seem to provide any information (I could be looking in the wrong spot.)
 (defun get-value-from-extension () &quot;Return a value based on the extension of the current buffer&#x27;s file.&quot; (interactive) (let ((extension (file-name-extension (buffer-file-name)))) (cond ((string-equal extension &quot;cpp&quot;) &quot;cpp&quot;) ((string-equal extension &quot;el&quot;) &quot;emacs-lisp&quot;) ((string-equal extension &quot;org&quot;) &quot;org&quot;) ((string-equal extension &quot;py&quot;) &quot;python&quot;) ))) ;; Org Capture Template using plain &quot;%(get-value-from-extension)&quot; 
 I could be missing something here, but have tried a lot of combinations with no success. What am I missing?

                              <span>Hello everyone, I have made several posts about creating dynamic keymaps in emacs. So far, the approach that many r/emacs users have helped me come to uses the native menu system.
 Example of a dynamic keymap with menus
  (defvar-keymap my/modified-buffer-keymap (kbd &quot;s&quot;) (lambda () (interactive) (message &quot;this buffer is modified&quot;))) (defvar-keymap my/unmodified-buffer-keymap (kbd &quot;t&quot;) (lambda () (interactive) (message &quot;this buffer is unmodified&quot;))) (defun my/filter-function (cmd) (if (buffer-modified-p) (progn (message &quot;using modified keymap&quot;) my/modified-buffer-keymap) (message &quot;using unmodified keymap&quot;) my/unmodified-buffer-keymap)) (define-key global-map (kbd &quot;C-c p&quot;) &#x27;(menu-item &quot;&quot; nil :filter my/filter-function))

                              <span>I didn&#x27;t realize that modules were on by default in emacs builds under both linux and windows.. and how easy it is to write one. 
 I was thinking about applications where I would render into an emacs window with c++ code so my first module was a horrible hack that implements a windows box drawing call to the active HWND, It works, as long as you keep calling it so emacs doesn&#x27;t paint over it. 
 Pretty sure I&#x27;d have to modify emacs itself to make this work fully:
 - add some lisp function get the os window handle for a frame.
 - add some way to provide an elisp callback for painting a given emacs window (or buffer) that replaces the normal logic. 
 The other thing I&#x27;m tempted to do is link in my 3d engine into it so emacs can create vr worlds. Though I can&#x27;t think of any use for it off-hand.

                              <span>Is there a way to have a column view Dynamic Block base its output on multiple files (and ideally on all files in org-agenda-files)?
 I tried messing with the FILE option for the if: parameter in the block&#x27;s #BEGIN: line, but as far as I can see, it supports only a single file, but I may just be doing it wrong syntactically.
 I note that the documentation says (bold emphasis mine): &quot;Column view is a feature that is often localized to a certain (sub)tree...&quot; and I&#x27;m hoping that the word &quot;often&quot; is significant, given the context. That is, &quot;often&quot; seems to imply that while you can narrow a Dynamic Block column view to a (sub)tree, you don&#x27;t have to. On the other hand, the only other id: option that would seem to be a possibility is LABEL, and its description says (again, emphasis mine): &quot;Call column view in the tree ...&quot;, which is less hopeful.

                              <span>Hello all!
 I&#x27;m embarking on the never-ending Emacs and Org journey. I&#x27;m starting out with one use case that seems appropriate for Emacs and Org mode, but I&#x27;m having a hard time figuring out exactly how I go about getting it to work. Given the breadth and depth of Emacs and Org mode, I&#x27;m hoping someone could help me quickly get started with just the Org mode part of this task, so I can springboard off it and (begin to) learn the rest. I don&#x27;t want to fall prey to https://xyproblem.info/ so I&#x27;m going to be really detailed about what I want to do to mitigate my subsequent questions betraying what I really want. Also, I don&#x27;t want this post to come off as &quot;Hey can you solve x for me?&quot; At the bottom, I have where I&#x27;m currently at and what I&#x27;m exploring. I&#x27;d be very happy with just a &quot;Yeah, tha…</span>

                              <span>Now that I&#x27;ve gotten elispdoc to the point its usable for me, I decided to publish my work in progress init file at https://github.com/benleis1/emacs-init. I&#x27;m biased but I think I ended up with fairly good fidelity to a literate style init file. 
 This is both a demo of elispdoc - the readme.md file was autogenerated from the init.el file and a chance to share / get interesting feedback.

                              <span>hy guyz i am using following function from König website it works fine but when i run it on a heading that have a link that have describtion as well it breaks and donot yank the heading properly for example for smthing like * [[https://www.reddit.com/][Dive into anything]] it give me following [[id:b12dbb22-c214-4d0a-b2dd-ddb1782492f9][[[https://www.reddit.com/][Dive into anything]]]] instead of : [[id:b12dbb22-c214-4d0a-b2dd-ddb1782492f9][Dive into anything]] help me with you elisp skills
 the function is 
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; (defun my/copy-idlink-to-clipboard() &quot;Copy an ID link with the headline to killring, if no ID is there then create a new unique ID. This function works only in org-mode or org-agenda buffers. 
 The purpose of this function is to easily construct id:-links to org-mode items. If its assigned to a key it saves you marking the text and copying to the killring.&quot; (interactive) (when (eq major-mode &#x27;org-agenda-mode) ;switch to orgmode (org-agenda-show) (org-agenda-goto))
 (when (eq major-mode &#x27;org-mode) ; do this only in org-mode buffers (setq mytmphead (nth 4 (org-heading-components))) (setq mytmpid (funcall &#x27;org-id-get-create)) (setq mytmplink (format &quot;[[id:%s][%s]]&quot; mytmpid mytmphead)) (kill-new mytmplink) (message &quot;Copied %s to killring (clipboard)&quot; mytmplink) ))
 (global-set-key (kbd &quot;&quot;) &#x27;my/copy-idlink-to-clipboard) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

                              <span>Hello, I&#x27;m having trouble setting up emojis on Doom Emacs and hoping to get some help here. I&#x27;m on WSL2 (Ubuntu 22.04 jammy) on Windows 11 running Emacs 29.2 installed via snap.
 My config used to work on my previous PC just by enabling the following on init.el (https://docs.doomemacs.org/v21.12/modules/ui/emoji/) with no extra config.
 (emoji +unicode) 
 The emojis were missing on my new PC, only displaying an empty space. In an attempt to fix this, I&#x27;ve added the following lines to config.el(following instructions here: https://ianyepan.github.io/posts/emacs-emojis/)...
 (use-package! emojify :config (when (member &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot; (font-family-list)) (set-fontset-font t &#x27;symbol (font-spec :family &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot;) nil &#x27;prepend)) (setq emojify-display-style &#x27;image) (setq emojify-emoji-styles &#x27;(unicode)) ) 
 ... but as you can see, not all emojis show up correctly...
 https://preview.redd.it/8e8pfwgpy8qc1.png?width&#x3D;1137&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;b0a62aef50625286bdb163da735e8c51f27d5cbe
 What I really want to do is to set (setq emojify-display-style &#x27;image) though, with the following...
 (use-package! emojify :config (when (member &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot; (font-family-list)) (set-fontset-font t &#x27;symbol (font-spec :family &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot;) nil &#x27;prepend)) (setq emojify-display-style &#x27;unicode) (setq emojify-emoji-styles &#x27;(unicode)) ) 
 ... I get black and white emojis...
 https://preview.redd.it/044ahopcz8qc1.png?width&#x3D;1137&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;f8a21567c35448a450b5e7b45eb3b4855e37a50a
 (font-family-list) does return two instances of &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot;.
 Any help appreciated. Thanks!

                              <span>After recently discovering Org-Roam, I’m looking to migrate to a full Emacs setup, but there’s one non-negotiable feature I need to transfer: block references.
 Block references are links in one file to a block of text in another file by means of a uuid. The text is transcluded so you can preview the contents in any file it’s referenced and you can even see the number of backlinks to the original reference. There’s only one plugin that offers at least the uuid-based text block transclusion feature: Roam Block.
 So far, the solutions involved migrating everything from Logseq or Roam to Emacs Org-Mode, but losing block references by imputing the original referenced text in its place. I suspect the solution might look like obtaining the SQL or database file where all block uuids are referenced and somehow transfer this mapping to have the same uuid transcluded the same content. 
 If anyone has some ideas as to how to achieve this, I’m more than either to start a conversation on the how. Please understand that I’m trying to keep block references, and cannot leave them out of the solution. So far I’ve found org-transclusion, two org-Logseq scripts on Awesome Logseq, and a roam-migration script, but none of these solutions seem to migrate the block references.
 This really seems like a no-brainer to solve, but I don’t know how would the solution look like. I’m open to any solution whether migrating from Logseq or Roam, as long as block references are migrated :)

                              <span>Hey,
How long should a Note be?  Here comes a lot of bla-bla, just skip to the Itaic part: I summarised the introduction to the Zettelkasten (this -&gt; °Link°) to get an overview etc. and used 1700 words, but i think thats to much especially if I took a look at the Luhmanns Archive. I worked like with a Word document, so I made different headings and summarised different chapters of the text under them. (I copied a lot although you&#x27;re not supposed to do that)
So: how long should the different note types (literature and permanent) be, what should they contain and how many should I make on a certain topic or source? (no bla-bla anymore)
It would be nice if you could take a look at the first 2 or 3 &quot;chapters&quot; (link above) and tell me what your Zettel would look like.
cheers.</span>

Ideas I&#x27;m exploring with my ZK:
My Zk is another story. I have a couple of new areas of attention–cogency and ambiance. I&#x27;m studying these terms and how they relate to ideation and love, respectively.

                              <span>Hi.. I am a beginner in Haskell and have been going through texts like LYAH .. I keep coming across this statement &quot;Haskell is declarative programming.. Unlike C or ruby it always defines what a function is and not how it should work&quot; and i am not able to understand this part.. 
 an example given in LYAH is
 double :: Int -&gt; Int
 double x &#x3D; x * 2
 If I do the same in ruby
 def twice (x)
 p x * 2
 end
 In both cases i have expressly stated as to how the function should operate.. So why is haskell declarative and why is ruby not.. ?
 In fact in every language where we define a custom function we do have to define its implementation. so whats different about Haskell ?
 Apart from stating the types of input and output explicitly in Haskell I can see no difference apart from the syntax .
 Have i missed out something or am I stating something colossally stupid?

                              <span>I just finished moving a project (using persistent/esqueleto) from stack to cabal, cabal build/test/run are all working fine. However, if I try to &#x60;cabal install&#x60; it cant find my .persistentmodels files, as if the working directory is different between install and the other commands. Am I missing something here?
 ​

 Just to be clear, this project works fine when using &#x60;cabal build&#x60;, &#x60;cabal run&#x60; and &#x60;cabal test&#x60;.

                              <span>Hi,
 I have a minor annoyance that I would like to fix/understand.
 I currently use this as org-roam capture template:
 (setq org-roam-capture-templates &#x27;((&quot;d&quot; &quot;default&quot; plain &quot;%?&quot; :if-new (file+head &quot;${slug}.org&quot; &quot;:PROPERTIES: :CREATED: ${mh/now} :END: #+title: ${title} &quot;) :immediate-finish t :unnarrowed t))) 
 I deliberately added an empty line after the title because what I want is that after capturing I want an empty line after the title and the cursor to be placed at the beginning of the next line.
 But this is not what is happening. In fact after the capture there are two empty lines created after the title but the cursor is placed on the line immediately following the title - it seems to me that it does not matter how much white space you add at the end of your template, the cursor always seems to be inserted immediately after the title.
 So my question: Is there a way to configure a capture template in such a way that after the capture the cursor is 2 lines below the title with an empy line between the title and the cursor?

                              <span>Background: I don’t know any programming languages but am open to learn a bit. I set up my Emacs and org-mode by googling and copy-pasting, so nothing systematic. I also only know very basic functions.
 Now, if I would like to rebuild everything from the scratch, and explore org-mode step-by-step and eventually making it as my systematic daily workflow, which video tutorial or article should I start? 
 I just want to start learning and enjoying org-mode as an organizing, writing workflow in my daily routine. And I would like to explore various functions in a reasonably progressive way. Something like a short video or intro article per day, and then start building up my workflow slowly but systematically, if that makes sense.
 Edit: I work in academia so my work requires a huge amount of writing, organizing, emailing, scheduling, and time-managing.

                              <span>Hi all,
 As the title suggests, when I make a new list item and go to the next line (not with M-ret just normally), it seems to get indented automatically, which I don&#x27;t want since the list item is not a nested list.
 Is this default behaviour? I even tried using the -q option with no config file but still see the same behaviour.
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I frequently use goto-last-change to move to the last changes I did in the current buffer. But in org mode this command doesn&#x27;t open the headings. If the change was done in the contents of a heading and the heading is currently closed, it just moves point to the (closed) heading.
 Is there any package like consult-mark, but for the buffer-local changes saved in the undo tree?
 I like it that consult-mark opens the headings and even gives a preview. But the mark-ring needs active setting of marks, I like about goto-chg.el that it keeps track of my edits automatically.

                              <span>Hello,
 I&#x27;m using the emacs-wayland package on Arch Linux under KDE Plasma6 and it is running great so far. However, when Emacs starts up there&#x27;s some flickering and the initial frame size is also kinda large with the effect that the frame is sometimes positioned partly off-screen.
 Under X11 I could manage a smooth startup by tweaking a .Xresource file (background color, initial window size etc).
 Now, obviously .Xresource is not effective under Wayland as far as I understand. Is there an equivalent way to achieve the same on Wayland so I can get a smooth startup?
 Thanks

                              <span>i have written an interpreter for a language which uses parsec to parse. each parser function has the type Parser X where X is a datatype that looks like this:
  data X &#x3D; I Int | F Float | E String -- error | etc... 
 the eval function ive written looks like this
  eval :: X -&gt; State -&gt; X 
 if eval returns an error E, id like it to be able to report what line from the original text caused the error. how do people typically do this? im at a loss.

 (add-hook &#x27;python-mode-hook (global-set-key (kbd &quot;C-x v a&quot;) &#x27;pyvenv-activate)) 
 doesn&#x27;t do the job as it skips the part when it&#x27;s supposed to ask me the venv path, and tells me that there is a missing argument.

                              <span>I use Linux and Windows. 
 The nerd icons package works well on Linux, but on Windows I cannot seem to get icons to appear within double quotes as strings.
 I can insert icons in a buffer manually, but I am having issues setting icons in my init.el file.
 Has anyone come across this issue?

 I&#x27;ve read the documents and set my regexp to accordingly to show leading whitespaces, but I&#x27;m still seeing normal spaces (that is, spaces between characters) replaced with a dot as well. Here&#x27;s the code I have set:
 (global-whitespace-mode 1) (setq whitespace-hspace-regexp &quot;\\(^\xA0+\\)&quot;) (setq whitespace-space-regexp &quot;\\(^ +\\)&quot;) (setq whitespace-style &#x27;(face spaces trailing space-mark)) 
 and:
  (set-face-attribute &#x27;whitespace-hspace nil :foreground (get-color &#x27;darkgray) :background (get-color &#x27;black)) (set-face-attribute &#x27;whitespace-space nil :foreground (get-color &#x27;darkgray) :background (get-color &#x27;black)) (set-face-attribute &#x27;whitespace-trailing nil :font normal-font :foreground (get-color &#x27;black) :background (get-color &#x27;red)) 
 Am I doing something wrong?

 In my lisp Skript, I would like to make from the heading a string. Therefore I would like to replace/remove [51%] 
 The result should look like: ** [2024-03-21 Do] test Projekt 
 (setq TTM_Heading (replace-regexp-in-string \[[0-9]{1,3}%\] &quot;&quot; TTM_Heading))
 To match it I tried [[0-9]{1,3}%] But it stays: ** [2024-03-21 Do] test Projekt [51%]
 Any hint?

                              <span>There are some complaints here that lsp-mode/eglot is slow in certain circumstances, and can freeze emacs for a longer period of time. Can you give me a simple case how to reproduce this? Like, &quot;clone this github repo, install this language server, and then notice that lsp-mode is slow on this and that file&quot;.
 (for context, I&#x27;m working on a faster JSON parser for Emacs, and I&#x27;d like to see the effects that the new parser has on the mentioned problems)

 Here is a post covering the first topic:

                              <span>I have category/tags setup such that one off events are of type Event and Recurring events are Recurring. 
 I do this so I can fitler to see upcoming one off events which tend to be actual events and recurring items which are often regular i.e. weekly occurrences like my side business meetings with my partner, weekly meetings at my normal job, weekly/monthly board game days or other items. I don&#x27;t typically want to see these recurring events when looking out 1-3 months. 
 I also use agenda icons so I categorize these with different icons so they differentiate at a glance. This all works splendidly. 
 What I&#x27;m trying to figure out however is how to quickly filter the agenda using an OR tag. If I include both Tags it will filter to events that are set to both types, which I do not do. I&#x27;ve been searching for some kind of additive list of tags. i.e. something like +TagA|+TagB but I&#x27;m not able to find any sort of OR operator within the quick filter. 
 I wanted to see if any one knows what the standard way to filter for this type of functionality would be. I&#x27;d rather not use -TAG for every tag other than the 2 I want to see.

                              <span>I love putting my tasks into the agenda, breaking them down as much as possible, and clocking in/out whenever I start/end working on a task. standup updates are so incredibly easy because I have an extremely granular profile of how I spent my time. I have a custom buffer I can access with C-c b that&#x27;s just a dynamic org-clock-report block set to yesterday so I just update it with C-c C-c and it gives me all the time I spent on each task. 
 if you&#x27;re not using org-clock-report, please give it a try :)

                              <span>I&#x27;m using a script to translate my calendars from ics to an org file, so that scheduled events appear in my agenda. An entry in the org file has the following format, with CALENDAR being an agenda keyword:
 * CALENDAR event description
 SCHEDULED: 
 In the agenda, this might show up between two scheduled tasks, one closed and one still open, as follows:
 SomeOrgFile 09:00 Scheduled: DONE SomeTask
 CalendarOrgFile 10:00-11:00 Scheduled: CALENDAR event description
 SomeOrgFile 11:00 Scheduled: TODO SomeOtherTask
 When checking with describe-char, the org-agenda-done face applies to the DONE task and the CALENDAR event, while the org-scheduled-today face applies to the 3rd (TODO) line.
 What I want is the second line (i.e., the file name, the time, &quot;Scheduled&quot;, and the event description) to be a different color from both the first and the 3rd line. How can I achieve this?

                              <span>I want to make my own custom keymap for emacs, but I have had some trouble with it due to the fact that I do not know how to re-add the basic necessity keybindings. Meaning: all the letters of the alphabet, the tab key and the default functionality of the mouse (i.e the default behaviors when clicking, double-clicking, dragging, etc.). If you could give me the commands or show me where I can acquire them I would be very thankful. Thank you in advance.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve declared Dot Emacs bankruptcy. My current setup became impossible to maintain and extend.
 I know it&#x27;s lame, but configuring Emacs when I am an Elisp noob, with the support of ChatGPT, is pure pleasure. Custom functions, code refactoring, suggesting non-trivial solutions - awesome.

 Big thanks go to Luigi Sartor Piucco for the PR, Henrik Lissner for Doom Emacs, and Daniel Mendler for corfu.
 Henrik seems to be really happy about this :-)
  
It&#x27;s been a long time coming, but thanks so much for your hard work (and patience with me)! I have big plans for this module post-v3 (to phase out Company and go all in on Corfu), so I&#x27;m happy to finally get this merged. Thanks again!

                              <span>Update: I ended up recreating the same git worktree and this solved the issue. It must have been something inside the worktree data.
 Committing from magit (magit-20240320.2336, GNU Emacs 29.2 (build 2, x86_64-w64-mingw32) of 2024-02-01, Windows 10) seems to have recently broken on my machine.
 In magit, with staged changes, I press C C, the commit message buffer is displayed and then the info line shows that git has failed:
 Running C:/Program Files/Git/mingw64/libexec/git-core/git.exe commit -- Only whitespace and/or comments; message not saved Diffing changes to be committed (C-g to abort diffing) Type C-c C-c to finish, C-c C-k to cancel, and M-p and M-n to recover older messages [2 times] error in process sentinel: with-editor-kill-buffer-noop: Don’t kill this buffer #. Instead cancel using C-c C-k error in process sentinel: Don’t kill this buffer #. Instead cancel using C-c C-k Git failed ... [Hit $ to see buffer magit-process: XXXXXXXXXXXXX for details] 
 The magit-process buffer shows nothing useful:
  1 git.exe … &quot;commit&quot; &quot;--&quot; 
 I&#x27;ve tried restarting emacs multiple times, no change.
 I was committing happily yesterday so I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s going on.
 Has anyone else experienced this?

                              <span>I already filed a ticket with the MacPorts tree-sitter-rust port (https://trac.macports.org/ticket/69548), but I was wondering if anyone else here has a similar setup and either doesn&#x27;t experience this or has found the root cause of the issue.
 I saw a similar post about MacPorts, and python-ts-mode here: https://old.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/1848h8w/enabling_pythonts_mod%C4%99_causes_my_emacs_memory/
 The author there said that they ended up compiling everything from scratch and it worked correctly, so there must be an issue with the MacPorts builds specifically. 
 Does anyone here have any guesses or insights?
 It&#x27;s very easy to reproduce:
  
Install emacs or emacs-app from MacPorts, with no fancy flags or anything: port install emacs-app
 Launch emacs with default init: emacs -q
 Open a brand new rust buffer: C-x C-f test.rs
 Switch to rust-ts-mode: M-x rust-ts-mode
 Watch Emacs process go unresponsive with CPU pegged to 100% and memory climbing to infinity.
  
I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s incorrect to manually switch to rust-ts-mode without any configuration, but if that&#x27;s not the proper way to do it, the issue still occurs with an init.el that just installs the rust-mode package, and sets (setq rust-mode-treesitter-derive t). It also happens if you don&#x27;t use that variable and instead use the more generic (setq major-mode-remap-alist &#x27;(rust-mode . rust-ts-mode)).

                              <span>Does there exist documents or videos or other resources to help migrate from Vim? 
  
What I want: 
 basic movement and edit, 
 option setting, 
 key bind setting, 
 autocmd (hook in Emacs?) setting, 
 command define, 
 basic Emacs lisp coding style.
 
 What I don&#x27;t want: 
 Evil or other emulation of vim. I will stick with native Emacs key bind.
 I hope there are not so many packages recommended. They are useful, but I want to learn more basics before using packages. So, recommend just some basic packages.
 
  
Thank you guys!

                              <span>I&#x27;m still very new to emacs, and am taking one Redditor&#x27;s advice of just living in it for 6 months or so to get it, instead of procrastinating until I&#x27;ve gone through all the &quot;right&quot; tutorials and such. I like the approach, and I&#x27;ve learned a lot - I&#x27;m at the stage where C-s no longer means &quot;save&quot; but &quot;search,&quot; and sometimes when I try to paste something outside of emacs, I get confused for a second when C-y doesn&#x27;t work. But I&#x27;m reluctant to make changes to my config file yet - when I have the time to look into that stuff properly, I want a vanilla setup, so I know I can follow any tutorial without worrying about one thing maybe breaking another, or whatever. 
 With that in mind, I want to go through Euclid in org-mode. Ideally, I&#x27;d be writing proofs, working through problems, and drawing &amp; colouring diagrams that would directly show up in my file, not have to be compiled into a LaTeX pdf or whatever. If that&#x27;s too high a bar, let me know what I can reasonably expect.

 I am mostly happy with it. The one issue that bothers me a lot is when I type:  function foo() { &lt;--- ENTER __ &lt;--- That&#x27;s two spaces! 
 But when I call indent-region it turns the two spaces into four.
 How do I make this consistent?

                              <span>Hi, I just watched a cool video about an AI powered note taking tool called Mem by Tiago Forte, author of BASB. I was just wondering if anyone here has managed to achieve an Emacs config with similar integration to other apps (i.e. Twitter, OneNote, email, etc.).

                              <span>Evaluation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems is paramount for any industry-quality usage. Without proper evaluation we end up in the world of “it works on my machine”.
In the realm of AI, this would be called “it works on my questions”.
Whether you are an engineer seeking to refine your RAG systems, are just intrigued by the nuances of RAG evaluation or are eager to read more after the first part of the series (Evaluating retrieval in RAGs: a gentle introduction) — you are in the right place.
This article equips you with the knowledge needed to navigate evaluation in RAGs and the framework to systematically compare and contrast existing evaluation libraries. This framework covers benchmark creation, evaluation metrics, parameter space and experiment tracking.

                              <span>I have a custom tree-sitter grammar for a language called &quot;core&quot; and would like to use it for syntax highlighting in emacs. I&#x27;ve tested and highlighted works from the command line using tree-sitter highlight. I have not found clear instructions yet on how to do this. All posts refer to grammars for other existing languages.
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; (define-derived-mode core-ts-mode prog-mode &quot;core&quot; &quot;Major mode for editing Core language files.&quot;)

 (require &#x27;tree-sitter-langs) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Few comments:
 cc and c++ paths are specified because emacs is installed via snap and needs to use gcc instead of system-installed clang to compile shared library. It was a problem which I fixed.
 (treesit-ready-p &#x27;core) returns t.
 When opening .core file and using tree-sitter-hl-mode command, I get:
 &quot;No language registered for major mode ‘core-ts-mode’&quot; error.
 Indeed tree-sitter-major-mode-language-alist does not mention &quot;core&quot;.
 What I am doing wrong?

                              <span>When I launch emacs with --init-directory&#x3D;C:\SomeDirectory in Windows Emacs still uses the .emacs file under the AppData\Roaming directory.
 Isn&#x27;t the purpose if --init-directory to avoid this all together, and look for or create .emacs in the --init-directory?
 I take it that --init-directory is the equivalent of .emacs.d.
 Do .emacs and init.el have to be explicitly set on the command line invocation if they shouldn&#x27;t be the defaults?

                              <span>I previously gave some first impressions of lsp-booster + lsp-mode. https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/1b494py/lspmode_emacslspbooster_first_impressions_and/
 I switched back to lsp-mode from lsp-bridge because I missed xref and helm, and those are still good reasons to use lsp-mode. But I&#x27;ve switched back to lsp-bridge, and I think it may be for a long time. And I don&#x27;t think that I&#x27;ll write an update every time here--I mean, maybe I need a blog or something if I really think that might happen--but I thought this was relevant to anyone who saw the last post.
 lsp-bridge is just faster. Straight up, no questions, it&#x27;s faster. I was seeing multi-second stalls in lsp-mode again, and it&#x27;s worth pointing out again that this isn&#x27;t a problem with lsp-mode per se, this is emacs&#x27; problem. It&#x27;…</span>

                              <span>Hello, I have posted a few times on the topic of dynamic keymaps in emacs. As per some suggestions on my previous posts and other sources, I wrote a minor mode to house all of my leader keybindings. However, the :filter property on menu-items is actually called ONCE when the keymap is evaluated and never again. This behavior seems to diverge from examples I have seen. Does anyone know how to fix this? Maybe I am doing something wrong.
 As soon as I start emacs I see the message &quot;filtering!&quot; then &quot;Going to use regular code keymap&quot;. Then whenever I do &quot;C-SPC c&quot; I always get the default keymap and I don&#x27;t see any more messages printed from my filter function.

                              <span>I have a workflow these days that takes advantage of file-local variables. I recognize them as a potential code-injection vector and appreciate that emacs provides interlocks (like &#x60;enable-local-variables&#x60; and &#x60;safe-local-variable-values&#x60;) to customize the level of scrutiny they receive before emacs evaluates them.
 One option that I can&#x27;t find that would be nice-to-have would be to tell emacs &quot;all file-local variables for all buffers with default-directory set to this directory are safe; apply regular scrutiny rules to any others.&quot; This should be safe for my workflow as I control all paths to new buffers spawning with default-directory set to my safe directory.
 I don&#x27;t see an obvious way to enable that; is that a feature I haven&#x27;t found in the docs, or is there a clever way to cobble it together?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve install the multiple cursors plugin, and have it set up like so:
 (use-package multiple-cursors :ensure t :bind (&quot;C-.&quot; . mc/edit-lines) (&quot;C-j&quot; . mc/mark-next-like-this-word)) 
 This mostly works, but it some modes override this keybinding. For example, in the scratch buffer, I see that C-j is bound to eval-print-last-sexp and in tex files, it&#x27;s bound to reindent-then-newline-and-indent.
 I have a few questions: 1) How I can make my mapping take precedence across all modes (but still have C-j work as normal in other mappings, e.g. C-x C-j for dired jump and 2) How can I override my mapping for a specific list of modes (e.g. in tex-mode, use the multiple cursors mapping, but in scratch buffers use eval-print-last-sexp instead.
 Thanks!

 foo/bar/baz foo/bar/foo 
 a prompt &quot;foo foo&quot; would match only the second candidate?
 Or is there some simple modification to the &quot;foo foo&quot; prompt that would do this?
 Bonus question - how to still match only the foo/bar/foo candidate if there is another candidate foo/bar/foo/baz/foo? In other words: how to match candidates with exact number of occurences of foo?

As an example, I recently opened /path/foo, and now I want to open file bar which is also in /path but has not recently been opened so recentf-mode knows nothing about it. I would like consult-buffer to be able to check for bar in any of the paths to recently opened files before failing the search. Is there something in either of those packages today that would do this that I am missing in the documentation? If not would this be a feature others would make use of?

                              <span>Hello everyone, is there way to get auto-completion for lisp file so that I am dont need to always compile program in slime? I tried slime-company, but it doesn&#x27;t work for me (its just don&#x27;t show errors, available completion and etc). Maybe there is some lsp for lisp?

                              <span>Heya friends,
 I thought the following would Just Work™️:
 (with-eval-after-load &quot;embark&quot; (with-eval-after-load &quot;eglot&quot; (defvar-keymap embark-eglot-map :doc &quot;Keymap for Embark Eglot/LSP actions.&quot; &quot;r&quot; #&#x27;eglot-rename) (define-key embark-identifier-map (kbd &quot;C-l&quot;) embark-eglot-map) )) 
 I can trigger the function just fine -- go to a variable, then C-, for embark-act, then C-l r and boom.
 Thing is: M-x eglot-rename interactively asks for a new name in the minibuffer.
 Invoking this function via Embark does not prompt for a new name and instead finishes right away. So I can&#x27;t effectively rename anything this way. (Confusingly, running that command on $myVar immediately finished and changes occurrences to $$myVar :))
 For context, this is the start of eglot-rename:
 (defun eglot-rename (newname) &quot;Rename the current symbol to NEWNAME.&quot; (interactive (list (read-from-minibuffer (format &quot;Rename &#x60;%s&#x27; to: &quot; (or (thing-at-point &#x27;symbol t) &quot;unknown symbol&quot;)) nil nil nil nil (symbol-name (symbol-at-point))))) ...) 
 Does Embark do anything automatically when calling functions that I could be missing?
 Is there a term for this phenomenon to search for?

                              <span>I do both. It depends on where I am and how I invoke Emacs. In my case, I sit 95 percent of the time on the Emacs terminal version, i.e., the Emacs client running on the terminal, which suits my mundane and trivial workflow. 
 Now, if I want to see pdf while sitting in that mode, I have to take advantage of the proper pdf viewer in the system(that is how I figured and used to) . W
 While on GUI mode, you could do so inside it with pdf-tool or docview(previously).
 Now, the query is: 
 What do you prefer? And why?

                              <span>Hello guys. I have some org-capture templates, some of them are intended to store meeting entries for clocking purposes and note taking. I’ve been having issues with my flow, because I tend to start by: “I had some things to debate here, let me go to my notes”. I mean, I’m already calling a template. How do you guys store your agenda for recurring meetings? How do for any other kind of similar flows? (e.g. I’m thinking about a meeting with a particular team and that topic you were willing to debate with them whenever there’s a chance).

                              <span>I&#x27;m learning to use tikz and the lines below help me render the images inline but I just can&#x27;t figure out how to add &quot;\usetikzlibrary{intersections}&quot; to this.
 (add-to-list &#x27;org-latex-packages-alist &#x27;(&quot;&quot; &quot;tikz&quot; t)) 
 (eval-after-load &quot;preview&quot; &#x27;(add-to-list &#x27;preview-default-preamble &quot;\PreviewEnvironment{tikzpicture}&quot; t)) (setq org-latex-create-formula-image-program &#x27;imagemagick)
 How can I go about this? I tried using this (see last line)
 (setq org-preview-latex-default-process &#x27;my:dvipng) (add-to-list &#x27;org-preview-latex-process-alist &#x27;(my:dvipng :programs (&quot;latex&quot; &quot;dvipng&quot;) :description &quot;dvi &gt; png&quot; :message &quot;you need to install the programs: latex and dvipng.&quot; :image-input-type &quot;dvi&quot; :image-output-type &quot;png&quot; :image-size-adjust (1.0 . 1.0) :latex-compiler (&quot;latex -interaction nonstopmode -output-directory %o %f&quot;) :image-converter (&quot;dvipng -D %D -T tight -o %O %f&quot;) :transparent-image-converter (&quot;dvipng -D %D -T tight -bg Transparent -o %O %f&quot;) :latex-header (&quot;\usepackage{tikz}&quot; &quot;\usetikzlibrary{intersections}&quot;))) 
 But that doesn&#x27;t seem to work. It complains that I have given wrong type argument for :latex-header and the description says it expects a list of strings but that&#x27;s what I seem to have given it. Now I&#x27;m quite lost. Any suggestions?

                              <span>I know it&#x27;s something simple, but suddenly when I ask the REPL 1 + 1 I now get the answer 2, but only after a big warning about something:
 :2:1-5: warning: [-Wtype-defaults] • Defaulting the type variable ‘a0’ to type ‘Integer’ in the following constraints (Show a0) arising from a use of ‘print’ at :2:1-5 (Num a0) arising from a use of ‘it’ at :2:1-5 • In a stmt of an interactive GHCi command: print it 2 
 What is this saying and how can I avoid it?

                              <span>So I’m going insane trying to solve this problem. No imports allowed and none of the usual functions which would assist like map, zip, fold etc. (however could be built manually). 
 The function takes a list and outputs the most occurring element. Eq [a] &#x3D;&gt; [a] -&gt; a
 To assist with this, my thinking is to create a helper function which would take a list and output a list of tuples [a] -&gt; [(a, Int)]. The output effectively being a dictionary which would give me the frequency of each element. 
 This wouldn’t be too hard for me in Python, however, the functional paradigm is really tripping me out and I can’t build this “dictionary” whatever I do. 
 Any help much appreciated! Thanks

                              <span>Apologies for the super newbie question below--I&#x27;m just now exploring Haskell. If there&#x27;s a more appropriate place for asking questions like this, please let me know.
 I&#x27;m very inexperienced with statically typed language (haven&#x27;t used one in years), but I work in a research lab where we use Clojure, and as a thought experiment, I&#x27;m trying to work out how our core Clojure system would be implemented in Haskell. The key challenge seems to be that Haskell doesn&#x27;t allow polymorphic lists--or I saw someone call them heterogeneous lists?--with more than one concrete type. That&#x27;s gonna cause a big problem for me, unless I&#x27;m missing something.
 So we have this set of &quot;components.&quot; These are clojure objects that all have the same core functions defined on them (like a haskell typeclass), but they all do something different. Essentially, they each take in as input a list of elements, and then produce as output a new list of elements. These elements, like the components, are heterogeneous. They&#x27;re implemented as Clojure hashmaps that essentially map from a keyword to anything. They could be implemented statically as records, but there would be many different records, and they&#x27;d all need to go into the same list (or set).
 So that&#x27;s the challenge. We have a heterogenous set of components that we&#x27;d want to represent in a single list/set, and these produce a hetereogeneous set of elements that we&#x27;d want to represent in a single list/set. There might be maybe 30-40 of each of these, so representing every component in a single disjunctive data type doesn&#x27;t seem feasible.
 Does that question make sense? I&#x27;m curious if there&#x27;s a reasonable solution in Haskell that I&#x27;m missing. Thanks.

                              <span>I was diagnosed Type 2 Diabetes a year ago. Since then I always want to have a systematic study on how to prevent complications, plan my diet and exercises.
I just need to figure out where to begin all this.
My current plan is to use the DK&#x27;s Diabete&#x27;s Handbook as a lead-in, which I hope could give me a systematic overview, and then I plan to add more articles and books to each part of the topic.
Then I start my plan last week by reading the handbook,  but I notice I have no idea how to read a book. I admit it indeed sounds silly. I was a good student when I was in the college. Now I&#x27;m not. I don&#x27;t know what to do when I go through each line, paragraph on the page.
So I&#x27;m wondering if anyone could share a realistic approach to read a book/books/article. By realistic, I mean I really hope it&#x27;s not some theory education with really confused vocabularies. Think me like a 12 year old student, not some top scientists.
Thank you and wish you all well.</span>

Its the company preview front-end. I&#x27;d like to move to corfu since I am already using orderless. Does anybody know if corfu does this and would it be possible to have a corfu offer both a tooltip front-end and a preview front end that I can bind to different keys and use as I chose.

 I have this in my config:
  (general-evil-define-key &#x27;(normal) org-mode-map &quot;DEL&quot; &#x27;mh/del &quot;C-DEL&quot; &#x27;mh/del ) 
 And the first binding works, however the second (the one I actually want) does not.
 What could the problem be here?

                              <span>I usually use Emacs for writing and editing and organizing, but seldom do I program anything with Emacs.
 That changed a bit in recent weeks. To my surprise I found that binding RET to default-indent-new-line was surprisingly useful, because it automatically continues block comment asterisks in C-style languages.
 The default key binding is M-j to continue comment blocks in a somewhat DWIM way. So with the point at the end of the comment line:
 /** * Writing here.‸ */ 
 You get 
 /** * Writing here. * ‸ */ 
 I bound this to RET (which was newline) and so far haven&#x27;t found any problems with it.
 I&#x27;m also pretty sure I&#x27;ve never seen anyone do this stupid rebind, so what are you all using instead?

                              <span>The goal is to support a line based multi word out of order search using the built-in isearch framework (not using swiper, ctrlf, consult, etc) as I like how isearch works. I&#x27;m trying to avoid the word &#x27;orderless&#x27; because that implies all kinds of awesome from the wonderful vertico and orderless packages which this has nothing to do with (no completing read here.)
 Search for &quot;foo bar&quot; to match &quot;foo blah bar&quot; and also &quot;bar blah foo&quot;; can escape by searching for &quot;foo\ bar&quot; to find precisely &quot;foo bar&quot; however.
 The very first cut hack repo is here: https://github.com/skeezix/isearch-out-of-order
 I use out of order search every day, for half remembered function names etc; super handy. I&#x27;ve gotten by with swiper tweaked to look like isearch but wanted to not require the whole ivy stack, and I…</span>

                              <span>Hey guys,
 I am new to elisp. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;d be glad if some of you could help me out.
 What I want to achieve
 I want to enable hl-line-mode and display-line-number-mode in all current and future buffers derived from prog-mode, text-mode, conf-mode and dired-mode. I also want to be able to toggle this functionality. By default I want this to be turned off. I just want to enable this from time to time.
 I&#x27;ll outline the high level way I thought about achieving this.
 Adding functionality
  
Add mode hooks to enable functionality in future buffers. (1)
 Apply buffer-local minor mode functions to all buffers derived from specific modes. (2)
  
Removing functionality
  
Remove mode hooks such that future buffers don&#x27;t have it. (3)
 Apply buffer-local minor mode functions to all buffers derived from specfic modes to toggle/disable functionality activated in step 2 above. This step might the same as step 2 above because hl-line-mode and display-line-number-mode provide toggling. (4)
  
I know how to add and remove hooks but I don&#x27;t know how implement steps 2 and 4. Especially checking whether buffers are in a mode derived from a specific major mode or not.
 I&#x27;d be really happy to receive some help on how to go about it.
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Some URIs can contain URI fragments, e.g. foo.bar/baz#locator where locator is the fragment. See RFC 5147. Is there a way to reliably handle these in emacs?
 Here&#x27;s my usecase: I use ebib, which lets me store a PDF filepath in a bibtex entry, then open the file at the filepath with a command when I&#x27;m viewing that entry. One problem with this is that often (in my discipline at least) the bibtex entry doesn&#x27;t relate to a file, it relates to some part of a file (e.g. where the entry is for a paper published in a collection, and my file is a PDF of the whole collection). The obvious way to get around this is to store a URI with a fragment in the bibtex file field (e.g. path/to/my.pdf#page&#x3D;210 for a paper which starts on page 210 of the collection). 
 However, as far as I can tell, emacs doesn&#x27;t support using URI fragments in finding files. Am I right/wrong? Is there a good known solution?
 To be clear, I know I could write a custom file handler function for ebib specifically, but that seems a bit too specific. I&#x27;d rather have a general way of handling this, so that ebib doesn&#x27;t have to do anything unusual. That way, other applications which deal with the same cases (e.g. citar, in the case above) will inherit the same functionality.
 TIA!

I don&#x27;t want to lose corfu, and, while using C-g before TAB works, it&#x27;s slower. Is there a capf fore cdlatex or something like that? I found there is a company backend on the issues of cdlatex, so I suppose is doable (if there isn&#x27;t any I&#x27;ll try do it myself, but I&#x27;ve already got a big list).

 I&#x27;ve tried: org :PROPERTIES: :header-args:sql: :var tableName&#x3D;someTable :END: 
 But it doesn&#x27;t appear that sql blocks support &#x27;var&#x27;.
 I&#x27;ve tried: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;org
 Local variables:
 tableName: someTable
 End:

 But local variables only seem to work if the code block is of type emacs-lisp.
 So, is there some way to set file variables to be used for string replacements in org code blocks?

                              <span>I want a function like org-get-tags that will list not only local and inherited tags, but also group tags. Is there such a thing?
 To illustrate what I want, suppose I have the following in an org-mode buffer: 
 #+tags: [ group : {_.+} ] * This is a test :_test: ** This is another 
 Calling org-get-tags on the second headline (&quot;This is another&quot;) yields a list which includes the inherited tag _test (here we have org-use-tag-inheritance set to t, which is I believe the default). But it doesn&#x27;t include the group tag group. The same happens if I call org-get-tags on the first headline: I just get (&quot;_test&quot;) as a result. I&#x27;m looking for a way of getting all the tags, including group tags.
 I tried going over the definition of org-tags-view but I couldn&#x27;t really follow.

                              <span>Hello all,
 I was playing with generating Core for simple definitions and noticed that GHC omits type applications for tuples. Here&#x27;s an example:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; module Foo where f :: a -&gt; [a] f x &#x3D; [x]
 g :: a -&gt; (a,a) g x &#x3D; (x,x) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 And here is the generated Core: 
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; ghc -c -O0 -ddump-simpl Foo.hs .... f :: forall a. a -&gt; [a] [GblId, Arity&#x3D;1, Unf&#x3D;OtherCon []] f &#x3D; \ (@a_aAC) (x_ag4 :: a_aAC) -&gt; GHC.Types.: @a_aAC x_ag4 (GHC.Types.[] @a_aAC) -- ^ ^ -- type application for list constructors
 g :: forall a. a -&gt; (a, a) [GblId, Arity&#x3D;1, Unf&#x3D;OtherCon []] g &#x3D; \ (@a_aAA) (x_ag5 :: a_aAA) -&gt; (x_ag5, x_ag5) --- ^ --- no type applications &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Is this just pretty-printing or is there something else going on?

                              <span>Hey all,
 We&#x27;ve been using persistent at work for a new project and it&#x27;s been serving us well.
 To run db queries, we&#x27;ve introduced a runDb function which is SqlPersistT m a -&gt; m a, implemented using runSqlPool.
 A standard &quot;business logic&quot; function looks like this RunDb m &#x3D;&gt; m Something and it uses runDb internally.
 Larger business logic pieces are composed of multiple of these functions.
 The code looks good, but we&#x27;ve noticed the following (probably obvious) problem:
 The following piece of code will run 3 transactions, because each &quot;business logic&quot; piece uses runDb internally:
 something &lt;- getSomething anotherThing &lt;- getAnotherThing processSomethingAndPersist something anotherThing 
 We&#x27;re ending up with hundreds of transactions for more complicated pieces of business logic, which is a bit excessive.
 We looked at persistent-mtl but could not get it to compile due to some weird GHC error (solveWanteds: too many iterations (limit &#x3D; 10)). However, after examining the code, it will still run separate transactions unless you call withTransaction and run everything in TransactionM.
 I thought about using some thread local state to store the current SqlBackend and use that if it&#x27;s available, but I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the right approach.
 How is this generally handled? We just want to have a single transaction per request, ideally with the ability to commit it and/or start a new one.

To deal with these issues I threw a bunch of println statements into the code. I&#x27;m wondering if is there any other way to test lazy or parallel code?

                              <span>Hi all! I noticed that sometimes the emacs process will emergency escape when I click C-g too many times on a completion prompt. How would one go about disabling this? Usually it happens when using Mu4e and switching inboxes but i don&#x27;t trigger it consistently There is no prompt to confirm before exiting. The stdout of emacs reports that the emergency escape key was pressed. I don&#x27;t have the output saved atm.
 Note: I run emacs on my tablet using termux. Phantom process limit is disabled on android. Its emacs killing itself
 Thank you, Quezta3

                              <span>I am very, Very, VERY happy to learn that I can sort the emacs buffers that contain notmuch search results!!!
 E.g. in buffer &quot;notmuch-saved-search-all mail&quot; esc-X read-only-mode toggles to make the buffer writeable and then C-x esc esc ... (sort-fields 3 (point-min) (point-max)) to sort the lines by the 3rd field, the from: address (mostly - I haven&#x27;t yet fixed the date+time formatting to be consistent).
 Hallelujah! I turned away from notmuch years ago because I thought it might have the &quot;search, don&#x27;t sort&quot; philosophy of gmail. Happily not. 
 Before I spend too much time writing my own sort, has anyone else already written them (and I just didn&#x27;t find them by searching the notmuch docs and web)?
 The usual sort by Sender, Recipient, Subject, status, dates, other headers... 
 Simple sorts should easy, once I figure out how to sort by the plist properties associated with each line of the buffers.
 I hope that somebody has already written grouped sorts - e.g. sort by the count of unread messages grouped by sender, etc. Shouldn&#x27;t be too hard, except makes the buffers no longer simple lists of lines - want 1 line per group sorted by counts, unfolding to message/thread lists.

                              <span>According to https://github.com/hlissner/evil-snipe#integration-into-avyevil-easymotion it is possible to integrate evil-snipe with avy or evil-motion. I am not sure what that means but from the title of that issue and the first message [Edit: this issue and first message https://github.com/hlissner/evil-snipe/issues/25#issuecomment-208068419 ], I am thinking it might mean adding labels to evil-snipe after the first result like the neovim extension leap.nvim.
 However, copy pasting that into my config.el for doom emacs results in an error, evaluting it directly does not seem to do anything.
 Why:
 The difference with just doing avy-goto-char-2 is that leap.nvim jumps directly to the first match wherease avy-goto-char-2 requires using a label to go to the first match. I would like to avoid using labels as much as possible as they can distracting.

 I&#x27;m working on a project that no longer uses github issues. We still have some old issues but they&#x27;re all closed.
 Is there a way to disable forge from fetching issues completely? Or filtering so it only fetches open issues?
 Thanks

                              <span>I opened a small issue yesterday asking if they would standardize and have all their faces inherit from the base one, doom-modeline. (There were a few stragglers who were coming from mode-line instead) . I thought perhaps I&#x27;d do a PR if others agreed with me. 4 fours later someone had already fixed it.

                              <span>I have recently fallen down the rabbit whole of trying to get a jupyter notebook-esque workflow in emacs. I used ein for a few years, but it&#x27;s been unreliable enough for me to look for new solutions. Many people seem to be using org-babel source blocks to reproduce this workflow. I started to tinker with this setup when I noticed eglot wasn&#x27;t working in my source blocks. Even if I C-c &#x27;, eglot still doesn&#x27;t work in the buffer that opens up (even though it&#x27;s in Python mode). Am I missing something? Is eglot supposed to be working here?

                              <span>A few weeks back someone showed me a new examples-based documentation system in Emacs. We were discussing proper usage of some elisp functions. For the life of me, I cannot remember the name of that docs subsystem. I cannot recall if it went in in 28.x or 29.x. Search engines and LLMs don&#x27;t know either.
 Anyone here can assist?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been trying to use eshell as my main shell and have encountered a situation I have no idea how to solve. I see two ways to use sudo in eshell. One is invoking sudo directly, which requires entering my password each time I use it. The other is using tramp; if I try to use it, then in order to terminate the ability to use sudo without a password, I need to terminate the created tramp sudo connection. I could probably solve it by closing such a connection automatically after a certain period, but I can&#x27;t even find a function that lists all active tramp connections. I saw a discussion on the internet suggesting:
 (setq eshell-prefer-lisp-variables t)
 (setq password-cache t)
 (setq password-cache-expiry 10)
 But it doesn&#x27;t do anything for my case.There&#x27;s a command called &#x27;tramp-cleanup-connection&#x27;. If I use it on a buffer where I opened a sudo connection, I see something like &#x27;/sudo:root@archlinux:&#x27;, and choosing this connection to close doesn&#x27;t do anything. Only using &#x27;tramp-cleanup-all-connections&#x27; closes it, obviously.
 My apologies for any technical inaccuracies, i&#x27;m not even an emacs user (yet).

https://xenodium.com/further-sqlite-mode-extensions
 
https://xenodium.com/sqlite-mode-goodies
 
 Since then, folks have reached out requesting either upstreaming or pushing to MELPA.
 While I can&#x27;t commit to upstreaming at this point, I can meet halfway on MELPA.
 As of yesterday, it&#x27;s available there: https://melpa.org/#/sqlite-mode-extras
 While I haven&#x27;t heard of issues, please continue treating as experimental and exercise safety by backing up your data.

                              <span>I&#x27;m not talking about emacsserver here, something completely different. This may be a heretical idea, but I want to see where it goes. I have an idea for a note-taking program that&#x27;s as nice-looking, performant and friendly as logseq or obsidian, but is fully backed by emacs and org-mode. I need features like tags, transclusion and backlinks, but also want all of Emacs: keyboard macros, eval&#x27;ed source blocks, LSP mode, etc. -- but over it all I want a smooth modern UI. I know some folks here will tell me how it&#x27;s possible in emacs; believe me, I&#x27;ve looked into the options for some years now (org-roam, org-logseq, org-transclusion, org-roam-ui and more) and the ones I&#x27;ve seen are slow or fragile or never bore fruit, so just bear with me and see if we can explore this idea.
 What I&#x27;d like is to run emacs in a headless way and sync, in realtime, a set of buffers to a modern UI (maybe electron, who knows). Let&#x27;s say we have a page in the UI, composed of a set of buffers (a buffer per block, maybe with sub-&quot;buffers&quot; transcluded into the UI), and the UI knows which emacs buffer corresponds to each block of text. My idea is the UI forwards keyboard &amp; mouse events to emacs and receives buffer updates (including text props &amp; overlays etc.), which it then displays in an integrated nice way. Could such a thing even be done? I don&#x27;t want to scrape the emacs pixels -- I want to &quot;export&quot; the meaningful contents of the buffer for display over a socket protocol. Text, properties, overlays, images, etc. with their semantics. 
 It seems like such a thing could be useful for other purposes as well, like using emacs to edit any text field in any app. Possibly even emacs could then run as an http service as the back end of a web app to run on Android or iOS. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m not the first to think of doing this; has anyone tried it before? What was learned?

                              <span>I know this is probably a problem more related to flatpak itself, but I&#x27;d no use it if my GNU/Linux distro would make it available on its repositories.
 I am using org-mode with LaTeX snippets inside for my notes, but Emacs cannot find LaTeX in the system. LaTeX is installed, so I think it&#x27;s just a matter of allowing Emacs to access the host binaries outside the container.
 My questions are:
  
what&#x27;s the best strategy to allow Emacs to access LaTeX? A separate flatpak? A special run option?
 Emacs 29 is great for its integration with org-roam How you installed it on your machjne? and this is why I want this version on my system. How you install Emacs29 on your distro? Is that updated?
  
Thanks for your attention and patience.

                              <span>After many experiments and hacks, dired-auto-readme is now available via Melpa and I think relatively safe to use.
 For Markdown preview, you will need to install Markdown mode. Rst and Org modes are already built-in into Emacs and work out of the box.
 Unfortunately, I had to raise the bar to Emacs 29.1 version. The reason is that Org-mode implements some new features that make this package substantially easier to implement and require less ugly hacks I used to use in the past. I think it is also a bit more efficient with the new org-fold.
 Not everything is perfect, some links will not be beautified; it works mostly in org-mode, but it is what it is - in the end of the day, still a hack. Hope you enjoy it anyway!

                              <span>In my project (Python and JavaScript), there are some functions that will accept a string as an input but only some specific ones are allowed. These are stored in a database. It would be really helpful if I had some kind of hint/suggestion as I&#x27;m typing it. So for example, if I write something like (Python):
  
self.get_document(&quot;
  
I want it to suggest from a list of strings after it fetches from the database. In other cases, I may also have some json files in the project which it needs to look through. I&#x27;m not sure if what I need should be implemented as an external LSP or something in Emacs itself. It would also be great if it can show an error if the string is invalid (which would otherwise be valid Python/JS).
 Will I need to write this from scratch or is there something already out there that I can use to build upon? I&#x27;ve just started using Emacs 2 weeks ago and I&#x27;m excited to explore how I can use its power to simplify my workflow. Any advice to push me in that direction is appreciated.

                              <span>Hi,
 I would like to record a file&#x27;s creation timestamp not as part of the filename but as a property.
 So I am trying to create a capture template that does that but I am struggeling to insert the proper time.
 This is what i have so far:
 (setq org-roam-capture-templates &#x27;((&quot;d&quot; &quot;default&quot; plain &quot;%?&quot; :if-new (file+head &quot;${slug}.org&quot; &quot;:PROPERTIES: :CREATED: [%&lt;%Y%m%d%H%M%S] :END: #+title: ${title}\n&quot;) :unnarrowed t))) 
 So my question is how do I get the current time inserted as property - can I do that with a capture template or do I need a trigger?
 Many thanks!

                              <span>TL;DR
 When using a time-prompted datetree capture -- i.e. one using file+olp+datetree and :time-prompt t -- how do I get my hands on the current date and time (i.e. the date and time when the capture is performed) and in a form I can use as an org timestamp (both active and inactive)?
 Details
 By default, a capture template using file+olp+datetree will store the captured entry in the datetree on the date of capture -- i.e. usually, in practice, today&#x27;s date. And that date is also made available in the various date/time-related %-escapes -- %U, %T, etc -- so as well as the item being located in the datetree according to that date, you can also insert the date into the content of the entry in various ways.
 However, if the capture template is given a :time-prompt t property then you are pr…</span>

                              <span>Lean 4 has a very cool feature that allows monadic do-blocks to contain imperative loops and mutable variables. This paper provides the motivation and theoretical underpinning.
 Since the concept is portable to any purely functional language supporting monad transformers, I thought it would be a fun experiment to implement it as a GHC plugin. The resulting plugin, donuts, allows for writing imperative style code such as this:
 guessPass :: IO Bool guessPass &#x3D; do let Mut guesses &#x3D; [] let Mut n &#x3D; 1 :: Int whileL (n  show n input  intercalate &quot;, &quot; guesses pure False 
 which the plugin desugars to monad transformer applications: ExceptT for control flow and StateT for mutable variables. Note that this works for any monadic do-block, not just IO.
 The imperativity is local in the sense that mutable variables are only mutable within the confines of the enclosing do-block&#x27;s body statements as well as the bodies of loops occurring in that block. Similar restrictions apply for control flow commands such as earlyReturn, breakL, and continueL.

                              <span>I always see functional programming talked about as an advantage in terms of a PL context, but I wonder if you can apply that same kind of thinking outside of that context?
 For example, an example I have was Chris Okasaki&#x27;s thesis - reading about his complexity arguments was a new way of thinking I hadn&#x27;t thought about before w.r.t. analysis of algorithms. Although I don&#x27;t know if you would consider that &quot;functional programming&quot; really. 
 I&#x27;m not too intricate with functional programming so I&#x27;m not sure if this is even a well formed question, but hopefully my point makes sense.

                              <span>When it was released, Scala 3 removed Scala 2&#x27;s runtime reflection capability replacing it with a compile-time macro-based reflection facility. While powerful, this new macro-based reflection exposes a lot of compiler internals and &quot;isms&quot; to the user, which is not always easy to understand or navigate. 
 The scala-reflection library does the hard work of reflecting on a class at compile-time for you. It then exposes the details of a reflected class as an RType abstraction that is much easier to navigate. 
 Version 2.0.2 greatly improves reflection on Scala 2-compiled classes (eg from an external library).

                              <span>I am downloading Scala with Coursier cs setup and for some reason its taking a very long time to install the standard Scala applications. It&#x27;s been installing for about two hours but its slowly making progress once in a while. Is there anything I can do to speed up this process?

                              <span>I&#x27;m an unemployed .Net engineer with experience in F# and a functional variant of C#. I&#x27;ve been searching for a new job for nearly 8 months, but I have been unemployed for almost 13. This job market has been absolutely brutal for me. My interviewing skills have gotten much stronger, but I haven&#x27;t gotten any new tech screens for months. Just rejection after rejection. Needless to say, I&#x27;m branching out.
 F# is pretty much a no-go at this point. At any given time, it is entirely possible that there is not a single public job posting for an F# position. The positions that do pop up aren&#x27;t often particularly good ones. Even so, I apply and get rejected without a tech screen.
 I&#x27;m currently examining Scala as an option, since many companies use it as a functional language. This would be very similar to my experience using C# as a functional language, and my direct FP experience in F#.
 I&#x27;d like to know what I would have to do to successfully make that transition to Scala. Specifically, what is the minimum that I&#x27;d have to learn about Scala to talk my way in? Or, is there a way I can sell myself such that I don&#x27;t have to do any additional learning before I start a role as a Scala engineer?
 Thus far, I&#x27;ve gotten all rejections without tech screens for Scala positions just like everything else. But it&#x27;s not clear to me that the companies using Scala recognize the connection between Scala and my current F#/C# experience.

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m just a noob learning the wonderful way of life that is Emacs. I went from not knowing what the hell an M-x was to writing my own Elisp functions and minor modes. One thing I can&#x27;t figure out though, is how do I keep Treemacs open until I manually close it, for example when selecting a file that isn&#x27;t already open in a buffer somewhere? I checked all of the treemacs-visit-node-* functions, but they all seem to close Treemacs with a double prefix. Is there any way to change this behavior? I guess I could write my own treemacs-visit-node function, but I don&#x27;t know how to use the treemacs--execute-button-action macro. I&#x27;ll be glad for any help at all.

 If you’re considering or already using the howm package, there’s good news. Version 1.5.1 was recently launched.
 I think it&#x27;s a good time to update the manual too. The manual now includes two chapters on time management and has additional information in other sections. 
 Enjoy the new features and updates!

                              <span>Yesterday night I was searching for a command to highlight a word, and could not find one. The closest I found was M-@ which went to the end of a word from where the cursor was. I had heard you could do so much customization in emacs I thought I would prowl the web and see how to do it. After some searching I found some sample functions, and I bootstrapped them into this,
 ​
 (defun highlight-word () &quot;Highlight the current word you are on.&quot; (interactive) (backward-word 1) (set-mark-command nil) (forward-word 1)) (global-set-key (kbd &quot;C-c C-SPC&quot;) &#x27;highlight-word) 
 At least with this I can be almost anywhere in the word and I can highlight it, and then, for example, select all other occurrence. 
 ​
 After doing this I have a glimpse at what could be keybound. Just thought I would share.

 GNU Emacs 29.1 (build 1, x86_64-pc-linux-gnu, GTK+ Version 2.24.33, cairo version 1.16.0
 Thx.

 I am using the code provided on Elpaca Github verbatim to bootstrap the package manager and initialise evil-mode so I am not not sure why this is happening. I&#x27;ve tried every which way to turn this error message off without success. Advice on how to do this would be appreciated. Thx.

 So I decided to do the same and now introducing the lsp-treemacs-nerd-icons package.

 I’m relatively new to Emacs and elisp particularly, so will be glad for review and some feedback

                              <span>Hey guys,
 I am a relatively new Emacs user (vanilla keybindings), but I am already starting to feel severely crippled when I have to use non-emacs keybindings.
 I do as much as I possibly can in Emacs and I love it, but I sometimes have to reach for a capable web browser.
 I tried out Nyxt, eaf-browser, qutebrowser, vimium browser extension, using Emacs/readline keybindings in GTK2/3 by setting gtk-theme-name &#x3D; &quot;Emacs&quot;.
 Current setup:
  
Firefox: I want to support a mature and well-maintained non-chromium browser. I also use a custom user.js and UBlock Origin to enhance privacy and security. Pages load very fast. Minimal strain on cpu and enhanced battery life.
 Vimium: Far from perfect, as many standard emacs keybindings like M-&gt; for (end-of-buffer), cannot be implemented. Setting ui.accelKey to 18, ui.key.chromeAccess to 0 and devtools.editor.keymap to &quot;emacs&quot; helped.
 GTK2/3: Setting gtk-theme-name &#x3D; &quot;Emacs&quot; really helps and makes editing input fields feel great. Unfortunately this won&#x27;t be supported anymore once firefox migrates from GTK3 to GTK4.
  
Maybe my standards are too high and I should just be happy with what I have.
 But so far I am not willing to give up on it, as my browsing experience is really the last puzzle piece missing to an otherwise perfect workflow.
 Alternative:
 Out of all the alternatives I like Nyxt by far the most.
 It truly supports emacs keybindings and I love the minibuffer. It is a joy to move around.
 If it only was possible to have extensions like UBlock Origin and maybe even swap out WebkitGTK in favor of Firefox&#x27;s Gecko Engine, I&#x27;d make Nyxt my daily driver immediately and never look back. It would be a dream come true.
 I&#x27;d really appreciate if some of you guys with requirements similar to mine (vanilla keys, ad-blocking, security and privacy concerns) could share their workflow.
 Although a student on a very tight budget, I&#x27;ll probably have to start donating regularly to Nyxt to keep my hopes alive.

However, the modeline seems to be somewhat problematic; here it doesn&#x27;t display icons correctly (sometimes it does) but it also just doesn&#x27;t have the same standard look that I&#x27;ve seen elsewhere. Does anyone have experience with this package? As well, does anyone know how I can get the modeline to set to a specific font, and/or change the overall buffer font?

 list &#x3D; [[1, 2, 3, 5], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9, 10]]
  
​
 The code is supposed to add +1 to the list with odd number of elements in it. The problem is that it either applies the function the all sublists or i could use empty square brackets for the otherwise case. But i dont want that. I want it to return the unchanged list if number of elements are even.
 I have tried to use xs for the otherwise case but gives an error. What am i missing here?

 Loading helm-mode...
 Waiting for git... [2 times]
 Loading helm-mode...done
 Does anyone know what might cause this? Thanks for any assistance.

                              <span>Hi! I&#x27;m a complete beginner at Emacs (running on Windows 11) and just learning how to use it, so please excuse my ignorance. I understand some of the possibilities and what it can do, but I&#x27;m struggling with even some basic tutorials and have some questions. I understand some conceptual things, like buffers/windows/frames, kill ring, etc., but I don&#x27;t really know how to start integrating Emacs into my workflow. I come from VS Code and other IDEs like it.
 I began by skimming over this tutorial and these papers (1 and 2); however, when I try and use some of the macros they don&#x27;t seem to work. For instance, if I try and use C-h r, Emacs reports &quot;C-h C-r is undefined&quot;; I don&#x27;t get why this is the case, because I am holding down the CTRL key, then pressing h, then pressing r, then releasing CTRL, but it seems like Emacs is reading 2 separate presses of CTRL?. As well, I started watching this video to get the Emacs UI to look decent, but I&#x27;m not sure how I go about making a init.el file (like where do I save it, how do I access and edit the file, etc.). I know I can use C-x C-f to find a file, but it autofills c:/Program Files/Emacs; is this normal? I thought the init.el is in ~//AppData/Roaming/.emacs.d/init.el/? Do I have to type that in to go to the file?
 Thank you guys so much in advance; as well, are there any other resources that I should look at first as a beginner?

                              <span>I have python installed on the system and a virtual environment /home/user/venv which houses the jupyter installation. The command jupyter notebook runs in the venv terminal. I would like to do ein:run to point to the venv folder for the python and jupyter notebook instance, but I haven&#x27;t been able to find documentation specific to this. I tried ein:run then server command: /home/user/bin/python but an error saying Jupyter server failed to start, cancelling operation appears. 
 I&#x27;ve also tried using ein:run with the followup server command: /home/user/bin/jupyter-notebook, which returns the same error. I have run the command inside the activated virtual environment command line and it opens the API through the browser. 
 I&#x27;m not able to install jupyter notebooks for the user on this machine but I can make python virtual environments.

                              <span>I use tree-sitter and c++-ts-mode. I have set it up to use the K&amp;R indentation style by customizing c-ts-mode-indent-style. The code base I work with uses namespaces a lot, the company has a coding standard where everything within a namespace should not be indented. The K&amp;R style of c++-ts-mode (or c-ts-mode) indents everything within a namespace. I have tried to figure out how to customize c++-ts-mode to not indent within a namespace, without success.
 When I look at treesit-simple-indent-rules I do not find anything that seems to relate to namespaces. To do this, I guess I would use a rule involving parent-is, but I can&#x27;t find a label for a namespace declaration.
 I have failed to find any good examples on how to customize indentation in c-ts-mode/c++-ts-mode. Any suggestions on how to proceed?

                              <span>Emacs is an amazing tool when you&#x27;re the only one using it (org-mode to jot down personal TODOs, manage your monthly budget, etc.). However, I&#x27;ve consistently run into the issue where when another person needs to interact with your work in any way, it&#x27;s a major sticking point. Examples being your beautiful literate programming spec doc needing to be edited by many teams or Google calendar being the source of truth for availability at your job. 
 Have any of you successfully bridged this gap? I want to keep using emacs but find I throw away hours of work the second another human needs to even be tangentially related to the piece.

                              <span>I struggled with the live-coding experience during online interviews, so I&#x27;ve built an extension, Chrome-Emacs, for the Chrome browser, as well as an extended fork of the Emacs package atomic-chrome.
 It focuses on bi-directional editing in online text editors and text areas from within Emacs.
 Why Upgrade:
  
Manifest V3 Support: Ensures future compatibility with Chrome. (Upcoming changes from Google will disable Manifest V2 extensions in Chrome by June 2024.)
 Text, Scroll, &amp; Selection Sync: Provides real-time text, cursor, and selection synchronization between Emacs and the browser.
 Enhanced File Management and Auto Major Mode Detection: Offers improved handling for a smoother experience, supporting features like linting and auto-completion.
 Editable Area Navigation: Quickly switch between editable fields in complex web pages with hints.
  
Compatibility Note: These enhancements are in a fork, requiring an accompanying fork of the atomic-chrome.el package for full benefits. They still work with the original package for basic functionalities, though.
 Collaboration over Competition: I admire the original atomic-chrome.el project and intend this fork as a contribution, not a replacement. My goal is to merge these improvements back into the original to benefit everyone. I also admire the original atomic-chrome extension.
 Difference from Other Extensions:
  
Vs. GhostEditor: While a fantastic tool for bidirectional editing, it lacks real-time cursor and selection sync and is still based on Manifest V2.
 Vs. Edit with Emacs: Applies changes but not in live mode and isn’t bidirectional. It also doesn’t cater to online editors, operating on Manifest V2.
  
I&#x27;m eager to hear feedback, suggestions, and welcome contributions.

                              <span>Hello!
 I&#x27;m learning Emacs and writing my own setup and I&#x27;m using the Elpaca package manager with use-package wrapper (my emacs dotfiles). Please feel free to roast my config and poke holes in it and suggest some improvements :)
 Currently I have 2 folders core/ (for emacs internal stuff) and modules/ (for packages) where core/core-init.el is sourced (required) from my init.el and it in turn sources the rest of core/ and all from modules/. Previously, what I have done for modules is that I&#x27;ve put the (elpaca-wait) command in each module, so that after each module is read elpaca processes the queue immediately and activates the package (at least that&#x27;s what I thought it did from how I understood it before).
 Since then, I&#x27;ve come to learn that elpaca processes the packages queue after reading the init file, so that made me think that it&#x27;s enough to call (elpaca-wait) only once at the end of my init.el after all the modules have been read -- which is what I did, however, now on startup I get warnings about bunch of packages that says:
  
ef-themes loaded before Elpaca activation (analogously for the others) and all of those packages are inactive and some of my settings for the font, theme, orderless, consult etc. aren&#x27;t respected.
  
Before I go ahead and refactor and fix everything, is my understanding correct that it is enough to write all package configs and then call (elpaca-wait) once at the end of my init.el for it to process and load all my package configs? If not, when should I call (elpaca-wait)?
 What is &quot;the best&quot; (a good, optimal) way of making as much use of Elpaca&#x27;s async powers as possible? Am I on the right track here?

                              <span>Hello,
 Every time I try to perform backward-sexp in python (with or without the shortcut) from a parenthetical at the end of a function, it will go to the start of the function, not the enclosing parenthetical.
 How do I stop it from going so far and going to the proper place?
 I am using the lsp python language server plugin but I was having this issue before I configured my emacs for python.
 ​
 Thank you

                              <span>Robe is a Ruby code assistance package.
 This is mostly to tag the changes that have been in the snapshot builds for the last few years, but also to announce that the next release should have more breakage (it should require Ruby 2.3+).
 And compared to the last release tag, this one has:
  
Ruby 3 compatibility.
 Emacs 28 and 29 compatibility fixes.
 Print &quot;keyrest&quot; params correctly in hints. Same for &quot;triple dot&quot; notation.
 company-robe shows icons for completions.
 Jumping to methods in classes which only have private methods.
 Jumping to methods referenced by symbol.
 File names printed (in the doc buffer) relative to the load path.
 Tracking of variable types after assignment (for improved completion). The implementation is still regexp-based.
 Likewise for calls where the target is a literal (string, hash, array).
 Less blinking with eldoc and documentation display.
 Navigation and completion for RSpec bindings (also regexp-based).
 The &quot;jump to constant&quot; call now works with BSD Grep too (Grep search is used as a fallback).
 New option robe-show-doc-source.
 Highlighting comments as comments in the doc buffer.
 More robust constant completion.
 Other tweaks and fixes.

                              <span>My goal is to iterate over a Map that contains several thousand records, and compare each matching key, with a column name from a Dataframe that has a hundreds of columns.
 I have a Dataframe that has a subset of objects:
 val petDF &#x3D; Seq(
 (1, “dog”),
 (2, “cat”),
 (3, &quot;horse&quot;)
 ).toDF(“Rank”, “Animal”,
 ….several hundred columns)
 ​
 And a map or dictionary with key/value pairs that has a superset of objects.
 val lookupMap &#x3D; Map (
 “Rank” -&gt; “Rating”,
 “Animal” -&gt; “Pet”,
 “Human” -&gt; “Person”,
 “Neighbor” -&gt; “Friend”
 …several thousand records…
 )
 ​
 I need to iterate over the Map and for each match with the Dataframe column, I need to reassign the column name in the Dataframe depending whenever there is a match on the key.
 For instance, when there is a match on the Map’s key “Animal” …</span>

                              <span>Hey everyone, I need to traverse a 2D-List (representing a matrix) that will follow diagonals that trace from the top right to the bottom left of the matrix, and go through each element of the diagonal in order when we process that diagonal. I can&#x27;t seem to grasp this traversal, can anyone help with a sample code snippet regarding this? Thanks in advance.

                              <span>In ancient times, computer programs were shared as software listings in magazines. You had to type the code yourself.
Now recently on Mastodon a C64 BASIC listing for a Zettelkasten was shared. Unlike normal code listings, this is a hexdump listing, so you&#x27;d be typing pages of hexadecimal codes.
It&#x27;s much tougher to debug arbitrary hex characters than it is to debug BASIC syntax.
If anyone with a C64 is inclined to do so, please share screenshots

                              <span>Background: Running Emacs on Windows (without WSL). I&#x27;m trying to do org-latex-preview, and I&#x27;m getting failures. This worked fine until about a month ago. In fact, any LaTeX export I do via org mode fails.
 The log shows this:
  ... (c:/texlive/2022/texmf-dist/tex/latex/base/textcomp.sty) ! Emergency stop.  l.30 \begin{document} ^^M No pages of output. system returned with code -1 
 There&#x27;s a message to edit org-preview-latex-process-alist
 Thing is, I&#x27;ve been down this road before. The reason it&#x27;s failing is pygmentize, and the solution on the Internet is to add -shell-escape to the latex/pdflatex commands. I did that at some point last year and LaTeX export worked fine - until recently.
 Digging into the code (org-compile-file), I see this line:
 (shell-command (format-spec command spec) log-buf) 
 The value of (format-spec command spec) is:
 latex -shell-escape -interaction nonstopmode -output-directory &quot;c:/Users/me/AppData/Local/Temp/&quot; &quot;c:/Users/me/AppData/Local/Temp/orgtexTdvuhN.tex&quot; 
 When I run this command verbatim in my console, everything runs fine. When I run it via shell-command, it fails with the error above.
 I&#x27;m at a loss as to why it fails with shell-command. I confirmed that it&#x27;s running the same LaTeX executable, and pygmentize is there in the path system-wide.
 Ideas?

                              <span>Hi all,
 My current theme employs darker colors for the foreground and background. However, when I launch emacs, it takes like a second to invoke my theme config and in that moment, launches with a blinding white background (default). How can I disable this behaviour? Thanks.

                              <span>I have the following function on js-json-mode-hook:
 (lambda () &quot;Use spaces instead of tabs in JSON mode.&quot; (make-local-variable &#x27;js-indent-level) (setq js-indent-level 2) (setq-default indent-tabs-mode nil)) 
 If js-indent-level is set to 2, then 2 spaces are inserted as expected for each indentation in a JSON file. But if js-indent-level is set to 4, a tab is inserted instead of 4 spaces. I&#x27;m at a loss trying to figure this out. Is some other setting overriding js-indent-level? If so, why when it is set to 4 and not when it is set to 2? How can I get 4-space indents in JSON files?
 Edit: It turns out that setting a custom value for tab-width elsewhere in the config somehow had the effect of overriding the value set by indent-tabs-mode by setting it to t.

                              <span>I have been unable to identify the source of this behavior. Heck, I&#x27;m not sure what I do that triggers it to start. It doesn&#x27;t happen after a restart of emacs.
 In a programming mode, (fortran or lisp), I&#x27;ll start spacing at the end of a line to add a trailing comment and I see that a period is placed after the last word on the line.
 I&#x27;ve gone through the list of major and minor modes active and I can&#x27;t see any that would do this. I checked lossage and it shows a self-insert of a period, but I absolutely did not type one.
 I&#x27;m still trying to pin down what I do that makes this start happening. Once it starts, it&#x27;s on everywhere.
 Any advice or does anyone know of this behavior?

But I wonder if I can do this notmuch/mu4e style, maildir files are essentially text files, aren&#x27;t they? And I really like the notmuch/mu4e interface and interaction. Just throwing this idea out here...

                              <span>Hey guys, I have jumped back to Emacs after using regular editors (for quite a while). I&#x27;ve been using avy and the likes to accelerate my navigations. And they are awesome! The one big problem I have with emacs is the scrolling. When it scrolls the whole screen changes, including the point, which loses all points of reference. I have tried using ways like scrolling only half a screen, smooth scrolling, or resorting to using my mouse (which sucks btw). In the end, I&#x27;ve settled down with good-scroll for full-screen scrolls, and repeated C-u C-n/C-u C-ps. And there&#x27;s that.
 Except it isn&#x27;t. Because now the problem becomes horizontal scrolling. For example, the code in the header image. If I were to, say, scroll down while reading the code, I don&#x27;t really have a friendly way to scroll horizontally and back. Like, there&#x27;s always this violent skip which makes me think &quot;oh where was I again?&quot; If I was using regular code editors like Kate, I can scroll horizontally using the mouse, and the scrolling will be smooth so I can conveniently track and read the code. But for hscroll, there&#x27;s only C-e and M-m in emacs (at least to my knowledge). I guess there&#x27;s M-f etc as well, but they move too slowly so it&#x27;s not as efficient.
 So what I am looking for? Well something like C-l that places the point in the center, except this time it&#x27;s horizontally centered as well. The other thing is during these horizontal scrolls and I move the point down, and the next line is not as long as the previous one, it skips back to the left and when the next line length is long enough, it skips back again. If there&#x27;s something that can preserve horizontal point offset during these scrolls it&#x27;ll be awesome. But not something like scroll-left because I have to manually scroll-right to get back.

                              <span>I want to contribute to a package. I haven&#x27;t really used elisp other than setting variables in a configuration and decided that forking a package and contributing was a good way to learn.
 I was surprised to see that the entire package was just one huge file. 2000+ lines of code. Basically unreadable.
 If I wanted to contribute to basically anything else I can assume everything else works fine and add features to whatever class I need. Here I guess I would have to sift through the code searching relevant variables and functions.
 What is the reason for this? It seems like the standard for elisp packages. This doesn&#x27;t even look slightly acceptable for me. It&#x27;s like a group of college kids decided to do a group project in one file like it&#x27;s a Google doc.

I talk about both neovim and emacs with a few people while we&#x27;re having a productive conversation, there&#x27;s always some wise-ass butting in with a snarky comment about how we are wasting time or that we&#x27;re deluded, or that some other unproductive comment. These are primarily all VS Code users (they make it known at every chance they get when they behave this way). I don&#x27;t understand what they feel so threatened about.
 I get that some people are ignorant about some of the tools out there but I&#x27;ve never seen anyone taking such an active interest in not knowing them, but even more interest in shitting on those who actually enjoy these tools.
 I can&#x27;t remember the last time I joined a conversation I don&#x27;t belong to and then be a dick to everyone for no reason. So I&#x27;m curious if this hostility I get from these people just a one-way thing.

                              <span>For a group project, I am building a compiler in Haskell. Today is the deadline and I have an idea of adding a &quot;verbosity&quot; flag to the compiler that prints internal information like &quot;detected unused variable, removing the node&quot; or &quot;Found constant x &#x3D; 4 and replacing used instances of x&quot;, etc. 
 However, our code currently does not support having a string to append throughout the journey of the program. Additionally, using (++) on Strings is poor performance and our professors would not like it. 
 I thought of using Debug.Trace to do this, but the Documentation recommends not to use it in production since it forces a value to be computed instead of being lazy. 
 What can I do?

                              <span>Hi,
 Is there a package that I could use to read an org document in emacs (without exporting) that would do some transformations like: 
 - hide all #+ directives
 - show header with alternative font and/or font-size depending on the node level
 - show code blocs with syntax-highlighting, quote blocs etc without showing extra delimiters (like &quot;SRC&quot;)
 - allows one-key navigation like in info-mode
 A package that is close to this requirements is the org-tree-slide mode but it assumes that nodes are slides (i.e. short) and does not deal with longer paragraphs as nicely as info-mode.
 The objective is to have a as close to paper look as possible and one-key forward navigation.

 And you want to use Org mode for planning-for-the-future purposes -- e.g. to give you advance warning of the actual event as well as any relevant planning info about the prep. work; but also for recording-the-past purposes -- e.g. keeping notes and clocking information about either the prep. work or the event itself. And you want to do it in such a way that each aspect is as closely associated as possible with all the others, to make for easy navigation before and after the event.
 So, specifically, you want to use…</span>

                              <span>Tapir maintainer here. We are planning to stop supporting Scala 2.12 in the near future. There is still a small group of active downloaders, so I would like to take the opportunity and publish an open question: If you depend on Tapir for Scala 2.12, what are your circumstances? Are there any significant blockers that prevent you from migrating to Scala 2.13? Let us know, and our team at SoftwareMill will plan the discontinuation accordingly. Thanks!

                              <span>Hi all,
 I assume this is a rather common question on this subreddit about whether one should adopt evil mode right away when learning emacs or lean into the default keybindings, for someone coming from vim. Unsurprisingly, I belong in the same boat: using (neo)vim for the past 5 years and have setup a window-manager setup with bindings all very akin to vim (heck I even have a firefox addon to emulate vim inside my browser for moving around).
 Now, I don&#x27;t wish to learn emacs the vim-way and would like to learn it with default keybindings (makes it easier to follow docs, works well with other packages, etc.) but I&#x27;m afraid that&#x27;ll make me &quot;unlearn&quot; the bindings I have in place that are more vim like. Heck, I&#x27;m scared I might unlearn vim itself.
 What I want to know is if it&#x27;s possible to use emacs bindings inside emacs and my custom (vim) bindings outside it? Has anyone encountered this and made it work? Thanks in advance!

 Seeing the use of yasnippets blew my mind at times. I&#x27;m really curious about other amazing things that I and many other people may have overlooked.
 Please share some examples of Emacs-wizardry.

                              <span>I want to set a font attribute as follows:
 (set-face-attribute &#x27;outline-1 nil :height 120) 
 Unfortunately, something occasionally resets it to &quot;unspecified&quot; (according to describe-face). I haven&#x27;t been able to pin down what&#x27;s doing that - so I thought maybe I could add a debug watchpoint with debug-watch to trip when it&#x27;s changed - the debug stack might give me a clue.
 Trouble is - debug-watch wants a variable to watch and I can&#x27;t figure out how to point it at a font attribute.
 Anyone have any ideas?

 Also, do you save the original text in any form? I started using EWW and wondering if there are any user flows where you perform some annotations on the eww page, and then save it in your notes - similar to org-noter?

 Following is my configuration. emacs-lisp (setq doom-font (font-spec :family &quot;FiraCodeNerdFont&quot; :size 16)) (after! doom-themes (setq doom-themes-enable-bold t doom-themes-enable-italic t))  What configuration is missed out?

                              <span>Hi everyone, I use the pass package in emacs to manage my passwords. This package has password-store and password-store-otp as dependencies. After recently updating the package, a newer version of password-store-otp is required (0.1.5) and elpaca seems to be pulling in (0.1.0). This error does occur in a fresh emacs install using emacs -q, installing elpaca, and installing pass with elpaca-try. 
 I&#x27;ve tried creating a use-package block for password-store-otp to update password-store-otp by setting a specific git commit. I&#x27;ve tried downloading and loading a local version of password-store-otp as well. Either way pass seems to always pull in the outdated version and use that. 
 Is there a way to make sure dependencies are updated with elpaca? Thanks for any help!

                              <span>Anybody else use notmuch treeview here?
 I have a bunch of saved searches, which I configure like this:
 (push &#x27;(:name &quot;Personal Unscreened&quot; :query &quot;tag:inbox AND tag:unread AND (NOT query:screened-addresses)&quot; :key &quot;u&quot; :search-type &#x27;tree) notmuch-saved-searches) 
 Regardless of whether I set :search-type to &#x27;tree or &quot;tree&quot;, when I select the search (either from notmuch-hello or notmuch-jump) it opens the search in search view (notmuch-search-mode), instead of tree view (notmuch-tree-mode).
 When in search view, I can press &#x27;Z&#x27; to get to the tree-view (notmuch-tree-from-search-current-query), but it&#x27;s another step and creates another buffer, and I&#x27;m trying to get the search to start in tree view directly.
 I&#x27;m new to notmuch, so I&#x27;m probably doing something wrong. Does anybody have any ideas? Or should I join the notmuch mailing list and ask there?

                              <span>Hey, I&#x27;m trying to ignore this warning on HLS but I can&#x27;t figure out how to.
 https://preview.redd.it/fxldguqepcoc1.png?width&#x3D;722&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;b51bf9a98211ba4ec6922530c50509fd16d26bf8
 I&#x27;ve tried the following on my .hlint.yaml:
 -ignore: {name: Anti-pattern}
 -ignore: {name: unsafe functions} &#x27;&#x27;&#x27; but it didn&#x27;t do the trick
 Please help
 Pd.: I&#x27;m practicing some things and have a file with lots of this warnings and is so uncomfortable to work in.

 Trying to with a sample program that depends on a package that&#x27;s not yet on Stackage - it&#x27;s a GitHub repo.
 The docs say that adding the following to the project&#x27;s stack.yaml should work:
 extra-deps: - git: https://github.com/haskell-cryptography/botan.git commit: bdab8fa8d87bc4e282d179119ac3612db132b4ff subdirs: - botan-low - botan-bindings - botan 
 However, when I try to build the sample program using &#x60;stack build&#x60;, I&#x27;m getting &quot;Could not find module . . .&quot; for all the references to the Botan package I&#x27;m trying to refer to.

I would like to receive TODO items with a date as a stdout which I can print or alert on my window through status bar (waybar), dmenu, or tiling window manager via &quot;urgent&quot;/bell notifications (probably simplest solution).

                              <span>Hello!
Yesterday, I experienced a situation that I&#x27;m surprised I didn&#x27;t notice before.
When we use object tags, we seek to identify the objects interacting in a note&#x27;s main argument. However, there are times when those objects may refer to qualities one may or may not have.
For example, let&#x27;s imagine I have two different notes where I explain the following ideas:
(1) Being too strict causes problems
In note (1), we could identify the object tag #strict. While in note (2), we could identify #relaxed as an object tag. However, the important point is that this decision is arbitrary. I could perfectly well have written the notes as follows:
(1a) Being too strict causes problems
or
(1b) Being not enough relaxed causes problems
In notes (1a) and (2a), I would have identified #strict. In notes (1b) and (2b), I would have identified #relaxed. However, all notes talk about the same object idea: there is a right amount of strictness/relaxation that avoids problems.
So, my question is the following:
How would you handle this situation?
Do I accept this arbitrariness and continue using both object tags?
Or, do I try to find a way to avoid this arbitrariness?

The example I showed is a simplification of a text I am processing about Semantic Versioning: https://semver.org/
The paragraph that provoked this situation was the following:

  
If the dependency specifications are too tight, you are in danger of version lock (the inability to upgrade a package without having to release new versions of every dependent package). If dependencies are specified too loosely, you will inevitably be bitten by version promiscuity (assuming compatibility with more future versions than is reasonable)


Using too tight or too loosely dependency specifications casues problems :-)</span>

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;m about to give a demo on how to maintain an engineering diary and a knowledge base. Of course, this will be an Org-mode demo. There won&#x27;t be any public recording but I might publish the Org-mode source in a proper format on Github later-on. 
 For showing off, I&#x27;d like to add three babel blocks to demo the pseudo-literate programming part within a minute or so. I&#x27;m not that creative, so I&#x27;d love to see your ideas on that. Bonus: if the content is relevant to engineers/devops/admins.
 My idea for this part: each block is using a different language (shell, python, ?). Each block generates some kind of data which is human-readable (e.g., as a nice table or at least some data the viewers are able to understand quickly). The next block takes the result from the previous and adds some pro…</span>

 Is there a possibility to disable this warning only for files from type &#x27;zip&#x27;? I have looked in the variables, but I have no idea how the variable may have been named. Warning-smth... I guess...
 thanks for your help!

I have no idea what causes this. It does not matter where the file I am working on is located, it is the current working directory when generating the previews. that matters.
 I have org-preview-latex-image-directory set to a single folder in my .emacs.d, but when I am not working in one of the offending directories, the error message I get seems to be that dvipng is looking for dvi files in /tmp/, where they are not found.

                              <span>Emacs 29.2 on Void Linux no packages installed new to emacs and just trying to use vanilla.
 I installed rust the suggested way using the curl command on their site and went to try eglot and it couldn&#x27;t find the rust-analyzer binary I check in my terminal and it seems rust doesn&#x27;t include it.
 I did some searching and found some Github issues suggesting downloading the binary and adding it to my PATH so I did.
 Now eglot finds it and suggests it can use it when I do M-x elgot, I confirm but it dies instantly.
 There&#x27;s no error information in the error message it just says &#x60; [eglot] -1: Server died&#x60;
 Any help would be appreciated, Thanks!
 Edit: I found another post suggesting I install rust mode I used package-install and tested it that way and eglot still crashes. It works fine for other languages C,C++, Python. The issue is isolated to rust-analyzer.
 Edit 2: Rust analyzer works find in VSCode, Neovim, and in my terminal I&#x27;m able to call the binary without it crashing.

 Any good places to get started? I want to be as compatible and competitive with vscode as I can.

 I&#x27;ve run into a frustrating problem when trying to use dir-locals-set-class-variables to set key bindings specifically for a npm projects when changing projects. It works for all files and directories apart from the project-root one!
 Is there any way to have this key binding / minor mode apply to the project root as well as all the subdirs and files?

((mode . npm-project))))) (defun setup-npm-project+ (project-root) &quot;Setup npm projects with &#x60;project-root&#x27;.&quot; (when (file-exists-p (concat project-root &quot;package.json&quot;)) (message &quot;setting up npm project mode&quot;) (dir-locals-set-directory-class project-root &#x27;npm))) (advice-add &#x27;project-switch-project :after #&#x27;setup-npm-project+))

                              <span>Hi all,
 I have been a neovim user for two years (I write my own configs using lua). I am considering switching to emacs after going through a major youtube rabbit hole on how emacs is a production environment, the beauty of org mode, evil mode key bindings, and it is still useable in the terminal when I ssh into a remote computer (do not have to install most of the time like neovim, especially when I do not have sudo permissions).
 One of the things that really made me consider switching to emacs is that for neovim, some of my plugins will break due to updates or be no longer maintained. Additionally I have no idea where the direction of neovim is going. I want something that I can customize, but also relatively stable and low maintenance. Does emacs offer this advantage? 
 Thanks!

 Hyperbole is a single package that can significantly raise your Emacs productivity with its broad information authoring and management capabilities, including giving you easier access to existing Emacs features that are hard to find or set up correctly. Give it a try for one month and see what you think.
 After an extensive year-and-a-half of development and quality-assurance, GNU Hyperbole 9.0.1, the Rhapsody release, is now available on GNU ELPA. And oh what a release it is: extensive new features, new video demos, org and org roam integration, Markdown and Org file support in HyRolo, recursive directory and wildcard file scanning in HyRolo, and much more.
 Hyperbole is like Markdown for hypertext. Hyperbole automatically recognizes dozens of common patterns in any buffer regar…</span>

 Will have a bind mount to my local project repository (will be /app in the container) for quick debugging and deploying.

 BACKGROUND:
 &quot;Functional Software Architecture&quot; refers to methods of construction and structure of large and long-lived software projects that are implemented in functional languages and released to real users, typically in industry. The goals for the workshop are:
  
To assemble a community interested in software architecture techniques and technologies specific to functional programming;
 To identify, categorize, and docu…</span>

                              <span>I searched this everywhere but couldn&#x27;t find an answer. Consider the two definitions for generating the nth fibonacci number
 fibMem &#x3D; 0:1:zipWith (+) fibMem (tail fibMem) fibTail n &#x3D; helper n 0 1 where helper 1 _ acc &#x3D; acc helper n prev !acc &#x3D; helper (n-1) acc (prev+acc) 
 Time complexity for both will be linear in n. But what will be the space complexity?
 I feel like the memoized definition should be linear in space and the tail definition (with the bang pattern) should be constant in space. I tried profiling with RTS and the only thing changing was &quot;bytes allocated on heap&quot; with the tail definition having slightly less allocation, but still increasing with increasing n. Also, not sure whether &quot;bytes allocated on heap&quot; is what I should be looking for anyway.
 If the memoized definition is indeed linear in space, then its not so cool afterall? and maybe it should be mentioned in every discussion that tail definition is what you should be using?

                              <span>Hey everyone!
 We&#x27;re looking for new colleagues for our Haskell teams at Channable (Utrecht, Netherlands). There are not a lot of SaaS companies that have Haskell in their tech stack, so I&#x27;m happy to share this with you all! 
 You can take a look at the job description here
 And if you&#x27;re interested in knowing how Channable uses Haskell you can take a look at the Tech blog where my colleagues write about their work. 
 For this role, you&#x27;d need to work in with a hybrid work policy. If you don&#x27;t live in the NL you can still apply and we can have a chat! Channable can help with relocation and the Netherlands is a beautiful country (especially if you like rain).

                              <span>I installed Haskell using the ghcup method and I&#x27;m on Debian 12. I&#x27;ve created a directory .../HaskellAlgebra and I&#x27;ve run cabal init in my terminal in that directory, then cabal run. The Hello... message is displayed. Good. Then I went into the HaskellAlgebra.cabal and added many packages to the executable HaskellAlgebra build-depends:
 build-depends: base ^&gt;&#x3D;4.17.2.1, text &gt;&#x3D;2.1.1, algebra &gt;&#x3D;4.3.1, hmatrix &gt;&#x3D;0.20.2, algebraic-graphs &gt;&#x3D;0.7, diagrams &gt;&#x3D;1.4.1, QuickCheck &gt;&#x3D;2.14.3, HaskellAlgebra 
 I then do cabal run again -- and after a long time I again get success and output. Then I open a ghci session with cabal repl in the terminal. At the prompt I try to load or access one of the packages or modules, with success.
 λ&gt; :set -package hmatrix package flags have changed, resetting and loading new packages.. 
 I try
 λ&gt; import Numeric.LinearAlgebra λ&gt; m &#x3D; (3&gt; m (3&gt; :set -package hmatrix cannot satisfy -package hmatrix (use -v for more information) λ&gt; :set -package Data.List cannot satisfy -package Data.List (use -v for more information) 
 Any ideas what could be wrong? Any Emacs haskell-moders out there? I basically just want to run stuff in a .hs file and have it run in a REPL for now.

                              <span>My research leads me to a nice model with like-minded groups of people working with Zettelkasten method. It&#x27;s a visual concept that helps me to find further insights to understand Zettelkasten interactions. My initial view is showing groups with different learning approaches and different knowledge intensity.
The largest group according to my survey are the &quot;Self-Learners and Autodidacts (29%)&quot; with some milieu-specific characteristics:
Personalized learning journeys driven by individual interests and goals.
Flexibility to explore diverse topics and resources at their own pace.
Utilization of Zettelkasten as a tool for self-reflection, goal tracking, and continuous improvement.
Even though we all use the Zettelkasten method, each group still has different needs and preferences. This helps me better understand some of our discussions here in the forum.

This is yet another opportunity to share with your friends what you are working on. Add to this discussion by telling us about your zettelkasten journey. Share with us what you&#x27;re learning. Sharing helps me and, hopefully, you, too. It helps us clarify our goals and visualize our thinking. And sometimes, a conversation sparks a magical moment where we can dive into an idea worth exploring. We&#x27;d love to hear more from you.  🫵🏼
It&#x27;s spring break! It&#x27;s time to catch up on zettelkasting projects.
Ideas I&#x27;m exploring with my ZK:
To make a note is to isolate an object of attention and investigate it with vigor.
The ideas around developing an ambiance for thriving.
The novel idea of ambient love.
The meaning of &quot;cogent&quot; as related to ideation.
The constellation of ideas around the portrayal of blindness in Young Adult Literature.
Things I&#x27;m reading:

I know there&#x27;s Aspell and abbrev, but I&#x27;m curious if there&#x27;s actually a native typo-fixer that works like everything else in MacOS without having to manually run aspell?

 In their template they specify a bunch of environments, e.g. abstract that need to be inserted in the document, but before \maketitle. When exporting Org mode to LaTeX, \maketitle is inserted straight after \begin{document}.

 Any means to achieve this?

 I have a template that when expanded creates the error:
  org-id-add-location: ‘org-id-get’ expects a file-visiting buffer 
 I have narrowed the error to a trailing space. This template works:
  (org-capture-fill-template &quot;* PROJ&quot; ) 
 but this one does not, the only difference is the trailing space after PROJ.
  (org-capture-fill-template &quot;* PROJ &quot; ) 
 fails with:
  org-id-add-location: ‘org-id-get’ expects a file-visiting buffer 
 Is this a bug in org or a feature that I have hit by mistake?
 thank you

 Here is link to the full playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list&#x3D;PLiYD0LWExCDkXGpYRY3WjNscDfhe4D0ND
 Thousands of developers have taken this course on fp-tower.com and Udemy and gained a robust understanding of functional programming (no specific library). The course is really hands-on with lots of exercises on topics like:
  
Parallel data processing (Chapter 3 https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list&#x3D;PLiYD0LWExCDlAls-ucYLGydz\_uP07R1Mn)
 Concurrent IO (Chapter 5 https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list&#x3D;PLiYD0LWExCDnkATO7yP350HEsXBUGftSO)
 Error handling &amp; data modeling (Chapter 6 https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list&#x3D;PLiYD0LWExCDmSukQM59oNkzlaQoCJ-30A)
  
The course consists of around 20 hours of videos and 30-40 hours of exercises. It is made for beginner to intermediate Scala developers. Some companies have used this course to train their new hire.
 All exercises, answers and slides are on GitHub: https://github.com/fp-tower/foundations
 It took me around 2.5 years to produced this course including 9 months full time. I gave my best to provide simple and practical examples of FP principles. Please let me know what you found useful (or not).

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently exploring the world of functional programming and seeking to deepen my understanding of how algebraic data types (ADTs) and type classes are utilized to construct contexts and specify behaviors. Specifically, I&#x27;m interested in how ADTs are employed to create context data types like Option, Either, and Future, and how type classes such as Functor, Monad, and Applicative define behaviors for these contexts.
 Here&#x27;s a bit more context on what I&#x27;ve been pondering:
 Algebraic Data Types (ADTs):
 ADTs allow us to construct complex data types by combining simpler ones. For instance, Option represents values that may or may not exist, utilizing ADTs like Some and None. Similarly, Either embodies values that can be of one of two possible types, using Left for errors and Right for succ…</span>

                              <span>endless-transaction is a new Scala library with functional abstractions to orchestrate distributed transactions using two-phase consensus. This is not “old-school” 2PC: it allows for both short and long-lived transactions (aka sagas).
 Operations spanning multiple entities in actor clusters often require coordination to ensure consistency: the lib integrates well with the parent library endless4s offering functional abstractions for distributed systems (but can also be used separately).
 In this blog article, I explain the motivations, use cases, and abstractions, illustrated with an example.

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to put emacs into docker containers for testing on a kubernetes system. 
 The kubernetes deployment does not have access to the internet. I like the emacs keybindings but need certain syntax coloring default emacs lacks. 
 So I want to do this in the docker build steps. 
 I&#x27;ve started a container ran alt x packagage refresh, package install then commited the image and used it that way but that is really slow and not automated.
 Is there anyway to automate emacs commands without opening emacs? Do you understand that question?
 In otherwords, install a melpa package in emacs in the build steps of a dockerfile. So automatically and without human interaction.

                              <span>First: I&#x27;ve searched for solutions and experimented but without success. Hopefully you have some ideas!
 The tl;dr is that I&#x27;m keen to find a way to edit files on remote Windows hosts using ssh as the protocol from a Linux host.
 I&#x27;m a Linux user through-and-through but have to manage Windows boxen sometimes. Modern Windows can run sshd, though, and combined with powershell, managing remote Windows hosts is actually bearable. However, I&#x27;d prefer to edit files within my local emacs session rather than through a terminal running ssh. The challenge is finding the right C-x C-f path spec to connect to a remote ssh host that works when that target is running Windows (with all those caveats).
 Some considerations:
  
I know that I can connect to Windows hosts remotely via ssh correctly and passwordless. I can edit the login shell, I&#x27;ve tinkered with both cmd.exe and pwsh.exe without much success.
 I do have the ability to target sh.exe or bash.exe, although I haven&#x27;t managed to make that work either (by changing TRAMP connection properties for the remote host)
 I assume there may be something I need to set to make the connection &quot;aware&quot; that the remote is Windows despite connecting over ssh, though I&#x27;m not sure what that setting might be (for example, changing a line ending setting)
  
I&#x27;d love any ideas or help with this.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been using a package called org-brain that is using, I&#x27;m all but certain, the .org-id-locations file as its database to store graph-like relationships between org files and org headings. org-brain is a sort of graph database which adds a PROPERTIES drawer with just the ID field with a UUID to an org file, as well as to the org headings in each file. So I opened this 127k file residing in my .emacs.d directory and apparently whatever is in my org directory and has a PROPERTIES drawer with ID field winds up in .org-id-locations represented as lists in one big list, one list for each file that has one or more drawers. But you knowledgeable people here know all this already. However, it surprised me since such a format as this

                              <span>I was reading the Hacker Files and I spotted this. 
 From Issue 1 of the Hacker Files
 The Hacker Files was about a hacker called Jack Marshall who freelances for the Government and uncovers all sorts of underhandedness. This was created by Lewis Shiner and Tom Sutton, and it seems to have been created for an informed audience. I mean, in most popular entertainment, hacking involves hoodies, fantastical visualisations to make someone typing in the terminal more interesting and so on. This comic has none of that, and yet is quite gripping.

                              <span>Has anyone been able to configure Copilot-like services, in my case Codeium , in their completion framework so there is less friction when using them?
 IMHO in a super-capf setup it can outshout other capfs because it returns longer results which take up posframe space. Similarly, i don&#x27;t want to have to change buffers to choose a suggestion, so the older completion styles seem clumsy.
 After some fiddling, my best guess is that it needs a separate completion mode which shows suggestions in an overlay within the current buffer. So in place, one at a time with some ability to move up and down through the undisplayed completions via M-n / M-p and with some kind of hint in the presentation about current position in the list.
 How have other folks been setting these things up?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been using Helm since the time I started using Emacs. A couple of weeks ago, Helm started giving me an error, and I searched for alternates and finally installed Vertico, Orderless, Consult and Embark.
 Now Helm is working again, but I&#x27;d like to leave my present config as is.
 What I need help with is:
  
In Helm when I M-x, I am shown the candidate from the last time I used M-x. In vertico, I have to search again, if I want the same candidate. Does anyone know how I can bring this Helm style behavior into Vertico? 
 
I&#x27;m not sure if this is an orderless or vertico function. When I M-x and type in the command i&#x27;m looking for, in Helm, I don&#x27;t need to enter the Hyphen. In this current setup, I need to enter a hyphen as a seperator, otherwise no matches are show. So for list-packages I need to type li-pa. li pa on its own won&#x27;t work. 
 
There is a horizontal bar running at the bottom of the screen, which I think shows the same candidates as in the completion list. Where is this coming from? Embark? WHat is it&#x27;s purpose?
 
 Attached image to indicate each of the points.
 Thank you!

                              <span>Hi,
 Emacs newbie here. I have an issue regarding flycheck as in a gif below.
 When removing something in a buffer sometimes the error doesn&#x27;t propagate to another buffer, buffer when method is removed. The error is shown in rust, however the error as well occurs in some other languages. It doesn&#x27;t matter if I&#x27;m taking someone&#x27;s config or my own, the error will occur.
 Example scenario (occurs in config from a link pasted below):
  
Go to buffer 1.
 Remove method.
 Error occurs on buffer 2.
 paste back method on buffer 1.
 Error still occurs on buffer 2 after switching to buffer 2, despite implementation being already pasted back in buffer 1 (which is incorrect behaviour).
  
Another scenario shown on gif:
  
Go to buffer 1.
 Remove method.
 Save buffer.
 Go to buffer 2

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking at integrating code coverage reporting for the work project. I&#x27;ve successfully generated a .tix file and the reports locally. Due to the time that a coverage build/test takes, we won&#x27;t be running it on each PR/commit, but once daily on the master branch.
 I am currently investigating code coverage services, like codecov.io and coveralls.
 One complication with Haskell coverage is that we get three things: &quot;top level definitions&quot;, &quot;expressions&quot;, and &quot;alternatives&quot;. Top level definitions includes things like derived instances and record fields, which significantly harms coverage figures. We&#x27;d like to primarily track expression and/or alternative coverage instead of top-level definitions.
 I&#x27;m curious if y&#x27;all have recommendations on how to do this nicely.

 i would love feedback, regarding scribes would it be preferrable for me to export the escape hatch i’ve used to remove the IOE constraints or to include scribes from other katip packages? the problem with the second approach is that i do not want to maintain multiple packages, so i would either increase the number of dependencies or include the scribes in sublibraries.

                              <span>Hi,
 My dahastes.cabal:
 ...
 executable dahastes
 import: common-options
 hs-source-dirs: app
 main-is: Main.hs
 build-depends:
 , dahastes
 , turtle
 , text
 , foldl
 , extra
 ghc-options: -threaded -rtsopts -with-rtsopts&#x3D;-N
 ...
 I&#x27;ve been trying this:
 !?master ~/spaces/haskell/dahastes&gt; cabal install exe:dahastes --installdir&#x3D;&quot;~/.local/bin&quot;
 Wrote tarball sdist to
 /home/alexey/spaces/haskell/dahastes/dist-newstyle/sdist/dahastes-0.tar.gz
 Resolving dependencies...
 Symlinking &#x27;dahastes&#x27; to &#x27;~/.local/bin/dahastes&#x27;
 !?master ~/spaces/haskell/dahastes&gt; ls
 &#x27;~&#x27; app bench BUILDME.md cabal.project CHANGELOG.md dahastes.cabal dist-newstyle flake.lock flake.nix hie.yaml LICENSE README.md src test
 ​
 Looks sensible, but I&#x27;ve got two problems:
  
No symlink in ~/.local/bin. No real surprise: I expected a binary in ~/.local/bin, and was promised a symlink _to_ ~/.local/bin, God knows where.
 It created an empty &#x27;~&#x27; directory in my project directory, which looks suspicious to me.
  
​
 I hope my intention is clear: install a project executive to a common bin directory. What am I doing wrong?

                              <span>Hi all!
 Three years ago I wrote a tiny library, https://hackage.haskell.org/package/safe-wild-cards-1.0.0/docs/SafeWildCards.html, to work around the lack of a GHC warning when you do smth like this:
 instance ToJSON Rec where toJSON Rec{..} &#x3D; object [ &quot;a&quot; .&#x3D; fieldA , &quot;b&quot; .&#x3D; fieldB -- oops I forgot to handle fieldC ] 
 To me, a very nice thing about Haskell is that the compiler tells me when I have to update my code, so I felt that the lack of warning was a serious omission and worth writing a library for.
 The library provides a Template Haskell pattern, fields, that lets you do the following instead:
 instance ToJSON Rec where toJSON $(fields &#x27;Rec) &#x3D; ... -- equivalent to: -- toJSON Rec{fieldA, fieldB, fieldC} &#x3D; ... 
 All fields will be added to scope and you will get a warning if you don&#x27;t explicitly ignore the unused ones.
 I&#x27;m not doing open source Haskell anymore, so I&#x27;d like to give this library away. In three years it saw only one PR (dependency version bump). If you want it, please DM me on Reddit, email me, or open an issue at https://github.com/monadfix/safe-wild-cards.
 Thanks!

                              <span>i want to display the current git revision that my program was built with in an info menu. to do that i have a template haskell function that looks like this
  git &#x3D; $(readProcess &quot;git&quot; [&quot;rev-parse&quot;, &quot;--short&quot;] &quot;&quot;) 
 this is simplified for the purpose of this post
 the problem is, it runs this command every time the program runs, rather than once at compile time, so it always tries to read the revision of whatever your cwd is. is there a way to make this only run at compile time and never again?

 Release notes:
  
With one exception, this release fixes bugs.
  
Changes since v2.15.1:
 Behavior changes:
  
stack path --global-config, --programs, and --local-bin no longer set up Stack’s environment.
  
Bug fixes:
  
Due to a bug, Stack 2.15.1 did not support versions of GHC before 8.2. Stack now supports GHC versions from 8.0.
 --haddock-for-hackage does not ignore --haddock-arguments.
 On Windows, package locations that are Git repositories with submodules now work as intended.
 The ghc, runghc and runhaskell commands accept --package values that are a list of package names or package identifiers separated by spaces and, in the case of package identifiers, in the same way as if they were specified as targets to stack build.
  
Thanks to all our contributors for this release:

 Following the handover of the Stackage project to the Haskell Foundation the file at Stack’s default URL is no longer up to date.
 stack init uses this file to decide which snapshots to try when creating a stack.yaml file. stack new uses stack init by default.

                              <span>Hi,
 What is the Haskell way to manage this kind of nested workflow? Here is an example in JS:
 /**
 * Reduces a sequence of names to initials.
 * u/function makeInitials
 * u/param {String} authors A comma-delimited list of authors.
 * u/param {String} sep A period separating the initials.
 * u/param {String} trail A period ending the initials.
 * u/param {String} hyph A hyphen separating double-barrelled names.
 * u/return {String} Properly formatted initials.
 */
 function makeInitials(authors, sep &#x3D; &quot;.&quot;, trail &#x3D; &quot;.&quot;, hyph &#x3D; &quot;-&quot;) {
 const rDot &#x3D; new RegExp(&#x60;[\\s${sep}]+&#x60;);
 return authors
 .replace(/\&quot;(?:\\.|[^\&quot;\\])*\&quot;/g, &quot; &quot;)
 .replaceAll(&#x27;&quot;&#x27;, &quot; &quot;)
 .split(&quot;,&quot;)
 .filter((author) &#x3D;&gt; author.replaceAll(sep, &quot;&quot;).replaceAll(hyph, &quot;&quot;).trim())
 .map(
 (author) &#x3D;&gt;
 author
 .split(hyph)
 .filter((barrel) &#x3D;&gt; barrel.replaceAll(sep, &quot;&quot;).trim())
 .map((barrel) &#x3D;&gt;
 barrel
 .split(rDot)
 .filter((name) &#x3D;&gt; name)
 .map((name) &#x3D;&gt; name[0])
 .join(sep)
 .toUpperCase(),
 )
 .join(hyph) + trail,
 )
 .join(&quot;,&quot;);
 }
 This kind of stuff looks pretty much the same in Dart, Kotlin, PHP, Rust, etc. Somehow I can&#x27;t figure out how to structure it in Haskell. There must be a way to keep uniformity and readability in Haskell; autoformat should like it, too.
 PS I still can&#x27;t figure out how to make code snippets readable. If it&#x27;s Markdown, why the &#x60;backticks&#x60; won&#x27;t work?

                              <span>Hello I am new to Emacs and I was wondering if its possible to change the code blocking syntax in Emacs. Currently Emacs uses the following syntax to contain code...
 #+begin_src cpp
 #+end_src 
 Instead I wanted use the following...
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;cpp
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; 
 How do I go about in making this happen?

                              <span>Posting this for any of y&#x27;all interested. I had to compile emacs 29.2 the libxml2 support because the eww-url-transform url wasn&#x27;t available on the emacs 28.
 You can create a function that takes a URL as input and returns a &quot;transformed&quot; version of the URL. The eww-url-transformers variable will be a list of all the &quot;transform&quot; functions you create. When you click on a link, eww will automatically run the URL through all the functions in that list before bringing you to the webpage.
 Adding this to your init.el will automatically redirect www.reddit.com to old.reddit.com
 (defun eww-reddit-redirect(url) &quot;Redirect reddit.com to old.reddit.com automatically.&quot; (replace-regexp-in-string &quot;https://www.reddit.com&quot; &quot;https://old.reddit.com&quot; url)) (setq eww-url-transformers &#x27;(eww-remove-tracking eww-reddit-redirect)) 
 Note, the eww-remove-tracking is a function built into eww.el to remove some tracking information from URLS.

                              <span>I am trying to make e-mail scheduling possible in Emacs based on gnus-delay but for notmuch.
 A lot of stuff in notmuch calls pop-to-buffer-same-window and similar functions which is making things complicated. Like when calling notmuch-draft-resume (which I call to bring up the postponed message, check headers and send).
 I would also like to run the queue processing in the background on a schedule, which will disrupt my work if I am doing something and all of a sudden windows start to move around.
 So I think I have two options when processing the queue:
  
Save the current window configuration, process the queue and restore it.
 Create a new frame, make-frame-invisible it, and delete the frame when done.
  
On the second option, something does not work after calling make-frame-invisible, as if pop-to-buffer-same-window would not work on an invisible frame. Is that possible?
 On the first option, as I would like to have the queue processing run on a schedule, I guess I&#x27;d need some way to &quot;run this function every X minutes ONLY ONLY ONLY if the session is inactive&quot; to not disrupt my work. Is there such a function/package available to detect if the session is inactive?

                              <span>Hi,
 Before someone runs in and suggests project.el or projectile, hear me out please. 
 My work consists of both programming and a lot of designing. I manage my repositories nicely with projectile, but my design resources are a complete mess. 
 I have directories with org-mode files, diagrams made both inside of emacs (with plantuml) and outside of emacs. I also have presentations and other miscellaneous files. 
 I am looking for a smart way to access and organize all these directories and files in a way that resembles org-roam. Would such a thing exist? 
 My current alternative approach that I haven’t tested yet involves swapping altering the org-roam database using .dir-locals.el together with projectile, but I haven’t tried this.

 LSP errors look unreadable as they&#x27;re single line... Anyone knows how to configure these errors to look more readable? Or to see one error at a time? Or open details of an error?

                              <span>Is it possible to have the org-habit graph display a day where a task was missed with a solid colour block rather than a glyph? For example having a red block on a day where a habit was missed followed by a green block where it was done? It seems that all the various org-habit faces are used to identify when habits are due vs overdue and such but there are none that actually denote what is a completed task vs failed one. Is a glyph the only way to identify this or is there any alternative?

                              <span>If you see my post history, I have been trying to move to Emacs full time for both, work and personal. I used my own config, then moved to Spacemacs, tried Doom and finally settled in Spacemacs.
 For personal stuff, I have a few annoyances but nothing major but, for work, there are a few things that hurt my productivity - I need to get things done and don&#x27;t have much time to fix, so I am using VSCode instead.
 Some of the things that are blocking me: - multi-vterm refuses to work. It just says that it cannot find vterm-mode. vterm works, so the mode is there but nope - vterm keeps on scrolling down to the prompt, making going through logs or things like that impossible - LSP seems to be unable to find my .venv and use the pyright inside, even when I start it from the shell
 It is possible that I am &#x27;holding it the wrong way&#x27; but I am not ready to change my full workflow for this.
 This is not a complain, just a post so people see what it is if you are not an expert - Google shows no solutions to these issues, no matter what I do and I don&#x27;t have the time to fix them. I understand that Emacs is more of a &#x27;here are the parts, put them together in any way you want&#x27; but that same approach, while mitigated by distributions like Spacemacs, make it way harder for people who need to get things done now, if you happen to hit any issues.

                              <span>Is there some kind of option/package, which can create C block comments in a way that it only puts a comment marker at the beginning and at the end of region?
 I mean, if I comment this with comment-region:
 Something here and there 
 I get this:
 /* Something here */ /* and there */ 
 But I&#x27;d like to have this:
 /* Something here and there */ 
 comment-region is inconsistent with the behavior if I write the comment by hand. I mean, if I start creating the comment by /* Some ..., emacs creates the second version. But if I uncomment it with uncomment-region, and then add the comment back with comment-region, I get the first version.

                              <span>I picked up obsidian recently after taking over a job from another guy. I love its TODO features and the beautiful markdown format it has which is really easy to use, but that is all I really use it for. I am normally a minimalist, I used to take notes and todo lists only in notepad (its very manageable with ok formatting), as well as physical notes in a few notebooks I regularly replace. My work is in Mechanical Engineering so its normally just about task management in the background while I have my CAE software &amp; outlook in front. Work PC is windows and obviously I cannot change that. 
 I discovered Emacs a few weeks ago, and its been rough trying to learn its systems since I have limited free time. I am really interested in org-mode, and the possibility of not only task management, but interlocking its systems with email, IRC (and therefore slack/discord), maybe learning VIM keybinds, etc but I really have no interest in using it as a coding interface, or in writing academic papers.
 Is emacs right for my use case?

                              <span>Eglot has this feature where the variable at point and its references in the code below get highlighted in bold.
 Does anyone know a feature or package that adds the same or similar highlighting to emacs lisp?
 And I mean not just highlight by name, but by binding, so if I (re-)bind the same name many times in multiple nested let expressions or let*, it should correctly highlight only the references of the same binding.
 Side-note:
 I really feel like emacs lisp is falling behind a bit with all the cool treesitter and LSP features other languages have now. I understand that treesitter support would be hard due to elisp&#x27;s syntactic ambiguity between macros and functions and highlighting and indentation would probably be worse than emacs itself which can respect the indentation guides and highlighting provided by the functions/macros themselves. 
 But a language server would really help a lot, for example to get xref-find-references working with functions not currently defined in the running emacs instance, for example when writing stand-alone scripts.

                          <div class="article-summary-box-inner media-object">

                              <span>Hello everyone, how do you handle the situation where you want certain keybindings to be conditionally bound. Here is what I have as an example:
 My config
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; ... (defvar-keymap my/code-keymap &quot;d&quot; #&#x27;xref-find-definitions ) 
 (defvar-keymap my/lsp-code-keymap &quot;d&quot; #&#x27;lsp-find-definition &quot;i&quot; #&#x27;lsp-find-implementation ) 
 (defvar-keymap my/leader-keymap &quot;.&quot; #&#x27;find-file &quot;/&quot; #&#x27;consult-ripgrep &quot;g&quot; #&#x27;magit &quot;:&quot; #&#x27;consult-mode-command &quot;Q&quot; #&#x27;ave-buffers-kill-terminal
 &quot;f&quot; my/file-keymap &quot;p&quot; my/project-keymap &quot;w&quot; my/window-keymap &quot;b&quot; my/buffer-keymap &quot;r&quot; my/rings-and-regs-keymap &quot;e&quot; my/edit-keymap &quot;!&quot; my/error-keymap &quot;i&quot; my/insert-keymap &quot;t&quot; my/toggle-keymap &quot;c&quot; my/code-keymap ) 
 (unbind-key &quot;SPC&quot; evil-motion-state-map) (bind-key &quot;SPC&quot; my/leader-keymap evil-motion-state-map)
 (add-hook &#x27;lsp-mode-hook (lambda () (make-local-variable &#x27;my/leader-keymap) (bind-key &quot;c&quot; my/lsp-code-keymap my/leader-keymap)) )
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Here I replace my-code-keymap with my-lsp-code-keymap if I am in an lsp-mode buffer. This nearly works, but making the keymap buffer-local doesn&#x27;t seem to work. Thus once lsp-mode is turned on in any buffer, all buffers have their code keymap replaced. 
 What I don&#x27;t want to do:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; (defvar-keymap my/not-wanted-lsp-code-keymap &quot;d&quot; (lambda () (if lsp-mode (call-interactively #&#x27;lsp-find-definition) (call-interactively #&#x27;lsp-find-definition)))
 &quot;i&quot; (lambda () (if lsp-mode (call-interactively #&#x27;lsp-find-definition) (message &quot;lsp is not available&quot;))) ) 
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 I want to avoid binding keys to some function that checks if lsp is bound and runs the appropriate command. This is because I don&#x27;t want which-key showing the &quot;SPC c i&quot; option in non lsp buffers since it doesn&#x27;t do anything because lsp is not available.
 Can keybindings even be buffer-local?
 I would appreciate examples of how this is handled in your config.

                              <span>I&#x27;m importing my calendar events into org so they are integrated into my weekly agenda etc. The thought occurred to me today - can I see a weekly time spent in meetings vs average. I don&#x27;t specifically tag them but could definitely add that to my workflow to make that easier.

                              <span>Have you ever heard of Worked Examples from Cognitive Load Theory?
If not, this simple, teacher/student oriented video explains worked examples quite well.
As I have been learning a bit about cognitive load theory and the effects of worked examples, I was wondering what how it applies to the Zettelkasten Method. Specifically, in the video above, it seems that elaborative encoding might not be as effective without the schema being represented well to the learner first when they are a novice.
It seems that a lot of the ideas around ZKM or just Zettelkasten more generally are heavily founded upon deep processing or elaborative encoding from a more constructivist flavor.
I was wondering if there was more of a need for worked examples as one develops knowledge within their ZK and even as one works on getting better at the method itself (ZKM).
Would love to hear if any others have thoughts on this.
Note: I know that Math is focused on this video. But, it seems to me that zettling is a practice/skill. And, even a lot of what we develop within the ZK should be able to used in some skill. So, worked examples seems relevant. Feel free to pick at that assumption too!</span>

                              <span>TL;DR: LLMs are unreliable, but oh my, this unreliable?!?
I have been working through a beautiful (and funny!) book, A.C. Grayling&#x27;s &quot;The History of Philosophy&quot; (2019). My main interest has been the ideas therein and less biography, but I decided to have a note each for the major philosophers I care about, and started using Claude 3 Opus (the latest model from Anthropic, claimed to be GPT-4 level) for just the biography part. What could possibly go wrong?!?
Well, in the dozen philosophers I have had Claude write a short bio for, maybe nothing wrong was seen. But then, I am hardly an expert on Thales (born around 624 BC) so wouldn&#x27;t have spotted a small lie here or there.
So I asked it to write a biographical note for someone I know well --- me. The results were horrendous. I report them in full detail (with correction) here: https://amahabal.substack.com/p/dissecting-the-people-make-errors (as part of the bigger question in response to someone saying &quot;but people make errors, too!&quot;).
Beware!</span>

 Its actually more of a rant about people not learning their tools. But I use my emacs setup to drive the point home.

 Would love some feedback!

                              <span>r/emacs is such a valuable resource; I&#x27;ve learned so much in conversation with you all. I&#x27;ve recently discovered that we have only one active moderator (thanks to them!). While so far I haven&#x27;t noticed issues arising from this, I think we can all agree that drawing additional moderator support from among our most active members would strengthen an already strong community. The advantages of a larger pool of moderators include distributing the work effort and bringing in other viewpoints. The former is especially important, as we all know how work and life commitments ebb and flow.
 If you are interested in serving as a moderator for r/emacs, please reply with your short &quot;Emacs bio&quot; — how long you&#x27;ve been involved with Emacs, what areas of the Emacs landscape most interest you, and what approach you&#x27;d bring to moderation.
 If you have concerns about moderation in general, please save those for another thread. If, like myself, you are supportive but cannot yourself commit to moderating, please join me in thanking our current moderator along with those who volunteer!

 EDIT:If you&#x27;re interested, you need to do 2 things:
  
Make Emacs&#x27; background transparent (for example by doing this in init.el). This is to take advantage of a feature in Plasma to blur windows that are transparent.

                              <span>Hello everyone, I am relatively new to emacs and have stumbled on a problem that has completely stumped me.
 My setup:
 I have a leader keybinding setup. I press “SPC” and which key shows the next prefix keys. I can do “SPC b” to get to buffer-specific keybindings and “SPC c” for code-specific keybindings. 
 This is achieved by having a my-leader-key-map, where “c” is bound to my-code-key-map, and “b” is bound to my-buffer-key-map. 
 “d” is bound to xref-find-definition in my-code-key-map. Thus “SPC c d” will call that command.
 What I am trying to accomplish:
  
“SPC c d” to be lsp-find-definition if and only if I am connected to lsp in that particular buffer.
 “SPC c i” to be lsp-find-implementation if the lsp supports it and I am connected to lsp in this particular buffer. Keep in mind …</span>

The issue is documented here [2] and here [3], but I haven&#x27;t got very far with it so I thought I&#x27;d ask here. My setup is as follows:
  
Operative System: Windows 10
 LSP server: Omnisharp 1.39
 Emacs: 29.1
 Programming language: C# (csharp-mode)
  
In general, omnisharp and eglot work great, but when I choose code actions nothing seems to happen. You can see a screenshot of this as well as the JSON RPC debug log:
  
https://github.com/joaotavora/eglot/discussions/1322#discussioncomment-8711304
  
I am just trying to understand:
  
if this is an eglot issue or an omnisharp issue;
 any pointers as to additional means to figure out what is failing. I have tried debugging with edebug as well as additional logging (JSON RPC etc) but no luck.

 This allow showing flymake&#x27;s error indicators in TUI and in GUI makes it more modern with scaling better for HIDPI screens.
 The solution i&#x27;ve found is make an advice for flymake--fringe-overlay-spec function:
 (advice-add #&#x27;flymake--fringe-overlay-spec :override (lambda (bitmap &amp;optional recursed) (if (and (symbolp bitmap) (boundp bitmap) (not recursed)) (flymake--fringe-overlay-spec (symbol-value bitmap) t) (and flymake-fringe-indicator-position bitmap (propertize &quot;!&quot; &#x27;display &#x60;((margin left-margin) ,bitmap)))))) 
 The only change here is in the propertize part for use left margin instead of fringe (if you want to use the righ…</span>

                              <span>Personally I have a habit.org file that I add to and then I use org journal for a personal diary which I add single item to-dos.
 I mark things done at the end of the day and try to use org pomodoro timers if I&#x27;m on my laptop.
 I&#x27;m having some problems having a fully functional workload using orgmode and am looking for some examples of what the workflow is like day to day.
 Some of the biggest things I feel like I&#x27;m missing is visibility on other platforms. I like the idea of having my habit scorecard and schedule in my face whether on emacs, laptop, phone, watch.
 I have problems with tracking away from my laptop. I assume some use a mobile org or maybe a third party app with an open api. Only a few of my tasks a day am I going to have my laptop on hand.
 How are you using org mode for scheduling? What other tools do you use in conjunction?

                              <span>Hey guys.
 Ive used org-mode and roam for about a year now. Recently I started taking notes for a new DnD campaign, and was thinking of using the zettlekasten method with org-roam like i usually do. 
 However, once i started to think about it, It didn&#x27;t make sense to me why i cant just keep the whole campaign in one file? I know that this is not the zettlekasten idea, but how does it logically change anything? I can links to all other headings when needed to have it work like a wiki, still use org-roam-ui AND get a clearer navigation system since its in one file and i can see all the headings above a node to make mental connections on the big picture on how things are connected. 
 Am i missing something? I understand that having separate files for two completely different topics can be useful, but i can&#x27;t see it for a single topic.

 Does Obelisk use something different to target the Android NDK? Where can I learn more about that and see an overview of the architecture of an Obelisk app beyond the browser – like what renderer is used for the UI of an Android native Obelisk app?

                              <span>are there good examples of libraries or plugins that allow users to modify behavior (e.g. how typeclasses are derived) by adding annotations to values and types? An example present in other languages is annotating record fields to change how de/serialization (e.g. from/to JSON) works.

                              <span>I have a situation where I have several traits with each trait containing a set of methods. I have now to expose these functionalities to the external world through profiles. For example., a basic profile will be another trait, but this contains just the methods a and 2 from trait 1, methods 4 and 5 from trait 2 etc.,I can create these profiles as a new trait and repeat the method implementation, but how can I reuse the already defined methods in my trait and just create the profile traits more elegantly? For example.,
 trait InternalTrait1 { def method1(int: Int): Int def method2(int: Int): Int } trait InternalTrait2 { def method3(int: Int): Int def method4(int: Int): String } 
 I would now like to have:
 trait BasicProfile { def method2(int: Int): Int dev method4(int: Int): String } 
 I want to refer the method2 and method4 from Trait1 and Trait2 respectively. Any ideas? Self traits come to my mind, but not sure if that is a good idea?

                              <span>Overview
 I am considering writing a new mode for running .NET / C# unit tests, and I thought I&#x27;d ask for some advice on how to go about it. Or, if there already is an existing mode which does what I&#x27;m after, if you could please point it out. The remainder of this post describes my requirements, what I have found out so far, and the approach I intend to take. I apologise in advance for the length of this post, but it seemed easier to lay down all the information I have thus far.
 High-Level Requirements
 My requirements are as follows:
  
the ability to see a unit test tree across all projects in a solution.
 ability to run individual tests, or nodes from the tree.
 ability to see which tests have failed and which tests have passed within the tree.
 ability to see details of the failure.

                              <span>Hello Emacs Community!,
 ​
 I just configured Forge at some Gitlab Repositories, I now can see issues related to the projects I&#x27;m in,
 Now, my team doesn&#x27;t use the issues on specific projects much, but open issues in a different Board on gitlab, which is not a project but contains all the important issues I do want to see.
 ​
 I see that I can see issues and posts on each project, but I want to see the one that is in a board, problem being that as it is not a project, it doesn&#x27;t end with .git, but /team-1/board, while a project would be /project-1.git.
 ​
 Adding the board repository will result in a wait without messages, just a Pulling wait that doesn&#x27;t seem to be pulling anything.
 ​
 Is there a way to add this board?, and even better, to have it globally?, or can I only see those PRs and issues related to the project I have added?
 ​
 Thanks!

                              <span>This is something that has bothered me for many years now, but I was always too lazy to dig in. Well, this time I&#x27;m at least not too lazy to ask:
 Is there a way to make Emacs buffer ordering be per-window and remembered separately for each window?
 The way I work is using eyebrowse to create &quot;screens&quot; or &quot;workspaces&quot; (I used escreen before eyebrowse, a long time ago). Each of these is usually further separated into windows. That means that certain buffers naturally end up &quot;belonging&quot; in certain workspaces. For example, my Clojure REPL always lives in screen 4.
 This setup is great, but the way buffer switching works doesn&#x27;t play nice with it. If I jump from screen 1 to screen 4 and back to 1, my previous buffer will be my REPL, which is not what I want. Screen 1, and more specifically, the window in that screen that I&#x27;m working in, should remember which buffers were used in it recently, so that I can use previous-buffer/next-buffer predictably.
 I think I would expect all other buffers (ones not visited in that window) to be appended at the end, as I don&#x27;t want to limit myself. I might want to switch to some of those some day.
 Does something like this exist? Is it possible at all?

                              <span>I make updates to my bib file that I have embedded, and the changes do not take effect when I refresh the preview pane (all changes within the .tex do) and even when I fully exit my emacsclient. 
 Even killing the preview buffer, re-starting emacs client, does not help. Even with using a new emacs instance it does not work. Last time to fix this, I wiped the files in the directory and re-opened the tex file (after copying them in from another place) for the bib to work.

                              <span>I want to write a function that marks my todo item done then archive it. 
 My current config is:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 (add-hook &#x27;org-after-todo-state-change-hook &#x27;org-done-and-archive)
 (defun org-done-and-archive ()
 (interactive)
 (when (and (or (equal org-state &quot;DONE&quot;) (equal org-state &quot;KILL&quot;))
 (org-archive-subtree-default)
 )))
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; 
 However, I cant get it to work along with org-log-done. The function would archive the todo item then add logbook to the next item. Can anyone help me out?

                              <span>Ultimately, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a single perfect book for getting into Haskell.
 Learn You A Haskell For Great Good is an excellent starter, especially for introducing FP concepts and the basics.
 I like Will Kurt&#x27;s Get Programming With Haskell, the explanations are very clear and visually, it&#x27;s got great design.
 Although I like the book very much, I struggle a bit with Chris Allen and Julie Moronuki&#x27;s very in-depth Haskell Programming From First Principles after the first few chapters.
 The one I&#x27;m most excited about is the one I just got. It&#x27;s Tom Schrijver&#x27;s Soar With Haskell and am finding this quite good. It covers some of the territory that Allen and Moronuki cover, but in a more accessible manner (albeit in less depth). This strikes me as a very solid intro to the language that doesn&#x27;t avoid advanced features or oversimplify.
 Curious what others think of these books.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve just switched over to ghcup and away from exclusively stack. I&#x27;m also trying to use Emacs&#x27; org-mode Babel, which is Jupyter notebook-style literate programming with more functionality than the Jupyter, IMHO. The going is not smooth getting the code blocks in the org-mode text to work, as they are run in a ghci session -- with all the restrictions such as multiple line versus single line to deal with. So when working with Haskell on org-mode, I first start a project with cabal init inside a directory, e.g., .../myproj. This will just be a skeleton, since I will throw my org-mode Babel files in this directory too. Next, I want to install Hackage packages, so I add them to the myproj.cabal build-depends section and do cabal run. Now, since org-mode&#x27;s Babel is sending my Haskell code blocks to ghci, can that ghci session see and use the packages of myproj? If I do :show paths in the ghci buffer it reports .../myproj so no need to do a :cd  Very well. But my question is, does the ghci session see, can use my included packages from the project? As I understand, packages are installed per project (ergo per directory). But is there a global way with ghcup to install a package for all projects to use? For example, if I want QuickCheck globally and not have to include it per project, is this possible? Similarly, if I want to open a ghci REPL anywhere, how can I access packages?

                              <span>I see this has been brought up in the past, but no definite solution. I&#x27;ve got a reliably failing scenario in a pretty vanilla system (emacs-mac from brew, GNU Emacs 29.1 (build 1, aarch64-apple-darwin22.5.0, Carbon Version 169 AppKit 2299.6) of 2023-08-08, current m2 mac, working through the emacs-bedrock configuration so there&#x27;s not a lot loaded).
 Essentially if I use the right click context menu, and move the pointer around said menu, I&#x27;ll get the briefly spinning and then forever frozen beachball cursor. C-g does nothing, pkill -SIGUSR2 also did nothing helpful.
 I don&#x27;t need the context menu, so I&#x27;ve removed the code in init.el that enables context-menu-mode.
 Anyone else still seeing these hangs, or have any ideas on a real solution?

                              <span>I am a long time vim user. I started using emacs about four years ago mainly for notmuch email.
 I tried evil for a while, but it had some quirks and incompatibilities with other packages, so I went back to the default key bindings.
 I find the default key bindings to just not stick with me. I keep reverting to using the cursor keys or mouse. Do the majority of folks use the default key bindings? Or do you map them to something that suites you? Or do I just need to force myself to use the default keys?
 In the various discussions I have never gotten a feel for just how wide spread evil is.
 Thanks.

                              <span>There was a recent thread about writing org mode init files where I noted that tangling an org file doesn&#x27;t fit my workflow due to several considerations I&#x27;m going to leave aside here but I like having a nicely formatted documentation file for sharing.
 Basically what I wanted was a way to postprocess my elisp files (primarily init.el but in theory any one) and generate either markdown or org that looked similar to literate programming examples that I could then publish if desired on github etc.
 I didn&#x27;t find anything that fit my scenario so I went ahead and wrote a fairly simple proto-package at
 https://github.com/benleis1/elispdoc
 I haven&#x27;t figured out publishing yet and its still in beta stage but you can clone and load-file it to try it out. Already the output is pretty enough for my purposes.
 I auto-generated the readme.md on the repo using elispdoc on itself.
 I&#x27;m hoping someone else will find this useful and I&#x27;m interested in any feedback.

                              <span>Emacs is a fantastic software that has become my swiss army knife as a pentester. The problem is that recently I&#x27;ve had a muscle issue, radiculopathy, and navigating around DWM with my current configuration is my personal hell. This is fixable with a reworked sxhkd configuration. 
 Questions regarding the issue:
 Q1: Is there a prefix key on the left side of the keyboard that can feel as smooth as firing C-x without creating any real pressure between the thumb and index finger?
 BLABLABLA: Define smooth, right? lmao... ig the same way you can glide on and off the defaults for save-buffer, or new-window-on-right. 
 Q2: Is there a way to get Emacs to use the same exact hotkey you&#x27;re using globally? 
 BLABLABLA: This is obviously the magical, superfast route, so I don&#x27;t expect a response to this question. Maybe though... a script, syntactical directive, something... 
 Answer either question at your leisure. I&#x27;m still hacking away at it myself and just wanted to delegate the task to anyone willing. C-x and M-x appear to be masterful in terms of flexibility.

                              <span>I am trying to set up my own config and want to use lsp-mode.
 I have a pretty minimal config with lsp-mode, lsp-ui, and vertico. When I open a JS file I can see diagnostic messages and hover over functions for information. When I try to type, I expect a popup to appear with suggestions from typescript-language-server as well as pieces of text from my buffer, but this does not happen.
 Do I need to install another package or set up some keybindings for this? I&#x27;m sort of confused at what consult/company/ivy/helm/vertico/etc are and where each of them fit in and want to understand this all better.
 Here is my config

 I&#x27;m using doom with company and vertico enabled in the :completion section; I&#x27;m not sure which one is responsible.
 Has anyone seen this behaviour? Any suggestions of how I can determine which package is causing it, or even better, how to fix it? Thanks!

                              <span>i am a college student and nobody i know uses emacs, i learnt vim by watching my mentors use it but i feel emacs will be much better than vim
 i&#x27;m so bad at emacs i spent 3 days trying to change my indentations from 8 to 4 and still couldn&#x27;t manage to do it
 i tried liberachat #emacs on IRC but people aren&#x27;t much present on irc
 i wish there was a discord channel where i could talk to people who use emacs
 i have never online seen a person use emacs as his goto IDE/OS :D
 neither have i seen a person offline 
 my teacher who i really respect uses vim and says it would&#x27;ve been better if he had got hang of emacs
 i wish i don&#x27;t comfort myself with vim for too long or it would be painful switching editor to emacs
 i use tmux, vim , arch , hyprland, i3 , dwm 
 however i&#x27;ve never felt the fear of using these while starting 
 but emacs scares me as i know how much time i spent trying to learn it and it was all vain

                              <span>I would like to be able to write a bunch of functions that call company-complete and then continue doing things after I&#x27;ve selected the completion. The idea is to pretend company-complete has been called from inside a \ref.
 This is a simple example
  (defun f1 () (interactive) (insert &quot;\\ref{}&quot;) (backward-char) (company-complete) ;; now choose the completion, etc (backward-char 4) (insert &quot;i_used_to_be_a_&quot;)) 
 If the above worked, I&#x27;d be using company-completeas if it was being called from a \ref, but then I&#x27;d modify the \ref to, in this example, \i_used_to_be_a_ref.
 The problem is that the above immediately modifies \ref, but I never get to choose the completions . I&#x27;ve tried variations of the above, like call-interactively, without success. I think I am missing something very obvious (emacs lisp novice here).
 Why do I want to do this? Because I want to use company-complete for arbitrary macros in latex as if they were \ref. I can do this modifying company-reftex&#x27;s company-reftex-labels-regexp, but ideally I&#x27;d like to do it without modifying that variable, or when company-reftex is not called, for example when using LSP.

 Read on - this is not a rant but an exchange wheather I should subimt a bug report
 Using GNU Emacs 30.0.50 (build 1, x86_64-w64-mingw32), pre-built treesitter libraries version v0.12.148 from https://github.com/emacs-tree-sitter/tree-sitter-langs/releases
 When I open a prettified JSON with 17944 lines, 370 kB in size, opening takes
  
js-json-mode: 1 Second
 json-ts-mode: 10 Seconds
  
Larger files also open, but become simply unwildly to use as eg. an undo seems to completely re-parse the file in json-ts-mode, which makes operating files in that mode really cumbersome.
 So using json-ts-mode is an order of magnitude slower and I wonder if my settings are wrong, this is to be expected or if I should submit a bug report?

                              <span>I want to learn emacs as a long-time neovim user. I love the way emacs is self documented as I find it so challenging to understand/fix things myself in neovim.
 I work on a monorepo at my job - a variety of projects in different languages inside of a single git repo. I will open a tmux session in my terminal emulator and keep a window open for whatever number of the projects I&#x27;m working with on. Typically I will use an alias to open a project in a new window, open neovim, and open a vertical split with a shell for running the project.
 The thing I like about this is it&#x27;s super easy to switch between projects and they all keep whatever pane layout I have set up. I can also spawn new windows for any other work I need to do.
 I&#x27;m not really getting how I can do this in emacs. I have set up dashboard.el and projectile.el and can open a project, but I have to then open another emacs frame if I want to open another project. I would much prefer to have a little tab bar or some shortcuts to switch between projects in a single frame.
 Any guidance is appreciated!

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 We are very excited to announce Copilot 3.19 [2]. Copilot is a stream-based EDSL in Haskell for writing and monitoring embedded C programs, with an emphasis on correctness and hard realtime requirements. Copilot is typically used as a high-level runtime verification framework, and supports temporal logic (LTL, PTLTL and MTL), clocks and voting algorithms.
 Copilot is being used at NASA in drone test flights. Through the NASA tool Ogma [1] (also written in Haskell), Copilot also serves as a runtime monitoring backend for NASA&#x27;s Core Flight System, Robot Operating System (ROS2), and FPrime (the software framework used in the Mars Helicopter) applications.
 This release drastically increases the test coverage of copilot-core. We also remove deprecated functions from copilot-core…</span>

                              <span>Hi,
 I tried Neovim and VScodium as the most popular Haskell IDEs. Curiously, the problem looks exactly the same with those mostly unrelated tools: the informative part gets lost beyond hope to the right of the right margin. No status bar, no hovering, nothing. It&#x27;s hard to believe that it&#x27;s intended to be so. What do I miss?

                              <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;ve been trying out Cursor recently - it&#x27;s a fork of VSCode with AI codegen baked in.
 They do some interesting things like indexing your codebase via embeddings and then use RAG to help do contextual codegen. You can provide your own API keys as well.
 This has been by far the best AI codegen experience, IMO. I was wondering if there are any good packages that replicate similar functionality in emacs.

                              <span>I noticed my computer was running hot and discovered that emacs was using 100% CPU usage on one core. I ran the profiler and it shows ~80% usage by redisplay_internal (C function) &gt; jit-lock-function &gt; jit-lock-fontify-now &gt; jit-lock--run-functions &gt; run-hook-wrapped. I then noticed this only occurred with org files that had links to web pages. For example, I opened an org file without links and CPU usage was low, I then added a link to a webpage and CPU usage went to 100%. In case it&#x27;s relevant, I&#x27;m using doom with emacs 28.1. 
 Please let me know if you have any ideas or if there&#x27;s any other info I should provide.
 Edit: Full profiler report Also forgot to mention I&#x27;m using Linux Mint

 Is there a way to skip the intermediate variable? What I really want is:

 Ideas? The docs are pretty thin on this.

 I&#x27;ve set TERM &#x3D; xterm-256color in Windows Terminal, I&#x27;ve set it in my emacs init.el but yet whenever I check getenv TERM it returns &#x27;dumb&#x27; and doing a meta-x list-colors-display shows me 16 colours. I know the actual Windows Terminal can display 256 colours because I ran some Python to get it to display them and it worked as expected. Any idea how I can get this to work? Is it even possible? Sadly it&#x27;s a work PC so I have no option but to use Windows otherwise I&#x27;d just use Linux and be done with it.

                              <span>Suppose I call completing-read-multiple with the following list of candidates: 
 (&quot;1&quot; &quot;2,3&quot; &quot;4,5,6&quot;) 
 If the value of crm-separator is [ \t]*,[ \t]*, selecting the second candidate will result in the list (&quot;2&quot; &quot;3&quot;), and not (as one might have expected) (&quot;2, 3&quot;). This is not very surprising of course, and if you are building your own completion tables for use with completing-read-multiple, the problem can be avoided by keeping the value of crm-separator in mind. The problem is that sometimes the completion table is generated on the basis of input the user may have no control over. 
 For example, in mu4e there&#x27;s a function mu4e-view-save-attachments which does what the name suggests: it lists all attachments in a given message for the user to choose (possibly more than one) and then saves the selected attachments in a specific directory. If you are dealing with a message with files whose names contain a comma, selecting one of those files will lead to trouble. 
 Now, I can just define a little function that will temporarily change the value of crm-separator to handle these cases, e.g.: 
 (defun my/toggle-crm-separator () (interactive) (let ((original-separator &quot;[ \t]*,[ \t]*&quot;)) (if (string&#x3D; crm-separator original-separator) (let ((separator (completing-read &quot;Select one of the following options&quot; &#x27;(&quot;;&quot; &quot;,,&quot; &quot;-&quot;)))) (setq crm-separator (replace-regexp-in-string &quot;,&quot; separator crm-separator))) (setq crm-separator original-separator)))) 
 Still, I wonder if there&#x27;s a smarter solution out there. Off the cuff, I can imagine scanning the completion candidates to ensure none of them contain an instance of the value of crm-separator and, if they do, at least alerting the user of the need to pick a different value for crm-separator? But I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s a better way to handle this situation. 
 Thoughts?

                              <span>Greetings everyone,
 I wanted to share a function that I&#x27;ve found incredibly useful while conducting qualitative data analysis of interviews. During this type of research, structuring my interview data and maintaining a clear overview is crucial. To assist with this, I&#x27;ve developed a function in Emacs Lisp that uses tags to extract specific headlines into a new buffer.
 This function, extract-headlines-by-tag, prompts the user to enter a tag. The function then scans the entire buffer, and for each headline that contains the specified tag, it extracts not only the headline but also its content. These extracted parts are then transferred into a new buffer. I&#x27;ve made the new buffer pop up for immediate review after the extraction process.
 Here&#x27;s the piece of code:
 (defun extract-headlines-by-tag (tag) &quot;Extract headlines and their content from current buffer by TAG.&quot; (interactive &quot;sEnter tag: &quot;) (save-excursion (let ((result-buffer (generate-new-buffer (concat &quot;/Extracted Headlines &quot; tag &quot;*&quot;)))) (with-current-buffer result-buffer (org-mode) (insert &quot;* Extracted Headlines by Tag: &quot; tag &quot; *\n\n&quot;)) (org-element-map (org-element-parse-buffer) &#x27;headline (lambda (headline) (when (member tag (org-element-property :tags headline)) (with-current-buffer result-buffer (insert (org-element-interpret-data headline) &quot;\n&quot;))))) (pop-to-buffer result-buffer)))) 
 This has greatly improved the way I manage and analyze my qualitative interview data. Sharing it here in case it&#x27;s of use to anyone else in similar situations.

 How can I get the time to display in a 12-hour format, like &quot;2024-03-07 1 pm-2 pm&quot;? Including a UTC offset would be nice, too.

                              <span>I implemented a custom JSON parser for emacs. Instead of using a library which creates an intermediary JSON representation which is then converted to Lisp objects, my solution creates Lisps objects from the JSON stream without any intermediary steps.
 Measured by ~1 MB of clang LSP messages, it works ~8x faster than the current emacs JSON parser. Maybe it can be helpful for people whose LSP works slowly, as an alternative solution to emacs-lsp-booster (I didn&#x27;t do any comparisons).
 You can check out the faster-json-parsing branch here: https://github.com/geza-herman/emacs/tree/faster-json-parsing. Is it based on master, but I think it can be easily applied to any recent version of Emacs (it&#x27;s just one commit).
 This JSON parser misses some error handling, like for example it doesn&#x27;t check for utf-8 encoding errors. So please consider it as a proof of concept, not as a production quality thing. But I&#x27;ve been using it for a while, it works for me with clangd perfectly.

For my use case, I am using a hydra to navigate around my buffers and every time a buffer is focused I run maximize-window, what I want to happen is the other open buffers stack on top of each other like in i3 can this be done?

                              <span>Hi all!
 I have evil mode enabled in my minibuffer by setting the evil-want-minibuffer variable to true. Is there a way to rebind C-n and C-p specifically in the minibuffer? I tried remapping it using the following but it didn&#x27;t work
  (define-key minibuffer-local-map (kbd &quot;C-p&quot;) &#x27;previous-line) 
 Before I used to be able to scroll up and down through my Ivy completions using C-n and C-p but now I cant. When pulling up the minibuffer with &quot;:&quot;, those ctrl keys map to the following when no text is inputted to the minibuffer.
 Note: These keybinds actually work as intended
  C-n next-complete-history-element [2 times] C-p previous-complete-history-element [4 times] 
 When I start typing and my ivy completion comes up, the ctrl keys map to the following
  C-p evil-complete-previous [6 times] C-n evil-complete-next [3 times] 
 The C-p and C-n dont go up and down the list of items as intended, which is why i want to rebind them to the original next-line and previous-line
 Any help would be awesome. Thank you! - Queztaz
 ANSWER
 This code fixed it
  (eval-after-load &quot;evil-maps&quot; (dolist (map &#x27;(evil-motion-state-map evil-insert-state-map evil-emacs-state-map)) (define-key (eval map) &quot;\C-n&quot; nil) (define-key (eval map) &quot;\C-p&quot; nil) ))

                              <span>I&#x27;m in need of a good contract-first approach to REST services. What I would like is to be able to generate the server-side code based on Li&#x27;s https://com-lihaoyi.github.io/cask/ framework (It&#x27;s great, and good for the scala community to have lovely approachable, useful and simple platforms like his).
 I&#x27;ve made a start here:
 https://github.com/kindservices/openapi-generator 
 The additional goal is to take a slightly different approach to traditional OpenApi templates, where the team is expected to have the generated code alongside the hand-cranked code.
 This template is intended to be packaged up in a jar, which can then be brought in to a clean new project as a simple jar dependency, allowing engineers to just &quot;insert your business logic here&quot; in a simple, tiny scala-cli style app.
 ​
 The main pieces are there, but it would really benefit from some collaboration, sanity checking, and getting ready for production use.
 So - does that make sense? Is anyone interested?

                              <span>Hey everyone. We are looking for two engineers to work new long-term project in the payments area. Haskell is already giving us an edge in terms of maintainability and developer efficiency so I&#x27;m keen to meet anyone who is wanting to take a new position to work with Haskell in their day job.
 The project is still rather young, so there&#x27;s plenty of opportunities to make an impact. We&#x27;re open to having remote employees. We sponsor visas and help with relocation too. Unlike a couple years ago, we are looking for more senior engineers. That is, people who have real life experience in production systems and whose expertise goes beyond Haskell. Experience with data modelling, infrastructure or frontend programming is highly appreciated.
 I&#x27;m happy to answer any questions about the role here, but if you want to apply for the position, please use our page.
 About the company
 We are a leading, fast-growing Nordic fashion and beauty e-commerce company. You can find our headquarters in Malmö, Sweden, but we also have a few physical retail stores in the Copenhagen area. We also have development teams in Aarhus, Copenhagen, Vilnius, and Poznan. We are also running a fully automated warehouse in Ängelholm, Sweden.

                              <span>Functional programming is a very new concept to me, and all I&#x27;ve known is imperative python and some oop java. 
 I&#x27;ve played with JS/TS before, but never learnt any of the theory behind it. 
 So, what is FP? Why would you use it over OOP? 
 Everything is immutable, but what&#x27;s the benefits of that? I get that mutability implies certainty of input-&gt;output, but why does that even matter?
 If anyone can give an ELI5 or tldr, that&#x27;d be great!

                              <span>The idea of one note &#x3D; one object of attention is rocket fuel—a change in attention &#x3D; a link to a new note. The level of detail depends on the elevation of the perspective you are paying attention to. If you are studying to be a sports trainer, the details you&#x27;d view ketosis with would be different from those of a person studying contemporary art design. The trainer might have a note mentioning William Wegman, and the artist might have a note mentioning macro balancing, but neither should feel the need to do a deep dive into topics outside primary areas of exploration. That doesn&#x27;t mean notes have to be exclusive, without the flavor of life.
This object of attention was sparked from watching Bianca Pereira, Linked Knowledge Does Not Work.</span>

                              <span>The most important thing the GPT for Zettel Critique does for me is point out areas where my note (thinking) is weak (has gaps) and offer suggestions like a patient and watchful tutor. This alone is a fine-tuned game-changer. If the GPT had a persona, it would be a smart, but not snarky, it would be patient, but not hold back, it would act with my best interests in mind. The GPT doesn&#x27;t have a persona. It is a huge algorithm of &#x27;linked knowledge,&#x27; and the benefit comes from its ability to pull out appropriate threads and apply them to the case at hand.
My role in this shindig is to be honest when reviewing the critique. I dream of &quot;What Would Richard Feynman Do?&quot; Maybe I should get this tattooed on my wrist. W.W.R.F.D. This would be a great slogan to go along with zettelkasting.  Try to be responsible and not give up independence to the machine. That doesn&#x27;t mean that the GPT is wrong in its critique, it means the it should be viewed like any tutorial, describing best practices while leaving open the opportunities to think in ways that support your individual style and goals.</span>

Episode 44 – José Manuel Calderón Trilla by The Haskell Interlude
Wouter and Niki interview Jose Calderon, the new Executive Director of the Haskell Foundation. Jose tells why he applied for the job, how he sees the foundation developing over the coming years, and how you can get involved in the Haskell community.
Playing with Value Iteration in Haskell by Iago Leal de Freitas

                              <span>Three years ago, a blog post introduced destination-passing style (DPS) programming in Haskell, focusing on array processing, for which the API was made safe thanks to Linear Haskell. Today, I’ll present a slightly different API to manipulate arbitrary data types in a DPS fashion, and show why it can be useful for some parts of your programs.
The present blog post is mostly based on my recent paper Destination-passing style programming: a Haskell implementation, published at JFLA 2024. It assumes basic knowledge of Linear Haskell and intermediate fluency in Haskell.

                              <span>Summary:
 I&#x27;ve encountered code that mixes the infix and non-infix (DSL style?) syntaxes. It is sufficiently abstract that despite 13 years of Scala experience, I cannot mentally parse and understand it. And that is even after unsuccessfully attempting to refactor it into a consistent infix style manually.
 What resources, if any, exist to transform an existing snippet of Scala source code such that it reformats it into a consistent infix style? And then enables reformatting it to a consistent non-infix (DSL style?)?
 Details:
 I&#x27;ve been using Scala since 2011. I come from a strong OOP background (Eiffel, Delphi, C++, Java, etc.), meaning that learning FP has been a bit of a cognitive dissonance over the years. That said, I have persisted and have mostly wrapped my head around FP in Scala.…</span>

                              <span>So my first instinct when I have some notes to take is to fire up notepad++, despite having used emacs for 20 years. I&#x27;ve never liked using emacs for plain text; it&#x27;s always felt like a code editor only to me. 
 I&#x27;d kind of like to use it for more text things, but one thing that I&#x27;m not sure how to do is maybe fire up a frame that only has access to txt/org files and won&#x27;t be cross-contaminated by all the code buffers I have open. Is there a good way to have a frame/window be dedicated to a type of file?

                              <span>I am new to org mode and would like to render images created in R code blocks to be rendered in my pdf. 
 I found this code block, which I believe should produce an image in the pdf when rendered, but no figure appears, only the r code. 
 Might I be missing something in my init.el file or in my header?

                              <span>I am working on a package that generates SVG files of interlined Denote files as a network. The package generates an SVG file (using GraphViz) which display great in a browser, including tooltips and hyperlinks.
 When I view the SVG file in Emacs, the tooltips and links are gone. Is there a way to display fully-featured SVG files inside Emacs?

                              <span>The query syntax varies between the function treesit-query-capture and the inbuilt tree-sitter-query-builder in Emacs 29 Let&#x27;s take this JavaScript code example: js console.log(); console.info(); hello.world();  I want to find only the call expression for console.log My query for treesit-query-capture is: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;lisp ((call_expression function: (member_expression object: (identifier) @call.object (:match &quot;console&quot; @call.object) property: (property_identifier) @call.property (:match &quot;log&quot; @call.property) )) @call )
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 But in the query builder buffer my query looks like this: lisp ((call_expression function: (member_expression object: (identifier) @call.object property: (property_identifier) @call.property)) @call (#match? @call.object &quot;console&quot;) (#match? @call.property &quot;log&quot;) )  The query builder works perfect, since it highlights only one node but the function returns me more than one node, it is returning all the console calls

                              <span>Hi,
 In projectile or emacs&#x27;s project.el, is there a way to support a project consisting of disjoint folders? i.e. folders without common parents? Or a way to exclude folders that I don&#x27;t want to be included?
 ​
 Thanks

                              <span>When I run emacs (GNU Emacs 26.1 (build 1, x86_64-redhat-linux-gnu, GTK+ Version 3.22.30)), I get a bunch of warnings like this:
  
(emacs:870588): Gtk-WARNING **: 17:46:44.937: Theme parsing error: gtk.css:978:50: Missing closing bracket for :not()
  
I do have a gtk.css file in .config/gtk-3.0, but it just imports a colors.css file - and that file just calls @define-color a bunch of times. And I tried commenting out the import - didn&#x27;t help.
 The default theme seems to be HighContrast, so I checked its gtk-3.0/gtk.css and there&#x27;s nothing it in. Could the problem being coming from another theme?
 It&#x27;s not a huge problem, but these warnings fill up my terminal. I can keep two terminals open to the same directory so I can see what I&#x27;m doing, but I was wondering if there&#x27;s any way to suppress this stuff.
 Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve tried:
  
I got rid of my .emacs file.
 I created a configuration file (~/.emacs.d/early-init.el) containing:
  
 (setq warning-minimum-level :emergency) 
 (setq warning-minimum-log-level :emergency) 
 (load-theme &#x27;leuven&#x27; t)
  
The theme takes effect, but the warnings are still there. Is there a global location that could be overriding my configuration? I got pissed and sent the warnings to /dev/null, but that means I can&#x27;t see any warnings at all - so not the best solution. Any better suggestions?

 stack new projname stack setup stack build 
 So I just installed ghcup according to the instructions and did ghcup tui where I chose ghc 9.4.8. But now ghc --version reports 9.0.2 -- as if it doesn&#x27;t know about my ghcup choice. I do ghcup set ghc 9.4.8 -- and again ghc --version still gives 9.0.2. I fear I&#x27;m messing things up. How can I get my Haskell world totally into ghcup and out of stack? The ghcup set ghc did say /usr/bin/ghc is &quot;shadowing&quot; and I should remove it. Will this solve this issue entirely, or is my previous stack world going to linger and cause more problems? I see in /usr/bin a cabal and cabal --version and which cabal yields, yes, /usr/bin/cabal and this not the ghcup cabal. Remove it too? What else?

                              <span>20240306154602 The algorithm of Neocortex
 #map #neuro #intelligence
In science existence of many constraints make it harder to find a model that fits. However, after an eureka moment all constraints seem harmonious.
In his book A Thousand Brains Hawkins look for a uniform algorithm implemented by cortical columns, the neural unit of neocortex.
Mechanism
Brain constantly tries to predict its inputs. When there is a mismatch between predictions and an input, the system immediately notices. Our model of the world being inaccurate deserves evolutionary attention.
The model we construct is not separate from our body. Neocortex, not being a simple I/O circuit stores data in reference frames  Meaning, we encode the location of a cup relative to our hand for instance.
The reasoning goes for abstract knowledge too. There are no &quot;is&quot; statements in the world.
I&#x27;m trying to go through a paradigm-shift in my understanding of Zettling, from &quot;PKM&quot; to keeping a ZK. Here is a simple structure note I created to dive deep into a topic, short because I haven&#x27;t split it into parts yet to work deeply. But I don&#x27;t know how to proceed. Any help is much appreciated.</span>

                              <span>Hi,
 This is an old story, once solved with {-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}
 Now I&#x27;ve got two errors:
 167 | strp path &#x3D; T.unpack $ fromRight &quot;&quot; (FPS.toText path)
 187 | Just ext -&gt; (T.unpack $ T.toUpper ext)
 https://github.com/Tyrn/dahastes/blob/master/src/Lib.hs
 Once it was ghc 8.x, now it&#x27;s 9.4.8. What could be the cause of the error?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve made this repository which was supposed to try out the parallel library, but using parallelism in Haskell, just in general, seems to not work any more. It&#x27;s no longer faster than just using a single thread. I&#x27;ve tried monitoring multi-threaded Haskell programs using htop, and I think the problem is that they&#x27;re not using the setpriority system call to get a high enough priority. 
 ​
 I can&#x27;t find any information on how to set the thread priority for the latest version of ghc (9.8.2), and I still haven&#x27;t gotten a follow up on any bug reports I&#x27;ve made.

So if I do a list-packages and don&#x27;t see it offered to install, but I notice it&#x27;s listed below in the dependency section, that means it is already installed, ready to use, and I won&#x27;t see offered in the available section, correct? I test out ht and it seems to work fine. So what is this mechanism with dependencies? I don&#x27;t remember installing ht, but I&#x27;ve got it -- as a dependency.

​
 When I go to do an internal link somewhere, I need it to be:
  
[[#id-3d58ec46-5e2a-4453-bf10-41f8b2767afc][Test Headline]]
  
​
 I would like a function to call that could create that link from an org headline that I could yank (paste) elsewhere in the file.
 ​
 Additionally, if possible, I would like to learn how I would figure this out on my own for future ideas.

                              <span>I have an eshell script named t.es that works when run in eshell with a source t.es command:
 echo $(* 3333 3333 3333) 
 I&#x27;m running emacs29.1 and I&#x27;m trying to get the script to run from the command-line. I&#x27;ve tried numerous variants of the following:
 /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs -q -batch --eval (&quot;require &#x27;em-script)&quot; --eval &quot;(catch &#x27;eshell-replace-command (eshell-source-file \&quot;t.es\&quot; &#x27;() t))&quot; 
 but none of them run and print to stdout. I figure there must be a way to do this but it&#x27;s surprisingly difficult (I found an old post from another account but it wasn&#x27;t quite there either).

                              <span>I created an emacs extension named org-linker that allows users to link a file in org-mode (the attachment is identified as a UUID), offering a secure and flexible method for referring to other files in org-mode. Try it out!
 Comparison with org-attach
 org-linker differs from org-attach in its approach to file attachment. 
 org-attach uses an org heading as a basic storing unit, which can lead to issues if not managed carefully (e.g. refiling or adding shadowing subtrees). 
 On the other hand, org-linker assigns a unique UUID to each attached file, ensuring a more robust linkage system. By treating individual files as the fundamental unit, org-linker provides a safer and more flexible approach to handling attachments in org-mode documents. For example, this allows easy movement and copying of links across various org files and headings.
 Both tools have their strengths and are suitable for different use cases. However, if you prioritize a secure and straightforward attachment system, org-linker might be the preferred choice.
 Example
 For instance, if the root is /tmp/org-linker/, and the UUID for the transaction is 20240101-235959, and the file is readme.md, the file will be copied to /tmp/org-linker/20240101-235959/readme.md with the transaction recorded in /tmp/org-linker/db.tx. And an org-link [[linker:20240101-235959/readme.md]] is inserted at point.
 You can customize the uuid generator. In particular, you don&#x27;t have to use timestamp.
 You can also remove the uuid easily by fuzzy searching with M-x org-linker/trash-folder-uuid, or just remove the uuid at point with M-x org-linker/trash-folder-at-point. The trashing function is customizable too.

 There is quick way to switch to a todo/agenda view, maybe of multiple files?

                              <span>I know it is natively possible to save the folded state of each sub-tree. Is there any elisp snippet or package that can help achieving that?
 I am asking about a snippet/package because simply having the property :VISIBILITY: folded&#x60; as described in the org-manual, like below, does not work for me. When I re-open the file, all sub-trees are unfolded.:
 * Main ** A - Level 1 *** A - level 2 :properties: :VISIBILITY: folded :end: Lorem ipsum ** B - level 1 *** B - level 2 :properties: :VISIBILITY: folded :end: Lorem ipsum ** C 
 I need to save the folded state in the file itself, using the VISIBILITY property, so that every time I open that file all subfolders have the desired folded/unfolded state.
 It must be something very simple which I am overlooking, any pointers, please?
  
 Edit: wording

                              <span>I am trying to refactor some of my old code with type parameter and can&#x27;t come up with a clean approach. Any suggestion is appreciated.
 ​
 I have two methods like following
 def doSomething(input: model1): model2 &#x3D; {
 ......
 }
 ​
 def doSomething2(input: model3): model4 &#x3D; {
 ....
 }
 ​
 doSomething() and doSomething2() are doing the same thing. So, i thought of passing the type as parameter and came up with the following
 ​
 def doSomethingGood[A, B] (input: A): B &#x3D; {
 ...
 return value.asInstanceOf[B] //---&gt;Is this good?
 }
 Now the issue is i have to cast the return value to B, is this good practice? Is there any better way to refactor it?

What are some of the benefits that we could have by moving to the typelevel ecosystem: http4s, cats-effect and circe. Also, what are some inconveniences that might come with such migration. Thanks!

 Our voices have been heard 👏👏👏 🎉🎉🎉
 Can&#x27;t wait until the standard library gets an update. Capture checking might change one or two of my solutions in a fun way too once that comes out.

                              <span>Since I couldn&#x27;t find any obvious online resources for this issue I thought I&#x27;d write a small post.
 I&#x27;ve been experimenting with turning on mouse mode when using emacs in the terminal via
 (unless window-live system (require &#x27;mouse) (xterm-mouse-mode t) (defun track-mouse (e)) (setq mouse-sel-mode t)) 
 This has some side effects that mess with cutting via the system command-c combination since the mouse selections are managed by emacs rather than my terminal, iterm2. I can live with that but I wanted some kill-ring / system clipboard integration since I do frequently want to cut text from inside emacs and paste outside of it in another app. So I added some advice to do that 
 ​
 ;; Advice to the kill functions that also copies the last kill ring entry to ;; the system clipboard. ;; This is called after the copy so we can ignore parameters. (defun pbcopy-region-filter (begin end &amp;optional region) (let* ((text (current-kill 0)) (process-connection-type nil) (proc (start-process &quot;pbcopy&quot; &quot;*Messages*&quot; &quot;pbcopy&quot;))) (process-send-string proc text) (process-send-eof proc))) ;; For terminal mode add advice to copy to clipboard (unless window-system (advice-add &#x27;kill-region :after #&#x27;pbcopy-region-filter) (advice-add &#x27;kill-ring-save :after #&#x27;pbcopy-region-filter))

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to set up Emacs on my personal computer in the same way it&#x27;s configured at my office, and I was surprised by how copying my init file from one to the other didn&#x27;t set up my font faces as I wanted.
 Turns out there&#x27;s a different set of colors available on each, even though both are running with xterm-256color. Doing list-colors-display in one gives the list of X11 color names that I expect -- 556 of them -- and in the other there&#x27;s a list of only 256 colors, the 16 ANSI terminal colors followed by colors numbered 16 to 256.
 I can&#x27;t find any documentation about this list of numbered colors anywhere, where is it coming from?

                              <span>I&#x27;m using latest master emacs with treesit support, ts-auto etc. So when I load a .cpp file it&#x27;s in c++-ts-mode. All good so far, but I notice none of my custom C++ snippets load anymore, because they&#x27;re in snippets/c++-mode. Is anyone working on solving that?
 It seems to me, from a user perspective, that the c++-mode/c++-ts-mode split is causing a lot of headaches. It may be solving some that I don&#x27;t know about, but it is frustrating sometimes.

 I am also open to methods to accomplish this other than adding an entry to my display-buffer-alist.

                              <span>Hi Experts
 Maybe I am not asking the right question, but please bear with me...
 Lets say i created an org document in which i used different org source blocks like shell, python, lisp ... and finally i get the data ... 
 How do finally wrap everything up in an interactive function, like i call that function and the whole org document is evaluated and gives me result 
 Is it even possible to achieve that?
 TIA.

                              <span>I&#x27;m on FreeBSD and have gotten suspend and resume working. Everything looks fine if I leave emacs open between suspend and resume, but if I restart emacs after resume, the fonts look like the standard unconfigured xterm-like font.
 Everything else renders fonts correctly. I have checked via M-x describe-fontset and it seems to be my font: Fontset: -PfEd-DejaVu Sans Mono-regular-normal-normal-*-16-*-*-*-m-0-fontset-auto2.
 What&#x27;s weird is this is after restarting emacs, so it&#x27;s something surviving in the system between restarts. Rebooting my laptop resolves the issue.
 Any ideas where to look to debug this?

                              <span>For using languages like python or julia, there are options like ob-ipython and ob-julia, which should interact with the REPLs directly. On the other hand, there is emacs-jupyter, which provides an interface with Jupyter, which also allows us to use like python.
 My question is: What is the benefit of emacs-jupyter for lang like python, when using org-babel? I think ob-python has provided the same functionalities.

                              <span>Hello, I am here to solve some doubts about &quot;Solarized Dark&quot; theme.
 I am considering these 2 versions:
 - Solarized-Dark 
 - Doom-Solarized-Dark
 ​
 I have these questions:
  
Is &quot;Doom-Solarized-Dark&quot; supposed to be better than the ordinary &quot;Solarized-Dark&quot; ? I would like to use the most complete theme and the one that supports more extensions. I don&#x27;t use Doom Emacs but that&#x27;s not an impediment to use the doom-solarized-dark theme. Which one is better and which one would you recommend me to use ?
 Solarized theme is a legendary theme, however it seems that has some flaws in its design (at least under my eyes). It is also true that I am not an expert in the topic. I am referring specifically to the fact that, talking about syntax highlighting, there is no color for strings (Font Lock String Face). That is, color for strings and foreground is exactly the same. Does it have any logical explanation ? Is it a flaw at a design level that needs to be improved ?
  
Thank you in advance for your help.

 Actually I had a try to do this and it didn&#x27;t work. Don&#x27;t know what is wrong.
 Did anyone tried to work with this?

                              <span>The magit package available on the nongnu elpa is v3.3.0 (https://elpa.nongnu.org/nongnu/magit.html), which requires transient 0.3.6. The stock transient that comes with Emacs 29.2 has the version 0.4.3.
 When magit 3.3.0 is installed, either from nongnu archive or directly from its tar file, it will pull down the latest 0.5.3 from the elpa archive.
 Is there a way to let magit not install transient 0.5.3 but use the built-in 0.4.3, which should satisfy the dependency requirement ?
 Edit: another package, transient-dwim, shows the same issue by pulling the latest transient even though this 2022-year package specifies transient 0.1 as its dependency.
 Solution:
 A temporary workaround until the bug reported by u/nv-elisp is fixed. Put this in init.el:
 (add-to-list &#x27;package--builtin-versions &#x27;(transient 0 4 3)) 
 Hope this is helpful and many thanks to all the people who chimed in!

                              <span>Hi!! I have been working as a Fullstack Dev for al most 2 years and, for most of my daily working routine I have been using VsCode. I am a Linux fan, but... During my studies I started with atom and finally moved to VsCode, using vi/vim/nano/fish/tmux for server managing and quick file modifications.
 I imagine that moving all my dev working routine from VsCode to Emacs is going to be... Hard, specially for the first days but this is the way my future working routine is going to be so... I am really excited and affraid to. I have a few tutorial from YouTube marked as &quot;to watch&quot; but I would like to have your personal experience feedback and your opinion for the usual question: why should I use emacs instead of, for example, VsCode?

 [ As part of 3.0.0-dev, we fixed an issue where a C-u prefix argument was needed to select a silo. ]
 I am aware that the top two functions currently still need the C-u prefix fix to correctly let you select silos (since I&#x27;m still on denote 2.2.4) Aside from this, I&#x27;m still running into two problems:
  
whenever i enter my silo in dired it always prompts me about the local variables list in my silo or .dir-locals.el containing values that may not be safe (*) and asking me to perform the action of ignoring it or applying the local variable list. But even after i choose the ! to permanetly mark these values as safe, the effect only lasts for that session and the next time I start up emacs and dired into that directory, it ends up asking me again.
 the three denote-silo-extras functions (aside from the C-u prefix issue on 2.2.4 which will be fixed in 3.0), all three of these functions when used don&#x27;t seem to pick up on my silo&#x27;s local variable denote-known-keywords for the silos when i execute the functions - they just show my normal global denote-known-keywords. They only seem to work when I manually dired into the silo directory first and then execute the functions while physically in the silo.
  
​
 ;;; Directory Local Variables. For more information evaluate: ;;; ;;; (info &quot;(emacs) Directory Variables&quot;) ((nil . ((denote-directory . &quot;~/Documents/recipes/&quot;) (denote-known-keywords . (&quot;french&quot; &quot;italian&quot; &quot;american&quot; &quot;mexican&quot; &quot;chinese&quot; &quot;japanese&quot; &quot;korean&quot; &quot;thai&quot;)) (denote-infer-keywords . nil)))) 
 Anyone encountering these problems?

 The plugin makes it so that you do not need to manually insert instrumentation code into function definitions, improving maintainability and reducing noise. By defining rules in a config file, you can specify which functions to instrument based on their return type or constraint context. This gives you control over whether you want the blanket approach of targeting your application&#x27;s primary monad/constraint or a more conservative approach of defining a type that explicitly indicates that it will be instrumented.
 A MonadUnliftIO instance must be available for a function to be instrumentable. In particular, pure functions are not eligible.

                              <span>Hi, HSL behaves strange and I don&#x27;t know why.
 About month ago I updated ghc to 9.6.4 and all related packages, such as HSL, cabal and so on.
 And now HSL behaves strange in tandem emacs&#x27; eglot.
 For example: I&#x27;ve created test project, made a mistake in a file and ran HSL in the directory where I did mistake. And that&#x27;s what it shows:
 2024-03-04T16:42:10.248584Z | Info | updateFileDiagnostics published different from new diagnostics - file diagnostics: File: /home/samurai/dev/playground/auth/src/Config/Http.hs Hidden: no Range: 1:1-2:1 Source: cradle Severity: DiagnosticSeverity_Error Message: Failed to run [&quot;cabal&quot;,&quot;v2-repl&quot;,&quot;/home/samurai/dev/playground/auth/src/Config/Http.hs&quot;] in directory &quot;/home/samurai/dev/playground/auth&quot;.

 Also, I created another project and ran there too and it showed me mistake, however on the next run, it started showing the same error
 How to fix that? I&#x27;ll appreciate any hints or something

                              <span>Hi, I freshly installed my PC with Ubuntu 22.04 and I want to set up a dev environment for Haskell.
 I run the curl command to install ghcup and let install everything including hls.
 Then I run stack new hello to build a neu project. The first thing I noticed is that another GHC version was installed.
 [GHCup-00130] The version 9.6.4 of the tool ghc is not installed.
 It installes GHC 9.6.4, which is neither recommended nor hls-powered
 It also installes HLS 
 If I run stack build I get the next error
 ghc-9.6.4: \gcc&#x27; failed in phase &#x60;Linker&#x27;. (Exit code: 1)&#x60;
 And if I open the project in VSCode (with the Haskell extension) I also get errors
 I had trouble figuring out the exact GHC version for the project. Falling back to using &#x27;ghc&#x27;.
 Failed to find the GHC version of this Stack project. Error when calling stack --stack-yaml /home/markus/dev/haskell/hello/stack.yaml setup --silent
 What went wrong? Did I miss some steps while installation? Do I need to install something additional on the OS?
 seems that I needed some packages. I installed these, But stack still wants to install a newer version of ghc. Does that matter?

Saving my org file generates the toc with links formatted like this: - [[#introduction][Introduction]] ; can I get it to simply make the link [[Introduction]]?

                              <span>Dear Zettlers,
you might have heard it: ChatGPT challenged me and my honour. Let&#x27;s see if I can keep it, or bow down in shame.
Here is a 100% authenticated record of a conversation I had yesterday (what a coincidence):

  
LUHMANN: What is best in life?


See this thread for full context: https://forum.zettelkasten.de/discussion/2837/gpt4-zettel-critique-assistant-robo-zettel-feedback
The idea is to compare the feedback of ChatGPT and me. So, we need notes. 2--3 are enough. The content needs to be accessible to me. So, I cannot deal with mathematical content software code. Also: Really intricate details in specific domains might be out of reach. However, I have broad knowledge in the basics of most domains. So, just give it a try.
Please, submit notes for this battle.
Live long and prosper

I have a few errors that may or may not matter, and I have no idea how to fix them after several hours of searching. Sorry if I should be posting several different error posts, and if anything of the problems are super obvious

 ⛔Error (doom-first-buffer-hook): Error running hook &quot;undo-fu-mode&quot; because: (file-missing Cannot open load file No such file or directory undo-fu) 
 This loaded on startup in the warning screen as soon as I downloaded doom (before I changed anything to the init or downloaded any packages). I tried adding the following to packages.el and my config.el respectively:
 (package! undo-fu)
 (add-to-list &#x27;load-path(undo-fu.el &quot;~/.emacs/d/&quot;))

                              <span>A couple of days back I made a post here asking how I can replicate my Emacs configuration for Front-end web dev in case I have to use a new computer. Some asked me to share my configuration.
 I installed the following packages from MELPA:
  
Company
 Emmet-mode
 lsp-mode
 web-mode
 yasnippet
  
I added these lines to my .emacs:
 ​
 (require &#x27;web-mode) (add-to-list &#x27;auto-mode-alist &#x27;(&quot;\\.html?\\&#x27;&quot; . web-mode)) (add-to-list &#x27;auto-mode-alist &#x27;(&quot;\\.css\\&#x27;&quot; . web-mode)) (add-to-list &#x27;auto-mode-alist &#x27;(&quot;\\.phtml\\&#x27;&quot; . web-mode)) (add-to-list &#x27;auto-mode-alist &#x27;(&quot;\\.tpl\\.php\\&#x27;&quot; . web-mode)) (add-to-list &#x27;auto-mode-alist &#x27;(&quot;\\.[agj]sp\\&#x27;&quot; . web-mode)) (add-to-list &#x27;auto-mode-alist &#x27;(&quot;\\.as[cp]x\\&#x27;&quot; . web-mode)) (add-to-list &#x27;auto-mode-alist &#x27;(&quot;\\.erb\\&#x27;&quot; . web-mode)) (add-to-list &#x27;auto-mode-alist &#x27;(&quot;\\.mustache\\&#x27;&quot; . web-mode)) (add-to-list &#x27;auto-mode-alist &#x27;(&quot;\\.djhtml\\&#x27;&quot; . web-mode)) (defun my-web-mode-hook () &quot;Hooks for Web mode.&quot; (setq web-mode-markup-indent-offset 2) (setq web-mode-css-indent-offset 2) (setq web-mode-code-indent-offset 2) ) (add-hook &#x27;web-mode-hook &#x27;my-web-mode-hook) (require &#x27;emmet-mode) (add-hook &#x27;web-mode-hook &#x27;emmet-mode) ;; Auto-start when the web-mode starts (add-hook &#x27;emmet-mode-hook (lambda () (setq emmet-indent-after-insert nil))) (add-hook &#x27;emmet-mode-hook (lambda () (setq emmet-indentation 2))) ;; indent 2 spaces. (require &#x27;lsp-mode) (add-hook &#x27;web-mode-hook #&#x27;lsp-deferred) 
 I installed VSCodes&#x27;s language servers by running this command on the terminal:
 npm install -g vscode-langservers-extracted 
 I added the directory (where the language server was installed) to my PATH variable.
 That&#x27;s all. This config provides me with HTML/CSS autocomplete, autoclosing HTML tags and syntax checking CSS syntax.
 Any tips/opinions would be appreciated. I have not yet been able to get syntax checking of HTML, like what VSCode does (highlighting misspelled tags in red)

 Anyone had the same experience and know how to fix it? Or maybe where I should report a bug?

                              <span>Hi,
 In python it is possible to create a class that inherits a slew of methods and properties, how can I make these visible in emacs?
 People often mention speedbar,occur or imenu, but these only deal with the structure present in the current buffer. I need a way to see the entire resulting object and all of its methods and properties.
 I have been looking for a solution to this for a minute now and all I have right now is to open a python shell, import the class and do ´´dir(MyClass)´ and parse this.
 ECB is broken for emacs29, pyreverse breaks on our codebase and many people here mention just using a jump-to-definition type of function, which I consider to be only better than poking in the dark by having a cigarette lighter on you.
 Is it possible at all in emacs? 
 ​
 thx,
 S

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been trying to get org-noter to work as demonstrated in this video by its maintainer. Here is a minimal init.el:
 (require &#x27;package) (setq package-archives &#x27;((&quot;elpa&quot; . &quot;https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/&quot;) (&quot;melpa&quot; . &quot;https://melpa.org/packages/&quot;) (&quot;org&quot; . &quot;https://orgmode.org/elpa/&quot;))) (package-initialize) (unless package-archive-contents (package-refresh-contents)) (unless (package-installed-p &#x27;use-package) (package-install &#x27;use-package)) (require &#x27;use-package) (setq use-package-always-ensure t) (use-package org :mode (&quot;\\.org\\&#x27;&quot; . org-mode)) (use-package pdf-tools) (pdf-tools-install) (use-package org-noter) 
 But unlike in the video (timestamp1 timestamp2), my pdf-buffer does not highlight passages in the pdf that have annotations. Things I have tried to no avail:
  
looking into the the maintainer&#x27;s emacs configuration, but nothing springs to my eye there.
 playing around with org-noter-highlight-selected-text as mentioned in this solved issue
 installing packages such as org-pdftools
  
Does anybody have an init.el with an org-noter setup that highlights pdfs, which they would be willing to share with me?

                              <span>I have been thinking about how to build a distributed database and it seem like a reasonable idea, may be terrible, to store all data and relations in a distributed map. However, I have only seen information on distributed hash maps and not maps that group related data to a node or group of close nodes. Does something like this exist?
 If not, would a key comprised of group id, table id, time, and data hash organize the data in the map so that table queries could still run quickly and not have to search all machines for the randomly distributed records.
 Also, I am intending this to be distributed across less than a hundred nodes, not thousands.

This is another installment of the What Are You Working On? thread. Add to this discussion by telling us about your zettelkasten journey. Share with us what you&#x27;re learning. Sharing helps me and, hopefully, you, too. It helps me clarify my goals and visualize my thinking. And sometimes, a conversation sparks a magical moment where we can dive into an idea worth exploring. We&#x27;d love to hear more from you.  🫵🏼
Ideas I&#x27;m exploring with my ZK:
A mindset that revolves around the organization and clarity of thought processes in note-making. How notes are proxies for ideas, and if I want clarity in my ideas, I need clarity in my notes.
Again, with the mindset. Having a mindset that matches the challenge is the key to flourishing.

                              <span>This version brings some minor enhancements to Iron&#x27;s internals and API as well as support for another library: Borer.
 Main changes
 First order types support
 Iron now provides refinement methods for first order types:
 List(1, 2, 3).refineAllOption[Positive] //Some(List(1, 2, 3)): List[Int :| Positive] List(-1, 2, 3).refineAllOption[Positive] //None 
 Such methods exist for:
  
Imperative (refine/refineUnsafe)
 Option
 Either
 &quot;Further&quot; equivalents
  
Borer support
 Iron now supports Borer&#x27;s codec derivation:
 type Username &#x3D; String :| DescribedAs[Not[Blank], &quot;Username must not be blank&quot;] type Age &#x3D; Int :| DescribedAs[Positive, &quot;Age must be positive&quot;] case class User(name: String :| Not[Blank], age: Int :| Positive) derives Codec Json.decode(&quot;&quot;&quot;{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;hey&quot;,&quot;age&quot;:25}&quot;&quot;&quot;.getBytes).to[User] //Right(...) Json.decode(&quot;&quot;&quot;{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;age&quot;:25}&quot;&quot;&quot;.getBytes).to[User] //Left(ValidationFailure(&quot;Username must not be blank&quot;)) 
 Other changes
  
Gen/Arbitrary instances for types such as List[Int :| Positive] will not fail anymore, even for big sizes.
 refine is now deprecated in favor of refineUnsafe
 Upgraded doobie dependency to 1.0.0-RC5
 Minor changes to existing documentation
  
Adopters
 Marss was added to the list of adopters.
