                              <span>I&#x27;m working on a project and we decided to use Azure Databricks and Scala.
 I&#x27;m fairly new to Scala and I was trying to find working examples online on how to setup a build.sbt file and build jars that I can deploy. Does anyone have experience with Databricks and Scala and can assist me how to setup a project properly. Basically all I want is one folder with multiple projects that stores all my pipelines, 1 commons project that sets up databricks configs and being able to build all projects into individual jar files. Has anyone attempted this or is there a better way to structure it? Should I use sbt-typelevel to create my project?

                              <span>Hi, I have a multi module project which has unit tests. I created a new task for integration tests. My goal is to run all unit tests in all modules followed by integration tests (only if all UTs pass). It doesn’t make sense to run ITs if any of the UTs fail! I tried using gradle task rules - mustRanAfter, shouldRanAter and DependsOn, all seem to apply the rule within each individual module but not across the whole project.
 Is it even possible to run all UTs across all modules and then trigger a new task with gradle build? Thanks!
 Module1: UT1 (under src/test/scala) IT1 (under sec/it/scala)
 Module2: UT2 (under src/test/scala) IT2 (under sec/it/scala)
 Goal: UT1 UT2 Anyother UTs (complete running all UTs) IT1 IT2

 I have &#x60;texlive-latex-extra&#x60; and &#x60;dvipng&#x60; installed.
 I have a problem with previewing a latex fragment in org file.
 Example org file
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 $\overline{A} + B$
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Running &#x60;org-latex-preview&#x60; on this fragment outputs an error &quot;Arithmetic overflow error&quot;.
 However, when I run this command on my linux machine (also Ubuntu with all packages installed), it outputs the preview image correctly.
 ​
 Has anybody figured how to make latex--preview work on WSL?

 Does someone can confirm that notmuch search --query&#x3D;sexp --format&#x3D;sexp &#x27;(not (tag myfancytag))&#x27; is not a legal query for notmuch ?
 The doc does not explicitly clarify this case.

                              <span>I must be going dumb, but i had this set up just 2 months ago. Now my Disc was fried and i&#x27;m trying to setup emacs again and can&#x27;t get magit installed.
 I&#x27;m using elpaca with use-package. Basically, magit requires transient and installing transient fails with &quot;Requires seq minimum version: 2.24&quot;. From searching online, seq should be build in and be Version 2.24 since quiet some time. I also don&#x27;t remember ever running into issues with this in the past.

                              <span>Hi All,
 I work using a local emacs instance running on my Mac and ssh to a remote machine. The two do not share a filesystem - i.e. any server files created on the Mac won&#x27;t be immediately visiable on the remote. 
 I&#x27;ve been trying to call emacsclient on the remote and have that open a frame on the local emacs instance. This used to work for the longest time (by accident?). I was recently noodling with my setup and suddenly it no longer works :) 
 I&#x27;ve been attempting to do the following from https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/emacsclient-Options.html : 
 local$ ssh -R12345:localhost:12345 remote 
 remote$ export EDITOR&#x3D;&quot;emacsclient \
 --server-file&#x3D;server \ 
 --tramp&#x3D;/ssh:remote:&quot; remote$ $EDITOR /tmp/foo.txt #Should open in local emacs.
 where I&#x27;ve copied the server file (from local Mac to remote) just ahead of trying.
 ​
 Any tips on how to get this work again? Quite a big part of my flow and hate having to use $EDITOR&#x3D;vim on the remove :D

                              <span>Hello! As a new Emacs user, it seems that I have joined in exciting times with the adoption of treesitter + LSP (which also was my setup in neovim). I have spent some time customizing and slowly get the hang of how minor/major modes work.
 From what I saw, a major mode defines syntax rules for highlighting (similar to treesitter), on-the-fly error checking with flycheck (similar to LSP) and some setup, such as indentation, etc.
 I understand that TS + LSP are still being actively developed and integrated into Emacs and so I accept that the experience using these tools might not yet match that of established major modes. So I am mostly curious about the future.
 If you were to start coding in a new language in Emacs, what would your setup look like? My thinking is to install the treesitter grammar and the LSP plus minor modes for navigation and editing (e.g., lispy for elisp). Would TS + LSP be used instead of the language major mode or in conjunction with said major mode?

                              <span>I frequently open two files from the command lines. e.g. emacs file_a file_b. Emacs opens a split window where file_b is in the left window and file_a is in the right window. Without issuing a command to swap the two windows, is there a setting that will cause emacs to open the file_a file in the left window and file_b in the right window? The convention that emacs uses appears to make the last file specified on the command line as the main buffer (which is the left window in my case).

 I want to switch to the workflow of org-gtd. I would like integrate org-gtd workflow to my current data. Its todo keywords is (sequence &quot;TODO(t)&quot; &quot;NEXT(n)&quot; &quot;WAIT(w@)&quot; &quot;|&quot; &quot;DONE(d)&quot; &quot;CANCEL&quot;). 
 I think I should convert all FAIL to DONE in all org file. Else (setq org-agenda-skip-scheduled-if-done t) will not filter FAIL tasks.
 How migrate org-todo-keywords in org file of my org-agenda when change workflow?
 Its is possible to share your elisp function for the migration?

Does anyone have an emacs solution that will allow me to make brief notes as to what&#x27;s in the pile, maybe tag them by subject areas and priority to read, represent how they relate to each other, and so on?

                              <span>Hej fellows,
 I am using Org Mode while learning about Guix via the fabulous Dissecting Guix series, employing Code blocks to visualize what it is I am talking about. However, I noticed two things that REALLY bug me out.
 First off, when I load the org file containing said source blocks, it is slow to the point of unusability UNLESS I first start GEISER-CONNECT with an instance of GUIX REPL hooked up. This leads me to believe that it is independent of org mode and has to do with the fact that it searches for the code to which the blocks reference. Nonetheless, input on this is highly appreciated
 Second, when I use TAB (for org-cycle), I am asked for the currently used scheme implementation - despite the fact that both related geiser variables, geiser-active-implementation and geiser-default-implementation only contain guile. When I choose guile, then the source block contents become read-only, and all subsequent editing needs to happen in a separate Org Src buffer. I have no clue why this is the case.
 I have come to the point where I commented out all code blocks to not have to deal with it, which is obviously not acceptable in the long run. Thus, any input is appreciated :)
 Have a good day, fellows!
 EDIT/SOLVED: I found out the source of the problem. At one point I had opened a lot of files related to Guix and then saved the Desktop file. Then, loading the file would load all those other files including all modes related. For some reason I don&#x27;t quite understand this literally ground emacs to a halt performance-wise.

 For example, the following is what I get using consult-imenu (which appears to give the same menu with plain imenu, just flattened):
 https://preview.redd.it/clcpn54xphbc1.png?width&#x3D;707&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;a722e75dfca64c6f2a2aacfd414df16a7a0d8882
 In this case, I cannot jump to &quot;1 Introduction&quot;, &quot;2 The Way of Emacs&quot;, or any other non-leaf nodes like &quot;Guiding Philosophy&quot;.
 Is there any way to configure imenu so that an item gets created for those inner, non-leaf nodes?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve started using lsp-bridge after months of fighting with eglot and lsp-mode. Both eglot and lsp-mode are great projects, but they have their quirks, and for me, most of them revolve around how slow and how prone to timing out they are, as well as the massive memory footprint that they cause (I&#x27;ve had both of them spawn clangd processes that end up consuming 20-30GB, and so far lsp-bridge is keeping under 10GB, which is fine). This isn&#x27;t their fault per se--I&#x27;m working on an Unreal Engine project and there is just so much going on all the time, and I can easily believe that parsing JSON is the bottleneck. (I know there&#x27;s a new-ish project that tries to solve that problem for lsp-mode, and I will definitely try that one day if this experiment with lsp-bridge doesn&#x27;t work out.)
 So, two questions:
  
Can I jump to the (header) file under the cursor, or like lsp-mode, cause that header to become a link to the file?
 I have some functions and classes that seem inaccessible because they&#x27;re wrapped up in a namespace. This isn&#x27;t true of everything in a namespace, just a few things. That means I can&#x27;t jump to classes/functions defined in that namespace, and I also get no completion information back. This wasn&#x27;t the case with eglot or lsp-mode, so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a fundamental limitation of clangd.
  
Other than that, so far, I&#x27;m pretty impressed. I&#x27;ll work out some keybindings and wrapper functions to see if I can get the functionality that I&#x27;m missing, but for jumping around the code, it&#x27;s significantly more performant.

                              <span>Lately I&#x27;ve noticed that new frames (e.g., created with emacsclient -nc) don&#x27;t come to the front with keyboard focus on them. I&#x27;m now on Mac OSX 14.2.1 (Sonoma), but I think it started happening before Sonoma upgrade. This behavior also shows with other programmatic ways of getting new frames (make-frame, yequake, etc.)
 Has anyone else noticed it, or solved it hopefully? 
 I&#x27;m up to date on osx (14.2.1 Sonoma) and emacs: 
 (emacs-version)
 &quot;GNU Emacs 29.1.90 (build 1, aarch64-apple-darwin23.2.0, Carbon Version 170 AppKit 2487.3) of 2024-01-07&quot;

                              <span>An elisp question. I have lines in my nnmail-split-methods using rx like this:
 (&quot;mail.git&quot; (rx bol (or &quot;From&quot; &quot;To&quot; &quot;Cc&quot; &quot;Resent-From&quot;) &quot;:&quot; (* anything) (or &quot;@github.com&quot; &quot;@gitlab.com&quot; &quot;@pdfbox.apache.org&quot;))) (&quot;mail.pro&quot; &quot;\\(^From\\|^Cc\\|^To\\|^Resent-From\\):.*\\(me@mine.com\\|@example.com\\)&quot;) (&quot;mail.hummon&quot; &quot;\\(^From\\|^Cc\\|^To\\|^Resent-From\\):.*\\(thing@example2.com\\)&quot;) 
 The first line, with &quot;mail.git&quot;, is the form I would like these things to be. I cringe at the repetition in each of them as I have the same headers bit that I want to replace with the (rx bol (or ...)) bit everywhere. But I can&#x27;t figure out the syntax to generalize that. In Clojure I could whip up a little let-bound function and use into to pull it off; what is the elisp solution to being able to stick the same rx code inline everywhere? I&#x27;m imagining (rx headers (* anything).

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to get a nice setup for LaTeX/Overleaf rolling, and I really like how GhostText and atomic-chrome let me just edit my browser Overleaf live rather than worrying about keeping a local git repo up-to-date with collaborators&#x27; changes. I was wondering if there&#x27;s any way to get citar working with this setup though?
 At the moment whenever I use M-x citar-insert-citation in a LaTeX buffer using atomic-chrome, I get the message &quot;RefTeX works only in buffers visiting a file&quot;. That seems conclusively like a dead-end to me, but this old comment from /u/T_Verron does imply that it is possible. (it also implies my setup might not work so well for collaborative editing as I thought it would, but I&#x27;m crossing my fingers that things have improved in the last two years)
 Can anyone point me in the right direction on a possible workaround? Thanks!

 This is a dangerous variable, so I don&#x27;t want to just add (org-confirm-babel-evaluate . nil) to my safe-local-variable-values, because then any file would run its code blocks without asking me.
 I thought of putting org-confirm-babel-evaluate in a .dir-locals.el file, but now I get asked whether I want to set it when .dir-locals.el is loaded, rather than when my org file is loaded.

                              <span>I am using Emacs 29.1.90 built from source with eglot and racket-langserver and any attempt to use LSP features results in an error message like the following:
 eglot--error: [eglot] Unsupported or ignored LSP capability &#x60;:implementationProvider&#x27; 
 The particular capability varies with what I am trying to do, but in short, even though I can connect to racket-langserver, any attempt to use eglot cross-reference features results in an error message like that above with each of the capabilities. I am using a vanilla configuration based on Emacs Bedrock. The pertinent parts of my config are here
 (use-package racket-mode :ensure t) (use-package eglot :hook (((c-mode c++-mode python-mode elixir-mode gleam-ts-mode racket-mode) . eglot-ensure)) :custom (eglot-send-changes-idle-time 0.1) :bind-keymap (&quot;C-c l&quot; . eglot-mode-map) :bind (:map eglot-mode-map (&quot;a&quot; . eglot-code-actions) (&quot;r&quot; . eglot-rename) (&quot;h&quot; . eldoc) (&quot;f&quot; . eglot-format) (&quot;F&quot; . eglot-format-buffer) (&quot;d&quot; . xref-find-definitions-at-mouse) (&quot;D&quot; . eglot-find-declaration) (&quot;i&quot; . eglot-find-implementation))) 
 I&#x27;ve checked the eglot events buffer and don&#x27;t see any requests going out. The only message I get back is the error mentioned above.
 This happens to me in Racket, but I&#x27;ve seen the same problem in other languages like Elixir. I should note that these features do work with other editors/LSP clients like Neovim and Doom Emacs. Am I missing some crucial configuration?

                              <span>Often times people here ask questions without formatting their code properly, which makes it a pain to read it.
 I mean, if you are not able to switch to markdown mode and use &#x60; and &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; or four spaces, how should you then be able to learn Haskell?
 I think there should be a rule requiring properly formatted code.
 What do you think?

                              <span>I&#x27;m new to Haskell and I find the syntax really off-putting (I am an experienced developer in Java/JavaScript/Typescript)
 One thing I don&#x27;t like most is there is no parentheses and comma in function calls. When a line contains several function calls with each having more than one arguments, your brain will be burdened to identify the &quot;parse tree&quot;, while in popular languages the parentheses will save you this effort.
 I don&#x27;t think there is mathematics base for this kind of designation. You can argue this is concise or elegant. I may also think the same way if I stick to Haskell for a while. But I&#x27;m afraid this can be one of the reasons Haskell has not been more popular - a developer from another language with passion of FP comes here, only to find he can&#x27;t tolerate the syntax and finally leaves for other FPs. :-)

                              <span>Open source software (OSS) development, grounded in principles of collaboration and transparency, is a cornerstone of the modern digital landscape. As more companies and individuals adopt this paradigm, it becomes essential for every programmer to have an understanding of how to launch and manage open source projects. In this article, we provide an overview of OSS best practices and categorization of open source software licenses.</span>

                              <span>Hi all -- I am experiencing an issue with the org-capture functionality. I use doom, and after my most recent upgrade &amp; sync when I invoke org-capture and org-roam-capture, the capture buffer (which prompts with [t] for todo, [n] for note, etc) now overwrites whatever buffer I&#x27;m working in, rather than creating a minibuffer to handle the capture. It also doesn&#x27;t seem to respect the custom capture prompts that I have attempted to shamelessly copypaste from a blog configure. Thankfully it&#x27;s not a fatal issue since a single undo restores the contents of the buffer but it&#x27;s very strange and annoying! Has anyone else experienced this issue or perhaps know of a fix? Snippets from my config.el pertaining to the aforementioned functions below. All help appreciated and thank you in advance!

                              <span>I need a little help: I&#x27;m trying to make a custom org agenda. I want an agenda view but with entries filtered so nothing with my :home: tag shows up. I tried this:
 emacs-lisp (setq org-agenda-custom-commands &#x27;((&quot;x&quot; &quot;Work testing&quot; agenda &quot;&quot; ((org-agenda-tag-filter &quot;-home&quot;)))) 
 but I still see entries with :home: as tags. What am I doing wrong here? I haven&#x27;t been able to find a good example of this.

                              <span>I followed this guide for using LaTeX with emacs, and I added snippets to my emacs configuration. The snippets are here along with my emacs config here.
 For some reason, when my snippets activate (either automatically or with tab completion) a new line is inserted after the snippet. As a result, my documents become very hard to read very quickly. The GIFs in the guide didn&#x27;t have this issue, so I was wondering if anyone here could point me in the right direction.

 (setq eat-enable-yank-to-terminal t)
 I&#x27;ve tried char-mode; semi-char-mode; line-mode. Text does get yanked into the buffer, but eat doesn&#x27;t do anything with it. It doesn&#x27;t fontify, the cursor remains in place, I can&#x27;t edit the text, it won&#x27;t be processed as a terminal command. After pressing ENTER, the yanked text moves to the next line with the cursor, but remains useless.
 What am I doing wrong here?
 (I&#x27;m using EXWM, if that matters!)
 Thanks for any help!

 I have tried to put this, which I found here in my config: 
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; emacs-lisp (defvar company-mode/enable-yas t &quot;Enable yasnippet for all backends.&quot;)
 (defun company-mode/backend-with-yas (backend) (if (or (not company-mode/enable-yas) (and (listp backend) (member &#x27;company-yasnippet backend))) backend (append (if (consp backend) backend (list backend)) &#x27;(:with company-yasnippet))))
 (setq company-backends (mapcar #&#x27;company-mode/backend-with-yas company-backends)) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; and i tried to put this
 emacs-lisp (setq company-backends &#x27;((company-bbdb :with company-yasnippet company-semantic :with company-yasnippet company-cmake :with company-yasnippet company-capf :with company-yasnippet company-clang :with company-yasnippet company-files :with company-yasnippet (company-dabbrev-code :with company-yasnippet company-gtags :with company-yasnippet company-etags :with company-yasnippet company-keywords :with company-yasnippet) company-oddmouse :with company-yasnippet company-dabbrev :with company-yasnippet))) 
 I wrote the former based on what I have read in the docs here, but it still does not work as expected.
 I&#x27;m running Emacs 27.1 on a Pop!_Os system. Can anyone help me figure this out?

                              <span>Maybe this defeats the point of tags etc., but I often want to narrow down a search based on what&#x27;s in the content of the entry (which maybe a blogpost or the transcript of a YouTube video). 
 I think elfeed-score can access this data in order to rank posts. I would for instance like to use this to score elfeed entries based on the length of their content (e.g. shorter posts ranked higher), but I haven&#x27;t quite been able to sort this out.
 But more generally, is there a package that can search through the entry content? I don&#x27;t think Elfeed alone allows this, but I&#x27;d be happy to be corrected.

Fwiw, I&#x27;ve been an emacs user for a decently long time now (~5-6 years at least?), I know how to write in lisp but I&#x27;m not overly acquainted with all the intricacies of the emacs environment.
 So some of the time when I go to save a buffer, I&#x27;m only greeted with the message Symbol&#x27;s function definition is void: nil. At this point, saving buffers becomes basically impossible as it always errors out, however, I can usually manage by manually calling basic-save-buffer instead. The few times this bug has appeared, it feels like my client is gradually deteriorating as more and more functions succumb to…</span>

I would like to display details about the test failure in the buffer associated (if currently open). I use flymake for compiler errors, so that seems like a logical choice, but I&#x27;m open to others.
 How can I manually add errors to flymake or some other package? Is there a better alternative I should explore, like overlays or something?
 For context, I&#x27;m working with Elixir and output from mix test.

 I&#x27;ve found a couple of references to others having a similar issue, but no solution listed, so before I contact the developers I thought I&#x27;d try Reddit.

                              <span>Soon I&#x27;ll probably be responsible for coding a compiler/VM for a language that targets WASM. And since haskell is such an amazing language for PL, I was wondering how the WASM experience is. 
  
Should I follow the gitlab user guide to wasm to get it going?
 Any tips, experiences, projects, or thoughts about things I should pay attention to?
 Any things that I should be worried about?

Swimming with Ideas
This is another installment of the What Are You Working On? thread. Please be courageous and add to this thread by telling us what is happening in and around your ZK journey. Join the community and enlighten us about your knowledge path trajectory. I do this for selfish reasons. It helps me clarify my goals and visualize my thinking. And sometimes, a conversation sparks an idea worth exploring. This is an invitation to you to up your participation in the discussion.
Ideas I&#x27;m exploring with my ZK:
EDCI445 Young Adult Literature is about to start.
I&#x27;m studying techniques for capturing &quot;Idea Flurries.&quot;
Reviewing 2023 and setting intentions for 2024.



I&#x27;m trying hard to slow down to interrogate and chew my thinking thoroughly. He/She who dies with the most notes doesn&#x27;t win. The goal is a rich and fulfilling life.

“It matters less what you read,” he told me, emphasizing each word, “than how you take notes.” - from Rank and File — Real Life by Robert Minto Referenced to me from On a failed Zettelkasten by Robert Minto — Zettelkasten Forum three years ago.
Zettelkasting randomness and disorder, and how it is surprising that these lead to knowledge.
Things I&#x27;m reading:
Parrish, Shane. Clear thinking: turning ordinary moments into extraordinary results. 2023.
Garmus, Bonnie. Lessons in chemistry. 2022.
Tucci, Stanley. Taste: my life through food. 2021.
Music I&#x27;m listening to:
Keith Jarrett

Japari Park
Jazz,  Jazz, and more Jazz.

                              <span>Hi everyone.
Most of my books at the moment are in digital formal (kindle) that I turn to pdf or EPUB using calibre. I want to start acquiring physical books but in the short term this is what I got.
I’m looking for an app that lets me highlight and add notes or comments to the highlights I made. Using the barbell method of reading I’d read the book twice and the highlights would have the purpose of being visual cues of what I found relevant and why.
There are three options I have found (MacOS): Highlights, Skim and PDF Expert.
Which software do you use and recommend? If you could expand a little bit on your workflow it would be great.
Thanks everyone.</span>

                              <span>Dear Zettlers,
I am in the process of restructuring my training regimen to align it with the new role of fitness in my life. (You can have a badly translated version of my last article here)
I am building an inventory of training stimuli for that. I am doing something similar like a factor analysis. For many years, for example, my aerobic endurance (roughly, what you normally associate with endurance if you are not into sports science) training was distributed over many different other training sessions that you&#x27;d normally not associate with aerobic endurance. Like that I could skip long sessions of running, biking etc. and use that freed up time and energy for other training while still having a solid aerobic base (for recovery between bouts of intensity and between exercise sessions).
I thought that I&#x27;d create something similar for knowledge work. Examples are items like reading physical books, attributes like screen time (to highlight a benefit of physical books over ebooks) or requirements like daily empty time slots (like my dog walks in which I do nothing, but just listen to the sound of the world).
So, what should be considered?
Live long and prosper
Sascha</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m just trying to express a current problem in types. The code itself is in TypeScript, so I don&#x27;t want to flesh out the PS solution in much detail, just annotate it in types as readability and type inference is so much better in PS.
 Is there an analog to Haskells undefined or Elm&#x27;s Debug.todo, allowing me to skip implementing functions while keeping the compiler happy? I just found an older Github issue suggesting this, but maybe I&#x27;m using the wrong queries in the internet search?
 I think type holes is not really what I want, as it kind of goes the opposite way around, right?

                              <span>so i like to have an in-between state, called DOING. but when i am DOING a repeated task. all the future tasks are also in a DOING state. 
 the problem is that when i mark the task as done. the other future task stay in DOING.
 is there a way to make them go back to TODO?

                              <span>tl;dr the title
 i am very new to emacs and org-mode. in fact i just finished watching the google talk by the creator.
 i found an app called Orgzly which seemed to work really well in the phone, and it even has a feature to set alarms. but it doesn&#x27;t seem to work. 
 i put the time in the scheduling as well as in deadline but it seems to only triggers a notification.
 it&#x27;s not a deal breaker and i could see my self replacing all my Obsidian notes to org. but i was just hoping to trigger an alarm so that i can plan EVERY PART OF MY DAY 😭😌
 thanks for the great software, and thanks for any help

                              <span>I often find myself reusing some code across various projects and thought it might be beneficial to share. 
 If you&#x27;re tackling the tedious task of modeling language or country concepts and you&#x27;re already utilising the Enumeratum library in your project, I&#x27;d suggest considering these two libraries: scala-iso-language and scala-iso-country. 
 They offer a minimalist and standardized approach and have some translation capabilities.

                              <span>Hi,
 I have a MBP 2019 16&quot; Intel, 64GB, I9 and running Ventura 13.6.3.
 Intellij Idea is the latest version as of now, Build #IU-233.13135.103, built on December 19, 2023. I allocated max. 12GB to the VM running IntelliJ
 What I am experiencing?
 When I edit scala files in a small size Scala project (roughly 40 files, scala source code + few files generated from the play framework) using playframework 3 &amp; anorm, basically IntelliJ goes nuts, i.e. the CPU usage goes up, the fans rpm go to the maximum (I run TG Pro) to the point where I cannot type continuously - I keep typing, and the characters don&#x27;t show up for a few fractions of second, then they all appear at once. Clicking anywhere in the editor or in the user interface has a lag. I am using the default JDK that comes with IntelliJ. Cmd+Tab doesn&#x27;t respond immediately, or it is frozen for a moment then the selection moves quickly a few more icons to right.
 I tried VS Codium + Metals to edit the same project and it is more responsive but I don&#x27;t like it as much as IntelliJ.
 I also run a Windows 10 VM in desktop parallels and, believe it or not, I installed the same version of IntelliJ and it is more responsive than the mac version. I think I am going to continue on windows in the short term.
 I am just curious about few things if you don&#x27;t mind sharing your experience:
  
do you use Intellij on Linux and if yes, what is the performance like, assuming that you don&#x27;t run it on apple hardware?
 if you run IntelliJ on a newer mac with the apple CPU, what is the performance like?
 any suggestions/recommendations on how to improve the performance of IntelliJ on the mac?
  
And just a side note, because I read the MBP 2019 16&quot; intel has some problems handling external monitors, I should mention I do use an external 4K Dell monitor, but I do not experience the problems described in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;AlUmnVYPcKM .
 Thank you

                              <span>Google Summer of Code is a long-running program by Google that supports Open Source projects. Haskell has taken part in this program almost since its inception!
 It allows everyone (since 2022, before that it was only students) to contribute to projects for a stipend. However, in order to do that, we need to have some ideas of what to contribute to.
 In the past, this has led to many improvements for GHC, Cabal, HLS, Hasktorch... and it can include your project as well! This is a great way to find contributors for your project (even after the summer ends) -- many past participants have become involved long-term.
 You can find more info and instructions on how to participate here: https://summer.haskell.org/ideas.html.

                              <span>please keep in mind that i’m very new to emacs and i&#x27;ve been using doom to get a feel for how emacs works, and thank’s in advance.
 so i just moved from neovim to emacs and loving it so far. but i’m having an issue configuring it to suit my workflow for python and django.
 so what i wanna do is replicate the workflow i’ve used in vim which is:
 configure pylsp with plugins pylsp-ruff and pylsp-mypy and then have isort and black handle formatting without lsp interference.
 and i also want to configure mypy globally in my config to check if there’s a (venv, poetry or conda) env active and and use that env’s python executable
 and bonus, if i could also get help setup a function to run django tests from emacs.
 i know my question seems like a tall order, but i’m really loving Emacs and doom and hope i could finally find a solution so that i’m able to stick with Emacs.

                              <span>One thing I&#x27;d like to do this year is to demonstrate various possibilities of using LLMs in Emacs. How are they actually useful in editors?
 In that light, I made a video showing how they are useful when taking notes. Specifically, I used ekg (my module in GNU ELPA) to come up with a way to get Aeropress recipes (Aeropress is, to me, kind of like the emacs of coffee brewing), and take notes how they taste. The video shows the entire process.

                              <span>I am currently testing PIKCHR, a modern take of the ancient PIC little language that generates diagram from textual input. PIKCHR outputs the diagrams as SVG files. However, when opening the files in Emacs (29.1, ) only an unfilled box (30x30 per mode-line information) is shown instead of the SVG files. Opening the same file in a browser (Brave), the diagram is shown. Also, when opening random SVG files found on the internet, they work perfectly in Emacs. Where to start finding the underlying issue?

 Because I am using GNU gettext I do have flake8 errors like this. I don&#x27;t want to put an extra flake8 config file into the repo.
 I don&#x27;t know how Emacs/eglo/pylsp do invoke flake8 in the back. Is there a way to inject &#x27;--builtins&#x3D;&quot;_&quot;&#x27; commandline option somewhere in there?
 *EDIT*: It seems that a &quot;.flake8&quot; file in the repos root folder is also ignored.
 [flake8] builtins &#x3D; &quot;_&quot;

                              <span>Recently I&#x27;ve been running into this problem a lot: Ruff gives syntax error hints even though everything is correct. After &quot;M-x eglot-reconnect&quot;, everything goes back to normal again. Below is a screenshot.
 ​
 https://preview.redd.it/my9v4il29xac1.png?width&#x3D;291&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;a10f27f546eaee001d6884fb4d82757245a396a2
 In this case, Ruff reports two errors that don&#x27;t exist: 1. ruff [E701]: Multiple statements on one line (colon) and 2. ruff [E999]: SyntaxError: Unexpected token Indent. &quot;M-x eglot-reconnect&quot; solves the problem.
 I want to report the problem but I&#x27;m not sure which component (Ruff, Flymake, Eglot, python-lsp-ruff or python-lsp) causes this problem. Any suggestions?

                              <span>I don&#x27;t know why but I am just having a really difficult time wrapping my head around the Emacs window manager. I can&#x27;t seem to translate what I have in my head into code, which is an unusual and frustrating experience for me.
 What I&#x27;d like to do is, when I&#x27;m specifically working on a Python project, have my frame set up so that there&#x27;s a main window with the buffer I&#x27;m working on, then to the right is a python REPL, and to the left is a switchable choice between an xrefs list and a directory tree. What I&#x27;d like to do is set up the position and sizing of all of these by mouse-dragging them to how I want them, then saving that configuration somehow. Then, crucially, having this configuration and sizing be entered when I visit a python buffer and python-mode launches, and exited back to &quot;normal&quot; emacs when I leave python-mode except in a couple of instances.
 Has anyone done something like this? If so, could you share your config? I don&#x27;t know what it is about Emacs&#x27;s window manager but each one of these requirements has so many moving pieces in different parts of the system that I just have trouble wrapping my head around the whole.

 At a single press of the F5 key -- or whatever you wish to make it too -- your project will be compiled. 
 I have examples for a number of languages -- Ruby, C++. Rust, Go -- but they are highly configurable and you can add your own.
 This works with your git projects. It will go to the root of your git project and execute the necessary commands to compile your entire project. Well documented with examples.
 If you hit the F6 key, you will be presented with the compile string that you can then edit on the fly.
 I should get this in Melpa. I tried a long while back, but the maintanier of Melpa insisted that I do a pull request instead with smart-compile, that schlau-compile is derived from. Except at that time I had made so many breaking changes a pull request would not have been feasible. And now? It has completely diverged, as I have added quite a few features and changed the workflow. It is its own project now, and I should approach Melpa again to include it separately.
 Let me know what you think!

                              <span>hi everyone.
 Let me know what kind of information would be useful to display in the org-ellipsis.
 I tried contents size (1) and first line of content (2). so, It looks like pretty good.
 sorry for my broken English. thank you for reading!

                              <span>I&#x27;m developing an experimental musical score writer. For now I&#x27;ve only been working on the internal representation, but I&#x27;d like to start prototyping the graphical aspect, which I&#x27;ve never done on haskell.
 I&#x27;m asking for recommendations on libraries to create an interactive canvas: basically, a window where I can draw/update the score and click on different elements in it, and also receive keyboard input. Not a GUI in the sense of menus, widgets or anything of the sort; just an interactive canvas. 
 Now, if memory doesn&#x27;t fail me:
 - the OpenGl bindings take mouse and keyboard events, but it&#x27;s perhaps too low level.
 - the Cairo bindings are nicer to work with, but to put them on an interactive screen some Gtk lib was needed; but even with that, would I only receive mouse click coordinates? I don&#x27;t mind writing some square object detection, but I wouldn&#x27;t mind a simpler route if there was.
 - ability to import svgs would make my life easier, probably.

Is haskell a good decision for compiler writing and why? Maybe I should use Rust for my compiler. Just try to find out some advantages and disadvantages of haskell in complier writing.

                              <span>There are so many aws api’s which are developed like for S3, Dynamodb etc. The aws platform support few languages like Java, python, rust, cpp, kotlin etc but no scala yet. Please share your experience if you are using scala in cloud , plain or fp flavor. I love scala and have been learning it for some time. The cloud is the next big thing where most of the development is happening now as the old apps are migrating from cobol/mainframes to cloud.

                              <span>Happy New Year!
I follow Sascha&#x27;s advice to use object tags: https://zettelkasten.de/posts/object-tags-vs-topic-tags/
In the following note, I have used the object tags: &quot;#good-technician #mediocre-boss #human-capital&quot;.
I often encounter this situation where I want to refer to a specific entity (e.g. a good technician), so I use adjectives to be specific about it. But I don&#x27;t know if this is good practice. The other options I could use are:
use two tags: &quot;#good #technician&quot;.
use only the core of the idea: &quot;#technician&quot;.
What do you recommend me to do?
Because in this note, I just want to refer to good technicians (I don&#x27;t want to talk about technicians in general). Therefore, I think that&#x27;s the object to define with the tag. But I could be wrong :^)
# 202401060957 Turning a good technician into a mediocre boss destroys human capital
#good-technician #mediocre-boss #human-capital

In companies (public or private), one way to progress economically is to
acquire responsibility for the work of others: to move from being a technician
to being a boss.

However, the skills that define a good technician are different from those of
a good boss.

This causes many good technicians (motivated by economic incentives) to become
mediocre bosses: they do not have the skills needed to be good bosses.

For the company, this situation destroys human capital value: we have turned
a good technician into a mediocre boss.</span>

                              <span>Hello!
 I&#x27;m interested in monitoring disk usage, one app to do this on Linux is IOtop.
 I checked to see if just like with the excellent proced process interface, there was an elisp implementation of something like IOtop, but I haven&#x27;t found any.
 Does this exist?
 Thank you!

 The only other things in my init.el file are use-package declarations and custom functions for keybinding and presentation display changes.
 Thanks.

                              <span>Been an emacs user for years, that said, I&#x27;ve barely touched elisp. Now, I want to update hyde.el to work on the latest emacs, and I&#x27;m having trouble the following part
 (defun hyde/load-posts () &quot;Load up the posts and present them to the user&quot; (interactive) ;; Clear the buffer (toggle-read-only -1) 
 It seems like (toggle-read-only) does not exist on emacs 29. Changing it to use (read-only-mode) makes emacs complain about the buffer being read only. 
 For what I can tell, I need to change the mode to read the read only and then inhibit it while I do some buffer manipulation. But these seems kind of elaborate for something that seems (to me) like common behaviour.
 Could anyone please comment on what the correct approach is to create a mode where a buffer displays data that is read only (and then have commands that do stuff on the data but mostly dont modifiy the buffer at all)?
 The code I&#x27;m trying to update is https://github.com/nibrahim/Hyde/blob/master/hyde.el, more info on https://github.com/nibrahim/Hyde/ with a relevant screenshot.
 Thank you.

                              <span>I am trying to get some color in an example block exported to beamer by doing something like the following
 #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE case when \textcolor{red}{condition-1 then value-1} when condition-2 then value-2 . . . when conditionn then value-n else value-z end #+END_EXAMPLE 
 According to this post on the tex stackexchange site, a verbatim enironment can get color by adding the commandchars argument, i.e.
 \begin{Verbatim}[commandchars&#x3D;\\\{\}] a (black) \textcolor{red}{b} (I want this letter to be red) \end{Verbatim} 
 Unfortunately I cannot for the life of me figure out how to get commandchars option set in the example block. I&#x27;ve tried adding a #+ATTR_LATEX: :options [commandchars&#x3D;\\\{\}] above the example block, modifying the begin example line as #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE :options commandchars&#x3D;\\\{\}, #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE :commandchars \\\{\}, and #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE :options [commandchars&#x3D;\\\{\}] and none of that has worked. How should I get color in my example block. Also, is there some reading material somewhere where I can find how to properly pass options/keywords/attributes to org-mode for exporting purposes. The org mode manual hasn&#x27;t exactly made a lot of sense to me.

                              <span>This post will not probably have enough information for troubleshooting, but the issue is rather bizarre, so I&#x27;m sharing it anyway in case anyone has any advice.
 My Emacs is emacs-mac GNU Emacs 29.1 (build 1, aarch64-apple-darwin23.2.0, Carbon Version 170 AppKit 2487.3) of 2024-01-04, installed with brew install emacs-mac --with-librsvg --with-mac-metal --with-native-compilation --with-natural-title-bar --with-unlimited-select
 My installed packages are committed to a git repo and they are a mix of melpa and melpa-stable with the preference for the latter.
 Yesterday I was upgrading packages (I have to apologize if this and a few next steps are vague as I was not keeping a log) and for some reason had to restart Emacs, which then gave me an error on (require &#x27;lsp-clangd) that it couldn&#x27;t be found. I check the load-path and see that lsp-mode is no longer its part, even though it was a user selected package. I do a package-reinstall for it, restart Emacs and it no longer starts: on mac, the icon jumps at the bottom of the screen for a second and goes away. Adding --debug-init isn&#x27;t helpful. Since my package directory is versioned, I git restore it, and it does not help, neither does deleting the ELN cache.
 Then I wipe my package directory and install user selected packages one by one, and everything goes fine until I get to helm-org. Install it, and Emacs fails to start. Restore an older copy of package directory (not using git restore) which does not have it, Emacs starts. This package has been installed for ages without any issues before.
 What is this I don&#x27;t even. Of course for now I fixed my setup with helm-org removed, but how do I get to the bottom of the issue?

                              <span>I defined the following macro to evaluate some expressions after a list of features has loaded, basing it on the with-eval-after-load macro.
 (defmacro with-eval-after-load-all (files &amp;rest body) &quot;Execute BODY after FILES are loaded. FILES is a list; usually it contains feature names, but it can also have file-names, in case a file does not provide any feature. See &#x60;eval-after-load&#x27; for more details about the different forms of the elments of FILES and their semantics. Do not quote the FILES list.&quot; (declare (indent 1) (debug (form def-body))) (let ((output &#x60;(lambda () ,@body))) (while (not (null files)) (setq output &#x60;(eval-after-load ,(pop files) ,output)) ) (print output) ) ) 
 And used it to execute the following in my config:
 (with-eval-after-load-all (&#x27;evil &#x27;undo-fu) (setq evil-undo-system &#x27;undo-fu)) 
 Emacs complains with the following error:
 Debugger entered--Lisp error: (void-variable undo-fu) (lambda nil undo-fu)() eval-after-load(undo-fu undo-fu) elisp--eval-last-sexp(nil) eval-last-sexp(nil) funcall-interactively(eval-last-sexp nil) command-execute(eval-last-sexp) 
 The previous macro evaluates to:
 (eval-after-load &#x27;undo-fu (eval-after-load &#x27;evil (lambda nil (setq evil-undo-system &#x27;undo-fu)))) 
 Why is this wrong? Evaluating the inner eval-after-load works, but evaluating the outer one doesn&#x27;t.

I just create it and have no time to create some xkb config files or analyze it statistically (only intuitively analyzed). I need your advices. Thanks!

                              <span>I have lsp-mode and lps-pyright working on my emacs setup as part of my attempt to get emacs working as a python IDE. I&#x27;ve been using emacs for about a week, and I like it a lot. I have python 3.11.7 installed as part of my Gentoo Linux install. The Gentoo package manager is written in python and I want to maintain a level of separation between my development environments and the package managers environment. To get lsp-mode and lsp-pyright working, I&#x27;ve created a emacs_venv in my ~/.emacs.d/ folder and then pip installed the lsp-server/pyright stuff to that. Then added that environment to my exec-path and set python-shell-virtual-environment-root to that folder. 
 Can I now use direnv to manage project environments? 
 Is there a better way to handle separating the Gentoo environment from an environment that emacs needs while in python-mode?

                              <span>Plane is an open-source alternative to Jira. In less than a year, it becomes the most starred project management tool on GitHub: https://plane.so/blog/how-we-got-to-20k-github-stars
 Collaboration is essential in project management. org-jira is a good solution for that. But Jira isn&#x27;t open source.
 Collaboration is possible using git with people mastering org mode. But for me, org mode isn&#x27;t a generic FOSS project management solution if I should use it in a real situation, because I need use a property solution(Jira) for the collaboration in team.
 ​
 Will org mode community integrate org mode with Plane in futur, or exist already such project in progress?

                              <span>In Orgmode, org-preview-latex-fragment turns $\int_0^x \sin x &#x3D; 0.5$ into an inline LaTeX formatted equation.
 As I under the org-previews-latex-fragment process - Orgmode makes a .tex -&gt; LaTeX makes a .dvi -&gt; dvipng makes a .png.
 But it didn&#x27;t work - at least not without some massaging. emacs 29.1, orgmode 9.6.15, FreeBSD 13. 
 There were 2 problems. 1) LaTeX couldn&#x27;t make a .dvi file, and 2) dvipng couldn&#x27;t make a .png file
 My dirty fixes
  
Orgmode made a .tex file with a line % Package hyperref omitted but hyperref is required by the later line \hypersetup{colorlinks, linkcolor&#x3D;blue, urlcolor&#x3D;bblue} . After inserting \\usepackage{hyperref} into org-format-latex-header LaTeX started making .dvi files.
 Orgmode calls dvipng ../../../tmp/orgtexXXXXXX.dvi - where the number of &quot;../&quot;&#x27;s is based on the directory depth of the PARENT DIRECTORY of my fiddles.org file (I moved the file, but the number of ../ was always one too few) It looks at /usr/tmp not /tmp. After creating a symlink from /usr/tmp to /tmp, dvipng started making png files.
  
I&#x27;m not familiar with Linux, perhaps tmp is in /usr/tmp - but in FreeBSD /tmp is a top level directory. The fix at the moment is a symlink pointing at /tmp from /usr/tmp. Is a little weird though, as LaTeX saves its work into /tmp.
 So, two questions.
  
Is poking a \usepackage{hyperref} into org-format-latex-header the right way to go?
 Is there a orgmode variable used to point dvipng at /tmp rather than at ../../../tmp?
  
I&#x27;m very new to emacs and orgmode, but there seems to be a variable for everything - perhaps I&#x27;m looking in the wrong places

                              <span>Hello Scala fam,
 I am a project manager, but before that, I was a software engineer, mostly working with .NET and later Objective-C/Swift (iOS).
 After 3-4 years as a project manager, I am thinking about ‘going back.’
 Writing software is much more fun than managing projects 😅😀
 So, I would like to learn Scala.
 Besides the book from Odersky and rockthejvm course(s), are there any other resources that I should consider for a beginner?
 Any advice for an ex-software engineer? 🫣
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>Publishing a JAR/package to Github packages using Mill is probably a simple task, but I just can&#x27;t figure out how to do it. 
 I tried the following command, but mill errors out with Code: 401  mill mill.scalalib.PublishModule/publishAll .publishArtifacts --sonatypeUri https://maven.pkg.github.com// --stagingRelease false 
 Can anyone point me to steps I can follow (or a tutorial would be nice) to publish a JAR on Github packages?
 PS: I come from the Python world. Compared to pypi, things in JVM appear very confusing, with terms like maven central, sonatype, ivy, (and to a lesser extent) artifactory and bintray thrown around a lot. (I think) I understand maven-central, as being the de-facto repository (so kind of like pypi) that hosts most of the publicly available packages. I have no clue what others are for, or if I need to learn about them!

                              <span>I observed lately that there is a lot of division in Scala community. There are multiple groups of users, some more vocal than others.
 This is counterproductive as people have different requirements, tastes, styles, and backgrounds.
 In my view, this goes against what Scala stands for, a Scalable language:
 &quot;A programming language designed to adapt to the evolving needs of its users.&quot;
 However, not all users have the same requirements. There is no one solution for everyone.
 Is there a way in 2024 to make the Scala community more inclusive and accept that every group has its pros and cons for the technical choices they make?
 Here are some groups I observed, mainly around async handling:
  
People who try to write everything with IO.
 People who keep using Scala Future.
 People who use plain threads / scala-async / project Loom / direct style.
  
While you may have a preference for one group, we should all agree that there is nothing wrong with choosing one or another. It&#x27;s just a matter of personal preference and the overall requirements and trade-offs.
 It&#x27;s essential to recognise that outside the Scala community, some of these paradigms represent the majority.
 For example, Scala Future behave the same as the Kotlin CompletableFuture, the Java CompletableFuture, the NodeJS Promise.
 What&#x27;s nice about each group is that people coming from Haskell/familiar with IO monad may be at home in group 1.
 People coming from Java/Kotlin/Javascript will be at home in groups 3 and 2.
 People coming from Python will be at home in group 3.
 So, instead of being consumed by division. Can the community be joined by the diversity and cooperation instead?
 It&#x27;s a Scalable language where everyone can be at home. We all have to win with Scala being a multi-purpose language as it was intended.
 Much love to each of the groups, have a wonderful day!

                              <span>In my company they told me to learn scala I tried with courses I was able to graps some concepts but coding them is totally different than python. Sometimes I find hard to remember syntax &amp; every new program feels like new syntax.
 How should I improve myself I don&#x27;t want to give up ?

 This was my random COVID project and after 4 years of feature creep I&#x27;ve finally released it. There&#x27;s still a lot more I have planned and this is intended to be a useful app and not just a for fun project. Hope y&#x27;all enjoy.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been using hls for a while now and I think it&#x27;s great but there&#x27;s one thing that kinda annoys me and I would like to hear if there&#x27;s a reason for this or not: If a fuction is polymorphic, it blows up the amount of information showed when viewing docs (and type info) with hls. Is this simply a configuration thing? 
 ​
 without parametric polymorphism
 with parametric polymorphism
 worst of all, most of the added information is redundant! I think that F# did it correctly here (please ignore the portuguese bits): 
 Visual Studio F#
 In this one you can clearly see the most generic form of the function, but it also has a list of all the parameters and their concrete types.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve come across Porstmann a few times as the &quot;intellectual father of the A-Series&quot;,  the &quot;creator of the DIN formats&quot;, and the creator of A4 in various contexts. I saw that he wrote an interesting looking handbook in the mid-1920s and was curious if anyone has come across or even read it? It looks like it went into three editions up to the 1950s. I&#x27;m not seeing any English translations at present. I suspect it has material on using card indexes as databases and may be focused on business use, but may also have some connections to note taking practices of the time. I&#x27;ve also found several references to Porstmann&#x27;s work and that of George Christoph Lichtenberg which makes me even more curious about the potential note taking connections.

I found impressive how he structures everything from the beginning in notecards and has like his own kind of Zettelkästen where he stores a lot of ideas, plots, characters, backgrounds and everything in between. A similar workflow from the one I&#x27;ve seen taken by Ryan Holiday and Robert Greene.

                              <span>Hi, all,
 Apologies if this post comes off as frustrated. I&#x27;ve just spent the last several hours struggling to make Emacs do what would be a checkbox in any other program, and it&#x27;s really putting a damper on my triumphant return to using it.
 All I want is this:
  
To run the systemd service and have an Emacs daemon in the background.
 For emacsclient (or an alias) called in the terminal to open a new buffer / frame / window / unit / pane / flibflab / whatever the hell in the Emacs GUI to edit the file. And, preferably, to focus the GUI when it does so.
 For the Emacs GUI to use JUST ONE WINDOW (in the desktop environment sense) and not open a separate one unless I explicitly tell it to do that.
 For the KDE .desktop file for Emacsclient to open the GUI if it isn&#x27;t open and focus the GUI i…</span>

                              <span>Hello everyone, I am relatively new to emacs and was tinkering with my config. I planned to make it so p and P use the &quot;0 register so that when I delete things, it doesn&#x27;t mess up my pasting. I wrote two super small functions I want to run instead of the default evil functions and plugged them into general. However, p and P still retain their original functionality. In fact, if I do &#x27;ctrl h k p&#x27; I still see that p is mapped to the evil function. I tried to do a similar remap using evil-define-keymap and got the same result. I would appreciate any tips!

 Default Configuration - User-Defined Titles
 One of the configuration options is the org-alert-notification-title option which allows you to define what your notification title will be. The default value for this is &quot;\org*&quot;* but it can overriden by the user.
 Here is a sample configuration and an example of how it looks like for my TODO and the custom title named &quot;Org Alert Notification&quot;.

                              <span>I have been using Emacs for thirty years now, and I obviously have amassed a fair share of crust in my .emacs file. The following config is something I have probably had for at least 25 years now, and I have no idea who the original author was:
 (defun s-scroll-up () &quot;Make pgup behave better (cursor to first line at start of buffer)&quot; (interactive) (if (condition-case nil (scroll-up) (error &#x27;t)) (goto-char (point-max)) ())) (defun s-scroll-down () &quot;Make pgdown behave better (cursor to last line at end of buffer)&quot; (interactive) (if (condition-case nil (scroll-down) (error &#x27;t)) (goto-char (point-min)) ())) (global-set-key (kbd &quot;&quot;) &#x27;s-scroll-up) (global-set-key (kbd &quot;
&quot;) &#x27;s-scroll-down) (global-set-key (kbd &quot;C-v&quot;) &#x27;s-scroll-up) (global-set-key (kbd &quot;M-v&quot;) &#x27;s-scroll-down) 
 My question is: is this still needed? It seems to me such an obvious &quot;right&quot; behavior that I would have expected Emacs to start behaving this way out-of-the-box with some release since when I first picked up this config, or at the least offer some customization variable. If there is one, I can&#x27;t find it, however. Anyone know of a better way of achieving this? (Not that it kills me to keep it).

                              <span>I&#x27;ve tried various different ways of saving desktops, including Bookmark Plus and the minimal example in the Emacs Wiki. They&#x27;re fine, but I would like to be able to automatically save my desktop every few hours (I use Emacs in daemon mode and basically only close it every 3 weeks or so), rather than manually saving it. Doing (desktop-save-mode 1) seems to have the unfortunate effect of restoring the desktop everytime you restart, unless you explicitally tell Emacs not to.
 Is there an elegant way to have auto-save without auto-restore?
 I have two main ideas:
  
Enable desktop-save-mode, but create a shell alias for emacs --no-desktop. This seems fairly straightforward, and I could even add --daemon to the alias since I almost always use that option as well.
 
Create a timer for one of the desktop save functions, e.g. bmkp-set-desktop-bookmark. I&#x27;m a little unfamiliar with timers in Emacs but this seems like a perfect use-case for them. I could even time-stamp the desktop file name when the save-function is called.
 
 Any thoughts?

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m trying to setup emacs as IDE for my Python projects.
 I&#x27;m coming from pycharm where I can set a remote interpreter located in a docker image, this way I only install my dependencies in the docker image and not locally.
 I&#x27;m trying to achieve the same result in emacs using lsp-mode, python-mode and envrc and using direnv and container-env.
 I have the following .envrc file inside my root directory 
 CONTAINER_NAME&#x3D;localhost:5000/myimage:latest
 CONTAINER_WRAPPERS&#x3D;(python, pylsp)
 container_layout 
 My init.el looks like this
 (use-package lsp-mode
 :ensure t
 :init
 ;; set prefix for lsp-command-keymap (few alternatives - &quot;C-l&quot;, &quot;C-c l&quot;)
 (setq lsp-keymap-prefix &quot;C-c l&quot;)
 :hook (;; replace XXX-mode with concrete major-mode(e. g. python-mode)
 (zig-mode . lsp-deferred)
 (python-mode . lsp-deferred)
 ;; if you want which-key integration
 (lsp-mode . lsp-enable-which-key-integration))
 :commands lsp-deferred) 
 (use-package envrc
 :ensure t
 :config
 (envrc-global-mode))
 (use-package python-mode
 :ensure t
 )
 It seems that envrc is loaded correctly so if I run M-x python I got the right interpreter. But the gotodef and autocomplete with packages that are only installed inside the container is not working.
 What I&#x27;m missing?

                              <span>Hey all, I&#x27;m using lsp-mode for typescript-react.
 
When writing an html attribute then clicking on the right arrow or C-f or C-e or a mouse click, lsp will directly apply a formatting edit, like the following:
 1- By moving the code line about 4 or 5 tabs to the right.
 2- If I didn&#x27;t yet wrote the closing tag, everything will back to its normal place, once I write the closing tag.
 3- If I edited or added another attribute, the same thing happens without the correction.
 
In the messages minibuffer it says:
 &quot;LSP :: Applying 1 edits to &#x60;NewSpaceUpdate.jsx&#x27; ...&quot;
 &quot;Applying 1 edits to &#x60;NewSpaceUpdate.jsx&#x27; ...done&quot;
 
If I click on C-/ it will undo the action.
 
Does anyone know a way to stop this behavior?
  
Thanks.

                              <span>I have a big vanilla config 10,000+ lines with lots of packages. The code is mostly
 spaghetti code of over engineering that I have done at times. Some functions
 I probably don&#x27;t use anymore. Performance is not too bad, I get a decent
 startup time. When problems come I can usually figure out where the
 problem is and fix it. Part of me wants to clean it up because I think I&#x27;m
 going to use Emacs for the rest of my life so might as well but the other part of me says
 if it&#x27;s not broken don&#x27;t fix it. Should I clean it up? Not refactor code,
 just make it more nice and clean. Split into more modules if 
 possible, remove unused functions. What would you do? What does your config look like?

 I&#x27;ve replaced scroll-up/down and recenter-top-bottom commands with their pixel-scroll counterparts and it feels great. I was okay with the old school versions too but this one feels easier for eyes. Also, it will be easier for colleagues to follow where we are at when screen sharing :)

                              <span>Hey everyone, I pretty much gave up learning python and Javascript due to them being being similar enough to one another to confuse me. I have been learning haskell because my mind works more mathematically so i figured i might as well program in a language that is concise with math. I know haskell is used more for industrial and scientific purposes but I am wondering if anyone is using it for more practical everyday purposes like web application dev and or simple desktop applications with a gui. If so, can anyone reccomend some good resources for building simple practical applications with it? Either way I&#x27;m interested to know what types of applications people are building with haskell in the broad general sense. Thanks

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;m new to Haskell and are learning QuickCheck for now. What I knew is to design the property and then it can enable QuickCheck for testing. However, for computation-intensive algorithm function, for example CRC-8 , how do you usually design the property for QuickCheck testing? Is there any tip in how to design the property while using QuickCheck? Thank you

                              <span>Hello. I am trying to write some bindings to a C library called wlroots.
 There is a struct, &quot;wlr_pointer&quot; that contains a nested struct. The struct is declared without a type name inside that struct.
 https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wlroots/wlroots/-/blob/master/include/wlr/types/wlr_pointer.h?ref_type&#x3D;heads
 I am trying to write peek, poke, alignment and sizeOf implementations for the Storable typeclass for these struct types in Haskell.
 I&#x27;m not sure how to do this, because the pattern isn&#x27;t the same as some of the other FFI code that I&#x27;m looking at. Searching the web for a good reference on how to do this was less than pointless, and the Real Word Haskell section on the C FFI didn&#x27;t mention nested structs like this.
 The PR that I made that attempted to do this is here, and I doubt it&#x27;s correct.
 https://github.com/bradrn/wlhs/pull/4 
 I guess what I&#x27;m asking is similar to this SO post https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8099678/haskell-ffi-for-c-recursive-struct-and-union
 Which I didn&#x27;t find at first because of my chosen keywords &quot;anonymous&quot; and &quot;nested&quot;.

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to setup minor modes within a major mode&#x27;s use-package declaration:  (use-package python :hook (python-mode . whitespace-mode) (python-mode . company-mode))  Unfortunately use-package sets up autoloads for whitespace-mode and company-mode from the python package.
 Is there a way that I can disable these autoloads from being generated on a per-hook basis? Or do what I&#x27;m trying to do in a cleaner way?
 The canonical way would be to setup the hooks in the whitespace and company use-package declarations but that&#x27;s counter intuitive: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; (use-package whitespace :ensure nil :hook python-mode)
 (use-package company :hook python-mode) &#x60;&#x60; and even theuse-package&#x60; documentation advertises the following:
  
Allow gathering all the configuration details of a package into one place
  
It makes more sense to me to have something akin to the following instead:  (with-eval-after-load &#x27;prog-mode (add-hook &#x27;prog-mode-hook #&#x27;diff-hl-mode) (add-hook &#x27;prog-mode-hook #&#x27;eldoc-mode) (add-hook &#x27;prog-mode-hook #&#x27;show-paren-mode) (add-hook &#x27;prog-mode-hook #&#x27;flyspell-prog-mode) (add-hook &#x27;prog-mode-hook #&#x27;flycheck-mode) (add-hook &#x27;prog-mode-hook #&#x27;yas-minor-mode) (add-hook &#x27;prog-mode-hook #&#x27;company-mode) (add-hook &#x27;prog-mode-hook #&#x27;electric-pair-mode) (add-hook &#x27;prog-mode-hook #&#x27;electric-layout-mode) (add-hook &#x27;prog-mode-hook #&#x27;display-line-numbers-mode) (add-hook &#x27;prog-mode-hook #&#x27;hl-line-mode) (add-hook &#x27;prog-mode-hook #&#x27;bug-reference-prog-mode))

                              <span>In true Emacs User Shave a Yak fashion, I need to store some credentials I&#x27;ll need for Magit Forge and I would prefer to configure auth-source to pull API tokens from gnome-keyring (as opposed to ~/.authinfo* or ~/.netrc). I&#x27;ve found some blog posts etc on how to do this integration with KeePassXC but not for gnome-keyring. Perhaps someone:
  
knows of an auth-source+gnome-keyring reference I&#x27;ve missed?
 would be willing to share their config snippets?
  
I did ask a couple of LLMs for guidance and, true to their kind, they provided information which was voluminous, detailed, convincing...and 100% BS.
 EDIT: Yes, the official auth-source docs included with Emacs do reference KeePassXC and gnome-keyring and dbus Secret Service. But there&#x27;s not much guidance as to how to stitch things together with that API.

                              <span>Hi all,
 I use the org-alert package to send notifications from my Emacs to my Linux laptop. This package uses the alert package backend to send notifications to my machine.
 My configuration is rather simple:
 (use-package org-alert :ensure t :after org :custom (alert-default-style &#x27;libnotify) :config (progn ;; Setup (setq org-alert-interval 300 org-alert-notification-title &quot;Org Alert Reminder&quot;) (org-alert-enable) ) ) 
 This works well enough on Linux. I made a post a few days ago explaining my setup in which I seamlessly integrate the native GUI Emacs app for Android and my Linux machine. 
 Since I use Emacs on my Android as well I needed to have notifications on Android too. I found it cumbersome to install termux-notifications since I would need to sign and repackage the apk for Termux…</span>

 export GTK_IM_MODULE&#x3D;ibus export QT_IM_MODULE&#x3D;ibus export XMODIFIERS&#x3D;@im&#x3D;ibus 
 But when I type in emacs with ibus and mozc (or sunpinin, ibus hangul plugin), then restart ibus-daemon. I cannot type japanese or chinese anymore in opened emacs windows, the only way make ibus work is running new emacs process.
 I run ibus with &#x60;ibus-daemon -dxr --verbose&#x60;, it show that ibus don&#x27;t capure keypress in emacs windows anymore even when it is new frame, only in new emacs process windows, I could type chineses or japaneses.
 The other apps like chrome, xterm, neovim ... work as normal, the logs in verbose mode show keypress as normal, it seems like ibus hates emacs?
 I search for log but can&#x27;t find anything relate. This is versions number:
 &gt;&gt;&gt;- neofetch Arch Linux x86_64 6.6.7-arch1-1 &gt;&gt;&gt;- yay -Qi emacs ibus Name : emacs Version : 29.1-4 Name : ibus Version : 1.5.29-2 &gt;&gt;&gt;- localectl System Locale: LANG&#x3D;en_US.UTF-8 VC Keymap: (unset) X11 Layout: (unset) &gt;&gt;&gt;- locale -a C C.utf8 en_US.utf8 ja_JP.utf8 ko_KR ko_KR.euckr ko_KR.utf8 korean korean.euc POSIX vi_VN vi_VN.utf8 zh_CN.utf8 zh_HK.utf8

                              <span>Hiya! 
 I would like to share with you all a little package package I&#x27;ve written here https://github.com/JasZhe/window-stool for code context. 
 There&#x27;s a few similar packages out there like lsp/eglot breadcrumbs, treesitter-context, and topsy to name a few but most of them use header-line (or in the case of treesitter-context, a childframe) which is limited to a single line.
 I really liked how context.vim had a sort of &quot;cascading&quot; context style and I didn&#x27;t find anything similar to it so I figured I&#x27;d give it my own shot here. 
 To achieve that, this package uses overlays and so it may not be as performant as others, but I haven&#x27;t experienced too much slowness personally, even on a pretty old 2017 Macbook. 
 It basically constantly moves an overlay to be at the top of the window to act like a pseudo multi-line header-line. I also opted to use a simple indentation based heuristic for figuring out the context as a default. There&#x27;s customization options to specify different kinds of context functions depending on the major mode. I&#x27;ve included a simple one for org-mode using headings. 
 In the future, I might try to add some tree-sitter support when I get a chance to dig into it.
 I named it window-stool cause it acts like a little stool that you can use to glimpse the contents above what your window can normally see.
 I&#x27;ve been using it for a little while, ironing out kinks along the way so hopefully there aren&#x27;t too many issues with others using it, but I&#x27;d appreciate any feedback for problems that crop up. Thanks emacs community!

 An idea is to have irc/erc window running in a background, so when i do:
 emacsclient -c --socket-name&#x3D;irc 
 (ofc i have alias for that) i immediately see an irc window
 i tried putting this in my init.el:
 (if (string-equal server-name &quot;irc&quot;) (progn (same-window-prefix) (erc &#x27;:server &quot;irc.libera.chat&quot; &#x27;:port 6697 &#x27;:nick &quot;idle-servant&quot; &#x27;&amp;interactive-env &#x27;((erc-server-connect-function . erc-open-tls-stream) (erc--display-context (erc-interactive-display . erc)) (erc-join-buffer . window))))) 
 but for some reason it does nothing, even tho &#x60;(string-equal server-name &quot;irc&quot;)&#x60; result is &#x60;t&#x60;

The main problem is that network change/disconnections cause X windows to disappear (which is recoverable) and Wayland windows to become lost and unresponsive. This includes waking from sleep. I wanted to outline the options I&#x27;ve tested.
  
Using the native Wayland Linux App (pgtk build), it is possible to restore the lost window, sometimes, by clicking on the Emacsclient icon but often you just have to kill Emacs which sucks when you have Python/Julia/R REPLs or other buffers open that you want to continue working on. (It was also the case that you could not use Windows snap for managing the window position and size but that was fixed …</span>

 If I have this in my init.el:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; (require &#x27;package)
 (add-to-list &#x27;package-archives &#x27;(&quot;melpa&quot; . &quot;https://melpa.org/packages/&quot;))
 (load-theme &#x27;manoj-dark)
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 then performing this:
  M-: (getenv &quot;TERM&quot;) 
 or this:
  C-x d 
 crashes emacs
 Commenting out the top two lines, or the last line allows the getenv command to work.
 Any ideas?
 EDIT:
 Visiting any file before I perform the getenv allows it to complete successfully The graphical emacs works fine, only when I lauch with -nw does it exhibit this behaviour.

                              <span>Hello! I am using Emacs in Windows. I would like Emacs to write messages (eg stuff that happens in the Messages buffer) to a log file somewhere. I am having trouble figuring out how to do this.
 I am a new Emacs user. What is driving me to do this is that Emacs is sometimes crashing or closing unexpectedly and I would like to know the reason why this happens so I can prevent it.
 I have tried Googling this question, searching in Reddit and the Emacs documentation, and using Chatgpt to no avail. I am clearly missing where this information is, so any help is most appreciated.
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Hi all!
 I recently have started learning emacs. I did the built-in tutorial and followed a couple of SystemCrafters’s “Emacs From Scratch” videos, and I’m facing a dilemma right now.
 Of course, evil-mode is hugely popular and has a lot of support, often being called the best vim emulator. Even SystemCrafters uses it, which to me, is a big vouch for using it.
 However, in reading some other reddit posts about others asking this same question, many people said that it had compatibility issues with some plugins, and relying on vim emulators has always left a bad taste in my mouth from other editors. Also, as a new emacs user, I don’t know how much of the emacs experience changes with evil-mode, and I don’t have the knowledge to be able to thoroughly understand and debug any issues that might come up from using it.
 So, I’m mostly just looking for some affirmation and anecdotes, good and bad, about evil-mode: if it will hurt me as a new user, and generally any heads-ups that could help me. Thank you!!

I would like to remove those with Elisp so that I can use the output for a completion I&#x27;m trying to display in the shell. 
 ​
 Is this possible or do I need to resort to processing the output with another program outside of Emacs like &#x60;sed&#x60;?

When i try to link to that library, it says &quot;Waiting&quot; under the file icon and the circling round indicator is on and it keeps going for a long time -- now it has been over an hour. I suspect I am doing something wrong. The file is perhaps a bit on the large side (~20MB) but I suspect it should not take this long.
Any suggestions would be much appreciated.</span>

                              <span>Pretty new here to the singleton library and currently trying to refactor some code that I previously hacked together using Data.Dynamic. To keep the problem as simple as possible, I&#x27;ve boiled down my application to the following (nonsensical) example:
  data Foo &#x3D; A | B deriving (Eq, Ord) genSingletons [&#x27;&#x27;Foo] class MyConstraint (t :: k) instance MyConstraint &#x27;A instance MyConstraint &#x27;B f :: forall k . (forall (t :: k) . MyConstraint t) &#x3D;&gt; () f &#x3D; () v &#x3D; f @Foo -- this does not work, even though forall (t: Foo) . MyConstraint t 
 Basically, I have some function f which for a given kind k (or at least a given list of types of kind k) needs to know that all types belonging to that kind (or in that list) satisfy some constraint. Conveniently, I can express this using QuantifiedConstraints, and make properly make use of that constraint in the function&#x27;s body. The problem is that I never seem to be able to call that function in a way that it satisfies this quantified constraint, and I don&#x27;t know how to tell Haskell that it does actually satisfy this constraint forall t :: Foo in this case. Any ideas/suggestions?

 I&#x27;m trying to insall ghcid with cabal install ghcid, and have bunch of errors due to lack of modules (see below).
 Didn&#x27;t find any solutions in internet, may be somebody could help me with this?
 Cabal output:

 Scala can be an advanced version of Java. It is more expressive. You can write neat code. All this comes with an acceptable learning curve. Valid choice.
 If you use Scala+Cats, it means you want to do advanced FP. Then why not just use Haskell? Instead of using a tool to turn stones into gold, you can just pick gold...
 And Cats can&#x27;t make pure gold for you, because there is no linting tool in Scala to enforce the purity. Your teammate can still write functions that have side effects. A mix of pure + impure code is confusing and error-prone.

                              <span>I use org-mode for keeping notes, and have used it to plan projects I led in the past. Now I am managing a team of people, each of whom have their own projects, I am struggling to scale it to this task. I use org-journal to keep notes from meetings, org-capture to add my individual todos. I try and tag the meetings with the relevant projects, but meetings are with people, and sometimes people work on different projects. I have been tagging meetings/todos with people&#x27;s names, but recently tried org-secretary to add their names as properties, which seems a nicer idea (cleaner, more organised) but also seems less searchable than tags. 
 I would really like to get
 1. an individual overview, that called up for each person the most recent meeting notes and any todos with their name as a tag or property, and then
 2. an overview of overviews so I can scan through - when did we last meet, any outstanding TODOs (for me) or TASKs (for them), and then dip into the individual overview for each. 
 Ideally I could do this by project too (which would just be another tag), but the people view seems most urgent. 
 Are there any suggestions how I could go about this?

                              <span>I&#x27;m doing some writing in Emacs and I&#x27;m wondering if anyone knows of a package that provides a way to diff two blocks of text, then walk through and accept or reject additions and removals in a granular way, like the track changes functions in major word processors?
 Essentially what I&#x27;m doing is having an LLM proofread for me with ob-chatgpt-shell, paragraph by paragraph. It spits out a whole suggested paragraph, so I&#x27;d like to be able to compare that output to my input and work through the suggestions one at a time.
 Thanks!

                              <span>i&#x27;ve been a neovim user for a couple of years and had a good workflow for python using pylsp with plugins pylsp-ruff and pylsp-mypy and i had configured them to check if there&#x27;s a venv active and use the venv&#x27;s python executable.
 a month ago i started moving little by little to emacs in hopes of making it my main editor for multiple reasons.
 but i haven&#x27;t been able to replicate my config in emacs so i&#x27;ve been using pyright temporarily until i&#x27;m able to configure it correctly.
 here&#x27;s the nvim pylsp config for reference

                              <span>Hello everyone. I suppose the solution to my problem must be fairly easy, but I&#x27;ve only recently started using Emacs for both coding and org mode, and I need some help with my config file.\
 Basically, I have a &quot;.emacs&quot; file that I started configuring through tutorials about a month ago. At the time, all I did was assemble together different elisp snippets from different configurations that I found online and liked. Inevitably, I accidentally created a kind of Frankenstein. My main problem is that I have contradictory information in (custom-set-faces) and (custom-theme-set-faces). Now, when I try to change something, it starts accumulating contradictory information and randomly selecting which one to pick.
 I want to clean up my config file, possibly try literate configuration. The problem is that I fear losing all my current configuration and being left with nothing, having to restart from scratch. Can anybody lend me a hand or share some resources?
 Here&#x27;s my configuration, if you&#x27;d like to take a look. Thanks a lot.

 This does not work, the cursor color is not yellow when Emacs starts. If I evaluate this piece of code after startup, the cursor will shift to yellow. I suspect this is caused by set-cursor-color setting the cursor color for the selected frame, only.
 The documentation for set-cursor-color says;
 You can also set the text cursor color, for all frames, by customizing the cursor face. 
 I have tried to figure out how to do this, without success. How do I change the cursor color for all frames?

                              <span>I would like to rewrite my Emacs config file. Since I started using Emacs, the org file from which I generate the init has become too large and difficult to navigate. Looking at popular configurations, I came to the conclusion that one of the first things I should do is split it into several files. I wonder if people here have any other advice or special know-how they have come across? What do you think are the best practices that lead to a nice tidy config that gets out of the way?

                              <span>Hello,
 The Haskell Foundation Technical Working Group (TWG)  serves as an advisory organization for both the HF management and the Haskell community as a whole, by evaluating specific proposals for projects that can have broad, ecosystem-wide effects. These proposals can be:
  
Community RFCs that seek the community’s input on a project
 Community projects that will be executed primarily by the proposer, but seek administrative or financial support from the HF
 HF projects that a community member would like us to execute
 Other topics of relevance to the community
  
Volunteers wanted!
 We presently have three openings on the working group, and we’re seeking volunteers. Members are expected to attend a monthly meeting, to participate in and moderate discussion threads regarding specific proposals, and to evaluate proposals for their technical merits. From time to time, committee members may also be asked to help a community member revise their proposal. The ability to communicate well and respectfully is important for any potential member.
 These discussions have a real impact on the Haskell ecosystem, so this is an opportunity to give back in a meaningful way.
 If you are interested, or if you know someone who might be, please get in touch with me at director@haskell.foundation! You don’t have to be a long-term Haskeller, or someone who is deeply embedded in Haskell development - we have members with this background already. If you are unsure as to whether you would fit in, please get in touch, and we can have a chat about it. We would like to have members with diverse backgrounds, professional experiences, and knowledge. All self-nominations must be submitted by the end of the day on Jan 12th 2024.

                              <span>I&#x27;m really excited about this idea of how you can maintain referential transparency and still perform real mutations/effects without having to force something into a monad that you can&#x27;t &quot;break out&quot; of.
 In Clean, as in any language, monads are possible, but you are not dependent on them and can get the value back at any time, so the complex combination of different types of monads is unnecessary. Monads in Clean are therefore just a helpful tool to facilitate sequences of computations. In Haskell, however, monads like IO seem a bit hacky with their lots of magic in the background, where only the compiler developers themselves probably know how they actually work. This magic has always irritated me and distorted the idea of monads.
 This brings to mind the idea of creating a resource like a file completely referentially transparent as a mere program object, and manipulating it, just as you can do with numbers or other simple values, without actually causing anything outside of the programming. You&#x27;re just describing the transformations. And only when you actually want to perform all these operations in the real world you add “*World” and continue working with an unique object standing for an entity in the real world.

                              <span>Hi! Haskell noob here. I don&#x27;t know the right terms here so please bear with me if I misuse any terms. Thanks! 
 I am looking for an async programming model like boost asio (the proactor design pattern) in haskell. I am not sure how to articulate it for a web search but essentially what I am looking for is to translate a toy asio server in C++ with callbacks to haskell. 
 I can (and did) implement this using forkIO + Chan but I am curious if the following has a name in haskell.
 type Context mkSocket :: Context -&gt; IO Socket recvData :: Socket -&gt; (Buffer -&gt; IO a) -&gt; IO () runContextFor :: Duration -&gt; Context -&gt; IO () 
 Here, each Context should be able to manage its own event backend (epoll, select, IOCP) without depending on the haskell runtime. Ideally, I should be able to run the event loop every once in a while manually. Am I going in the right direction here?
 In spirit of the X-Y problem, what I am trying to solve is a reader on a socket forkIO $ forever (recvFrom sock 512 &gt;&gt;&#x3D; doSth) should be interruptible and I should be able to interrupt this &quot;blocking&quot; wait on the thread. I guess I can do the following but they don&#x27;t feel clean
  
by closing the socket and forcing an exception on all readers
 set a socket receive timeout and exit the &quot;blocking&quot; wait periodically
 use a System.Timeout.timeout on a read and poll

                              <span>I&#x27;m working on a problem that has a state [Integer], logs a tuple ([Integer], Maybe String) and returns Maybe Integer. If using the transformers library, I&#x27;ll be working with the following type:
 MaybeT (StateT [Integer] (Writer [([Integer], Maybe String)])) 
 However, mtl doesn&#x27;t have a MaybeT. It seems there&#x27;s MonadState instead, but there&#x27;s no documentation on how to actually use it. In fact, I&#x27;ve searched far and wide, and all I see are articles like &quot;let&#x27;s make our own instance of MonadState&quot; or &quot;define MonadState from scratch&quot; followed by some fictitious code. After an hour, I feel like punching in their faces and screaming, &quot;FFS don&#x27;t reinvent the wheel, show me a real example instead&quot;.
 Sorry for the rant, but libraries like mtl and articles like the above are cancer for the Haskell community. The only silver living are the good people in the community, that&#x27;s who I&#x27;ve turned to for help.

                              <span>Hi,
 I am using intellij with sbt and Scala 3.3.1. I want to see the code that an anorm macro expands to: Macros.parser[]. The problem that I have is that, for whatever strange reason, this code triggers a compiler warning: [E029] Pattern Match Exhaustivity Warning for a specific case class.
 I&#x27;ve done some research into compiler options but the options related to macros have been removed in scala 3. See: https://docs.scala-lang.org/scala3/guides/migration/options-lookup.html and search for -Ymacros. 
 Thanks

                              <span>Hello everyone.
 As described in the title, I have problems with table alignment in my org files, as you can see in the following example:
 | 1 | 22 | 333 | 4444 | 55555 | 666666 | 7777777 |
 |------+------+------+------+-------+--------+---------|
 | Data | | | | | | |
 | | Data | | | | | |
 | | | Data | | | | |
 | | | | Data | | | |
 | | | | | Data | | |
 | | | | | | Data | |
 ​
 These are my related settings in ~/.emacs
 ;; Normal text fonts. Both variable and fixed pitch
 (custom-theme-set-faces
 &#x27;user
 &#x27;(variable-pitch ((t (:family &quot;ETBembo&quot; :height 130 :weight thin))))
 &#x27;(fixed-pitch ((t ( :family &quot;Fira Code Retina&quot; :height 130))))
 &#x27;(org-block ((t (:inherit fixed-pitch))))
 &#x27;(org-code ((t (:inherit (shadow fixed-pitch)))))
 &#x27;(org-document-info ((t (:foreground &quot;dark orange&quot;))))
 &#x27;(org-document-info-keyword ((t (:inherit (shadow fixed-pitch)))))
 &#x27;(org-indent ((t (:inherit (org-hide fixed-pitch)))))
 &#x27;(org-link ((t (:foreground &quot;royal blue&quot; :underline t))))
 &#x27;(org-meta-line ((t (:inherit (font-lock-comment-face fixed-pitch)))))
 &#x27;(org-property-value ((t (:inherit fixed-pitch))) t)
 &#x27;(org-special-keyword ((t (:inherit (font-lock-comment-face fixed-pitch)))))
 &#x27;(org-table ((t (:inherit fixed-pitch :foreground &quot;#83a598&quot;))))
 &#x27;(org-tag ((t (:inherit (shadow fixed-pitch) :weight bold :height 0.8))))
 &#x27;(org-verbatim ((t (:inherit (shadow fixed-pitch))))))
 ​
 ;;Trying to fix tables
 (set-face-attribute &#x27;org-table nil :inherit &#x27;fixed-pitch)
 ​
 ;; Set variable pitch as normal
 (add-hook &#x27;org-mode-hook &#x27;variable-pitch-mode)
 ​
 ;; Make me select paragraph size myself
 (add-hook &#x27;org-mode-hook &#x27;visual-line-mode)
 ​
 I tried changing many different settings, but have seen no improvement yet. Even if I force fixed-pitch with M-x, the tables still won&#x27;t align properly. Could someone help me figure out what I&#x27;m doing wrong?

                              <span>Greetings,
I&#x27;ve been getting around the Zettelkasten method for about 2 years, but never dove in.
I&#x27;ve tried several formats.
I&#x27;ve tried a file per each note and numbering it, such as 1.a, 1.a1, 2.a, and so on, but soon all the notes appeared the same to me, and I found hard to detect the paths of the notes
So I&#x27;ve tried a single outline (see the screenshot) because I&#x27;m a visual person, hoping to have a visual clue of the structure of the chains of thoughts, but again I feel confused when I see all of those lines.
Furthermore, I need a fast way to insert the new note into the System, because I have no time to get the extra hour each day in order to review the notes (I&#x27;m always on the rush).
I also tried a kind of PARA method, thinking of the opportunistic strategy, but I fear I&#x27;ll have difficulties when searching for older notes.
Any advice is accepted.
PS: a screenshot of the outline...</span>

                              <span>There are cases when I&#x27;m on mobile and need to interact with entries of my synced org files. The most frequent example is clocking, which I may do on my smartphone but edit other parts of the document on my laptop in the meantime. 
 This may or may not emit a conflict issue on Syncthing side, which does not goes into the details of wheter the edited parts of the document are disjointed or not. So the question: do you use another synchronization technique that is more reliable regarding this aspect?

                              <span>I&#x27;m a non-programmer who uses emacs for writing (a dissertation) and research. Originally I was writing in LaTeX, now I write in org mode.
 I&#x27;ve found org mode to be a great tool for writing but I&#x27;m pretty new to it. I&#x27;m curious how other writers incorporate the task functionality of org mode into the writing process.
 So far, I&#x27;ve kept things separate. So I have my document I&#x27;m writing in (say a chapter) and I have a separate outline in a different document that I add my TODO tags to (see image).
 However, with this method, if I make changes to the writing document outline (which happens a lot), I have to update my tasks document. Is there a way to have the TODO tags in my writing document and be able to see those headlines in a separate buffer?
 Or is the another way you use TODO tags to keep track of writing tasks?
 All advice is welcome.
 ETA: I should also say that I use narrow/widen quite a bit, which I can do with a separate tasks file. Would be interested if other methods can similarly narrow in.

                              <span>hi everyone
 I want org-ellipsis to display the number of subheadings.
 that&#x27;s because of two reasons.
  
I want to add meaning to the decorations. 
 I want to get some information of big picture even if it&#x27;s folded.
  
It&#x27;s something like this: 
 * test (23)
 * testtest (3)
 I think you can understand the big picture of the file faster if you have numbers...
 (I think it&#x27;s useful to display some information individually, even if not just numbers.)
 ​
 So, I tried to implement this.
 I thought of assigning a unique value to ellipsis for individual lines by assigning a conditional value to org-ellipsis.
 but I couldn&#x27;t figure out the conditions to identify the ellipsis displayed on individual lines...
 and I read some code related to org-ellipsis, but I couldn&#x27;t figure out the mechanism to specifically display org-ellipsis.
 (All I found out was that the ellipsis value was stored in something like some archetype when collapsing headings...)
 ​
 if anyone has any hints please let me know !
 Also let me know your thought on the idea of adding information to org-ellipsis. 
 Apologize for my bad English and stupid attempt. thank you for long reading!

I can also see from the log buffer that DAP is being started only with the junit classpath env variable and without the class path to the test class. Note: flymake and lsp-java-build-project are successful. 
 Where/how do I set things up so the correct class path is passed onto DAP?

                              <span>Is it possible to have Magit diffs still be highlighted/colored with font-lock-mode disabled? I prefer no syntax highlighting, but still want to be able to easily read diffs.
 I know it is possible to override faces individually to achieve the same result, but this requires adding new faces consistently.

 (use-package treesit :ensure nil :custom (treesit-language-source-alist &#x27;((c++ &quot;https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-cpp&quot;) (python &quot;https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-python&quot;) (c &quot;https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-c&quot;))) (major-mode-remap-alist &#x27;((c++-mode . c++-ts-mode) (python-mode . python-ts-mode) (c-mode . c-ts-mode))) (treesit-font-lock-level 4)) 
 Though I cannot pin point exactly what I did but for some reason while before I simply got a nil for 
 (treesit-language-available-p &#x27;c++) 
 but now I am getting this for some reason 
 *** Eval error *** Wrong type argument: stringp, nil 
 What is even more confusing that c-ts-mode and python-ts-mode are working fine. 
 Here are my contents of ~/.config/emacs/tree-sitter

                              <span>Over the past decade, pixel density of displays has increased significantly. On Mac, the &quot;Retina&quot; display concept represents a doubling of display density, from ~100 to ~200ppi. On HDPI Retina displays, applications are presented with and work in &quot;virtual&quot; pixels of 2x2 physical screen pixels, so that font sizes, icons, etc. remain &quot;normal&quot;. Then raster, vector and font drawing can make use of all the tiny pixels, for higher quality. My question is, how does Emacs on different systems handle HDPI display?
 My build (emacs-mac) provides some limited support for varying DPI. You can provide parallel high-res versions of image files named like file@2x.ext which are substituted for low-DPI images (without the @2x) automatically. You can similarly embed the text property :data-2x in generated image data. But standalone high density images (like Retina screenshots) must be scaled appropriately (often by 0.5x) to &quot;light all the pixels&quot; and not appear overly large.
 What do other ports do to accommodate high-DPI? Nothing? Do you just select very large font sizes? What if you have multiple displays with significantly different pixel density connected? How is image display handled? This seems like an area where some coherent treatment and documentation would be very helpful. But perhaps the underlying OS/display systems vary so greatly in their treatment of HDPI it limits this kind of progress?

                              <span>I have mentioned on the forum before that I&#x27;ve been working on a personal history for about 3 years.  This is captured in my ZK, in a purposeful way but with random timing.  Each zettel covers one thought or memory and is written following the normal process for producing a pithy, well-considered note.  So far, I have written 35 such zettels covering a variety of topics and all organized (yes, I admit it) using a structure note.
I have let random memories trigger the note writing, which probably explains why the overall process has been, well, random.  Recently, I’ve been thinking I’d like some more discipline and consistency in the process.  You know the saying - be careful what you wish for!

                              <span>Hello All,
 This is my first Reddit post so please let me know if I’ve done anything wrong. 
 I started with no experience in software developing a few years ago into a Scala environment so Scala is all I know. 
 I would say I am at a middle level point and trying to further my knowledge but I am struggling on making my learning efficient as I seem to go round and round reusing the same solutions. 
 Somebody who started with me went through Rock the JVM and he said it was the best thing he done. I’m thinking of starting that. 
 Has anybody got suggestions or recommendations on how to learn new things more effectively? 
 Thanks.

                              <span>Hello everyone, I&#x27;m currently searching a company, which uses Haskell and where I can do a internship. Some information about me: I have graduated in computer science and used to work one and a half years as a junior developer. At the moment I&#x27;m travelling through different countries, but I would love to also learn something related to development. Because I will continue my traveling and it&#x27;s more about learning something new (Haskell and functional programming), I&#x27;m not looking for a long term position, but more an internship. I&#x27;m happy to hear from you guys if you are interested. Greetings Micha😊

 How do I view both parts of the pair with the same lens? How can I write something like p ^. both . _z that will give me (3, 9)?
 (Yes, I know p ^.. both . _z gives [3, 9], but that&#x27;s a list not a pair. I want a pair.)
 (A V3 is a three-dimensional point from the Linear library. It has lenses like _x and _z to work with particular elements, so I can write (V3 1 2 3) ^. _x -&gt; 1 and (V3 1 2 3) &amp; _z .~ 88 -&gt; V3 1 2 88.)

 Haskell is notoriously not very pretty when it comes to tooling and dev-environment.
 What would be, in your opinion, the cleanest way of setting up your toolchain and interacting with it? Consistent, sensible file locations, organized packages, and anything else you can think of.
 We&#x27;re not going to get Cargo, but we can definitely do better than what I&#x27;ve seen a lot of people doing.
 Attempting to use as few tools as possible that accomplish as much as possible. 
 What is your minimalist, sane environment and tooling?

                              <span>Hey all, I was poking around for an answer to this in the LSP and FlyCheck docs, but couldn&#x27;t see it anywhere. When I debug Rust code I don&#x27;t get syntax highlighting under certain inactive code (specifically when statements like #[cfg(target_arch &#x3D; &quot;x86_64&quot;)] appear). I tried adding a line to my .cargo/config to enable these features features but rust-analyzer doesn&#x27;t seem to pick it up. I feel like there&#x27;s a basic option for this, so apologies if I&#x27;ve missed something but I&#x27;m rather new to emacs.

                              <span>So I followed the mastering emacs guide to installing tree-sitter but am left a bit confused about what actually these additional major modes are and have some questions.
  
What is the difference between the installing the package tree-sitter and building emacs with tree-sitter? Which one should I use given both options? 
 Do these new ts major modes serve to replace existing modes or do they sit on-top of the regular modes? So If I was using rustic package for rust development, does rust-ts-mode essentially replace the rustic package or would I still need it? 
 How would you tell emacs to use tree-sitter mode if there are no default major modes for the language to begin with? For example rust or go don&#x27;t have built-in modes like python or bash do so a command like (setq major-mode-remap-alist &#x27;((go-mode . go-ts-mode))) would not work unless you explicitly install the go-mode package.

                              <span>CUDA is a language that, by default is unsupported by treesit in emacs.
 It has a grammar defined in https://github.com/theHamsta/tree-sitter-cuda.
 I have followed https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Tree_002dsitter-Major-Modes.html and https://github.com/renzmann/treesit-auto to come up with the following:
 (use-package treesit-auto :custom (treesit-auto-install t) :config (add-to-list &#x27;treesit-auto-recipe-list (make-treesit-auto-recipe :lang &#x27;cuda :ts-mode &#x27;cuda-ts-mode :url &quot;https://github.com/theHamsta/tree-sitter-cuda&quot; :ext &quot;\\.cu\\&#x27;&quot;)) (treesit-auto-add-to-auto-mode-alist &#x27;all) (global-treesit-auto-mode 1)) (define-derived-mode cuda-ts-mode prog-mode &quot;CUDA[ts]&quot; &quot;Major mode for editing CUDA with tree-sitter.&quot; (when (treesit-ready-p &#x27;cuda) (treesit-major-mode-setup))) 
 Unfortunately, I have problems with the code:
  
When I open a .cu file, it is opened in Fundamental mode
 When I manually M-x cuda-ts-mode, it is enabled but I do not get syntax highlighting
 The CUDA parser is not automatically installed; I had to install it via M-x treesit-install-language-grammar and build the recipe interactively because it didn&#x27;t find my provided recipe
  
What is wrong about the code?
 Thanks and I wish you all a happy new year!
 EDIT: I was able to get syntax highlighting working by calling (treesit-parser-create &#x27;cuda) before (treesit-major-mode-setup) and by deriving from c-mode instead of prog-mode. Is this the correct solution?

 The code is as follows:

 How do you find the best price for items while shopping online? You can go to each website and compare yourself manually. Or let Emacs do the hard work for you!!

 It allows you to code in every language as if it was a lisp and the single feature that is keeping me hooked to intellij. Is there something close/similar in the emacs ecosystem?

                              <span>I always had the scrollbars disabled in Emacs because they kind of stand out in an ugly way and they are visible on every window even if not needed (even in the minibuffer window). As the toolkit scrollbars in Emacs are nevertheless handy, I tinkered a bit to solve both problems: * 1: on-demand-scroll-bar-mode is an alternative to scroll-bar-mode that shows vertical scroll bars only when needed https://github.com/florommel/on-demand-scroll-bar * 2: custom-css allows to load arbitrary CSS snippets to style Emacs&#x27;s GTK widgets. It comes with a dedicated mode to change the scrollbar visuals, as this requires special care. However, you can also adapt all other GTK widgets inside Emacs (menu bar, tool bar, context menus). The package requires a C module to be built and loaded and works only with GTK builds of Emacs. https://github.com/florommel/custom-css
 Both packages are experimental. Of course, they can be used independently from each other.

                              <span>Hello ! I&#x27;ve been learning Scala and FP, currently reading the red book. Is there any of you who use an &quot;non-FP&quot; http framework/library such Akka-http, Cask, Springboot, etc... with an FP core?
 Or you guys use a pure FP library such as http4s (I guess)? 
 I was thinking that using super mature web frameworks like Springboot + using FP for the service layer makes sense. 
 Hopefully this post doesn&#x27;t trigger too much the pure FP devs. I&#x27;m getting started with FP. I have a Java &amp; Python background. I did some Spark jobs in Scala also.

                              <span>Occasionally I have ideas or come across articles/book titles that I know I&#x27;d like to explore further for a given project, but right now is not the right time for them, usually because I&#x27;m in the middle of another task.
I want to:
this project, and not another one, or when I&#x27;m focused on following a different trail in this project).
I&#x27;m curious how you all handle these in your workflow.
Should I drop a zettel with the info in the appropriate place and hope I&#x27;ll resurface it at the right time? My issue here is that I often don&#x27;t know what information is going to come out of the article until I&#x27;ve read it.  Should I just take my best guess? (am I just overthinking it)?
Should I keep it on a separate task list or someday/maybe list?  My issue here is that I almost never get to the things on my someday/maybe list because I&#x27;m never looking at it when I&#x27;m working on a current project, and my task lists quickly get cluttered if they aren&#x27;t immediately actionable.
Other ideas?  Thanks!</span>

                              <span>This is a bit of an outlier, because it is not technically inline with zettelkasten method per se. However, I have found it incredibly useful, and it could be integrated into a zk with a little work I think.
I&#x27;ve started keeping an ongoing document called CHURN. It is organized by indentation, so it can be folded or hoisted to only show relevant sections by the two editors I use on it most frequently (vim and taskpaper). I just dump in there anything I think of, and freely re-organize (move up and down, indent, create headers and groups).  I keep tasks in taskpaper syntax, but essential to the model is the fact that anything can go in. The plan is to weekly move out of that file anything done/no longer relevant into my already-extant Weekly File ([[2023-W52]]),  and if anything develops en…</span>

                              <span>I’m using doom emacs, just out of the box. I’m having trouble with a theming configuration though. I’ve tried both treemacs and neotree and changing the theme I’m using. How do I get rid of that dark sidebar when I open treemacs. In all the images I see online, when they open treemacs, they don’t have that.

                              <span>I have been trying to use EMACS for weeks now, yet the most simple of tasks still elude me. I want to make the editor look good so that I can actually start using it. I love the DOOM Emacs look but don&#x27;t want to use EVIL mode. Additionally, I don&#x27;t like the added complexity.
 My dream is to eventually build my own text editor with very simple features, but for now, I just want to get started using something other than Gedit. Emacs seems right because of the simplicity of setting custom key bindings, and the tables and code output in files.
 I understand that I need a theme.elfile and to place it in a folder. Then, I need to run some code to let Emacs know that the theme is there. However, I can&#x27;t find the theme.el file, and I don&#x27;t know which folder to place the theme in or what command I need to run. Help, please.

 1) I found only vim was available on some severs so just being young and open minded I learned that too
 2) I started using Mac os and never found aquamacs or x11 XEmacs seamless enough (I&#x27;ve tried and failed more than once).
 3) most significantly, emacs pinky crippled me, and MacBooks only have one Ctrl key so I couldn&#x27;t even alternate to give my left pinky a break

                              <span>Coming out of EmacsConf, I&#x27;m converting over to lsp-bridge. Right now I&#x27;m doing mostly golang and WASM stuff and so I&#x27;m trying to figure out how to effectively use lsp-bridge with gopls. Looking at the lsp-bridge docs, it sure looks like gopls is first-class supported. However, I&#x27;m not getting anything lsp-bridge-y when I&#x27;m editing go code.
 Anyone care to share their working config snippet(s) for gopls and lsp-bridge? I would share mine except its such a moving target right now while I&#x27;m trying to get things working that I&#x27;m not sure it would produce productive feedback and probably just confuse folks who read the post a year from now.
 I&#x27;ll make everyone a deal, I&#x27;ll post my config once it&#x27;s resolved however I will warn I&#x27;m a literate config person so it&#x27;d not only be elisp but also some other tooling for making sure all of the Python dependencies etc are installed. I guess folks would be free to copy/paste/modify as they see fit for their setup.
 Thx!

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently using eglot for LSP and markdown-mode to render markdown in eldoc buffer.
 When I click on a link in an eldoc buffer for a rust project, it stops, flashes and then prints progn: Beginning of buffer in the *Message*.
 So, I figured maybe if I turn on toggle-debug-on-error I can find out where the error is happening. But, clicking the link does not trigger the error for debugging.
 So, I decided to put a message call at the beginning and end of the markdown-follow-thing-at-point (which is executed when you click on a link) like this:
 elisp (defun markdown-follow-thing-at-point (arg) &quot;Follow thing at point if possible, such as a reference link or wiki link. Opens inline and reference links in a browser. Opens wiki links to other files in the current window, or the another window if ARG is non-nil. See &#x60;markdown-follow-link-at-point&#x27; and &#x60;markdown-follow-wiki-link-at-point&#x27;.&quot; (interactive &quot;P&quot;) (message &quot;markdown-follow-thing-at-point sos&quot;) (cond ((markdown-link-p) (markdown-follow-link-at-point)) ((markdown-wiki-link-p) (markdown-follow-wiki-link-at-point arg)) (t (let* ((values (markdown-link-at-pos (point))) (url (nth 3 values))) (unless url (user-error &quot;Nothing to follow at point&quot;)) (markdown--browse-url url)))) (message &quot;markdown-follow-thing-at-point sis&quot;)) 
 When I evaluate the defun and then click on the link again, it only prints the &quot;markdown-follow-thing-at-point sos&quot; which might imply that the function broke at some point, but I can&#x27;t see why with toggle-debug-on-error.
 I ideally would like it if it at least open the url in a web browser :(

                              <span>I have recently started using lsp-mode but noticed it forces one to install (and use?) yasnippet. I switched from yasnippet to templ a long time ago, and I don&#x27;t want to go back to the former.
 Can this be done?

 Is it possible to create blocks like this:

 It has become more important as I now have to use a password and I can&#x27;t have the password appearing in the file.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve mainly been using Vim and Jetbrains for the past several months. My favorite programming streamers are using emacs and I like the potential of emacs being an all around editor for any kind of usage, as well as its customizability. I&#x27;ve started learning the keybinds through the built in emacs tutorial. But I&#x27;m just wondering, if I&#x27;m wanting to be a true power user, do I need to become proficient at elisp?

                              <span>Wolfram Mathematica can apparently function as an lsp server now https://github.com/WolframResearch/LSPServer and the official notebook editor gives the user a dexterity of code manipulation on par with notepad, so I put 2 and 2 together and attempted to make emacs use the lsp server with mixed results.
 I simply took the command to start the lsp server from the wolfram plugin of vscode and added it to eglot like
 (add-to-list &#x27;eglot-server-programs &#x27;(&#x27;xah-wolfram-mode &quot;/usr/local/Wolfram/Mathematica/13.3/Executables/WolframKernel&quot; &quot;&#x60;kernel&#x60;&quot; &quot;-noinit&quot; &quot;-noprompt&quot; &quot;-nopaclet&quot; &quot;-noicon&quot; &quot;nostartuppaclets&quot; &quot;-run&quot; &quot;Needs[\&quot;LSPServer&#x60;\&quot;];LSPServer&#x60;StartServer[]&quot;)) 
 With this, the eldoc and the flymake integration part of eglot works, but I&#x27;m not getting most of the rest of the functionality, in particular &#x27;completion-at-point&#x27;.
 I also tried adding the same lsp server command to lsp-mode instead of eglot, but that just didn&#x27;t work at all.
 (add-to-list &#x27;lsp-language-id-configuration &#x27;(xah-wolfram-mode . &quot;wolfram&quot;)) (lsp-register-client (make-lsp-client :new-connection (lsp-stdio-connection &#x27;(&quot;/usr/local/Wolfram/Mathematica/13.3/Executables/WolframKernel&quot; &quot; &#x60;kernel&#x60; &quot;&quot; -noinit&quot; &quot;-noprompt &quot; &quot;-nopaclet&quot; &quot;-noicon&quot; &quot;-nostartuppaclets&quot; &quot;-run Needs[\&quot;LSPServer&#x60;\&quot;];LSPServer&#x60;StartServer[]&quot;)) :activation-fn (lsp-activate-on &quot;wolfram&quot;) :server-id &#x27;wolfram) 
 Does someone have any idea how to troubleshoot this? I&#x27;m really more interested in the eglot route because that is what I use otherwise. I do completion with corfu and it works in the languages that eglot supports by default. The problem is that I&#x27;m not really getting any error messages even with everything in &#x27;eglot-strict-mode&#x27; turned on, so I have no idea what else to try.

                              <span>Hello Haskell community,
 I&#x27;m currently working on a Haskell project and have come across a challenge I hope you can help with. I&#x27;ve written several instances of functors in my source code, and I&#x27;m looking for an efficient way to ensure they comply with the Functor laws.
 Up until now, I&#x27;ve manually written tests for this purpose. You can see an example in my GitHub repository here: HaskellRank Functor Tests.
 Additionally, here&#x27;s how I&#x27;ve been running these tests:
 (base) dewi@DewiJones:~/code/hask_tacer/hask-tracer2$ stack test --test-arguments&#x3D;&#x27;--match &quot;/HaskellRank.HaskellRankJson/&quot;&#x27; hask-tracer2&gt; test (suite: spec, args: --match /HaskellRank.HaskellRankJson/) HaskellRank.HaskellRankJson Your Test Suite should pass the Functor Identity Law [✔] +++ OK, passed 100 tests. should pass the Functor Composition Law [✔] +++ OK, passed 100 tests. Finished in 0.0084 seconds 2 examples, 0 failures hask-tracer2&gt; Test suite spec passed 
 While this approach works, it&#x27;s quite manual and time-consuming. I&#x27;m wondering if there&#x27;s a tool or a feature in GHC/Stack that can automatically scan all functor instances in my source code and check if they adhere to the Functor laws. Any suggestions or advice on how to streamline this process would be greatly appreciated!
 Thank you in advance!

                              <span>I want to link my Haskell code to a VC++ static .lib. Wondering if there is any advice/documentation on how to approach achieving this.
 Linking to C code works fine, but with C++ I get a bunch of &quot;undefined symbol ...&quot; spit out by ld.lld.exe during cabal build. Using dumpbin.exe I can see the symbols are present in the lib I&#x27;m trying to link to. So I assume this is C++ ABI incompatibility MSYS2 and VC++.
 Can I somehow configure my build to use the VC++ ABI when building my Haskell code?

 1) Stack on top of cabal, with optional hpack
 2) YAML???
 3) ghcide compiled against GHC 8.6.5, but currently using...
 4) One part of code has incorrect syntax, everything after doesn&#x27;t get hls coverage
 5) Stack can&#x27;t compile because it doesn&#x27;t know what version of a package to use

                              <span>Recently, I&#x27;ve been taking notes in org-mode for particle physics. Although simple LaTeX input for equations works very well, it would be nice to also have an easy way to have Feynman diagrams as inline images programatically. I have tried the LaTeX route with feynmp and tikz-feynman which does not work. I am not exporting to LaTeX most of the time, albeit even then it does not seem to work.
 Does anyone have a good workflow?

                              <span>This release brings Iron support for several libraries and other minor features.
 What is Iron?
 Iron is a library for refined types in Scala. You can attach predicates (also called &quot;refinements&quot;) to type and ensure they pass at compile-time or runtime:
 scala val x: Int :| Positive &#x3D; 5 val y: Int :| Positive &#x3D; -5 //Compile-time error val z: Either[String, Int :| Positive] &#x3D; -5.refineEither //Left(&quot;...&quot;) 
 Check the README for further information.
 Main changes
 Doobie &amp; Skunk support
 You can use Iron types in your query and tables. Here is an example using iron-doobie:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;scala import doobie.* import doobie.implicits.*
 import io.github.iltotore.iron.* import io.github.iltotore.iron.constraint.all.* import io.github.iltotore.iron.doobie.given

 Came up with: https://github.com/cachix/websockets-simple
 Note that it requires a bunch of changes currently scheduled for websockets 0.13.

                              <span>Recently I figured out a pattern for quickly creating record parsers that utilises generics and HKTs: Parsing Recipe Pattern. I haven&#x27;t seen it before, and I think it might be useful and interesting to people, so I&#x27;m sharing it. I&#x27;m also curious to see if people in the community have thoughts about it.
 ​
 TL;DR I didn&#x27;t like how Cassava/Aeson forced me to proliferate newtype wrappers for different kinds of date formats. The recipe pattern is about allowing me to specify different date parsing formats for each record type without newtype wrappers and keep generic derivation of record parsers.

 it &quot;gets the chapter name&quot; $ do Chapter.name chapter &#x60;shouldBe&#x60; &quot;Protection of Children from Abuse and Neglect&quot;

 Hi, for the life of me I can&#x27;t figure how to use Memotrie or any other method to memoize, say, an HTML parsing function. I want to memoize it so I can write a bunch of Hspecs without re-parsing the HTML for each spec.
 IOW, I need a memoized test fixture. There used to be something on the Hspec site but it was removed.
  
Somehow I accidentally deleted the rest of my post. The important stuff is up there. :-P

Windows 11, Emacs master branch built last week, latest &#x60;master&#x60; eglot (via &#x60;straight.el&#x60;). Unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t reproduce with a simplified init.el, so let me just describe what&#x27;s happening in case someone has any ideas:
 Error:

 It&#x27;s happening in &#x60;jsonrpc-events-buffer&#x60;, and I notice that there is no eglot events buffer in my emacs. (&#x60;eglot-events-buffer&#x60; says it can&#x27;t find an Eglot events buffer.)
 &#x60;clangd&#x60; does start OK from the cmd line, as does my python language server.
 I&#x27;m not sure where to dig in to debug it.
 The traceback looks like this (lightly edited for readability):

                              <span>Hi all,
 First, a little backstory.
 I have started getting interested in note-taking and knowledge bases about a year and a half ago. I first stumbled upon Notion, but quickly abandoned it due to its online-only nature. Then I started looking at alternatives like Obsidian and Logseq. Logseq caught my attention since it provided some nice features like daily journaling and &quot;Everything is a node&quot; strategy. I liked it. Then I learned that it was a watered down version of Emacs&#x27;s org-mode. That is when I started looking into Emacs. This was a year ago.
 I fell in love instantly. It was mind boggling to me that you could change anything and nothing was off limits. This was a year ago and I still change things on a daily basis. I think I may have fallen into the rabbit hole of endless customiza…</span>

                              <span>Hello there!
 It&#x27;s been a while since I&#x27;ve wanted to share my personal Emacs configuration. Either because I managed to configure something and someone needed help (like typescript on a React environment) or I needed help doing something and I was &quot;afraid&quot; of sharing it.
 Unfortunately my dotfile (yes, it was a ~/.emacs file) was ugly, old, slow and full of personal stuff.
 I managed to make it faster (0.6 seconds loadtime with ~95 packages on Linux), somewhat organized and (I hope) free of personal stuff.
 This config focuses on having the SAME (or close) user experience on both TUI and GUI. 
 Nowadays you can do things on tmux, for example, and you want to use Emacs as a sole editor with &#x60;emacs -nw&#x60; (the same fashion Neovim users do), others times you may want Emacs also as your terminal emulator and project organizer, you may want to start several instances of Emacs for gnus, ERC or other stuff, on either TUI or GUI. This config aims this situations, so nothing should be missing from GUI to TUI. You can even start it as a daemon and use at the same time on terminal and GUI without breaking anything.
 On this screenshot we have TUI (left) and GUI (right):
 https://preview.redd.it/esot9k1zw89c1.png?width&#x3D;2880&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;c338016527f3c76f235c6e848d6db63759f5202f
 It is made in a single file, using as much of default Emacs as possible, so you can fork it, customize or get inspired. It is not, by any means an &quot;Emacs Distro&quot;.
 I&#x27;d love some nice feedbacks (preferably on Github issues so we can track and reuse issues).

 But now, since I&#x27;m using pyenv consistently (instead of homebrew flavors of python that sometimes used to be summoned), I have another problem: whenever there is output in the shell, there is no newline after it.

                              <span>I actually just found out about Schema Costco (I live in the Eye of the Sahara, so you know). I did see references to the Schema Store in the VSCode LSP sources awhile back. I can&#x27;t quite recall whether I was looking into Ansible LSP or just the standard VSCode Template ... but I /was/ reading tens of thousands of lines of typescript (as one does when configuring LSP servers based on that template). When I saw it, I assumed I just needed to download the schema files one at a time and put them somewhere (we live in schema poverty out here in the Sahara).
 In case anyone is wondering, this configuration seems to work for yaml-language-server ... which does have telemetry by the way. Make sure you thank your friendly Fully Corporate Open Source developers for helping us privacy-focused indivi…</span>

                              <span>I am trying to show a &quot;save&quot; icon in the mode line, but the character shows up incorrectly:
 All the displayed icons are the same \&quot;save\&quot; icon. Note the wrong icon next to \&quot;test.el\&quot; file name. The icon only shows correctly in the lower scratch buffer.
 When invoking C-u C-x &#x3D; I see this:
  position: 4 of 7 (43%), column: 3 character:  (displayed as ) (codepoint 57697, #o160541, #xe161) charset: unicode-bmp (Unicode Basic Multilingual Plane (U+0000..U+FFFF)) code point in charset: 0xE161 syntax: w which means: word category: L:Strong L2R, j:Japanese to input: type &quot;C-x 8 RET e161&quot; buffer code: #xEE #x85 #xA1 file code: #xEE #x85 #xA1 (encoded by coding system utf-8-unix) display: by this font (glyph code): mac-ct:-*-Hannotate TC-regular-normal-normal-*-13-*-*-*-p-0-iso10646-1 (#x8AA8) 
 It looks like it uses &quot;Hannotate&quot; as a font, which seems incorrect. However I am not sure how to change this.
 What I have tried or looked at:
  
I have both all-the-icons and nerd-icons fonts installed with their respective commands. I also don&#x27;t think this is the issue as I can see the correct icon in the scratch buffer.
 I have tried the solutions suggested in this reddit thread. However, it doesn&#x27;t work for me. I also tried to do (set-fontset-font t &#x27;unicode (font-spec :family &quot;all-the-icons&quot;) nil) (i.e. without &#x27;append), and whilst this works for the mode-line it messes up my icons in other places (e.g. dired buffers) as well. 
 Related to the thread above, I also don&#x27;t have any set-fontset-font in my config, nor any mention of unicode. So I don&#x27;t think I am changing any fonts in my config in this regard.
 
 I have looked at other similar reddit threads as well, and despite there being many on this topic there hasn&#x27;t been a solution that has worked so far.
 For whatever reason, the same config works on my other laptop which is also a Macbook with the same Emacs installation.
  
If it matters, I am on MacOS using emacs-plus (29.1).
 Any help is appreciated!

There’s one thing I haven’t found an answer to: is it possible to pass selection keys to a transient prefix, similarly to how selection keys can be passed to org-capture? If yes, how? Thanks!

                              <span>Hello, just today I&#x27;ve started learning Emacs and I have some problems.
 I&#x27;ve downloaded Doom Emacs and configured so it would have support for JavaScript, Python, Rust, and Web, but when I run the command doom doctor it tells me:
  &gt; :lang python ! Couldn&#x27;t find black. Code formatting will not work. ! Couldn&#x27;t find pyflakes. Import management will not work. ! Couldn&#x27;t find isort. Import sorting will not work. ! Couldn&#x27;t find pipenv. pipenv support will not work. ! Couldn&#x27;t find nosetests. Running tests through nose will not work. ! Couldn&#x27;t find pytest. Running tests through pytest will not work. &gt; :lang web ! Couldn&#x27;t find tidy. Code formatting in HTML modes will not work. ! Couldn&#x27;t find stylelint. Linting for CSS modes will not work. There are 8 warnings! 
 This are things that I have in my system, for example: 
 kelisei@Debian:~/.emacs.d$ pip list | grep black black 23.12.1 kelisei@Debian:~/.emacs.d$ npm -v tidy 9.2.0 
 I&#x27;ve tried searching but no one seems to have this particular error, some info that would be relevant:
  
Python version: 3.12.1
 Distro: Debian 12 
 NPM version: 9.2.0
 I&#x27;ve installed it from the package manager: emacs-gtk/stable,now 1:28.2+1-15 amd64 [installed]
 Thank you!

                              <span>I know that most people who are using Emacs do not care about emojis, but for people that do and that are, additionally, on Windows, I wanted to make it easier to find the solution. 
 I&#x27;ve decided to write a separate post for the ease of searchability for people who wonder the same. 
 Special thanks to u/eli-zaretskii for guiding me through this problem. Original post is here 
 First it&#x27;s important to note that as of today , on Emacs 29.1, it is NOT possible to have a colored emojis in Emacs. However it is possible to have black-and-white emojis, so here is a guide. 
 First make sure you have the right version. Open Emacs and check the version with: M-x version RET 
 If you don&#x27;t have 29.1 or later, please update by downloading the newest version from the official website.

Swimming with Ideas
This is another installment of the What Are You Working On? thread. Please be courageous and add to this thread by telling us what is happening in and around your ZK journey. Join the community and enlighten us about your knowledge path trajectory. I do this for selfish reasons. It helps me clarify my goals and visualize my thinking. And sometimes, a conversation sparks an idea worth exploring. This is an invitation to you to up your participation in the discussion.
Ideas I&#x27;m exploring with my ZK:
Tags can either be used to categorize notes or give an idea of the note&#x27;s theme. My subatomic is a short summary or theme that replaces a theming tag. Tagging is unnecessary overhead.  Tag for note status and grouping only. Let structure notes and linking dominate.
Web Historical Trails breadcrumbs, GPS adventure breadcrumbs, and how the metaphor can be applied to how I explore my journey with life.
Focusing attention is a skill much like wood carving. Focusing takes time to develop. It can be learned. There are better and worse ways to practice. A mentor boosts progress. This habit is susceptible to the usual biases—especially the Dunning-Kruger Effect.
Things I&#x27;m reading:

Garmus, Bonnie. Lessons in chemistry. 2022.

The &quot;My rolling ten-day zettel production&quot; is produced by a script for attachment to my daily journaling template. I do my journaling in Bear to keep personal journaling separate from my knowledge work.
Let me know if you would like to discuss any of these notes.

                              <span>Hi, everyone! I&#x27;m so glad to have discovered this forum.
A question has been nagging me ever since I started my ZK journey, and that is: what do I do if I&#x27;m into multiple topics?
My interests are all over the place: I&#x27;m into photography, sociology, history, theology, philosophy, linguistics, and education.
I am not sure whether I should have one giant slip box for everything or multiple ones for topics that have stuff in common. But that would also raise a conundrum. I&#x27;m into photography, and I&#x27;m into art history, so those two topics could be in one slip box. But then I&#x27;m also into history in general, so should art history be a part of the box with history or photography? Again, this is just an example, not an actual dilemma.
I&#x27;m going through Ahrens&#x27; book but I don&#x27;t know if it will touch on this particular topic. He does mention that Luhmann wrote on all sorts of subjects, which seems to indiciate he had a single slip box system for everything.
Has anyone here dealt with this?</span>

 Elisp doesn’t use namespaces or private variables. This means you’re basically living in the Wild West. The only thing that prevents constant name collisions is that people are responsible about naming everything with appropriate prefixes.
 EDIT: The specific use-case I&#x27;m considering is color-coding tabs for buffers. I know there are a couple packages that support tabs for buffers, and I&#x27;m currently using centaur-tabs. However, centaur-tabs has no color-coding options. I anticipate it will take a decent amount of work (and a better understanding of emacs/elisp than I have now) to achieve the color-coding that I want. However, the actual point of connection with centaur-tabs will likely be pre…</span>

How to get lsp-treemacs-symbols to start whenever a project is opened up. 
 the same for treemacs
 how to close the symbols windows 
 getting a summary window to show all the errors and their location
 adjust the side window positioning
  
Thanks for any tips / how you have configured things.

 Output:
 CREATE TABLE test ( id INT PRIMARY KEY, the_name VARCHAR(255) ) 
 Notice how spaces are added between id and int to match alignment of the line below it.
 I tried the following packages, without success:
  
sqlformat (cli tool)
 prettier (with sql plugin)
 sql-indent
 format-sql
 sqlformat
  
None seem to do what this web based tool does: https://www.dpriver.com/pp/sqlformat.htm
 Any suggestions?

                              <span>Hi! 
 I&#x27;m having a weird behavior in my config where all my agenda files are showing at once at random moments, interrupting my workflow when I&#x27;m writing or programming. 
 I would like to know what commands are executing Emacs, on live. Maybe I can catch the problem (my guess is a hook or some advice function) and see how to solve it. 
 I tried view-lossage, but it doesn&#x27;t show anything useful. 
 Is anyone else experienced something similar?
 Thanks.

 This a bit different than my GTD + Emacs video but I still use both regardless.
 Let me know what you think. Thanks!

                              <span>Hi!
 I know there have been a few posts on eglot setup lately, but had trouble making things work as they should using all the advice there.
 Briefly, I was able to make eglot work for built-in package such as &#x60;os&#x60; or &#x60;sys&#x60; (though not consistently), but was never able to make completions work for installed packages (such as numpy or pandas). 
 I strongly suspect that the lsp server is not using the right Python version (I tried all servers, pyls, jedi, etc.). How can I coerce eglot and the underlying server to use the right Python version, and to load the right PYTHONPATHs? 
 In general, I use pyenv, and I use 
 (setq python-shell-interpreter &quot;/Users/$USER/.pyenv/shims/ipython&quot; 
 python-shell-interpreter-args &quot;-i --simple-prompt&quot;)
 ​
 Thanks for the help!

                              <span>Hello everyone, happy end of the year.
 I&#x27;m wondering why I keep coming back to custom code snippets on StackOverflow whenever I need to colorise a buffer that has ANSI colours in it. Here&#x27;s a sample from a Rails app:
  Parameters: {&quot;id&quot;&#x3D;&gt;&quot;27&quot;} [1m[36mUser Load (1.0ms)[0m [1m[34mSELECT &quot;users&quot;.* FROM &quot;users&quot; WHERE &quot;users&quot;.&quot;id&quot; &#x3D; $1 ORDER BY &quot;users&quot;.&quot;id&quot; ASC LIMIT $2[0m [[&quot;id&quot;, 2], [&quot;LIMIT&quot;, 1]] ↳ app/controllers/application_controller.rb:27:in &#x60;set_establishment&#x27; [1m[36mEstablishment Load (0.7ms)[0m [1m[34mSELECT &quot;establishments&quot;.* FROM &quot;establishments&quot; WHERE &quot;establishments&quot;.&quot;id&quot; &#x3D; $1 LIMIT $2[0m [[&quot;id&quot;, 2], [&quot;LIMIT&quot;, 1]] 
 Are ANSI escape sequences trickier than they seem? I&#x27;m going to resort to a custom bit of code (thank you people of StackOverflow) but I was wondering why log-view-mode or compilation-mode don&#x27;t have it built-in?

I think I&#x27;m facing the issue when using a dark theme. I&#x27;ve identified that setting shr-use-colors to nil mitigates my problems but I only want to do that under the &#x27;mu4e:view&#x27; mode. I&#x27;m still pretty new to emacs and just getting my hands dirty with elisp and need some help achieving this. Can someone point me to the right docs? FWIW, I&#x27;m using doom emacs configs but should be able to understand any generic approach to solving this and apply it to my configs.

                              <span>In the documentary Kevin Hart &amp; Chris Rock: Headliners Only (Netflix, 2023) while preparing for a portion of their tour, Kevin Hart admires a portion of Chris Rock&#x27;s stand up comedy method and calls it &quot;a science&quot;. Chris Rock writes headlines for his jokes on slips of paper and then arranges them on either tables or small bulletin boards to outline his set list for presenting jokes for his performances.


If there are interesting contemporaneous news items which appear, he&#x27;ll include a newspaper or other material to represent the related joke for inclusion into his set. This makes a fascinating means of outlining his material and seems to fall within the realm of my search for zettelkasten output processes. Even if Rock doesn&#x27;t use index cards to write or store his jokes like comedians in the past have, he&#x27;s using a slip-based method for outlining and arranging them as part of his output process.

Kevin Hart: Chris, I&#x27;m so... I&#x27;m so, uh blown away by what I&#x27;m discovering that is your process.
Chris Rock: My process.
Kevin Hart: This all your shit?


Chris Rock: Well, this here would be, uh, bullet points for tonight. Every card represents a joke or a reference that I choose. I don&#x27;t wanna forget. You know what I mean? Like, you can remember all your jokes, but some nights, I&#x27;m like, &#x27;ehhh, I&#x27;m not gonna close with this one. I&#x27;m gonna close with that one&#x27;.
Kevin Hart: You have it down to a science where you can bullet point the time.
Chris Rock: You can. And by the way, sometimes, something happens in the news.
Kevin Hart: You got jokes on the bench.
Chris Rock: I have jokes on the bench.

Kevin Hart: I&#x27;m going to tell you I&#x27;m not only impressed by that, but I&#x27;m disappointed in myself. Because, uh, whatever I got, got to to fly.

                              <span>I&#x27;m about a month into my emacs adventures with a primary focus with using it for org documents. I am on MacOS and use doom emacs currently as my distro. 
 When exporting with LaTeX pdf I get: &quot;zsh:1: command not found: pdflatex&quot; in my Org PDF LaTeX Output buffer. LaTeX is installed on my machine and the export works fine from terminal emacs (emacs -nw) so from what I&#x27;ve read this is likely a PATH issue. However, the whole setting a PATH so that emacs can see where LaTeX is is over my head with my current knowledge as I have little experience in terminal. 
 Is anyone able to explain how to go about letting emacs see where LaTeX is installed? Or maybe insight into a solution if this isn&#x27;t the issue?
 I know where pdflatex is by running &quot;which pdflatex&quot; in terminal but do not know next steps.
 Thanks!

                              <span>I like the idea of browsing command line help from --help, and similar options, with a similar user interface to info or man pages in Emacs.
 I&#x27;ve written a small package to do this called noman (no-man). It works well for kubectl and aws, but I haven&#x27;t tried it on a wide range of other programs (these are my main use cases). 
 This is my first attempt at writing an Emacs package, so I&#x27;d appreciate any feedback people have, especially on things like:
  
Elisp coding style.
 Emacs package conventions.
 Package usability, and any problems you might find.
  
Thanks in advance! 🙏

                              <span>Hey there, I would like to get some autocompletion working in customization buffer.
 Lets say I have this emacs lisp snippet:
 (defcustom my-file-custom-variable &quot;/home/user/my-file.txt&quot; &quot;Path to my file.&quot; :type &#x27;file) 
 Emacs manual(https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Simple-Types.html) mentions this about the file widget type:
  
The value must be a file name. The widget provides completion.
  
But I cannot get my emacs to perform autocompletion on file path. Is there something wrong with my elisp snippet? is there any key binding to trigger autocompletion? Is there some additional setup required for autocompletion in customize buffer? Or do I simply misunderstand the emacs manual?

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to rebuild my configuration file from scratch since emacs has been taking 3 seconds to load.
 When starting emacs -Q, it starts in the 0.3 seconds I would expect.
 But when moving my .emacs away to like dot-emacs-bak and starting emacs, it still takes 1.1 seconds to load. The *Messages* buffer is empty in that case.
 C-h v user-init-file shows .emacs in all cases
 Starting emacs seems to load some things that are not in my ~.emacs file.
 How can I find out what that is and disable it?

Why do we have this difference in behavior?

                              <span>I&#x27;m talking about row level multi tenancy, where each row in your relational database has a tenant_id column. You could solve this by using different schemas or database or whatever else but we have Haskell at our disposal, so let&#x27;s focus (but not constrain) the discussion on that.
 The goals are:
  
Make it very hard (but maybe not impossible) for tenants to access each other&#x27;s data
 End up with a convenient interface
 Use an already established DB library
  
I&#x27;ve worked on a few projects with such multi tenancy and have never really been &quot;satisfied&quot; with how we&#x27;ve done this.
 Project 1 used template Haskell to generate &quot;repository&quot; code that had the filtering built-in. We were lucky enough that for our usecase this was fine. TH was not very pleasant to use and the approach is rather limiting.
 Project 2 was simply relying on the developers to not forget to add the appropriate filter.
 Project 3 uses a custom database library that has quite a lot of type level wizardry but it basically boils down to attaching the tenant id filter at the end of each query. The downside is that we basically need to reimplement everything that already exists in established DB libraries from scratch. Joins are a pain so we resort to SQL views for more complicated queries.
 Is there an established way people go about this? Maybe some DB libraries already can handle it?

                              <span>I&#x27;m working on the graph problems from the famous Ninety-Nine Haskell Problems. Most of the problems involve searching/traversal of the graph, and I&#x27;m pretty confused about how to approach the solutions idiomatically. I&#x27;m looking for some help in evaluating one the following options:
  
Basic recursion: Pass the state around during recursive calls, and use if-then-else to prune/terminate as necessary. This is the simplest choice, but results in similar-looking boilerplate code. 
 Same as above but using the State monad.
 Model a search problem as a tuple of (start value, expanding frontier function, terminating condition), and provide implementations of the 2nd and 3rd items for each algorithm. This model is shown here and looks promising in reducing boilerplate.
 Read a novel academic paper, like Structuring Depth-First Search Algorithms in Haskell or Backtracking, Interleaving, and Terminating Monad Transformers and come up with an implementation. FWIW, it seems like the Data.Graph library implementation is based on the former paper (but for the purposes of the exercise I shouldn&#x27;t use).
 Logic and Continuation: This option is mentioned in passing in some places but there is exactly zero online literature available as far as any practical examples go. None whatsoever. I don&#x27;t even know why would I choose this option, other than it potentially reducing boilerplate. The H-99 problems aren&#x27;t for infinite graphs, and ask for all answers, not the first one, so, fairness/interleaving isn&#x27;t really a concern.
  
A somewhat related question had been asked before, although it focussed on a specific advent of code problem and lacked the research I&#x27;ve laid out above. Nothing against the question, just saying that the comments there don&#x27;t preempt my question.
 What would be the most elegant option? If there&#x27;s one that&#x27;s not listed above, please do tell.

The time between the solstice and the new year is a time for introspection, reflection, and gratitude. It&#x27;s a time to look back on the year that has passed and think about what we have learned and achieved. And more importantly, it&#x27;s a time to look forward to the new year and set intentions for ourselves.
I am grateful for the inspiration I receive from your posts and comments and for seeing what you are studying. We can brainstorm, debate, and explore new ideas together. By doing so, we can push the boundaries of our thinking and gain a deeper understanding of the world around us.
A forum post can be the starting point for a stream of ideas.
Thank you, everyone. (Including, you transient lurkers.)</span>

                              <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;ve been using org-roam for a while now, but I recently started to go a bit deeper with customization and wanted your opinion on my current workflow and possible ways to automate and improve it.
 Basically, I&#x27;m trying to use org-roam as an issue tracker with issue, task and time management, similarly to tools like redmine.
 Currently my workflow is as follows:
  
I have an issues.org file containing all issues and their state (TODO, STRT, etc.)
 Every time a new issue comes in, I add it to that file and assign an id with &#x60;org-id-get-create&#x60;
 For that new issue, I also create a new org file specific to that issue to track description, comments, etc. and roam-link the original TODO item to it
 I use org-roam-dailies to then reference the TODO item from issues.org, clock spent time and add tasks as sub items.
  
This is working mostly fine for me, I&#x27;m able to build precise monthly reports over the issues I&#x27;ve been working on, however, there&#x27;s a bit of a &quot;disconnection&quot; between dailies and the overall issues file.
 As the issue state is only recorded in issues.org, the agenda never shows the actual state of the issue when I clock-in, as that&#x27;s only a roam-link to the original issue. Conversely, time tracking only happens at the daily-level and it&#x27;s never reflected back to the original issue. Also, having tasks as sub-items in the dailies makes it easy to track all tasks by searching for roam back references, but at the same time it creates a lot of duplication because sub tasks are not carried over to the next day for example.
 Here I&#x27;m asking for your opinion, because I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m just using org and roam the &quot;wrong way&quot; and I&#x27;m not supposed to try to achieve any of this, or if it&#x27;s a somewhat valid approach and I just need to automate it.
 Thank you all!

 I already use packages that provide a chat based interface, looking for a faster interface to OpenAI from within my code files.

                              <span>I don&#x27;t mean something like exwm, I mean something that emulates the behavior of i3 or sway with emacs windows. Rather than having to write &#x60;C-x o&#x60; to move to the right window, how about something like &#x60;M-l&#x60;, similarly for moving a window down. Perhaps something could even be done with workspaces by storing window layouts in a list or something.

                              <span>I use tabspaces + project.el so each tab in the tab bar represents its own project. Like this:
 https://preview.redd.it/pxku3u4x3p8c1.png?width&#x3D;1304&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;1bc23614698024dd7232b689707c1eb48fc067ec
 I&#x27;ve only made some trivial customisations but not sure where to go to make it a little bit more helpful. This is basically it.
 (setq tab-bar-close-button-show nil) (setq tab-bar-tab-hints t) 
 Every example I&#x27;ve seen so far seems to be specific to a config framework like Doom or Nano. No complaints there but would be keen to see some other unique examples in the wild.
 What have you got, if you use tabs? Since we&#x27;re in emacs I figured they could do a lot more than this, as with the modeline and minibuffer.

                              <span>I would like the Alt key on Windows to be interpreted as alt by Emacs (I use the windows key as meta). I have tried to (setq w32-alt-is-meta nil), but this does not seem to work. For example, setting (global-set-key (kbd &quot;A-x&quot;) #&#x27;execute-extended-command) does not let me use Alt+x to execute a command. Instead, A-x is mapped to insert-char, and it actually inserts a multiplication sign! I get similar output for Alt+ other characters on windows. Is there a way to get Emacs on Windows to read &quot;A-x&quot; as &quot;A-x&quot;?

                              <span>Hi all,
 ​
 Still new to the Emacs space and slowly making my way through the emacs mastering book :)
 ​
 I was wondering on a few things.
 1: How do people avoid hurting their fingers using the default emacs keybindings, i.e. using control and meta keys so frequently.
 a. I understand people use vim keybindings to avoid this
 b. But want to know if people just bare it/its not as bad as its made out to be (i.e. classic emacs pinky)
 2: What keyboard do you use and does it help avoid finger contortions with the control and meta key.
 a. Sorta wondering how the custom keyboard space merges with the emacs space, i.e. is the miryoku layout with homerow mods helpful etc.
  
For those who use intellij, how has emacs influenced your workflow. I see there&#x27;s IdeaVim and IntelliMacs alongside the Emacs intellij keybindings, how have you setup IntelliJ in light of your emacs usage
  
Thanks for your time!

                              <span>Brand new to emacs - it has almost been a whole week - using Freebsd 13 (and a bit on Windows 10)
 emacs 29.1 has eglot baked in, and M-x eglot asked for access to an executable provided by python (pylsp)
  
pip install &quot;python-lsp-server[all]&quot; into a dummy venv
 Add the venv&#x27;s bin/ to $PATH
 And M-x eglot connects to the language server!
  
eglot now finds indent errors, syntax errors, highlights all instances of variables, and gives guidance on functions like print (although is in the minibuffer and not well formatted for my eyes)
 But it does not give command or variable completion which I think is supposed to come from jedi.
 My question is - how to get eglot to speak to jedi? 
 Is completion supposed to come from 
  
pylsp (in the python venv) speaking with python jedi,
 through eglot speaking directly to jedi (in the python venv) or
 directly between emacs buffer hook and emacs jedi (which I cant find in the package-list)
  
Tried with emacs 28 - but eglot wasn&#x27;t in the package-list
 Thoughts?

                              <span>Hi all,
 I am reading the book &quot;Algorithm Design with Haskell&quot; and have some questions relating to greedy algorithms.
 The book introduces a nondeterministic &quot;greedy condition&quot; as follows:
  gstep x (MinWith cost cs) ← MinWith cost (map (gstep x) cs) 
 gstep x refers to a &quot;greedy step&quot; that optimally extends a candidate by the component x.
 In page 162, it asserts that this condition holds if we can prove the following monotonicity condition
  cost c ≤ cost c&#x27; ⇒ cost (gstep x c) ≤ cost (gstep x c&#x27;) 
 for all c and c&#x27; (where c&#x27; comes after c in the list of candidates cs)
 In page 181, it says that the greedy condition is satisfied if the monotonicity condition holds for all c and c&#x27; (regardless of their positions in the list, I assume).
 My questions are
  
Which version is correct?
 If the first one is correct, then for cost c &#x3D; cost c&#x27;, does cost (gstep x c) &lt; cost (gstep x c&#x27;) violate the monotonicity condition?
 If the second one is correct, then for cost c &#x3D; cost c&#x27;, does cost (gstep x c) have to equal cost (gstep x c&#x27;)?
  
Thanks.

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to define a function - calcLayer - that performs matrix-vector multiplication and adds biases to the resulting product.
 module Neural where import Linear data DenseLayer &#x3D; DenseLayer {weights :: Linear.Matrix Float, biases :: Linear.Vector Float} calcLayer :: Num dataType &#x3D;&gt; Linear.Vector dataType -&gt; DenseLayer -&gt; Linear.Vector dataType calcLayer ingress layer &#x3D; Linear.vecSum (Linear.matVecMul (weights layer) ingress) (biases layer) 
 ​
 This will not compile. When I remove the function&#x27;s &quot;Num&quot; type constraint everything builds just fine:
 module Neural where import Linear data DenseLayer &#x3D; DenseLayer {weights :: Linear.Matrix Float, biases :: Linear.Vector Float} calcLayer :: Linear.Vector Float -&gt; DenseLayer -&gt; Linear.Vector Float calcLayer ingress layer &#x3D; Linear.vecSum (Linear.matVecMul (weights layer) ingress) (biases layer) 
 ​
 I&#x27;m not exactly sure how to justify to myself why this worked as a solution. In my head, the previous version said that &quot;datatype&quot; is restricted to the &quot;Num&quot; typeclass. Doesn&#x27;t &quot;Float&quot; fall under that umbrella?
 ​
 I&#x27;m trying to keep everything as general as possible, so preferably I would even like my DenseLayer definition to be able to accept other types belonging to the Num typeclass (not just Float), but I&#x27;m not sure if there is a way to do that with record syntax.
 ​
 Beyond shedding some light on why this worked, any criticism or advice will also be greatly appreciated.

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;m a digital ASIC/IC designer using SystemVerilog/Verilog to design digital logic HW. I got started learning Clash to model digital logic hardware since this week since I wanna feel the power of functional programming in hardware design. However, I don&#x27;t have any functional programming background and thus I jumped start from modeling shift-registers with length N in Clash by the assistant of ChatGPT. It goes well but I cannot feel the power of functional programming in the context of digital hardware to be honest. Thus, I&#x27;m here to hear from your suggestion. What minimum design case example can show the value of Clash against VHDL/Verilog? Or what&#x27;s the realistic benefits of Clash against traditional RTL HW description language? Thank you

                              <span>Edit: I somehow didn&#x27;t managed to insert the picture in the post, so here it is as a link to imgur.
 As you can see in the picture, I&#x27;ve succeeded to get Icon rendering in Dired on Windows 10, however emojis do not work at all.
 Seems weird that I&#x27;m able to render icons and not emojis. I understand they are different, but I&#x27;m not getting why the one is able to be displayed and the other is not.
 I&#x27;ve read every article I could find on this sub and google about Emojis in Emacs on Windows, but most articles are either 2+ year old, or have some broken links and succeeded to fix this issue.
 I&#x27;m running native Emacs on Windows, I&#x27;m not using WSL. I&#x27;m using Emacs 28.2.
 I have installed all-the-icons. I also have installed &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot; and put this in my ~/.emacs:
 (set-fontset-font t &#x27;symbol &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot;)
 And evaluated. I&#x27;ve also tried with &quot;native&quot; windows emoji font: Segoe UI Emoji, but same story.
 I&#x27;m getting the emoji in the buffer, but it&#x27;s invisible. If I copy it from, say, emojipedia and CTRL + y in a buffer, the cursor moves as if something was inserted, but nothing is shown as if I inserted a SPC.
 However if I CTRL+a CTRL+k and then paste it in, say, my browser, I get all the emojis I&#x27;ve inserted in the buffer.
 My question is - Has the Windows API changed(that is the reason, allegedly, why it didn&#x27;t work in the past as I&#x27;ve read about this issue on this sub) or is there some other way to display emojis in Emacs buffer on Windows 10 that bypasses this API problem or whichever other problem there is.
 On my Linux machine everything works fine, however, unfortunately, sometimes I&#x27;m forced to use Windows and thus want to make it work here as well.

                              <span>I am currently using org-roam, org-roam-bibtex, citar, and citar-org-roam and embark. When I have a citation link in my org file, I click on it and it opens embark showing all the actions I can take. Since it is a new note, I click on citar-open-notes, which automatically extracts the title and author and populates it into my capture template:
  (org-roam-capture-templates &#x27;((&quot;n&quot; &quot;literature note&quot; plain &quot;%?&quot; :target (file+head &quot;${slug}.org&quot; &quot;#+title: ${title}\n#+filetags: :paper:\n#+author: ${author}\n#+created: %U\n#+STARTUP: latexpreview\n&quot;) :unnarrowed t))) 
 Now, my bibtex file contains information about the paper&#x27;s year, and journal and I was hoping to extract it automatically just like it does with the ${title} and ${author}, but it does not appear to be the case. So I was wondering how this can be achieved such that citar automatically extracts the other pieces of info in the citation. I tried searching the citar-org-roam github, but I was not able to find something like this in the documentation. So currently, I am just using the following:
 (use-package citar-org-roam :straight t :after (citar org-roam) :config (citar-org-roam-mode) ) ;; You can also use citar-org-roam to plugin to org-roam-bibtex, like so: (citar-register-notes-source &#x27;orb-citar-source (list :name &quot;Org-Roam Notes&quot; :category &#x27;org-roam-node :items #&#x27;citar-org-roam--get-candidates :hasitems #&#x27;citar-org-roam-has-notes :open #&#x27;citar-org-roam-open-note :create #&#x27;orb-citar-edit-note :annotate #&#x27;citar-org-roam--annotate)) (setq citar-notes-source &#x27;orb-citar-source)

                              <span>I want to use code that I wrote in one file in a separate org file. I&#x27;d like to use this in combination with the ability to chain org blocks together. What I am imagining is there being a thing like #+include: to import any code I want to use from there to my org file, without actually exporting the contents of the first file. So, for example, if I have a file one.org with the contents...
 #+name: test #+begin_src python x &#x3D; &quot;Hello World&quot; #+end_src 
 I would like to be able to use this in another file two.org in a way like...
 #+include-but-dont-export: pathto/one.org #+begin_src python :include test print(x) #+end_src #+results: : Hello World 
 Is there anything like this, currently? Thanks.

                              <span>Hello Emacs Community!,
 ​
 I have several mail configured in gnus and smtp-multi, as I couldn&#x27;t get the smtp separated sending with only the posting styles. It is pretty simple really and it works with application passwords,
 ​
 However, I recently have to be checking now an Exchange work mail, and the reason I was using GNUS in the first place is not to have external dependencies like with mbsync... Is there any configuration that I can do to still get this mail?, or am I doomed to go to another app or use davmail?,
 ​
 Thank you!

                              <span>This post presupposes that I understand that Monads are typeclasses which bind pure functions to an impure execution context. I understand that functions that are within a monad do not evaluate to a &quot;value&quot;, but rather to code that will generate an IO action. the result of the action is non-deterministic, but the code that the Monadic functions evaluate to is deterministic.
 #1 is this correct?
 #2 what does this code look like? Is it C? Machine code? Haskell?

                              <span>Is anyone going to do anything about Haskell networking? The last time I checked on TechEmpower, we were running at 25-33% (servant and naked warp) of the fastest Rust webservers, while even Php-Nginx was floating around 50%.
 ​
 Likewise, I&#x27;m currently running a high-bandwidth Haskell application on http-client, but the program keeps on crashing (without exceptions).
 I think we&#x27;ve been generally aware that Haskell networking has been a bit retrograde for quite some time, but it&#x27;d be nice if someone (else, not me) would help step up to get Haskell&#x27;s networking libs back on track.

 This blog entry doesn&#x27;t really convince me why I should prefer type families over Fundeps, especially since functional dependencies seem more elegant to me instead of introducing additional types or even another extensions like &quot;type family dependencies&quot;.
 Here is a &quot;radical suggestion&quot; that fits this topic well:
 https://typesandkinds.wordpress.com/2015/09/09/what-are-type-families/
 Accordingly, functional dependencies seems less problematic…

                              <span>Hello,
 I&#x27;ve been using fzf, an excellent tool for searching through bash history. It employs an interactive fuzzy finder that&#x27;s activated with CTRL+R, making it easier to find what I am after.
 I&#x27;m wondering if there&#x27;s a similar tool available for GHCI. Such a tool would ideally offer an interactive, fuzzy search method for sifting through GHCI history.
 Many thanks in advance for any suggestions! :)

                              <span>My work involves a fair amount of time spent in the terminal, in docker containers, on remote machines via ssh, and sometimes in containers on remote machines. To support this, I’ve developed a customized terminal experience on kitty. Basically, if I open a new tab, it will clone my current environment, including the container/remote, current directory, and current bashrc. And it also color-codes tabs based on the type of environment I’m in. 
 I’m curious if it would be possible/interesting/desirable to recreate this setup in emacs, with the ultimate goal of using emacs as a customized ide + terminal emulator. 
 Does anyone have thoughts on this? The first issue that I see is that so far, I haven’t found a tab bar for emacs that supports customizing the colors of the tabs. I’m sure this is possible, but I’m too new to emacs to know how difficult it would be (I have experience coding in multiple lisp dialects, so needing to code in order to customize is not a drawback). Thanks.
 (EDIT: I guess this is partly a question about customizing emacs and partly a question about using emacs as my primary terminal emulator.)

                              <span>Two days ago I wrote a small experiment that lets me include Lisp as a template placeholders. It looks something like this:
 1 + 2 &#x3D; {{ 3 }} 1 + 2 &#x3D; {{ (+ 1 2) }} 1 + 2 &#x3D; {{! escaped }} 
 I used Mustache-like syntax, to basically just delimit Lisp region from the rest of the text. However, due to Lisp paranthesized syntax it is possible to simplify it. I have now re-written it so it just needs one marker to mark which expression is to be evaluated as Lisp:
 1 + 2 &#x3D; %%3 1 + 2 &#x3D; %%(+ 1 2) 1 + 2 &#x3D; %%!escaped 
 Due to Emacs being a text processing toolkit and a Lisp repl/environment, that basically let us use Emacs Lisp as a template language in text files. The intended use is file and code generators.
 The simplified syntax turnes out to be slightly harder to process than the one with start and end delimiters, however I think it might be worth, so here is an experiment to test the idea.
 Download and details about the usage details are in online repo.
 I appreciate critique and discussion, especially if you find a bug or some fundamental problem.

Great idea! Here are some of my Emacs packages that I&#x27;ve been working on
 Blamer.el
 https://github.com/Artawower/blamer.el
 Blamer.el is a minor mode for Emacs that shows the last modification date and the author of the current line or the current region in the overlay from git.
 The package can be slow on very large repositories, so I&#x27;m testing asynchronous functionality now and plan to make a release early next year.
 Turbo-log
 https://github.com/Artawower/turbo-log
 A simple and dumb package based on tree-sitter for one goal: to quickly insert a log message for the current line!…</span>

 However, the package list only shows compat and git-commit as being obsolete - neither of which are on the autoremove list.
 Any suggestions as to what&#x27;s going on?

was hoping to automate this (automatically run it, instead of M-x c-guess  every time) when it detects I am in a C/C++ buffer

 I assume that a cursor would have to be chosen to match the theme better, making it more visible against the background, and theme designers would take that into consideration.
 Do some themes have a way of adjust the cursor colors to match at runtime or there none whatsoever?

 It reads to me like the tar is in a bad format? Or I&#x27;m just misconfigured it? (This wouldn&#x27;t be caused by missing dependencies or anything, right? And shouldn&#x27;t use-package install dependencies anyway?)
 Thanks for any tips. (or if there is a more hand holding copilot install).

 (setq org-src-block-faces &#x27;((&quot;emacs-lisp&quot; (:background &quot;#EEE2FF&quot;))
 (&quot;python&quot; (:background &quot;#E5FFB8&quot;))))
 but for other structure blocks like examples, quotes, verse, or even new custom ones.
 ​
 I am, for some reason, writing a screen play, and taught it will be helpful to distinct different elements of scripts by applying different background colour to blocks.
 ​
 I think maybe it should be like this, but I don&#x27;t know what to put instead of &quot;org-src-block-faces&quot;.
 (setq xxxx &#x27;((&quot;slug-line&quot; (:background &quot;#EEE2FF&quot;))
 (&quot;action&quot; (:background &quot;#E5FFB8&quot;))
 (&quot;transition&quot; (:background &quot;#E5FFE8&quot;))))
 Thank you for your comment in advance.

 I&#x27;m using Doom Emacs, and according to this, if I have something tagged :important: And something else tagged :important:chore:
 I should be able to do a tag search like important-chore or +important&amp;-chore to be more explicit. But the negation doesn&#x27;t seem to work at all when I do the search, it works the opposite. If I do +important&amp;-chore it ONLY shows me things marked :important:chore: 
 I would think that it&#x27;s completely broken, but it IS searching the org files correctly and finding tags. 
 Match tag search
 Search for important
 Try to negate chore
 Result

                              <span>I also posted on Posit&#x27;s community portal but maybe better to ask the Org-mode crowd.
 I&#x27;m interested in exporting Org-mode documents to Quarto. For instance, I have the following document called test-export.org
 #+title: Quarto export test #+begin_src python import matplotlib.pyplot as plt #+end_src #+begin_src python plt.plot([1, 2], [2, 4]) #+end_src #+begin_src python :eval no print(&quot;Hello World!&quot;) #+end_src 
 I first try using pandoc to just export to markdown format:
 pandoc test-export.org -t markdown --o test-export.qmd 
 test-export.qmd then looks like
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; python import matplotlib.pyplot as plt &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; python plt.plot([1, 2], [2, 4]) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; {.python eval&#x3D;&quot;no&quot;} print(&quot;Hello World!&quot;) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; 
 The problem is that Quarto expects 
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;{python} 
 to denote Python code blocks. (I can understand that pandoc makdown conversion should not know to convert :eval no to #| eval: false in the code block but that is secondary).
 I could write a post-text-processing script to handle this but I wonder if there is a more direct way to at least get the language specification to be {python} instead of python or {.python ...}. I have also tried exporting to other Markdown flavors using pandoc, and using Org-mode&#x27;s built-in Markdown exporter. I guess the built-in exporter targets the original Markdown
 # Table of Contents import matplotlib.pyplot as plt plt.plot([1, 2], [2, 4]) print(&quot;Hello World!&quot;) 
 so is even further away from the Quarto form.
 AFAIK the Quarto documentation only defines the Quarto -&gt; Org transformation and not the other way around. 
 Thanks for your suggestions.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve used vim (not as my main dev environment) since i first used linux 2 years ago
 Since then i&#x27;ve heard about Emacs (some of my teachers in the CS university use it) and that it&#x27;s more than just an editor
 I want to know moee about emacs, where to start learning it&#x27;s features. 
 Some friendly starting point and some impressive thing that can be done with Emacs
 Thanks for any advice

 They add nothing to this community and detract greatly from it. Personally I&#x27;d like a mod with less of an axe to grind who sticks to removing only blatantly egregious posts and spam. Someone who has actually contributed to the community with a proven track record and isn&#x27;t just thirsty for &quot;mod status&quot;.

                              <span>Sorry if this has been asked about before, but I haven&#x27;t been able to turn up any search results about this occurring... For some reason any time I  complete imports in typescript files, company-mode (I assume) is appending a $1 to the end of the name. For example, if I were to type import {Rec and then press  to complete I would expect the result to be import { Recipe } from &#x27;./recipes/recipe.model where Recipe is the name of the class. Instead my tab-completion is imported as import { Recipe$1 } from &#x27;./recipes/recipe.model&#x27;; 
 This additional $1 only occurs when importing packages- not when using tab completions for anything else. Happy to provide any pieces of my init file that would be of use to help me solve this!

 I am searching for ways to speed up gnus by other tools. By googling, I find that the combination of offlineimap and dovecot can make fetching gmail or other mail fast, and the leafnode can make fetching nntp mail fast.
 I want to read mail list provided by nntp and gmail. It seems that both the way by offlineimap and dovecot and the way by leafnoe are needed. Is that correct? Or the combination of offlineimap and dovecot can also help fetch nntp mail.
 It would be great if anyone can help!

                              <span>For Emacs speedrun videos, I have a lot of org docs stacked up that needs recording.
 However, especially with subjective choices with lots of valid options, community breadth is more valuable that individual depth.
 What are habits, tools, configuration choices, fundamental and advanced, that you would recommend to a programmer to ramp up quickly, all the way to becoming productive at working on Elisp packages?
 Videos are around 5-10min and count on the viewer to do the work but try to let them know when to go deep and what on.
 I&#x27;ll go first: * Intrinsic types in Emacs (and how to relate it to understanding the UI) * Apropos and small tricks to use docstring conventions to search for types * Byte compiling * Structural editing of some variety * Evaluate in other buffer, all the evaluation workflows and their tradeoffs * Persistence, be it org mode, saving scratch, writing modules, or ielm history * All the bells &amp; whistles in the helpful package, including using it to quickly find the right manual contents * Fuzzy searches for symbols and important search keys like &quot;-hook$&quot; and &quot;-functions?$&quot; etc * Edebug &amp; debug * LLM prompting to overcome lack of proper vocabulary &amp; language barrier * Shortdocs * The built-in Emacs glossary * Macrostep * Tests * Process, JSON-RPC, HTTP * Probably some CL because I think the built-in loop structures are just anemic, but I want to stick to bread &amp; butter cl-lib. That said, what do you consider bread &amp; butter?
 Even if I don&#x27;t share your views, I will try to make sure that sources of high value with at least a significant fraction of users are represented. It costs very little extra time to mention something like, &quot;If you are doing X a lot or when you get to Y, people say try adopting Z.&quot;

                              <span>I am trying to create a habit where I run three times a week. So I decided to set a org habit that is set to every 56 hours as follows using org-gtd:
 ** Running SCHEDULED:  :PROPERTIES: :ID: Running-2023-12-22-22-02-57 :STYLE: habit :END: [2023-12-22 Fri 21:57] 
 In the org manual, it says that I should be able to do this. But when I open the agenda view, I am hit with the error: Debugger entered--Lisp error: (error &quot;Invalid duration string: ++56h&quot;)
 Why is it not possible to do this? Or is there another way to achieve this?

                              <span>A while back I wrote org-roam-pygraph, a small Python library to extract the natural graph structure associated to a collection of org-roam nodes.
 Recently I took up a project of running some data analysis on my org-roam collection. In the process, I decided to write a more featureful Python library to assist in all the grunt work of extracting information from the org-roam database.
 Features
  
Several &quot;indices&quot; are provided, which are dictionaries with roam-node IDs as keys and some data pertaining to that node as values. Indices provided are 
 Title index (data: title of node)
 Filename index (data: where the node is located)
 Tags index (data: tags the node has)
 Backlink index (data: list of roam-node IDs a node links to)
 Org link index (data: list of org links that are not backlinks to other nodes)
 Node body index (data: the body text of the node)
 Math snippets index (data: list of LaTeX snippets in the body of a node)
 Source block index (data: list of src blocks in body text, tagged by language)
 
 networkx representation of your org-roam collection. You can use networkx to do all kinds of graph analytics on your collection, including visualization, which is how I made the cover image for the git repo.
 Basic manipulations of the collection 
 Filter collection by tags
 Remove orphan nodes
 
  
The code can be found at https://github.com/aatmunbaxi/orgroamtools, and the code is documented at https://aatmunbaxi.github.io/orgroamtools. The package is available on PyPI, and can be installed with pip install orgroamtools.
 PRs and issue reports are welcome.

                              <span>Hi,
 If you have a plain list with checkboxes, like
 - [ ] Things to do - [ ] sub item 1 - [ ] sub item 2 - [ ] sub item 3 
 Is there a way to check all sub items at once, not C-c C-c them all one by one?
 C-c C-c on Things to dojust gives error message
 org-ctrl-c-ctrl-c: Cannot toggle this checkbox: unchecked subitems
 I looked up the manual page for Checkboxes, and one way seems to mark all the items you like to check and C-c C-c, but wondering if there is an easier way for a checkbox subtree?

                              <span>i have been training for a job in the medical field (maybe a bit of an understatement in regards to the cost and mental toil, but saying i&#x27;m in med school has its implications because i&#x27;m really not.) and about two-and-a-bit months ago, i decided to start a zettelkasten. i learned all about it and wrote notes about the underlying philosophy in the zettelkasten itself, and things started off fantastic! MOCs and hub notes feel like a dream for my personal organization. higher-order learning seemed extremely necessary. disregarding the idea of separate disciplines in lieu of an understanding rooted in existing knowledge seemed very helpful.
now it&#x27;s been a couple months and my zettelkasten contains over 100 zettels; i&#x27;d say about 20 regarding personal knowledge management and then about 80 medical notes. that is the problem, though. i look at other notemakers&#x27; obsidian graphs and they&#x27;re one big ideaverse of notes radiating from the center. my notes, conversely, are separated into blobs by discipline or level of abstraction from reality. (e.g. anatomy [tangible] vs. study concepts [intangible]) in essence, i want to keep watching my zettelkasten grow--it is helping me retain information--but i&#x27;m a bit scared that i&#x27;m not implementing higher-order learning correctly.
this is making me unsure whether a traditional, luhmann-esque zettelkasten is the best idea for medical study. what do you think? does anyone else have trouble connecting tangible, business-related zettels to more abstract zettels?</span>

I can get this example to work by omitting the fac :: Int -&gt; Int line but this error in particular is really starting to bug me.
 The following gives a parse error at |fac 0 &#x3D; 1:
 fac :: Int -&gt; Int |n :: Int |fac 0 &#x3D; 1 |fac n &#x3D; n * fac (n-1) main &#x3D; print (fac 42) 
 This gives a parse error on &#x27;::&#x27; at n :: Int:
 fac :: Int -&gt; Int n :: Int fac 0 &#x3D; 1 fac n &#x3D; n * fac (n-1) main &#x3D; print (fac 42)

                              <span>As the title says, Flyspell highlights every single word, even if it&#x27;s correct and if it exists in the dictionary. At first, I thought it&#x27;s an issue with aspell, so I switched to hunspell, but the behavior is the same. I do have hunspell installed on the system, dictionaries too (using Romanian language), running hunspell -D in console shows that the dictionaries are loaded:
 LOADED DICTIONARY: /Users/claudiu/Library/Spelling/ro_RO.aff /Users/claudiu/Library/Spelling/ro_RO.dic 
 This is my spellcheck config bit from init.el:
 (setenv &quot;DICTIONARY&quot; &quot;ro_RO&quot;) (setenv &quot;DICPATH&quot; (concat (getenv &quot;HOME&quot;) &quot;/Library/Spelling&quot;)) (setq ispell-program-name &quot;hunspell&quot;) (setq ispell-really-hunspell t) (setq ispell-dictionary &quot;ro_RO&quot;) (setq ispell-local-dictionary &quot;ro_RO&quot;) (setq ispell-dictionary-alist &#x27;((&quot;ro_RO&quot; &quot;[[:alpha:]]&quot; &quot;[^[:alpha:]]&quot; &quot;[&#x27;]&quot; nil (&quot;-d&quot; &quot;ro_RO&quot;) nil utf-8))) 
 Every single word in the image below exists in the dictionary and shouldn&#x27;t be highlighted. Anyone have any idea why this is happening?

 ​
 I&#x27;d hoped that typescript-ts-mode (ts for treesitter) would work for editing .js files containing jsx, but reformat at least doesn&#x27;t work. It could well be my set-up, but is there anyone here using tree sitter versions of js modes successfully with react/jsx from emacs 29? If not, what is the current &quot;best thing&quot; - googling js/jsx with emacs opens pandora&#x27;s box and I&#x27;m really pretty confused as to how best to move forward.
 ​
  (use-package typescript-ts-mode :config (defun my/ts-mode-hook () (lsp-deferred)) (add-hook &#x27;typescript-ts-mode-hook #&#x27;my/ts-mode-hook) :mode ((&quot;\\.ts\\&#x27;&quot; . typescript-ts-mode) (&quot;\\.js\\&#x27;&quot; . typescript-ts-mode) (&quot;\\.tsx\\&#x27;&quot; . tsx-ts-mode)))

                              <span>My specific problem happens when I&#x27;m starting a Python interpreter.
 I&#x27;ve noticed that when I start the interpreter (using run-python), the interpreter doesn&#x27;t have any of my variables: os.environ shows a bunch of useful variables but none of the ones I&#x27;ve set in my shell-config file (~/.zshrc).
 I&#x27;ve been digging through the code and it seems that the python interpreter process is ultimately started by make-comint-in-buffer. What is the preferred solution to ensure that this function picks up all the variables I want before starting the process?

                              <span>Super new emacs user here, sorry for the dumb question. Suppose I want to map control-w to closing the current window. Can someone tell me why adding the following to the end of init.el doesn&#x27;t work:
 (global-unset-key (kbd &quot;C-w&quot;)) (global-set-key (kbd &quot;C-w&quot;) &#x27;delete-window) 
 Edit: Looks like evil-mode added a whole bunch of keybindings for working with windows that all start with C-w. I think I&#x27;ll try actually using those.
 One things I&#x27;m still unclear about: Did global-unset fail to remove these because they aren&#x27;t global? Or did it fail because you&#x27;d have to unset each binding that begins with C-w individually? 
 I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;s not the second one. That&#x27;s a lot of commands, if you have to unbind each one individually.

                              <span>So I was running some random commit from master for a while (because nix overlay defaults) and then when Emacs 29.1 was released properly I switched over. Since then single ESC isn&#x27;t respected in tui (-nw) but works fine in gui. Same for the arrow keys. They&#x27;re fine in gui but in tui they force me into insert mode (with a flash of M-o being undefined) and type ABCD.
 I get the same behaviour with -Q and then eval (require &#x27;evil), so it&#x27;s something that&#x27;s changed upstream and not in my config.
 Anyone else affected and have found a solution?

 I bet I&#x27;m missing something obvious, but haven&#x27;t been able to figure this out.
 I&#x27;ve got the menu-bar and tool-bar hidden. But I can&#x27;t figure out how to get rid of this gray bar at the very top of emacs:
 https://preview.redd.it/ny5s3y04iu7c1.png?width&#x3D;1008&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;e2eedd6ef87a036c1b0c9e931c135b4de3c63d0a
 I can get rid of it using toggle-fullscreen-mode, but that also hides the system menu. I don&#x27;t want fullscreen, I just want the bar gone.
 Any way to do that?
 Thanks!

                              <span>I don&#x27;t know why but Eglot suddenly disappeared on my mode-line. Previously it was like &#x60;[eglot:project]&#x60;, but now it&#x27;s like &#x60;[]&#x60;. It is still functioning, though, with python lsp and c++ clangd.
 I didn&#x27;t really change my configuration. Any ideas about why this happened?

                              <span>Flyspell is not working for me, I enable flyspell by Mx flyspell-mode but it does not highlight the spelling errors. I am using hunspell (in Windows 11 with a portable Emacs version 29.1).
 Hunspell is configured in the init.el as follow:
 (setq ispell-program-name &quot;C:/MASS/hunspell-1.3.2-3-w32-bin/bin/hunspell.exe&quot;) (setq ispell-local-dictionary &quot;en_GB&quot;) (setq ispell-local-dictionary-alist &#x27;((&quot;en_GB&quot; &quot;:alpha:&quot; &quot;[^[:alpha:]]&quot; &quot;[&#x27;]&quot; nil (&quot;-d&quot; &quot;en_GB&quot;) nill utf-8))) (when (boundp &#x27;ispell-hunspell-dictionary-alist) (setq ispell-hunspell-dictionary-alist ispell-local-dictionary-alist)) (setq hunspell-default-dict &quot;en_GB&quot;) 
 Any advice will be helpful.

                              <span>Hi guys, I&#x27;m a Haskell novice and have been challenged to make something like a chess engine. I love the idea of doing it in Haskell and also doing it properly™ (i.e. overengineering the hell outta it lol).
 I already have a program (involuntarily written in Java) to store/output the board state and determine whether someone won.\ What I intend to create is the following: 1. a protocol between the Java program and 2. (see below)\ this will contain things like &quot;NEWGAME&quot;, &quot;TURN xy&quot;, &quot;RESPONSE zw&quot;, etc. 2. a Haskell program that implements that protocol to actually generate a good next move and send it back to the Java application, which 3. I will modify to be able to talk to my &quot;engine&quot;
 So what is your folks&#x27; opinion on how to structure the Haskell code / protocol?\ I came up with this: - CECP-/UCI-like protocol: one move sent at a time, my program would need to store that somehow\ however, I don&#x27;t have any idea on how to elegantly do this in Haskell and wonder whether it can even be done idiomatically - get the complete board state as input each time and output the next move / new state; as easy as it gets and seems to fit really well with the functional paradigm BUT extremely inefficient and not what I would do if I was programming it in another language (also apparently not how most protocols work…)
 Dear, epic, most valued, mathematically blessed computer scientists, can you bestow some advice upon me, so I can maybe become worthy of joining your ranks one day?
 Thanks in advance and happy holidays! :)

 How relevant will experience developing in Scala be if you want to switch to another programming language?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve read &#x27;Functional programming simplified&#x27; by Alvin Alexander, and I think I understand pure function, side effects, IO monads, type classes pretty well(although I dislike its implementation)
 But I don&#x27;t understand state monads, functors or monad transformers. I tried &quot;scala with cats&quot; and gave up after a few chapters. So I don&#x27;t know how to use cats-core
 Now can I jump to learn cats effect or zio ? For now I don&#x27;t want to learn advanced Haskell-like FP concepts, but focusing on writing pure functions and handling IO in an FP way. Just don&#x27;t know if cats effect or Zio require understanding of these concepts (I just want to use cats effect or zio, not trying to understand what&#x27;s behind the scenes)
 And if you think it&#x27;s ok, which one is simpler in you opinion? Some also say Future is enough, do you recommend I just learn how to use Future as a monad to solve real world problems?

                              <span>A couple of days ago my phone&#x27;s Dropbox sync stopped working. It pretends that it has complete the sync, but no files on either my Linux desktop (emacs) or my Android phone (Orgzly) get updated. There are no error messages. I&#x27;ve done a lot of rebooting, as well as unlinking and relinking repositories, etc., all without success. Any suggestions?

                              <span>I am using agda2-mode, and it always binds &quot;\&quot; key to starting the input method for the latex. I have rebound this behavior to another key, and would now like to rebind &quot;\&quot; to inserting &quot;?&quot;. But the standard way of C-h C-k in order to find the function does not work. In addition, attempts like &#x60;(define-key agda2-mode-map (kbd &quot;\\&quot;) (lambda () (interactive) (insert &quot;?&quot;)))&#x60; doesn&#x27;t work either. Any ideas would be appreciated.

                              <span>Hi,
 so, the omnisharp version in nixos is borgt and dose not work at all... But if i use lsp-install-server everytime i try to run the lsp i get this mesasge: Error running timer: (file-missing &quot;Doing vfork&quot; &quot;No such file or directory&quot;)
 I don&#x27;t know what Doing vfork means, all i know is that some file is missing. But how do i find out WHAT file is missing? Non of the buffers (lsp log, lsp stderr etc.) say something meaning full... how do i debug this? --debug-init is useless i think because the error dose not occur during init.
 Please help my GoogleFu is failing me!

 I&#x27;m highly curious if anyone has some tips on how to make it better :)
 Note: There is a package called org-gtd which was not around when I started using GTD so I made my own way of doing things

                              <span>I&#x27;d like to use Gnus: its usage paradigm looks appealing and I&#x27;d like to use it to navigate mails, newsletters, newsgroups and RSS feeds together with a handful of features like scoring and filtering and big customization - as expected fro Emacs.
 However, I&#x27;d like not to renounce (yet?) to the comfort of GUI mail clients (Thunderbird, Evolution, Geany, any is good for me...) in some situations. So the question: is there a way to make them share the same inbox, without having to download the mail twice?. Maybe with a separate process that fetches the emails, so that Gnus does not get stuck doing network operations.
 Additional info: My mail provider is Proton Mail. The question applies mainly to Linux systems. It would be useful to have a similar setup even using Emacs for Android - but I guess it&#x27;s a chimera.
 Thank you in advance for your help

                              <span>Greetings to the community!
 Especially to those interested in various Emacs-based note-taking systems. 
 This year, my goal has been to make a guide on using the howm package.
 Some of you might already know about this wiki-like system created by Kazuyuki Hiraoka.
 The language barrier hase made it difficult for the howm package to reach a wider audience outside of Japan.
 I hope my humble contribution can somewhat address this situation, especially because howm really deserves more attention.
 The tutorial on howm is free and you can find it in English and Russian here:

 Happy holidays! 🎅 🍻

                              <span>I am trying to load native compiled code from personal libraries, but running native-compile, even when it creates the .eln file, does not result in subsequent loading of the file to use the native-compiled code.

                              <span>Had a sports accident a couple weeks ago, looks like my knee&#x27;s gonna be outta commission for half a year. My job is all walking and running, and since the injury happened on my own time, tough luck. Moved back in with the parents, so not to worry on the starving/freezing part. I have a decent local reputation in my industry, too, so long story short, this is just a very annoying setback. That&#x27;s the bad news.
 Good news is that obviously, my schedule&#x27;s freed up. Wanted to get back into reading forever, you can bet that&#x27;s happening. And lots of things I&#x27;ve wanted to sink my teeth into, but never did for one reason or another. Two of them are emacs, and recreational math.
 My hope is that the reason I&#x27;ve never been able to sit down and work my way through the Petersen book was that I was just too sapped from work and life stuff. And apparently I got six months or so, so I&#x27;ll have plenty of time to digest it. But. In case it turns out that I&#x27;m just lazy and weak, plan is to go through his beginners guide, and follow his advice of having a goal with emacs. I have two:
  
I want to learn how to do Bullet Journal-type of stuff. Make plans, write pieces for myself, that sort of thing. Heard that org-mode isn&#x27;t any good for longer entries, though, so advice here would be appreciated.
 Something I can practice my math in. From taking notes, to copying out math problems and solving them, so on. I have no clue what this would look like, so again, advice appreciated.

 (\xs -&gt; (\n -&gt; (xs,n))  chooseInt (0, length xs)) 
 pointfree.io converted it to:
 liftM2 () (,) (chooseInt . (0 ,) . length) 
 Here, xs is [a] and chooseInt is from QuickCheck.
 I can&#x27;t figure out how the pointfree expression type checks (it does). I understand each of the following functions individually, but combined they&#x27;re hurting my brain. Can you deconstruct the pointfree expression and explain it to me?
 liftM2 :: Monad m &#x3D;&gt; (a1 -&gt; a2 -&gt; r) -&gt; m a1 -&gt; m a2 -&gt; m r () :: Functor f &#x3D;&gt; (a -&gt; b) -&gt; f a -&gt; f b (,) :: a -&gt; b -&gt; (a, b) 
 I even get () (,) (chooseInt . (0 ,) . length), which is a function wrapped in a Functor, but liftM2??

                              <span>I&#x27;m using vector-sized to do some shenanigans. I don&#x27;t understand the difference between the below two approaches:

 fhalf &#x3D; take&#x27; i v
 shalf &#x3D; drop&#x27; i v
 newV &#x3D; fhalf ++ cons p shalf
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;haskell import Data.Vector.Sized import GHC.TypeNats
 -- doesn&#x27;t work insertVec2 :: forall n m a. KnownNat n &#x3D;&gt; a -&gt; Vector (n + m) a -&gt; Vector (n + (1 + m)) a insertVec2 p v &#x3D; newV where fhalf :: Vector n a fhalf &#x3D; take v shalf :: Vector m a shalf &#x3D; drop v newV :: Vector (n + (1 + m)) a newV &#x3D; fhalf ++ cons p shalf  The error in the second one is:  • Could not deduce (KnownNat n0) from the context: KnownNat n bound by the type signature for: insertVec2 :: forall (n :: Nat) (m :: Natural) a. KnownNat n &#x3D;&gt; a -&gt; Vector (n + m) a -&gt; Vector (n + (1 + m)) a at /Users/deco/work/sahs/src/Surface.hs:37:15-89 The type variable ‘n0’ is ambiguous • In the ambiguity check for ‘insertVec2’ To defer the ambiguity check to use sites, enable AllowAmbiguousTypes In the type signature: insertVec2 :: forall n m a. KnownNat n &#x3D;&gt; a -&gt; Vector (n + m) a -&gt; Vector (n + (1 + m)) a &#x60;&#x60; I don&#x27;t know why GHC (9.4.7) is inserting this type variablen0&#x60; but even if I did, I don&#x27;t see how to possibly disambiguate this variable. The first version seems to do the same, except it passes a Proxy or Finite tagged with the KnownNat.

                              <span>Dear Haskellers,
 I have a question about streaming libraries (streamly, conduit, streaming, etc.). I am trying to write a little application to remap user input events (keyboard, mouse, etc.) so I am dealing with low-volume, lazy streams. Additionally, the actual remapping will depend on a user configuration file. 
 I have gotten suggestions to use a streaming library to represent the basic datatype in my app, something I did look into but quickly abandoned because of a rather daunting amount of choice and considerations. However, now is the time for me to make a decision, since going back and refactoring everything after the fact is going to be a huge time-sink. So:
 I am currently under the impression that the biggest benefit of the streaming libraries is speed, and that that speed is generated by doing ghc-optimization tricks. I am also under the impression that speed is not that important in my domain, and that since I don&#x27;t know which stream-transformations I will be composing at compile time (since I&#x27;ll be reading the transformations from user-config), I wouldn&#x27;t even be able to benefit from these performance gains.
 Is my understanding correct? Am I missing something? My home-rolled solution uses binary and a Chan and async to set up different event readers by parsing from lazy bytestrings, writing to the chan to merge the results, and then represents the input as a lazy, infinite list that then gets passed to my pure remapping engine. It seems to work fine. Am I setting myself up for some unforeseen disaster in the future? 
 The reason I&#x27;ve been avoiding these solutions is also just because my productive time is limited and very unreliable, so the cognitive overhead of a completely new set of abstractions comes with its own cost.
 Thank you for any advice you may proffer.

 appendList (x:xs) ys &#x3D; x: appendList xs ys 
 This is easy stuff but i don&#x27;t understand how ys is concatenated with the first list. I understand that each character is broken down in the first and the recursion stops once xs is empty, but how does xs join with ys?

                              <span>I have started using Haskell as a replacement for Python, for &quot;ad hoc computing&quot;. I guess, rather hope, I&#x27;ll also write production programs in it some day, but for now I&#x27;m just enjoying this beautiful set of well thought out primitives that mathematicians and the countless people behind Haskell have laid at my hands (Thank you all!).
 Recently, GHC has started whining about using head. Now, I understand the motivations etc behind this (or I think I do), and I can see why in certain corporate settings, having a coding convention to disallow the use of head might be a totally appropriate thing to do.
 But I don&#x27;t think such verboten-ness belongs to the language itself. Haskell is not a monoculture of non-partial programs, I feel it has a wider community than that. When I&#x27;m tinkering with stu…</span>

                              <span>Greetings to the community!
I&#x27;d like to introduce you to yet another way to organize a knowledge base in Emacs. This is the howm package by Kazuyuki Hiraoka. Package available on Melpa.
I&#x27;ve been using howm daily for a year and a half now, and I can confidently say that it is a simple and elegant solution for taking notes. Howm, much like &quot;The Archive,&quot; utilizes links as a search trigger, among other similarities.
The package is almost 21 years old, but Hiraoka continues to actively support it. I&#x27;ve spent the past year creating a guide for howm, and I&#x27;m glad to show you what I&#x27;ve come up with.
The tutorial on howm is free and you can find it in English and Russian here:

                              <span>While I was doing my research for an alternative to The Archive in Windows being unhappy with the mainstream options I found Denote. After working with the archive for 2 years and reading a bunch of times the Getting Started I can say this one ticks all of the boxes for me. Yes the downside is learning emacs, although maybe not A LOT of emacs and just what&#x27;s necessary to feel comfortable with Denote. Also, it doesn&#x27;t rely on org-mode so you don&#x27;t need to also be familiar with how org mode works and just stay within emacs for your note taking needs. Another big win is that of course its free.
I&#x27;ll leave a link to a video from the developer here.
What do you think about it?</span>

                              <span>Hey,
 Sorry to spam you a bit recently. I promise this is the last time, at least until the New Year ;)
 One of the new features in the recent IntelliJ Scala Plugin release is the X-Ray editor mode. It displays hints next to your code without adding too much clutter, and only when you want it. Even though X-Ray was already mentioned in the release note, we - the IntelliJ Scala team - decided it&#x27;s interesting enough to write about it a bit more.
 So, here&#x27;s a blog post: https://blog.jetbrains.com/scala/2023/12/21/the-x-ray-mode/

                              <span>I have tried to read various articles, and also some books, that aim to explain Monads. Yet none of them have really caught on with me, especially when it comes to practicality. I get that if some wrapper (List, Option, IO etc.) should be able to be called a Monad, it has to have some properties, and some laws that it should fulfill. But that still doesn&#x27;t help me understand it really well, and I will forget the laws the next second and probably won&#x27;t know how to implement or use a Monad in practicality. 
 Do you happen to have one golden source that made Monads &#x27;click&#x27; for you both in what it is from a theoretical point of view, but also how to implement and use them? (Exercises would also be greatly appreciated, but I first need to understand it)

                              <span>First of all, I&#x27;m new to FP. And this post is not aiming to provoke or something.
  
It&#x27;s used for &quot;ad hoc polymorphism&quot; - how does this help with make a function pure and handle side effects, which I was told to be the focus of FP ? 
 And its implementation in Scala heavily relies on implicit keyword. After doing lots of implicits you can finally replace foo(bar) as bar.foo(). To me this just looks like a way of creating syntax sugar. How is it FP? 
 So I guess it&#x27;s not FP by itself, but just a way to implement FP feature such as monads. Make sense?

                              <span>I know the question has already been asked here, but it was a few years ago, I wonder if the situation has changed, so I ask again.
 I need to add scripting capabilities to one my software, i.e. give the user the possibility to write it&#x27;s own &quot;script&quot; and have the program execute it. Ideally, being able to write such a script as an Haskell EDSL would have been great but I don&#x27;t think it is possible (or easy). So before rolling out my own language, I was wandering what are the best options ?

                              <span>This is a condensed version of a problem I&#x27;ve encountered in a rewrite of a project to use associated types instead of multiparameter typeclasses. I want the type signatures in the API to be as clean as possible, and avoid the need for so many type ascriptions in code using the API, which is why I&#x27;d like to make this work somehow.
 I have a typeclass A with a non injective associated type Context
 class A a where type Context a 
 so many instances of A can have the same Context.
 Some instances of A are also instances of the class AA, that has two additional associated types, B and C.
 class (A a) &#x3D;&gt; AA a where type B a type C a problematic :: Context a -&gt; B a -&gt; C a -&gt; a 
 The intention is that given a Context, the combination of B a and C a uniquely identify a, but I don&#x27;t know how to express this.
 I know it&#x27;s possible to make constraints like
 class A a where type B a &#x3D; b | b -&gt; a 
 , but what I need is some kind of constraint with multiple parameters, like (Context a, B a, C a) -&gt; a. How can this be achieved?

                              <span>I have a large file with tables and calculations, and when a part of it is not needed anymore, I like to keep it in the file for later reference. To calculate all the sums and formulas, I do org-table-iterate-buffer-tables, which works fine, but naturally takes a while.
 Could I exempt the older parts of the org file by adding the ARCHIVE tag to the old headings? Or does it only exempt them from agenda views and exporting, as it says in the org manual? It would be great if there were a function to exempt parts of a file when calling org-table-iterate-buffer-tables.

                              <span>Hi,
 As a follow-up to the 2023.3 release of IntelliJ Scala Plugin, we&#x27;ve given the IntelliJ Scala Help pages a major overhaul. This includes updates to many sections as well as a few entirely new sections written from scratch. We&#x27;ve also added new screenshots and short videos instead of GIFs.
 You can check it all out, starting from here.
 By the way, if you think we should add or modify some sections, let us know - either here in the comments, or on our Discord server.
 Happy developing!

                              <span>I&#x27;m working my way through the exercises in &quot;Function Programming in Scala, 2nd edition&quot;, and currently at chapter 11, Monad. The book defines its own Monad trait, and asks for some implementations. I want to verify that my implementations satisfy the Monad laws, so, I&#x27;m attempting to create some tests.
 Let me first show a test I wrote for testing Monoid left identity law.
 trait Monoid[A]: ... trait MonoidLaws { this: AnyFunSpec &amp; ScalaCheckPropertyChecks &#x3D;&gt; def leftIdentityLaw[A: Arbitrary: Monoid]: Unit &#x3D; val instanceM &#x3D; summon[Monoid[A]] 
 The tests are called as shown below:
 describe(&quot;Integers form a Monoid under addition&quot;): import MonoidInstances.intAddition leftIdentityLaw[Int] rightIdentityLaw[Int] associativityLaw[Int] 
 Along the same lines, Monad and Monad laws:
 trait Functor[F[_]]: ... trait Monad[F[_]] extends Functor[F]: ... def leftIdentityLaw[A: Arbitrary, B: Arbitrary[A &#x3D;&gt; F[B]]](using mA: Monad[F]): Unit &#x3D; it(&quot;should satisfy the left identity law&quot;): forAll { (x: A, f: A &#x3D;&gt; F[B]) &#x3D;&gt; mA.unit(x).flatMap(f) shouldBe f(x) } 
 However, the leftIdentityLaw test doesn&#x27;t compile. What would be the corect type signature for it?
 Edit:
 After some trial and error, I found the a working solution, but I don&#x27;t like it having an unused arbAToFB name.
 trait MonadLaws[F[_]] { this: AnyFunSpec &amp; ScalaCheckPropertyChecks &#x3D;&gt; def leftIdentityLaw[A: Arbitrary, B: Arbitrary](using arbAToFB: Arbitrary[A &#x3D;&gt; F[B]], mA: Monad[F]): Unit &#x3D; it(&quot;should satisfy the left identity law&quot;): forAll { (x: A, f: A &#x3D;&gt; F[B]) &#x3D;&gt; mA.unit(x).flatMap(f) shouldBe f(x) }

I have worked in scala for 6 months but it was an existing codebase and there were certain code style, most of them was written like map, filter etc. I would like to learn scala from the ground. Do you guys recommend any comprehensive books?

                              <span>I&#x27;m just planning on a personal project. I like Elm, and I want to give PureScript a try on the backend.
 Is there an easy way/tool to share types between PureScript and Elm, so I can stay a little more DRY, at least with the data I send between frontend and backend?

                              <span>This is a recurring issue for me when I do Advent of Code, which I do in Haskell - some problems are really suited for using memoization. I tried to condense my confusion to as close to the pain point as possible, and I am hoping someone here can help me understand where my thinking goes wrong. Here is a code block with a few different ways of calculating a Fibonacci sequence:
 import Data.Function.Memoize main :: IO () main &#x3D; do -- slow print $ fib 35 -- fast print $ fibMemo 35 -- slow print $ (memoize fibMemo2) 35 fib :: Int -&gt; Int fib 0 &#x3D; 1 fib 1 &#x3D; 1 fib n &#x3D; fib (n-1) + fib (n-2) fibMemo :: Int -&gt; Int fibMemo &#x3D; memoize fib&#x27; where fib&#x27; 0 &#x3D; 1 fib&#x27; 1 &#x3D; 1 fib&#x27; n &#x3D; fibMemo (n-1) + fibMemo (n-2) fibMemo2 :: Int -&gt; Int fibMemo2 0 &#x3D; 1 fibMemo2 1 &#x3D; 1 fibMemo2 n &#x3D; (memoize fibMemo2) (n-1) + (memoize fibMemo2) (n-2) 
 Note here that two functions are really slow - both the first and last one. But in my mind, the second one (which is fast) is exactly the same as the third one (which is slow). What is the difference here? Both of them recursively call memoize on themselves, which tells me I am missing something critical.

                              <span>Hi,
 I just started trying org, org-roam, and org-roam-bibtex for my note-taking workflow, and I found them fantastic. However, I ran into one problem that I cannot customize them to open the corresponding paper pdf of any org-roam file using Google Chrome.
 What I want to achieve is that after pressing C-c C-o on the following ROAM_REFS, 
 https://preview.redd.it/jn4cx4qeha7c1.png?width&#x3D;546&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;53bbf2a567aeb177afaa81f37124273c0d017337
 by pressing p in the following popup window, the pdf will be opened in Google Chrome.

 What I tried is to modify the variable org-file-apps, like below.
 https://preview.redd.it/b5d4n5oxha7c1.png?width&#x3D;886&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;ac1bb850b6a37a510dc88a127e7a450514fee13e
 What I observed is that now when I export my org-roam notes to pdf, e.g. pressing C-c C-e l o, it will be opened in Google Chrome. But when I press p in the popup window, the corresponding pdf of the original paper is still not opened in Google Chrome.
 How could I solve this? I appreciate any help you can provide.

                              <span>There are things about data engineering I&#x27;ve really enjoyed, but after 2 years it has started to become quite stale and boring. The part of the job I have enjoyed the most is when I get to work with python and spark (the more software engineery stuff with data engineering). So given that scala is the language spark was written in, and what many data engineers had been using for a long time (and some still do), I decided it could be worthwhile learning.
 Also, I&#x27;d really like to transition into a more software engineering centric role in my next job, and have been learning Scala as a means by which to achieve this. My logic was that if I learn Scala the worst case scenario is that I get better at coding, (data engineering with python will only take you so far in terms of developing software engineering skills), and even though it is dying out as a language for DE in favour of python, it might help with employability for DE jobs. The upside is I may be able to get a Scala Developer/Engineer role that pays better, and which I may be better suited to and enjoy more.
 After reading a lot of posts on this subreddit, it seems people are growing increasingly pessimistic regarding the employability of scala, so I wanted some general advice regarding my approach. My current plan has been: Learn Scala -&gt; Personal Projects -&gt; Scala Data Engineer / Scala Engineer -&gt; Scala Engineer/Developer. From what I have seen online Scala Engineer Jobs in my area (London) are very lucrative but I imagine there is a high barrier to entry, and worry that this transition isn&#x27;t realistic.
 I&#x27;m currently working through the Scala RocktheJVM course and am enjoying what I have learnt so far, and will likely continue regardless. Any advice/thoughts would be much appreciated.

Swimming with Ideas
This is another installment of the What Are You Working On? thread. Please be courageous and add to this thread by telling us what is happening in and around your ZK journey. Join the community and enlighten us about your knowledge path trajectory. I do this for selfish reasons. It helps me clarify my goals and visualize my thinking. And sometimes, a conversation sparks an idea worth exploring. This is an invitation to you to up your participation in the discussion.
Ideas I&#x27;m exploring with my ZK:
WikiLinks - how to format them, how to convert them from one format to another, why they are formatted the way they are.
Working with the garage door open.
How to get more than 3.8% of the zettelnauts who view this thread to post a quick response sharing their battles with note-taking. How&#x27;s the ZK journey going for you?
How the transience of thought relates to international deep, geo, and aerospace industries.
The goals and structure of a revolving &#x27;Continuous Review/Refactoring of Structure Notes&quot;
Things I&#x27;m reading:
Calvino, Italo. The path to the spiders&#x27; nests. 1947.
Garmus, Bonnie. Lessons in chemistry. 2022.
Parrish, Shane. Clear thinking: turning ordinary moments into extraordinary results. 2023.
Sencea and Gioia, Dana. Sentences from Seneca. 2023.

                              <span>Two years into having a kid, and one week into losing my laptop to a water spill, I decided that the future was mobile.
For the past several years, I’ve been primarily using and writing notes on my laptop. When I needed to access these notes on the go, I used 1Writer. I treated this as a read-only exercise. I didn’t really trust the syncing, and so I would use Drafts to jot down something that I wanted to add to my notes later. 1Writer was initially terrible for searching 10,000 files, and so made even read-only access somewhat pointless. However, a note to the developer improved things significantly, and then learning to sort by title rather than by other attributes, made 10,000 notes workable. Still, this was always going to be my last resort platform.
I’ve loved timestamp prefixes, and …</span>

                              <span>Hello everyone  
I recently discovered the Zettelkasten method and was instantly intrigued. Currently I am in school studying Software Development and have always wanted to learn Game Development on top of that.
I&#x27;ve been looking for how to notes from schooling and game development and turn it into a Zettelkasten to help me along my journey but can&#x27;t find a lot of resources on it and the few I do, it doesn&#x27;t make sense to me.
Any help is much appreciated!</span>

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m doing monoids from CIS 194. Below are functions/data I will talk about: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; {- For learning purpose I have rewritten Monoid to Monoid&#x27; and mempty with mappend to mempty&#x27; and mappend&#x27; -}
 newtype Product a &#x3D; Product {getProduct&#x27; :: Integer} deriving (Show, Ord, Eq, Num)
 instance Num a &#x3D;&gt; Monoid&#x27; (Product a) where mempty&#x27; &#x3D; Product 1 mappend&#x27; &#x3D; (*)
 getProduct :: Product Integer -&gt; Integer getProduct (Product x) &#x3D; x
 prod :: [Integer] -&gt; Integer prod &#x3D; getProduct&#x27; . mconcat&#x27; . map Product &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; Now the problem I have is, if I use getProduct&#x27; from record syntax, I have error in prod function &quot;Ambiguous type variable ‘a0’ arising from a use of ‘mconcat&#x27;’ prevents the constraint ‘(Monoid&#x27; (Product a0))’ from being solved.&quot; but If I use getProduct, that is function defined under Product, everything works. Why is it like that, is record syntax is hiding something from me?
 EDIT: Added Monoid&#x27; (Product a) instance on comment request.

 I watched a video by Alexis king about laziness but I don’t have patience for videos so didn’t finish it.
 Can you please give me an idea of what benefits laziness brings to Haskell? And can you share of a paper or a good blog post that talks about this? Thanks

                              <span>Hi. I wrote a quick minesweeper clone in scala.js w/ laminar to test them out. Website is here, code here.
 Besides the code not being the cleanest (beginner programmer – all advice welcome), there&#x27;s one bug I haven&#x27;t been able to crush: on Firefox you can accidentally right-click a cleared square and get a context menu popup. This is not desirable, as it at best slows you down and at worst leads to accidentally leaving the page via said menu.
 Relevant code from Main.scala:
 dom.document.addEventListener(&quot;contextmenu&quot;, e &#x3D;&gt; e.preventDefault()) 
 On Chromium things work as expected – no context menu anywhere, ever.
 What I&#x27;ve tried:
  
onContextMenu --&gt; { e &#x3D;&gt; e.preventDefault() } literally everywhere: buttons, tbody, table etc.
 onContextMenu --&gt; { e &#x3D;&gt; println(&quot;here&quot;) } similarly everywhere to find out that when right-clicking a disabled button, nothing on the page seems to receive the pointer event, meaning there&#x27;s nothing to block it, which then leads to Firefox opening the context menu
 pointer-events: none; for disabled buttons, which breaks things on (at least some) mobile browsers since the browser thinks that a tap on a disabled button was &quot;really&quot; meant for its neighbour, which is... not good!
  
So, is this something that needs to be fixed in Firefox, or am I missing something obvious?
 Thanks.
 edit. This is a Firefox bug https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id&#x3D;1543196 
 Minimal reproducible example for this particular case just because:
  
  body { margin: 0; padding: 0; height: 100vh; }  
  No context menu Context menu :(

 ** TODO [#B] Hi I am a priority B that should be returned tighter with other ones
 ​
 this is my config file 
  
(defun my--org-sort-file-TODO-and-priority () 
 &quot;Sort the current Org file by TODO items with priority tags.&quot;

​
 when I run the shortcut C-c s I get a message: Nothing to sort, although my file where I run the command has TODO with priorities tag. 
 ​
 I tried to use &#x60;message&#x60; Lisp to log a string match to use the *Scratch* buffer, but just I am not able to debug, if someone could give me an hint would be great for my future lisp knowledge, I know there are other methods, to achieve my use case but I want to pass this function to understand why is going wrong.

                              <span>Does it possible that every entry/headline has it&#x27;s own footnote number?
 When org-footnote-section set to nil, footnotes will be placed locally in each headline, but footnote numbers are shared between all headline(, which means I can&#x27;t have two headlines use the same number, says [fn:1]), 
 and the exported html file collect all footnotes together again(, which I don&#x27;t want).
 So, does it possible that every entry/headline has it&#x27;s own footnote number?

                              <span>Today, I had a moment of reflection and realized how fortunate I am to be part of a community that embraces functional programming as a livelihood. It&#x27;s not about intelligence, but rather standing on the shoulders of giants—open source maintainers, content creators, the Scala Centre, EPFL and everyone that makes this community welcoming for people like me.
 I want to express my sincere appreciation to the entire ecosystem and the individuals who contribute to it. Scala changed my life for the better and for all the trash it gets sometimes, it made me fall in love with programming again, and it is great to get paid for something you would do for free either way.
 Amidst the ups and downs, Scala has been a source of inspiration, reminding me of the joy of playing with math and computers for a living. Thanks to everyone who makes this possible.

                              <span>Hello there!
 I have recently made the switch from Obsidian to Emacs Org-mode, and it&#x27;s been a delight. Yet, I found one important issue that keeps bugging me: 
 I tried to install org-roam from MELPA, which caused my org to be automatically updated from my current version (9.3) to the more recent one (9.6). 
 The problem is, whenever this happens, I lose all my configurations, together with functionality of org-mode, web-mode and other stuff I&#x27;ve installed. Instead, I am greeted by this: (invalid-function org-assert-version), and a message saying there was a problem in loading the configuration file. Running Emacs --debug-init on the terminal would create a long list of errors. The only way to solve this is by going into my ~/.emacs.d/elpa/ directory and manually removing the files for the updated org mode version.
 For reference, all my configurations are in a ~/.emacs document.
 How can I update org-mode without loosing all my configs?
 Thanks a lot!
 P.S. I&#x27;m fairly new to programming and Emacs, sorry if this was not properly oriented or if there is information missing.

Equivalence problems with StreamGraph by Jonathan Dowland
The StrIoT Logical Optimiser applies a set of rewrite rules to a stream-processing program, generating a set of variants that can be reasoned about, ranked, and deployed. The problem I’ve been tackling is that a variant may appear to be semantically equivalent to another, but compare (with &#x3D;&#x3D;) as distinct.

                              <span>Greetings,
I come to you, specialists and sages of the Zettelkasten, in a quest to understand something I cannot wrap my head around… 
I&#x27;ve read How to Take Smart Notes, I&#x27;ve practiced the method successfully for writing fiction, but there is something I cannot yet figure (or maybe need validation to implement?).
How do you manage that which you know you do not know, or do not know enough, or realize you did not know? That is:
How do you manage questions, which can be ongoing on life? (&quot;How to be a good man in the 21st Century?&quot;)
How do you navigate and evolve forming practices? (Like: the Zettelkasten method, which you hone in through practice, and evolve insight: &quot;this works for me, I should pay attention to that&quot;)
How do you walk back on ideas that do not serve you anymore, or that you realize were false? (like an early 20st Century scientist witnessing the ether being disproved, meaning all theories and constructs pertaining to it become completely irrelevant apart from scientific history)
I guess the underlying issue is &quot;transient&quot; content, which is a little bit at odds with the concept of permanent / evergreen note / Zettel. Now I know a Zettelkasten is personal, that truth is unattainable and everything is potentially transient – please bear with me here 🙂 I also know, in Luhmann&#x27;s words, that the Zettelkasten is a &quot;septic tank&quot;.
And yet. What would be best practices for capturing accruing, unformed ideas and questions, which would free the user by knowing they will not pollute the system down the road if they turn out to be dead ends?
Is it a simple matter of trusting that linking will isolate irrelevant content? Or should you prune links later, remove notes – but potentially destroying the path of thinking that led you to where you are now? Is it a much simpler matter of redirecting the energy of the system simply by altering the geometry of structure notes?
Any insight and especially technical approaches would be hugely appreciated. Thank you!</span>

                              <span>Hi,
 In org-mode I would like to insert #begin_verse and #+end_verse surrounding existing text that is marked rather than inserting insert #begin_verse and #+end_verse at the cursor point and having to copy and paste text 
 &lt;v Tab for adding #+begin_verse and #+end_verse doesn&#x27;t do this. 
 Any time saving ideas welcome. I need to mark poems in a large document of mixed text.
 Thank you

                              <span>Hey, I want to use a proof tree library in latex for my work. I did found some sty files, but all of them have multiline definitions, so I cannot just put a #+LATEX_HEADER: behind every line. neither can I just make a macro and deal with it manually as it is more than 1000 lines long.
 Is there a way to use it directly or any convenient way to change it? Any other way to write proof trees would also work.
 PS: I use Doom Emacs

                              <span>Hey, I am trying to make diagrams using tikz, and all of the arrows seem render without arrow heads, like.
 ​
 Rendered output
 given by the following block of code.
 \begin{tikzpicture}[shorten &gt;&#x3D;1pt,node distance&#x3D;2cm,on grid,&gt;&#x3D;{Stealth[round]}, every state/.style&#x3D;{draw&#x3D;blue!50,very thick,fill&#x3D;blue!20}] \node[state,initial] (q_0) {$q_0$}; \node[state] (q_1) [above right&#x3D;of q_0] {$q_1$}; \node[state] (q_2) [below right&#x3D;of q_0] {$q_2$}; \path[-&gt;] (q_0) edge node [above left] {0} (q_1) edge node [below left] {1} (q_2) (q_1) edge [loop above] node {0} () (q_2) edge [loop below] node {1} (); \end{tikzpicture} 
 this is a sample piece of code from the tikz automata library.
 Also I use Doom Emacs, and I am sort of new.

                              <span>I had been following this guide on YT about using Obsidian for Zettelkastens and it mentions the use of an &quot;index note&quot; as an index for other Zettels so that they can be found. I have been following it since.
However, as my Zettelkasten grows, I&#x27;m starting to have trouble finding each index note. How do you solve this problem of being unable to find the first note? How do you &quot;enter&quot; the Zettel, per se?</span>
