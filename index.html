This is another installment of the What Are You Working On? thread. Add to this discussion by telling us about your zettelkasten journey. Share with us what you&#x27;re learning. Sharing helps me and, hopefully, you, too. It helps me clarify my goals and visualize my thinking. And sometimes, a conversation sparks a magical moment where we can dive into an idea worth exploring. We&#x27;d love to hear more from you.  ü´µüèº
Ideas I&#x27;m exploring with my ZK:
A mindset that revolves around the organization and clarity of thought processes in note-making. How notes are proxies for ideas, and if I want clarity in my ideas, I need clarity in my notes.
Again, with the mindset. Having a mindset that matches the challenge is the key to flourishing.

                              <span>This version brings some minor enhancements to Iron&#x27;s internals and API as well as support for another library: Borer.
 Main changes
 First order types support
 Iron now provides refinement methods for first order types:
 List(1, 2, 3).refineAllOption[Positive] //Some(List(1, 2, 3)): List[Int :| Positive] List(-1, 2, 3).refineAllOption[Positive] //None 
 Such methods exist for:
  
Imperative (refine/refineUnsafe)
 Option
 Either
 &quot;Further&quot; equivalents
  
Borer support
 Iron now supports Borer&#x27;s codec derivation:
 type Username &#x3D; String :| DescribedAs[Not[Blank], &quot;Username must not be blank&quot;] type Age &#x3D; Int :| DescribedAs[Positive, &quot;Age must be positive&quot;] case class User(name: String :| Not[Blank], age: Int :| Positive) derives Codec Json.decode(&quot;&quot;&quot;{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;hey&quot;,&quot;age&quot;:25}&quot;&quot;&quot;.getBytes).to[User] //Right(...) Json.decode(&quot;&quot;&quot;{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;age&quot;:25}&quot;&quot;&quot;.getBytes).to[User] //Left(ValidationFailure(&quot;Username must not be blank&quot;)) 
 Other changes
  
Gen/Arbitrary instances for types such as List[Int :| Positive] will not fail anymore, even for big sizes.
 refine is now deprecated in favor of refineUnsafe
 Upgraded doobie dependency to 1.0.0-RC5
 Minor changes to existing documentation
  
Adopters
 Marss was added to the list of adopters.

                              <span>A couple of days back I made a post here asking how I can replicate my Emacs configuration for Front-end web dev in case I have to use a new computer. Some asked me to share my configuration.
 I installed the following packages from MELPA:
  
Company
 Emmet-mode
 lsp-mode
 web-mode
 yasnippet
  
I added these lines to my .emacs:
 ‚Äã
 (require &#x27;web-mode) (add-to-list &#x27;auto-mode-alist &#x27;(&quot;\\.html?\\&#x27;&quot; . web-mode)) (add-to-list &#x27;auto-mode-alist &#x27;(&quot;\\.css\\&#x27;&quot; . web-mode)) (add-to-list &#x27;auto-mode-alist &#x27;(&quot;\\.phtml\\&#x27;&quot; . web-mode)) (add-to-list &#x27;auto-mode-alist &#x27;(&quot;\\.tpl\\.php\\&#x27;&quot; . web-mode)) (add-to-list &#x27;auto-mode-alist &#x27;(&quot;\\.[agj]sp\\&#x27;&quot; . web-mode)) (add-to-list &#x27;auto-mode-alist &#x27;(&quot;\\.as[cp]x\\&#x27;&quot; . web-mode)) (add-to-list &#x27;auto-mode-alist &#x27;(&quot;\\.erb\\&#x27;&quot; . web-mode)) (add-to-list &#x27;auto-mode-alist &#x27;(&quot;\\.mustache\\&#x27;&quot; . web-mode)) (add-to-list &#x27;auto-mode-alist &#x27;(&quot;\\.djhtml\\&#x27;&quot; . web-mode)) (defun my-web-mode-hook () &quot;Hooks for Web mode.&quot; (setq web-mode-markup-indent-offset 2) (setq web-mode-css-indent-offset 2) (setq web-mode-code-indent-offset 2) ) (add-hook &#x27;web-mode-hook &#x27;my-web-mode-hook) (require &#x27;emmet-mode) (add-hook &#x27;web-mode-hook &#x27;emmet-mode) ;; Auto-start when the web-mode starts (add-hook &#x27;emmet-mode-hook (lambda () (setq emmet-indent-after-insert nil))) (add-hook &#x27;emmet-mode-hook (lambda () (setq emmet-indentation 2))) ;; indent 2 spaces. (require &#x27;lsp-mode) (add-hook &#x27;web-mode-hook #&#x27;lsp-deferred) 
 I installed VSCodes&#x27;s language servers by running this command on the terminal:
 npm install -g vscode-langservers-extracted 
 I added the directory (where the language server was installed) to my PATH variable.
 That&#x27;s all. This config provides me with HTML/CSS autocomplete, autoclosing HTML tags and syntax checking CSS syntax.
 Any tips/opinions would be appreciated. I have not yet been able to get syntax checking of HTML, like what VSCode does (highlighting misspelled tags in red)

 Anyone had the same experience and know how to fix it? Or maybe where I should report a bug?

                              <span>Hi,
 In python it is possible to create a class that inherits a slew of methods and properties, how can I make these visible in emacs?
 People often mention speedbar,occur or imenu, but these only deal with the structure present in the current buffer. I need a way to see the entire resulting object and all of its methods and properties.
 I have been looking for a solution to this for a minute now and all I have right now is to open a python shell, import the class and do ¬¥¬¥dir(MyClass)¬¥ and parse this.
 ECB is broken for emacs29, pyreverse breaks on our codebase and many people here mention just using a jump-to-definition type of function, which I consider to be only better than poking in the dark by having a cigarette lighter on you.
 Is it possible at all in emacs? 
 ‚Äã
 thx,
 S

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been trying to get org-noter to work as demonstrated in this video by its maintainer. Here is a minimal init.el:
 (require &#x27;package) (setq package-archives &#x27;((&quot;elpa&quot; . &quot;https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/&quot;) (&quot;melpa&quot; . &quot;https://melpa.org/packages/&quot;) (&quot;org&quot; . &quot;https://orgmode.org/elpa/&quot;))) (package-initialize) (unless package-archive-contents (package-refresh-contents)) (unless (package-installed-p &#x27;use-package) (package-install &#x27;use-package)) (require &#x27;use-package) (setq use-package-always-ensure t) (use-package org :mode (&quot;\\.org\\&#x27;&quot; . org-mode)) (use-package pdf-tools) (pdf-tools-install) (use-package org-noter) 
 But unlike in the video (timestamp1 timestamp2), my pdf-buffer does not highlight passages in the pdf that have annotations. Things I have tried to no avail:
  
looking into the the maintainer&#x27;s emacs configuration, but nothing springs to my eye there.
 playing around with org-noter-highlight-selected-text as mentioned in this solved issue
 installing packages such as org-pdftools
  
Does anybody have an init.el with an org-noter setup that highlights pdfs, which they would be willing to share with me?

 The problem I have is with the following statement:
  syntax &#x3D; &quot;proto3&quot;; 
 Even though, in the mode, syntax is declared as a keyword (c-other-decl-kwds) it is not highlighted. My guess is that it is not declared in the right category because syntax &#x3D; &quot;proto3&quot;; is considered as an assignment in C/C++.
 Can anyone point me to the documentation to highlight syntax in this case but only if its followed by &#x3D; &quot;proto3&quot;;? Also, I&#x27;d like to highlight in the same color as import if possible, is there a way to change the color?

 title, I am working in a django repo and most classes have inheritances sometimes 8 levels deep and it is as good as impossible for me to have an understanding of what this class at point is capable of.

                              <span>AUCTeX (Emacs modes for LaTeX documents) adds metadata to the end of LaTeX files like this:
 %%% Local Variables: %%% TeX-master: &quot;master&quot; %%% End: 
 I&#x27;m slightly bothered by this. How portable is this syntax when the same LaTeX file is opened by a different IDE, such as VSCode, TeXLive or (cloud-based) Overleaf? This is a concern when collaborating with others on editing a LaTeX file.
 Is it possible for the original LaTeX file to be untouched, while saving the &quot;local variable&quot; information in a different place for AUCTeX to access?

                              <span>For quite some time I&#x27;ve had electric-pair-inhibit-predicate set to electric-pair-conservative-inhibit, which prevents the automatic insertion of closing delimiters in certain situations‚Äîeven when electric-pair-mode is active.
 Recently I tried to get to the bottom of what this actually does, in case I wanted to further tweak its behavior. Unfortunately, I&#x27;ve found myself a little confused by some small things.
 The documentation for electric-pair-inhibit-predicate states
  
The function is called with a single char (the opening char just inserted). If it returns non-nil, then electric-pair-mode will not insert a matching closer.
  
The source code for electric-pair-conservative-inhibit is
 (defun electric-pair-conservative-inhibit (char) (or ;; I find it more often preferable not to pair when the ;; same char is next. (eq char (char-after)) ;; Don&#x27;t pair up when we insert the second of &quot;&quot; or of ((. (and (eq char (char-before)) (eq char (char-before (1- (point))))) ;; I also find it often preferable not to pair next to a word. (eq (char-syntax (following-char)) ?w))) 
 I find this code a little confusing and am left with a few small questions.
  
Is there any difference between calling (char-after) and (following-char) in the context of this function?
 
Inside the and, why is it tested that char is equal to (char-before)? If char was just inserted, then I would imagine that this will just always be true.

 But still EGLOT never managed to be able to connect to it,
 until
 For Python, I just installed pylsp, changed my config to use it, and suddenly EGLOT was able to connect! prompting both servers, I chose pylsp and it works well, and even has the module functions when you import them in the popup. I shutdown the server and chose the pyright option and was disconnected after connecting (RIP).
 I did the same thing for clangd and installed a newer version of it, likewise, EGLOT managed to conenct.
 Moral of the story? Update your LSP&#x27;s or just install a different one? :P
 I just need to get external libraries for C to be recognised by Company and then I&#x27;m good.

                              <span>In order to improve my geek chops I have obtained a compact keyboard with no function, arrow keys and PageUp/PageUp/Home group and the going is getting tough, but I&#x27;m sure I will get there.
 One of my problems now in Emacs is to navigate up and down the M-x list which usually involves the up and down arrow keys. Those keys are available by using the function key in combination with the others, and also with the help of the mouse in GUI programs like this browser, but that is CHEATING.
 What are the native Emacs keys for that?
 Are there some cheatsheets that can help with these keyboards, for both regular emacs and evil-mode?
 I&#x27;m mostly an evil person, but having to switch to normal mode to navigate makes learning those Emacs key combinations worthwhile.

                              <span>This has been a problem for me ever since I started using it. I press C-c C-w for example, and it says it&#x27;s not defined. I have to switch to the treemacs window first before I can do that.
 In some rare cases, even when I click on the Treemacs window, it&#x27;s not actually active. I wasn&#x27;t able to reproduce this.
 I can&#x27;t seem to be able to remember which window I&#x27;m actually on since I keep switching between them often I keep forgetting to check the statusbar to verify which window is actually active. Even when I&#x27;m trying to write code, sometimes I forget whether I&#x27;m in Insert or Normal mode and there seems to be some other mode sometimes that I can&#x27;t get out of and when I type ESC, it takes that as part of a new macro. After trying it frustratingly, I manage to get back to the mode where I can actually start typing.
 Even having to check the statusbar every time before I need to do something does not seem correct to me. Is this what everybody does or am I missing something fundamental?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve started experimenting with the javascript framework Astro. 
 Astro templates have their own file extension: .astro.
 Unsurprisingly, by default emacs doesn&#x27;t know anything .astro files. 
 I can load web-mode for .astro files.
 .asto files seem to combine css and js.
 This would seem to make it suitable to use with web-mode.
 This seems to give me syntax highlighting and indentation. 
 It&#x27;d be great to get completions. 
 Over the last few months I&#x27;ve been using lsp-mode for completions.
 But because my lisp knowledge is limited, I&#x27;m reliant on finding snippets online for configuring lsp-mode.
 Do any emacs&#x27;ers here use astro?
 If so, what does your configuration look like?

                              <span>Hello,
 I&#x27;m struggling with setting up an org-roam capture template that adds notes to a single, pre-defined file as org-mode headers instead of saving each note as a separate file.
 ‚Äã
 The following tests write the note into a file of my choosing, but the properties drawer with the ID is placed at the top of the file, not under the created header.
 Test 1:
 (add-to-list &#x27;org-roam-capture-templates &#x27;(&quot;a&quot; &quot;test&quot; entry &quot;* ${title}&quot; :if-new (file &quot;/mypath/myfile.org&quot;))) 
 ‚Äã
 Test 2:
 (add-to-list &#x27;org-roam-capture-templates &#x27;(&quot;a&quot; &quot;test&quot; entry &quot;* ${title}&quot; :if-new (file+head &quot;/mypath/myfile.org&quot; &quot;#+title: ${title}\n&quot;))) 
 ‚Äã
 Test 3:
 (add-to-list &#x27;org-roam-capture-templates &#x27;(&quot;a&quot; &quot;test&quot; plain &quot;* ${title}&quot; :if-new (file+head &quot;/mypath/myfile.org&quot; &quot;#+title: ${title}\n&quot;))) 
 ‚Äã
 This test is adapted from https://systemcrafters.net/build-a-second-brain-in-emacs/keep-a-journal/ and will create a header with the properties drawer + ID - but that will always stay the top header of the file. Subsequent captures are placed within the same file but without property drawer and ID:
 (add-to-list &#x27;org-roam-capture-templates &#x27;(&quot;a&quot; &quot;test&quot; plain &quot;* ${title}&quot; :if-new (file+head+olp &quot;/mypath/myfile.org&quot; &quot;#+title: ${title}\n&quot; (&quot;${title}&quot;)))) 
 ‚Äã
 I&#x27;m currently making things work using regular org-mode capture templates. But I&#x27;d rather use org-roam capture templates so I can create new notes on the fly when searching for notes and finding they don&#x27;t exist yet.
 ‚Äã
 Any ideas what else I can try to get this to work?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been attempting The One Billion Row Challenge in Haskell and my current solution is embarrassingly slow, taking roughly 6m15s. I&#x27;m still trying to eke out single-threaded performance for now, and I&#x27;m constraining myself to GHC boot packages (although I think &#x60;async&#x60; and &#x60;parallel&#x60; would probably be in the spirit of the challenge). With profiling it seems like currently most of my time is spent inserting into a Set in order to keep the weather station names sorted, but I don&#x27;t know how to do better. Does anyone have advice and/or suggestions for how to optimise my solution?
 Edit: I optimised set insertion and now it&#x27;s no longer the bottleneck, the new runtime is 3m20s:

                              <span>Hello,
 I was wondering if there are any conventions for the org filetree structure.
 Do you all just make directories and files randomly or how do i do this? All in one directory, or several for different topics, or do you even put everything in one file?

                              <span>Okay, I&#x27;ve finally gotten around to setting up emacs-lsp-booster, and my first impression is: it works. And it works really well. I already liked LSP-Mode in general, but it was too slow for my very large Unreal project. I&#x27;d get constant timeouts, suggestions and completions just outright wouldn&#x27;t work, and it was a very disappointing experience.
 I switched to LSP-Bridge because it promised better performance, and that was 100% true. It did completions where LSP-Mode and Eglot would choke, but it was a bit of a hassle to set up. I&#x27;m on a Windows machine and that always makes things a little more complicated for me. I had to make sure to write a project-root-finding-function or it wouldn&#x27;t understand my project setup (devs: not everyone uses git, stop assuming that we do), etc.
 Ultimately, I&#x27;m switching back to LSP-Mode because it integrates with xref and helm and various other things a lot better. The LSP-Bridge built-in completion is adequate, but it worked in ways that I wasn&#x27;t expecting/didn&#x27;t like (the lsp-bridge-find-references function, for example, would split the buffer, and when I quit it, sometimes it would kill the buffer I&#x27;d been visiting as well. User error? A bug? Don&#x27;t know.) You just end up having more flexibility with lsp-mode.
 What I can tell you is that no matter how you slice it, for a project of moderate to large size, you should be using something like lsp-bridge or emacs-lsp-booster. (For reference, based on my compile-commands.json file, there are about 17000 files in my project.)
 Also, it seems that the root of this problem is emacs&#x27; ability (or lack thereof) to parse JSON efficiently. That really should be looked at; emacs-lsp-booster is a project that shouldn&#x27;t have to exist, but I&#x27;m grateful that it does.

                              <span>Have used Emacs as my daily-driver text editor for years now, but always on Linux systems. Setting it up now on my work laptop (a Mac) and having difficulty getting it to launch the way I want. If I try to run it from the terminal with the plain old emacs command, I run into the problem described here. The stty -tostop suggestion didn&#x27;t work. However, elsewhere I found the suggestion to directly invoke the application from its installation directory, e.g. /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs.
 This solves the &#x27;suspended output&#x27; issue and does indeed launch a GUI Emacs session. However, if I attempt to do this with the --init-directory flag, it fails to load the specified init.el and Emacs greets me with an &#x27;unknown option&#x27; error. On the other hand, if I run Emacs in the foreground in the terminal, the --init-directory flag works and it sets up (as much as possible) according to the specified init.el file. I&#x27;m running version 29.2
 Does anyone know how to get this to work?

                              <span>One solution to wrapping tables in the buffer is to use org-table-wrap-functions to wrap cell contents of an org table. The issue with this is that the wrapped text will be recognized as different cells when exporting to latex, and does not look the best. Would it be possible for me to define a special character sequence and an use an export filter such that if I have one of these manually inserted line breaks, that on export, the filter will essentially use a temporary buffer, search for these sequences, rejoin the cells affected, and remove the escape sequences? If so, what would be the best way to do this? Thanks.

                              <span>Hello, I&#x27;m trying to configure polymode for Databricks notebooks. They are text files that have their content like this for some NotebookExample.sql :
 -- Databricks notebook source -- MAGIC %python -- MAGIC print(&quot;Hello&quot;) -- MAGIC print(&quot;World&quot;) -- COMMAND SELECT 1 FROM table 
 I&#x27;ve tried to replicate the configuration from their documentation and got to this:
 (use-package polymode :straight t :config (define-hostmode poly-databricks-hostmode :mode &#x27;sql-mode) (define-innermode poly-python-databricks-innermode :mode &#x27;python-mode :head-matcher &quot;-- MAGIC &quot; :tail-matcher &quot;-- COMMAND &quot; :head-mode &#x27;host :tail-mode &#x27;host) (define-polymode poly-databricks-mode :hostmode &#x27;poly-databricks-hostmode :innermodes &#x27;(poly-python-databricks-innermode) ) ) 
 But this is not working as expected because from my investigations it expects to have some closed block. Like on this (another great one from u/mickeyp) post https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/polymode-multiple-major-modes-how-to-use-sql-python-in-one-buffer where the SQL code is contained with a well delimited piece of code between the:
 r&quot;&quot;&quot; CODE &quot;&quot;&quot; 
 Anyone knows if there&#x27;s a way to make it ignore the &quot;--MAGIC&quot; markers between the beginning and the end? I also tried the indent option but it seems to just work with whitespace.
 Thanks

                              <span>Hi, I have a feature in mind that I can&#x27;t find, but am also struggling to articulate, so I&#x27;m still not sure if it exists or not!
 I&#x27;m thinking of something like literate programming, but without tangling, as the source code lives in files separately from the text. Instead of source blocks containing code in the literate document, the literate document instead specifies &quot;views&quot; into the source files. The views would be specified by a file name and a line number range, and that range of lines would be visible in the literate buffer as if that was where the text lived, but it actually lives in its own source file.
 So on-disk this &quot;view src block&quot; might look like this:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 +begin_view :file src/main.rs :lines 120-124
 +end_view
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Whereas in the emacs buffer it might look like this:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 +begin_view :file src/main.rs :lines 120-124
 let rectangle &#x3D; Rectangle { length: 3.0, height: 4.0 }; let triangle &#x3D; Triangle { length: 3.0, height: 4.0 }; print_debug(&amp;rectangle); println!(&quot;Area: {}&quot;, area(&amp;rectangle));
 +end_view
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Editing text within this view would be propagated back to the source file, and adding a newline at the end of the view would increment the end of the line range.
 The motivations for this would be avoiding problems with eglot/lsp in an org document for example, or a document explaining some bits of code in detail, without committing to the full literate workflow.
 Does this have a name and does anyone know of any implementations of something similar to this? If not, does anyone have any insight into how hard this would be to achieve in emacs?

                              <span>TL;DR 1) hash-tables are faster than lists for maintaining sets of unique elements and 2) search-forward is faster than move-to-column for jumping to a specific column in an Org table
 While doing some elisp coding, I found a few tricks that anecdotally seemed to speed up my code, and then benchmarked the different versions and found that there was a measurable speedup. Below I summarize my explorations, which I hope will be of help to someone else here doing elisp hacking.
 I have a large Org file (&gt; 1MB) with more than 200 &#x27;transaction&#x27; tables that all have a fifth column with the header &#x27;Notes&#x27;. I need a method for collecting all the unique fields the fifth column of each table into a single list. Since the list is intended to be used for completion, I need this method to be as fast as ‚Ä¶</span>

                              <span>I m developing a new package for management of comments (coman). However I consider myself a beginner with emacs lisp and I would really appreciate some help.
 I&#x27;ve been using emacs for some time now so, in that regard I&#x27;m not so new. I learned a couple of things about elisp in that time. However the creation of a major mode and a package development is completely new to me. I would appreciate first of all some general feedback and constructive criticism on my code and good practices.
 Also I&#x27;d like to ask if somebody here (or maybe there&#x27;s a forum for that) would be open to give me advice from time to time. My references are usually the emacs lisp manual and internet search (i.e., emacs.stackexchange.com) but sometimes is difficult to find the exact info that you need, or the good practices or conventions. I&#x27;d appreciate if I could ask from time to time and get an experienced opinion and/or at least a good reference to solve particular problems.
 Any ideas, pointers or comments are welcome.

                              <span>I have been a happy user of project.el for a while. I also like monorepos, and I&#x27;m glad to say that the support for them is good in project.el. One thing that I haven&#x27;t figured out, is how to use project.el on projects outside of version control. I&#x27;d like to ask how I could fill that gap.
 For monorepo support, I have the following config, which probably looks straightforward to most of you.
 (defun common-lisp-project-p (dir) (directory-files dir nil &quot;.*.asd$&quot;)) (defvar monorepo-root-markers &#x27;(&quot;package.json&quot; &quot;mix.exs&quot; common-lisp-project-p)) (defun monorepo-try-find-project (dir) (when (file-exists-p dir) (let* ((root (seq-some (lambda (root-marker) (locate-dominating-file dir root-marker)) monorepo-root-markers)) (vc-backend (ignore-errors (vc-responsible-backend root)))) ;; I require a vc-backend, otherwise things break (when (and root vc-backend) (list &#x27;vc vc-backend root))))) (setq project-find-functions &#x27;(monorepo-try-find-project project-try-vc)) 
 The problem is simply that this only works for projects under version control.
 How do people deal with this while using project.el?

                              <span>I am somewhat of a novice when it comes to org mode and elisp. I&#x27;m trying to write a code block that can generate a table that is formatted in a particular way when exported as a pdf.
 Manually I can get the result I want by doing this.
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; |---+-----+-----+-----| | | foo | bar | baz | |---+-----+-----+-----| | / |  |  |  | | |  |  |  | | | 1 | a | b | | | 2 | c | d | |---+-----+-----+-----|
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 However when trying to generate the table with a code block it doesn&#x27;t output the line with the /.
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 +BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :exports results :results value table
 &#x27;( hline (&quot;&quot; &quot;foo&quot; &quot;bar&quot; &quot;baz&quot;) hline (&quot;#&quot; &quot;&quot; &quot;&quot; &quot;&quot;) (&quot;/&quot; &quot;&quot; &quot;&quot; &quot;&quot;) (&quot;#&quot; &quot;1&quot; a b) (&quot;#&quot; &quot;2&quot; c d) hline 
 )
 +END_SRC
 +RESULTS:
 |-----+-----+-----| | foo | bar | baz | |-----+-----+-----| |  |  |  | | 1 | a | b | | 2 | c | d | |-----+-----+-----|
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 What is the best way to generate the table I created manually?

                              <span>I have been trying really hard to set up Emacs for front-end web development. After a lot of trial and error I finally got the major stuff working (snippets, autocomplete, syntax checking). To do this I had to install several packages and also add some elisp to my .emacs as mentioned on the websites of those packages.
 If i need to replicate this configuration later, maybe on another machine, how can I do it easily without having to go Googling again? Like is there some code to ensure that if a particular package is not found it will be installed automatically by Emacs, so the elisp in the .emacs that deals with this package wont throw an error? I do keep a record of my .emacs in my GitHub
 I don&#x27;t know how to put this in a better way, but I just want to be able to replicate this configuration with another emacs installation without the same amount of effort.

 &gt; 2+2 [line 1] Error: Expect expression. &gt; &quot;yes&quot; [line 1] Error: Expect expression. &gt; [line 1] Error: Expect expression. &gt; true [line 1] Error: Expect expression. &gt; 
 I&#x27;ve been going through my code trying to fix it and I honestly can NOT figure out what I did wrong. I hate to just ask to look through my entire page of code and find out but idk what I&#x27;m missing, and I imagine a lot of people here have read the book too... I haven&#x27;t used Scala before this so please bear with my non-idiomatic/bad code lmao. I was mostly just trying to do what the book did without much deviation.
 Here&#x27;s my Parser &amp; Expression files, which I think are the culprits:

                              <span>I am still evaluating Scala 3 and decide to do a small imperative project (i.e. drawing a triangle with LWJGL). I immediately got bitten when I accidentally ignored a Try[Unit] and it swallowed an exception without warning:
 scala Using.Manager: use &#x3D;&gt; //... some code that threw an exception // ^-- return value not used! 
 That I forgot to handle the Try did not generate any warning, and the ignored error caused bugs in a completely different place. This sounds pretty dangerous and I think there must be a way to avoid it. Am I missing some design patterns here?

 What is the quickest laziest way to do this without loading everything into memory? Is there zipByColumn function that somebody implemented somewhere that I can steal?
 UPDATE: This is neither homework nor commercial code. I just want to use it for personal needs

                              <span>Hi all - just wanted to share a library I&#x27;ve been working on for a while. I love using Tidal but I have not found it very easy to take the source apart to target backends other than SuperDirt/OSC. For this reason, I have been working on minipat, which is largely Tidal-compatible but hopefully makes it easy to add new backends! Currently, there are two - SuperDirt and MIDI. If anyone is interested, I would love some help adding backends for DAWs like Bitwig or Renoise, turning the system into a tool for rapid composition. Anyway, check it out if you are interested. Contributions welcome. Thanks!

                              <span>I am writing a toy program.. it takes a string say &quot;tom&quot; and splits it into individual characters and gives out the following data 
 t &#x3D; thriving o &#x3D; ornate m &#x3D; mad here the adjectives thriving, ornate and mad are stored in a data structure as key value pairs eg: (&#x27;a&#x27; , &quot;awesome&quot;) 
 The issue i have is when a string has the same characters, the same adjective gets repeated and i don&#x27;t want repetitions. 
 eg:- if i give the name sebastian, the adjectives &quot;serene&quot; and &quot;awesome&quot; is repeated twice.. which i don&#x27;t want..
 It should select another adjective for the letters s and a ? How do i do that? Should i add more data structures? How do i move from one to another so as to avoid repetitions? 
 I am reproducing the code done till now below 
 ‚Äã
 -- Main.hs module Main where import qualified Data.Map as Map -- Define a map containing key-value pairs of alphabets and their values alphabetMap :: Map.Map Char String alphabetMap &#x3D; Map.fromList [ (&#x27;a&#x27;, &quot;awesome&quot;), (&#x27;b&#x27;, &quot;beautiful&quot;), (&#x27;c&#x27;, &quot;creative&quot;), (&#x27;d&#x27;, &quot;delightful&quot;), (&#x27;e&#x27;, &quot;energetic&quot;), (&#x27;f&#x27;, &quot;friendly&quot;), (&#x27;g&#x27;, &quot;graceful&quot;), (&#x27;h&#x27;, &quot;happy&quot;), (&#x27;i&#x27;, &quot;innovative&quot;), (&#x27;j&#x27;, &quot;joyful&quot;), (&#x27;k&#x27;, &quot;kind&quot;), (&#x27;l&#x27;, &quot;lovely&quot;), (&#x27;m&#x27;, &quot;mad&quot;), (&#x27;n&#x27;, &quot;nice&quot;), (&#x27;o&#x27;, &quot;ornate&quot;), (&#x27;p&#x27;, &quot;peaceful&quot;), (&#x27;q&#x27;, &quot;quiet&quot;), (&#x27;r&#x27;, &quot;radiant&quot;), (&#x27;s&#x27;, &quot;serene&quot;), (&#x27;t&#x27;, &quot;thriving&quot;), (&#x27;u&#x27;, &quot;unique&quot;), (&#x27;v&#x27;, &quot;vibrant&quot;), (&#x27;w&#x27;, &quot;wonderful&quot;), (&#x27;x&#x27;, &quot;xenial&quot;), (&#x27;y&#x27;, &quot;youthful&quot;), (&#x27;z&#x27;, &quot;zealous&quot;) ] -- Function to look up a character in the map and return its value lookupChar :: Char -&gt; String lookupChar char &#x3D; case Map.lookup char alphabetMap of Just val -&gt; val Nothing -&gt; &quot;Unknown&quot; -- Function to split a string into characters and look up their values lookupString :: String -&gt; [String] lookupString str &#x3D; map lookupChar str main :: IO () main &#x3D; do putStrLn &quot;Enter a string:&quot; input &lt;- getLine let result &#x3D; lookupString input putStrLn &quot;Result:&quot; mapM_ putStrLn result

                              <span>Hi all, newcomer here. 
 I am a technical consultant in IT. Currently I have a lot of client projects running in parallel. Every client case I log meticulously in Orgmode and it gives me and my clients a lot of comfort. Also the end product is plain text and I can store it on every knowledge repository they use. I think it upgraded me as a professional. Being organized to the max goes a long way. 
 I‚Äôm totally hooked! Orgmode is addictive! 
 2 questions: - I use doom emacs, some orgmode packages and Org Agenda. Are there any more cool packages I should know about? - ODT exports are ugly. Weird line splits. I know about using templates but is there a simple way to make them more usable out of the box?

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to migrate all Markdown files from Obsidian to org mode but but also keep the linking between files working. Anyone that has done that could point me in the right direction?
 Thanks

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I am a computer science student and one of my future lesson is on contribution to open source software. I&#x27;ve been using Emacs for 3 years now, and I always wanted to deep into Elisp. Moreover, I discovered the functional language Coq last year, and I&#x27;ve become fond of it.
 Linking those two, I&#x27;d like to contribute to Proof General, the interface for proof assistants and especially for Coq inside Emacs. Do you have any advice on how to start ? i.e how to get enough knowledge on the software, getting in touch with contributors, general manners...
 Thanks in advance !

                              <span>hi
 ‚Äã
 I have a basic question about &#x60;embark-export&#x60;
 ‚Äã
 So i can run &#x60;consult-ripgrep&#x60; and export the results using &#x60;embark-export&#x60; 
 ‚Äã
 I can modify in the exported buffer and they get reflected. 
 ‚Äã
 But i am not able to find a way to filter further or delete the result from the exported buffer.
 ‚Äã
 How do i filter the exported results further ?
 ‚Äã
 TIA

                              <span>It‚Äôs annoying to org-agenda-switch-to every time I want to adjust a clock. The clock is shown in the agenda buffer and said function jumps straight to where it is. I don‚Äôt want to make some weird custom function for something I think we could use in vanilla org mode.
 Does anyone know about something like this? Do you guys experience this same problem adjusting clocks?

 When I try to print names of faces for selected texts I get something like:

 I tried setting &#x60;(setq forge-notifications-selection &#x27;(unread))&#x60;, but it always seems to attempte load 400 pages but fails eventually.
 There are about 21000 &quot;done&quot; notifications and a few hundred unread. 
 Why are read notifications fetched at all (by default)?

                              <span>Okay, so first of all, I think it is super interesting that the shell utilities like find, ls, grep, etc. are all implemented in Eshell.
 I just don&#x27;t understand why. The native binaries are gonna be faster so what was achieved from doing a reimplementation of these utilities in Lisp? I asked ChatGPT about this and it says this enables deep integration between the shell and emacs. But, what does that even mean? Whether I type ls or grep as a shell command or the lisp version of it, the output is the same anyway. So what kind of integration are we talking about?
 I&#x27;m coming from the vim world and just been using Emacs since a few days. So I&#x27;m trying to understand it. I&#x27;m really curious what people actually do in Eshell that the other shells can&#x27;t do.
 EDIT: Got some great, insightful answers. I&#x27;m glad I asked this. Clearly there&#x27;s a lot for me to learn. This is gonna be a fun journey. Thank you everyone!

                              <span>Hello fellow emacsers,
 A question that I could not find an answer to so far is how one can expand/raise minibuffer window in emacs in a similar fashion to vim when you press &#x60;C-f&#x60; during a command. This will raise the command line prompt, allowing you to edit it with usual vim keys. An equivalent in emacs would remove the need to have copied (yanked) a long text for the prompt and paste it in the minibuffer.

 I know of &#x60;flymake-show-project-diagnostics&#x60;, but I prefer the ux of grouping errors by file. Does flymake have a different &quot;frontend&quot; that&#x27;s more tree-based?

                              <span>Hi, everyone. I wanted to post a quick tip to help other noobs like myself. I love org-capture, but I sometimes want to make a completely new file out of quick note, rather than append it to an existing org-mode file. I searched and only found outdated or kind of hard-to-understand answers. So here is a quick snippet to put into your init.el and capture templates to enable creating a new file. 
 (defun jj/open-new-project-file () (let ((fpath (read-file-name &quot;File name: &quot; &quot;~/Sync/inbox/&quot; nil nil nil))) 
 As prescribed in the org docs, this creates a new function that will prompt you for a file name to create, starting in the directory you specify in the function. Then, in your org-capture templates add:
 (&quot;i&quot; &quot;New note in Inbox&quot; plain (function jj/open-new-project-file) &quot;#+title: %?&quot;) 
 This will use your function to create the file and set your cursor ready to type the title in your new org file.
 ‚Äã
 I hope this helps someone. I know most people would probably just append to an inbox.org file or similar. I was doing the same thing, but after reading Building a Second Brain, I&#x27;m trying to separate the notes into files that can be dragged-and-dropped via Treemacs into the PARA setup I&#x27;ve made. It&#x27;s a little simpler than trying to use org-refile because in the PARA method, your directories are constantly changing and moving.
 ‚Äã
 This solution was heavily inspired by this post: https://www.jesseevers.com/org-capture-function/
 I just modified it to fit my own use case and thought someone searching on Google in the future might appreciate it. Cheers!

 I am using doom emacs and enable the latex language module and setup everything else, anyways, I am not sure how to use Latex in emacs, so I was wondering if you know of good instructions on how to do this correctly, and for my case I am not sure if I should go with org mode as well, because I have never used it, thanks for the help.

                              <span>Hello! I am an org-mode newbie and am having trouble getting a usable configuration set up. I am using Doom Emacs and have installed org-modern as well. I think there may be some problems with how they integrate together as the style is broken in agenda mode.
 The warning shown below occurs any time my cursor goes over any headings such as &quot;Important&quot; or &quot;Habits&quot; and gets stuck. I have to use my mouse or error keys to get off the heading line.
 I&#x27;m not sure how I would go about debugging this as I&#x27;m not getting any warnings or errors that gives me any real information. Does anyone have any tips to try to get more information?
 Here is my org-super-agenda part of the config
 (setq org-agenda-skip-deadline-if-done t org-agenda-include-deadlines nil org-agenda-block-separator nil org-agenda-compact-blocks t org-agenda-start-day nil ;; i.e. today org-agenda-span 1 org-agenda-start-on-weekday nil org-super-agenda-groups &#x27;(;; Each group has an implicit boolean OR operator between its selectors. (:name &quot;Important&quot; ; Optionally specify section name :todo &quot;TODAY&quot; :tag &quot;bills&quot; :priority &quot;A&quot;) (:name &quot;Habits&quot; ; Optionally specify section name :todo &quot;TODAY&quot; :habit t) (:name &quot;Errands&quot; :todo &quot;TODAY&quot; :tag &quot;errand&quot;) (:name &quot;Media&quot; :todo (&quot;TO-READ&quot; &quot;TO-WATCH&quot; &quot;WATCHING&quot;)) (:name &quot;Other&quot; :priority&lt;&#x3D; &quot;B&quot;))) (org-super-agenda-mode)

 I also searched various combination of keywords on Google, on forums, on this reddit, etc, but I didn&#x27;t find anything.
 Is there even an equivalent? Do I have to mix two styles to get some local variables?

Ordinarily I wouldn&#x27;t make an announcement for a patch release but this one is special because the major headline change is the capability to migrate from Akka to Pekko clusters as a rolling upgrade (see https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/PEKKO/Pekko+Akka+Compatibility). This is also why its a milestone release, we wan&#x27;t people to test this functionality out before making a full release.
 For more details on the release please see https://pekko.apache.org/docs/pekko/1.0/release-notes/index.html#1-0-3-m1

                              <span>I might be missing something very obvious here. I am learning Scala 3 and trying to do a test project (last experience with scala was 2.11). However, I notice that while the project is using Scala 3, build.sbt itself seems to support only Scala 2.
 Does sbt still only runs on scala 2? It feels very strange to use two different versions of the same language for the build system and the main project.
 I also see scala-cli, but I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s powerful enough to handle platform-specific dependencies like lwjgl.

                              <span>Hi,
 Is there a way to get a Haskell toolchain that just works? I&#x27;ve got sour experience with Haskell from the Linux repos (Arch). It&#x27;s huge, unwieldy and is apt to turn into a brick on update (if it used to work before the update).
 https://hub.docker.com/r/fpco/stack-build/
 This one is much better. Ideal, I&#x27;d say, if it weren&#x27;t for Docker :) . Several years ago I&#x27;ve seen a project on GitHub dedicated exactly to this purpose: A Haskell Toolchain that Just Works. Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t remember the name of the project, and can&#x27;t find it.
 The OS is Linux. Any suggestion is welcome.

GHC 9.8.2 is now available by Zubin Duggal
The GHC developers are happy to announce the availability of GHC 9.8.2.
More QualifiedDo examples by Oleg Grenrus
Qualified do-notation, QualifiedDo, is a nice syntactical extension in GHC. Probably its best property is that it changes semantics only locally, by using explicit ‚Äúannotation‚Äù: by qualifying the do keyword. This means that enabling the extension doesn‚Äôt change meaning of other &amp; existing code.

This month I wanted to read Meditations, Effective Notetaking and The Stand by Stephen King.
I usually read novels before I go to sleep, it‚Äôs the habit I use to replace the use of my phone before bed. To try to improve my english I usually read while following the audiobook (I don‚Äôt even know if it‚Äôs useful though, but I like it). Novels and other kind of fiction content is the only one I hear with an audiobook.
I read nonfiction mainly two times a day, at breakfast and when I eat my lunch with a 30 min timer to remind me when my reading session is over. I carry my pencil with me everywhere so that I can also read if I find myself waiting for someone, in ‚Ä¶</span>

Nix‚Äôs reproducible builds and its extensive package registry. That ruleset has proven to be
especially advantageous in endeavors demanding intricate dependency administration and the
maintenance of uniform build environments.
However, rules_nixpkgs is incompatible with remote execution. This is a major limitation given that remote
execution is possibly the main reason why people switch to Bazel. And that rules_nixpkgs provides a great way to configure hermetic toolchains, which are an important ingredient for reliable remote execution. There is no trivial fix as
can be seen in the related, longstanding open issue. At Tweag we
investigated a promising solution presented at Bazel eXchange 2022 (recording), but ‚Ä¶</span>

 I&#x27;ve opened a php buffer and enabled lsp-mode.
 Now, after a type a few characters the Warnings buffer pops up. 
 This is intrusive and unneccessary.
 How can I stop this from happening? 
 I&#x27;m using Emacs 29.2 on linux.

                              <span>The immense popularity of org-mode is completely justified, but I would like to caution new users against starting their Emacs journey by creating their configuration file in org-mode.
 Because that approach is useful when we want to comment code extensively, elaborate on the reasons behind specific settings in the configuration.
 This is particularly relevant when the configuration is complex or when creating tutorials for others.
 A great example of such configuration is https://protesilaos.com/emacs/dotemacs.
 However, these needs do not apply to beginners or even moderately advanced users.
 And these functionalities come with significant costs:
  
Increased difficulty and complexity
 Increased boilerplate with +begin/end src blocks
 Complicates debugging
 Requires additional steps befo‚Ä¶</span>

                              <span>So my vanilla GNU Emacs (no Doom, no Spacemacs, etc) with catppuccin-theme looks like [see image below] when looking at my home directory, which isn&#x27;t very cool. It looks decent enough when actually editing text, but the bland white colours when browsing directories just doesn&#x27;t do it for me. The catppuccin/emacs git promised me this, and mine looks nothing like that. Probably because the example uses Doom, which I don&#x27;t like and I&#x27;m not willing to use.

                              <span>When you look at a consult/marginalia mini buffer, the right hand column are descriptions of the item in the list. So if you look at the ctl-x-map variable in the mini buffer it says
 Default keymap for C-x commands.
 Is there a way to do an isearch or regex search of these descriptions from within the mini buffer? So that I can filter the list of candidates based on text in those descriptions, instead of the names of the commands/variables/functions/etc?
 I know you could embark export the list of candidates and then search them that way and that works with small lists but embark export does a lot of things in the buffer that I don&#x27;t always need. If I just want to find something, don&#x27;t know what it&#x27;s called but do have an idea of what it does, this could be a very helpful way of refining the list of candidates.

 Is there something like M-x &quot;view feed at point&quot;?
 (i don&#x27;t need full rss reader functionality, i just need to quicly browse feed url to understand format of feed entries, if there are new ones, etc (for programming purporses))

                              <span>I use both RefTeX and company-reftex for latex documents. For choosing the bibliographic reference, I much prefer company-reftex. But I like how C-c ] (reftex-citation) allows choosing from a list of citation formats (ditto for reftex-reference). The problem is that reftex-citation takes you to RefTeX&#x27;s mechanism for choosing the bibliographic reference, which is not company-reftex.
 So I am now doing this:
  ;; From my reftex-cite-format; for real, this is a longer list (defvar my-cite-options &#x27;(&quot;\\cite[][]{}&quot; &quot;\\citep[][]{}&quot; &quot;\\citealp[][]{}&quot; &quot;\\citep[][p.~]{}&quot;)) (defun my-cite-menu () &quot;Insert citation based on user choice.&quot; (interactive) (insert (completing-read &quot;Choose citation type: &quot; my-cite-options)) (backward-char) (company-complete)) ;; Preserve muscle memory (bind-key (kbd &quot;C-c [&quot;) &#x27;my-cite-menu reftex-mode-map) 
 (Same comments apply to reftex-reference, where I reuse my reftex-ref-style-alist, and create a my-reference-menu).
 This seems to me like the obvious solution because: a) it preserves muscle memory; b) I can reuse my lists of citation options and reference styles, and if I wanted to go back to a pure-reftex solution it would be simple; c) I can continue easily choosing structure; d) I use company-reftex; e) it seems simple enough.
 But I have not found anything similar when searching for it. I wonder if I am doing something silly, or reinventing a wheel (and ending up with a square wheel as a result, given my elisp ignorance).

                              <span>Recently, I&#x27;ve started using Emacs again, mainly because Emacs 29.2 has built-in eglot and treesit. I spent about a week configuring it to see if the current Emacs can achieve the smoothness of lsp code completion on par with Neovim.
 My system is a MacBook Pro M1 MAX, so there should be no problem with hardware performance.
 I am using emacs-plus@29 and have enabled nativecomp. Here are the parts related to lsp code completion and performance in my configuration, I did everything I can find to boost the performance but still not as fast as Neovim&#x27;s lsp (via gopls and rust-analyzer).
 Is there anything to improve?

 I use dape for debugging and plz to test an api.
 When you set a breakpoint in the api and you try to test this method with a request then the UI will be freeze...
 I think this is because both different thread try to use the same UI thread ...
 I don&#x27;t know it is an issue or just as designed and I can use the curl from console as well but I think it is a limitation if I think correctly.
 What do you think ?

 I&#x27;m using doom emacs, and I followed all the instructions to enable Latex in doom emacs, but, when I use gptel to query with gpt4all, whenever I query math equations it&#x27;s not showing up in the nice latex, so, any tips on how to get this working, so I can view the math and physics equations in a nice way. Thanks for the help.

And now I&#x27;m testing flyckeck Grammarly, it is better but the explanation of the issue with text is not helpful. My English is not perfect and I have problems understanding what to do to fix the grammar mistakes. Example:
  
The noun phrase first element seems to be missing a determiner before it. Consider adding an article.
  
I don&#x27;t understand what this hint suggests. The browser extension has a suggestion that you can click to fix the grammar mistakes. Does any Emacs mode have something similar? I thought that lsp mode use company mode to allow fixing grammar mistakes from dropdown menu, but I was told that the company mode only works with completion and doesn&#x27;t work with lsp-grammarly.
 I can fix mistakes by hand, but I need to have a list of fixes to apply. lsp-grammarly had even more cryptic hints &quot;Correct article usage&quot;. Those are only in browser extension but there is a proper grammar listed that I can apply.

 Hope you&#x27;re all doing awesome! I&#x27;m Jesse Amos, and I&#x27;m excited to announce that I&#x27;ve conquered the Haskell course (Haskell MOOC)! Now, I&#x27;m diving into a personal project and on the lookout for a mentor and buddy. I&#x27;d love to have someone I can hit up with questions as I tackle hurdles. Your wisdom and insights would be super valuable to me. Can&#x27;t wait to connect with someone willing to share their expertise. Thanks a million!

 How would one generally go about doing that?

                              <span>For the past years, I had to write encoders and decoders for a bunch of datatype files. In this time, a common theme was a separation between the encoder and the decoder part. While with some trickery, you can get a specification such as code &#x3D; Constructor  extractA  extractB to work for newtypes, I have never found a nice approach for ADTs that let me plug-and-play codes for field (without changing the type definitions, anyway. I know you can do some magic with an additional functor argument that you put in front of every field. Your mileage may vary).
 In any case, I found the state unsatisfactory and set out to find a solution and - to my own surprise - was successful. If you just want code here is a proof of concept on github. It even has a few comments and a nice README.

                              <span>Hi so im very new to haskell and i was wondering how do you fix the variable not in scope error.
 double x &#x3D; x + x
 quadruple x &#x3D; double (double x) 
 i know this is a very simple code, but when i try to run quadruple 2 in powershell, it just gives me an error of Variable not in scope: quadruple :: t0 -&gt; t. I still dont know what im doing wrong.

                              <span>Hi everyone, I&#x27;m a newbie in Haskell and just learned it for about a week. I got this error while trying to build a library.
 : error: panic! (the &#x27;impossible&#x27; happened) GHC version 9.6.4: Couldn&#x27;t find module Data.Type.Ord CallStack (from HasCallStack): panic, called at compiler/GHC/Utils/Error.hs:454:29 in ghc:GHC.Utils.Error 
 FYI, I&#x27;m using rules_haskell as builder and base-4.18.2.0.
 As I checked https://www.stackage.org/lts-22.12/package/base-4.18.2.0, this base does have Data.Type.Ord.
 I tried to downgrade the ghc version but it still didn&#x27;t fix this issue.

 Can I also run this code? Normally it would be in an SRC block and run with Babel, but dynamic blocks seem to be just text.

                              <span>This is my first time trying to edit files remotely using emacs. When trying to ssh into a remote server using C-x C-f /ssh:user@host:/path tramp hangs after the second colon and sometimes after pressing C-g will display in the minibuffer the message [Tramp: opening connection nil for user@host using ssh...failed]. I thought the issue might be that I was using windows, so I tried /plink:user@host:/path and got the same message, albeit without emacs hanging and it instead saying &quot;using plink...failed&quot;. The only person I&#x27;ve been able to find with the same problem is here https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/qnyv6r/tramp_is_unusable_in_the_latest_git_version/ and I&#x27;m not using mac so their solution doesn&#x27;t apply to me. Does anybody have any ideas for how to fix this?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been getting fairly familiar with emacs but I am still struggling with controlling the windows (i.e. the panes) in emacs. My main issue is emacs presuming to create new windows when I do not want it to. I especially want all of my regular file buffers to always open in the same window. Does anyone have suggestions for controlling your windows? Are there any really good packages or dot-files I should be looking at to solve this issue?

It was quite easy to use it, except for one small issue. Suppose I am in the dashboard and click or select ‚ÄúInbox‚Äù. Now when I quit ‚ÄúInbox‚Äù it goes the mu4e&#x27;s default (ugly) dashboard. How do I prevent that from happening and only use the dashboard from above?

I am trying to find a way to add an automattically calculated percentage cookie to the relevant todo heading that is bases it calculation off of something I can set manually. Below is a examplae of what I am trying to accomplish. I don&#x27;t want to use checkboxes / sub-heading due to the very large value being tracked ~115.

                              <span>I have been using go templ and htmx to write web server for a while. There is a templ-ts-mode for Emacs user to use. But the functionalities are so limited that it does not have HTML keyword completion. I tried to integrate web-mode or html-mode into it but no success. Both the source code of web-mode and html-mode are so complicated that I don&#x27;t even know where to find the auto-completion related functions.
 So I decided to do it my own way, with the help of built-in treesit, it was a fun and successful experience. I recommend more of you try out the treesit related stuffs. 
 Here is my blog post about it.

                              <span>Hello there,
 I&#x27;m trying to get GPT4ALL working with the gptel package, after getting past some errors, now another error got thrown while trying to use gptel: could not parse http response?
 The gpt4all-chat gui works fine, but in emacs with gptel, it throws this error.
 I found a similar issue in the gptel repo, so I posted my issue there, if any of you would like to take a look, thanks.

                              <span>I just installed Fedora KDE and I&#x27;ve run into an embarrassing problem. Neither my terminal of choice (wezterm) nor Emacs can find my installation of nerd fonts. I installed them as per normal in ~/.local/share/fonts and they show up in the fonts section of the GUI appearance manager (and are completely usable in KDE). However, they can&#x27;t be found by wezterm or Emacs.
 Anyone had this problem before? I&#x27;ve never had an issue with openSUSE or Arch. 
 I&#x27;ve also installed them in /usr/share/fonts and of course ran sudo fc-cache -v.

                              <span>By comparing the parser combinator implementation in the paper Parsec: Direct Style Monadic Parser Combinators For The Real World and the one actually used in the parsec library, I found they are quite different.
 The implementation in the paper defines the Parser type as follows
 type Parser a &#x3D; String ‚Üí Consumed a data Consumed a &#x3D; Consumed (Reply a) | Empty (Reply a) data Reply a &#x3D; Ok a String | Error 
 The implementation in the parsec library uses
 newtype ParsecT s u m a &#x3D; ParsecT {unParser :: forall b . State s u -&gt; (a -&gt; State s u -&gt; ParseError -&gt; m b) -- consumed ok -&gt; (ParseError -&gt; m b) -- consumed err -&gt; (a -&gt; State s u -&gt; ParseError -&gt; m b) -- empty ok -&gt; (ParseError -&gt; m b) -- empty err -&gt; m b } 
 The latter uses a continuation-based approach instead of different constructors. I can see why it works. But until yesterday I did not know that this method had a formal name - &quot;church encoding&quot;.
 My question is
  
Why does church encoding improve the performance of parser combinators? Surely it avoids the &quot;wrapping&quot;/&quot;unwrapping&quot; data into/out of constructors. So the abstraction and application of lambdas must be cheaper, right?
 And how much? I haven&#x27;t found a paper describing refactoring of parser combinator libraries using church encoding and the benchmark comparison.

                              <span>I have been using org-roam for a while. But I have found its template system confusing.
 I think there are two use cases:
  
Creating a new node (for this the templates work well)
 
Adding data to an already existing node.
 
 The templates are also used when the user runs org-roam-node-find and the selected node-title does not exist. This is probably whey templates in org-roam behave very different than org templates.
 Last weekend I finally spent time and address some of these issues. The commits are here:
 https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam/compare/main...dmgerman:org-roam:main
 for example.The first template will only work when creating a new file (see :create-file). It will ask for the node-title and use it to create the file (the slug).
  (add-to-list &#x27;org-roam-capture-templates &#x60;(&quot;A&quot; &quot;area&quot; plain &quot;%?&quot; :target (file+head ,(eval (dmg-roam-build-path &quot;areas/${slug}.org&quot;)) ,(eval (dmg-roam-template &quot;plain.txt&quot;))) :create-file yes :unnarrowed t)) 
 If the path is provided, the user will not be asked for the destination. if the template has :create-file no, and the file does not exist, the capture will be aborted.
 In contrast, this template will ask for a node id, and then search for the &quot;Tasks&quot; header. node and node+olp will not create a new file.
  (add-to-list &#x27;org-roam-capture-templates &#x60;(&quot;t&quot; &quot;todo&quot; entry &quot;*** TODO %?\n%t\n%a\n\n%i&quot; :target (node+olp nil (&quot;Tasks&quot;)) :unnarrowed t)) 
 If the node id is provided, the user will NOT be asked for the node id.

                              <span>alphapapa&#x27;s org-ql package looks really nice.
 I&#x27;m looking for a good way to use it to &quot;filter&quot; an org buffer as explained below.
 The idea is:
 [input org buffer] --&gt;  --&gt; [new output org buffer]
  
Starting with some org buffer (the &quot;input&quot;)
 Produce a new &quot;filtered&quot; org buffer (the &quot;output&quot;)
 Where the &quot;filtered&quot; buffer would contain those nodes of the first org buffer which satisfied some &quot;matching&quot; criteria.
 The &quot;structure&quot; of the &quot;filtered&quot; buffer would be the same as the first org buffer, but with unmatched nodes effectively pruned.
 The matching criteria would ideally be based on alpha-papa&#x27;s nice org-ql package.
 The &quot;output&quot; is a new org buffer 
 not a sparse tree folding of the original buffer
 not an agenda view into the original buffer

 I am trying to install scala using courser but it cannot access the internet (work limitation) so it cannot get the json file that tells it what JVM I have or if one is installed. I have openJDK 8 installed and verified that when running java -version. Is there a way to use courser without the internet?
 Thanks!

I tried using old Hazlecast lib but it is giving errors as it was compatible with 3.12 version of Hazlecast not latest version. If I go with Java implementation I have to write my own serializaton implementations(I have 50+ maps to serialize). Is there any other way I can serialize so that I can store maps easily. I am using scala dotty.

                              <span>Hello! :-)
It is good practice to keep the titles of a Zettel short:
On the one hand, the task of writing a short title helps the learning process.
On the other hand, the visualization of the notes is better if the title is short.
However, my question is, do you know if there is a sweet spot for the length of a title?
In my case, I try to write titles of 80 characters or less (with the UUID included). I selected this quantity due to my background in programming, where it is recommended to limit code lines to 80 characters. In my experience, this length is a good challenge that helps both objectives (1) and (2).
But I am considering increasing it a bit: maybe 100 characters.
What maximum length for titles do you use?</span>

Call it anxiety (and you would be right) but the community has been longing for dependent types for a long time and I&#x27;m no exception, lol.

 Do you have any resources ?
 EDIT Update &#x3D;&gt; Ok Update. The problem was only in the version 9.2.8.

                              <span>Suppose I have the following in my emacs config.
  (use-package general :config (general-create-definer leader-key :prefix leader-key-pfx) (general-create-definer local-leader-key :prefix local-leader-key-pfx)) 
 I could then use the above to create a binding in a specific key map (e.g., for emacs-lisp-mode) as follows.
  (local-leader-key :keymaps &#x27;emacs-lisp-mode-map &quot;e s&quot; &#x27;eval-surrounding-sexp) 
 I would like to group such bindings, for instance, based on the mode they affect.
 If I understand correctly, use-package could be used for arbitrary configurations and does not need to be tied to a specific package.
 So, I tried the following.
  (use-package emacs-lisp-mode :config (local-leader-key :keymaps &#x27;emacs-lisp-mode-map &quot;e s&quot; &#x27;eval-surrounding-sexp)) 
 Now, the settings do not take into effect when I open an elisp file or a buffer in emacs-lisp-mode.
 Could someone help me fix the config?

                              <span>Hi, I installed emacs in macOS (emacs-plus@29) and immediately noticed that the font rendering was a bit off, slightly darker or bolder than in other apps. For example, this is Source Code Pro (Regular 15) in VSCode (above) and in emacs (below):
 https://preview.redd.it/ctq8s69dyzkc1.png?width&#x3D;342&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;079e1ee0f334bf0a80516fd81ce8ff0123d75bbf
 Does emacs use a different font rendering engine than the rest of the system?
 I tried setting ns-use-thin-smoothing but found no difference in rendering.
 Thanks!

                              <span>On Friday I updated all my lsp language servers (I use ts-ls) and all my emacs packages, and now whenever I save it&#x27;s overwriting all my imports incorrectly; it&#x27;s also (stupidly) adding an emacs backup file to my &#x60;tsconfig.json&#x60; file. I&#x27;ve been looking at the lsp-mode documentation, but I can&#x27;t figure out how to disable code actions on save (and honestly, I&#x27;d rather keep that and just turn off whatever it&#x27;s trying to do to the imports, but I haven&#x27;t found a setting for that). I&#x27;ve also been looking at the configuration options on the ts-ls repo, but I&#x27;m unsure of how to set those through emacs-lsp, and couldn&#x27;t find any documentation on setting server-specific settings. 
 Here&#x27;s what it&#x27;s doing:

                              <span>Just wanted to show you how to use org tables with custom elisp functions, in case you dont know its possible:
 The following table shows results from a questionnaire:
 #+name: sus-questionnaire-results #+caption: SUS Questionnaire Results #+attr_latex: :align l|r|r|r|r|r|r|r|r|r|r|l :font \fontspec{Noto Sans Condensed Light} | USER | Q1 | Q2 | Q3 | Q4 | Q5 | Q6 | Q7 | Q8 | Q9 | Q10 | SUS | |------+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+-----+------| | U1 | 5 | 2 | 2 | 1 | 3 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 60.0 | | U2 | 5 | 2 | 4 | 2 | 5 | 1 | 4 | 1 | 4 | 1 | 87.5 | | U3 | 5 | 2 | 4 | 1 | 4 | 2 | 4 | 1 | 4 | 3 | 80.0 | #+tblfm: $12&#x3D;&#x27;(ux:sus-calc-score-per-row &#x27;($2..$11));N 
 The SUS column is calculated for each row using the values from column 2 to 11. When the ‚ÄòN‚Äô flag is used, all referenced elements are parsed as numbers and interpolated as Lisp numbers
 Here is the elisp function:
 (defun ux:sus-calc-score (lst) (let ((counter 0)) (mapcar (lambda (x) (setq counter (1+ counter)) (if (&#x3D; 0 (% counter 2)) (- 5 x) (1- x))) lst))) (defun ux:sus-calc-score-per-row (lst) (* (apply &#x27;+ (ux:sus-calc-score lst)) 2.5)) 
 Thats all!

                              <span>A while back i made a post on a different Problem where i mentioned this as well, but i&#x27;m not able to track this down. So i&#x27;m, once again, asking for help here.
 Basically, at a random point in time after starting emacs, it will create buffers named &quot;*emacs*&quot; in the background.
 https://preview.redd.it/sy147bu3mxkc1.png?width&#x3D;898&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;72f99a091f59e8332e2a1a067b2b2ad8eeff33ae
 They seem to be somehow related to me moving through files. I have only my init.el file open and moving up and down makes new buffers appear in that list. This isn&#x27;t consistent though. If i restart emacs, i can move through my init file just fine. And at some point, this just starts happening.
 Some of those buffers are empty, and some have just &quot;Lisp Expression:&quot; with nothing else written in them.
 I already tried stripping down my config and haven&#x27;t been able to track it down. I ripped the whole completion setup out, threw out treemacs and such, ran without all the eglot and language modes and tried without org and evil configuration. Nothing seems to help.
 Is there a hook or option i can use to get more information on how or by what those buffers are created? Maybe write a verbose log on those events or such? Although i&#x27;ve worked with emacs for quite some time, i seem to be pretty bad at configuring and troubleshooting it, so some hints would help me a lot here.
 If someone wants to look at my config, the current state is here: Dominik Schlack / Domacs ¬∑ GitLab

 I&#x27;ve always had this problem and I want to see if someone can please help me: I have the following code in my config:
  ;; Set backup directory for files (setq backup-directory-alist &#x60;((&quot;.&quot; . ,(expand-file-name &quot;backups/&quot; user-emacs-directory)))) ;; Set auto-saves directory for buffers (make-directory (expand-file-name &quot;auto-saves/&quot; user-emacs-directory) t) (setq auto-save-list-file-prefix (expand-file-name &quot;auto-saves/sessions&quot; user-emacs-directory) auto-save-file-name-transforms &#x60;((&quot;.*&quot; ,(expand-file-name &quot;auto-saves/&quot; user-emacs-directory) t))) ;; Disable lock files - enable if they cause trouble while compiling ;; (setq create-lockfiles nil) ;; Set directory for temp projectile and lsp files (setq projectile-known-projects-file (expand-file-name &quot;tmp/projectile-bookmarks.eld&quot; user-emacs-directory) lsp-session-file (expand-file-name &quot;tmp/.lsp-session.v1&quot; user-emacs-directory)) ;; Make backups to backup directory (setq backup-by-copying t delete-old-versions t kept-new-versions 6 kept-old-versions 2 version-control t) 
 It creates ## files as backups in the directory, which is really nice. But, if I have a [/] in an org header (a progress thing for a checklist), it continually asks upon hitting &#x60;C-x s&#x60; if I want to save the file. If I quit out of Emacs with &#x60;C-x C-c&#x60;, then it will not only ask, but also say that some buffers are modified, and do I want to really quit? I find this behavior to be a little weird. I&#x27;m just looking to see if anyone can help me make it so that backups are saved/taken care of silently in the background, and when hitting &#x60;C-x s&#x60;, it doesn&#x27;t prompt me to save the backup file each time. Instead, it prompts for normal (non-backup) buffers.
 I don&#x27;t know *why* it continually updates the backup files if I have a [/] in the header, but it does. If anyone has any ideas, please let me know?
 Thanks! üôÉ

                              <span>Hi, 
 I have a perfectly working setup in emacs 28 using eglot and tresitter. I am moving to emacs 29, and trying to figure out which parts of the configuration can be removed since both eglot and treesitter are part of emacs now. I know that treesitter-auto can do a lot of heavy lifting in emacs 29. The relevant config from the emacs 28 installation is: 
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; (use-package eglot :straight :hook ((python-mode julia-mode) . eglot-ensure) :config (add-to-list &#x27;eglot-server-programs &#x27;(python-mode . (&quot;python-lsp-server&quot;)) &#x27;(julia-mode . (&quot;eglot-jl&quot;))))
 (use-package tree-sitter :straight t :config (global-tree-sitter-mode) (add-hook &#x27;tree-sitter-after-on-hook #&#x27;tree-sitter-hl-mode)) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; Any help/tips would be awesome. Thank you!

                              <span>Greetings,
 I&#x27;m having trouble getting this to work, linked below is the github issue, if any of you would like to take a look, thanks.
 https://github.com/karthink/gptel
 Recently I installed the gpt4all-chat package from the nix packages unstable channel:
 gpt4all-chat
 And it works really well, but I wanted to get gpt4all working in emacs since I do everything in there. Anyways, your gptel package is just what I need in order to have gpt4all working smoothly in emacs. But I&#x27;ve run into some an error when trying to setup gpt4all working in emacs with your gptel package.
 Warning (gptel): Preferred &#x60;gptel-model&#x27; &quot;gpt4all-falcon-newbpe-q4_0.gguf&quot; notsupported in &quot;GPT4All&quot;, using &quot;nil&quot; instead Disable showing Disable logging
 I copied the model files from the settings section of the gpt4all-chat gui app, then pasted them in the gptel configuration in config.el(I&#x27;m using nix-doom-emacs). But this error is getting thrown? nix-doom-emacs repo broke a while back so it&#x27;s stuck at doom emacs version 28.2, but that shouldn&#x27;t be an issue for this gptel package, at least I don&#x27;t think so?
 Thanks in advance for the help.
 Here&#x27;s my config.el configuration for gptel below:
 ;;---------------------------------------------------
 ;; gptel llm configuration:
 (use-package! gptel
 :config
 ;;(setq! gptel-api-key &quot;your key&quot;)
 ;; OPTIONAL configuration
 (setq-default gptel-model &quot;gpt4all-falcon-newbpe-q4_0.gguf&quot; ;Pick your default model
 gptel-backend (gptel-make-gpt4all &quot;GPT4All&quot; :protocol &quot;http&quot;))
 (setq-default gptel-max-tokens 500))
 ;; gptel llm backend configurations:

 :protocol &quot;http&quot;

                              <span>Just wanted to show you how to use org tables with custom elisp functions, in case you dont know its possible:
 The following table shows results from a questionnaire:
 #+name: sus-questionnaire-results #+caption: SUS Questionnaire Results #+attr_latex: :align l|r|r|r|r|r|r|r|r|r|r|l :font \fontspec{Noto Sans Condensed Light} | USER | Q1 | Q2 | Q3 | Q4 | Q5 | Q6 | Q7 | Q8 | Q9 | Q10 | SUS | |------+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+-----+------| | U1 | 5 | 2 | 2 | 1 | 3 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 60.0 | | U2 | 5 | 2 | 4 | 2 | 5 | 1 | 4 | 1 | 4 | 1 | 87.5 | | U3 | 5 | 2 | 4 | 1 | 4 | 2 | 4 | 1 | 4 | 3 | 80.0 | #+tblfm: $12&#x3D;&#x27;(ux:sus-calc-score-per-row &#x27;($2..$11));N 
 The SUS column is calculated for each row using the values from column 2 to 11. When the ‚ÄòN‚Äô flag is used, all referenced elements are parsed as numbers and interpolated as Lisp numbers
 Here is the elisp function:
 (defun ux:sus-calc-score (lst) (let ((counter 0)) (mapcar (lambda (x) (setq counter (1+ counter)) (if (&#x3D; 0 (% counter 2)) (- 5 x) (1- x))) lst))) (defun ux:sus-calc-score-per-row (lst) (* (apply &#x27;+ (ux:sus-calc-score lst)) 2.5)) 
 Thats all!

 The format i am usiing is
 [[file:images/img.jpg][DESCRIPTION]]
 Images are correctly placed in folder because clicking the link open the image.
 Things i have tried:
 - org-display-inline-images from the config and toggling it in the same buffer, no luck 
 - org-toggle-inline-images, no luck 
 - remove all configurations from my emacs
 - install latest org-mode using package-manager replacing the native one
 I am sure is something silly I am not figuring out. Help?
 emacs: 29.2
 org-mode: 9.6.19
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hi. I am using &#x60;org-msg&#x60; to write emails but it always exports code blocks with some kind of formatting, even in a text export, example:
 ‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ
 ‚îÇ (require &#x27;org)
 ‚îÇ (load-theme &#x27;leuven t)
 ‚îÇ 
 ‚îÇ (dolist (face &#x27;(org-level-1 org-level-2 org-level-3 org-level-4 org-level-5
 ‚îÇ org-level-6 org-level-7 org-level-8))
 ‚îÇ (set-face-attribute face nil :extend t))
 ‚îÇ 
 ‚îÇ (setq org-fontify-whole-heading-line t)
 ‚îÇ (scratch-buffer)
 ‚îÇ (org-mode)
 ‚îÇ (insert &quot;#+title: (Infty, 2) Reading Group
 ‚îÇ #+ROAM_TAGS: \&quot;Quasicategories\&quot;
 ...
 How can I export such a code block completely in plain text, like if I had just copy-pasted the code directly?

                              <span>Following on from this question about restricting property values during capture, I have a followup.
 I&#x27;m currently implementing that value restriction in my init.el with something like this:
 (setq org-global-properties &#x27;( (&quot;MEETING_ALL&quot; . &quot;Staff Finance ProjectX ProjectY&quot;) (&quot;FLAVOR_ALL&quot; . &quot;Strawberry Chocolate Vanilla&quot;) ;; ... and so on )) 
 However, I want to be able to have some property values that contain whitespace. So &quot;Project X&quot; and &quot;Project Y&quot; instead of ProjectX and ProjectY. I read the org-global-properties description but I still haven&#x27;t got enough hang of car and cdr and cons to know for sure what it&#x27;s on about. So I guessed and simply \-escaped some &quot;&quot;, like this:
 (setq org-global-properties &#x27;( (&quot;MEETING_ALL&quot; . &quot;Staff Finance \&quot;Project X\&quot; \&quot;Project Y\&quot;&quot;) (&quot;FLAVOR_ALL&quot; . &quot;Strawberry Chocolate Vanilla&quot;) ;; ... and so on )) 
 To my surprise, that works fine, but is it The Right Way to do it? One small thing that concerns me is that it doesn&#x27;t appear to be handled very well by emacs&#x27; lisp mode. So if I have it as a vertical list, I get this:
 (setq org-global-properties &#x27;( (&quot;MEETING_ALL&quot; . &quot;Staff Finance \&quot;Project X\&quot; \&quot;Project Y\&quot;&quot;) (&quot;FLAVOR_ALL&quot; . &quot;Strawberry Chocolate Vanilla&quot;) ;; ... and so on )) 
 None of this is the end of the world, I know, but I just wanted to check in case I&#x27;m really supposed to code it as some kind of nested parens monstrosity, but one that&#x27;s at least indented according to some sensible aesthetic! Ye know -- the kind of thing you come to expect with Lisp :-)

                              <span>The following function is:
 subst f g x &#x3D; f x g(x)
 As far as I understood, f is a function that takes two arguments f (x , y). But, in this particular case, one of its arguments is a function g, f (x, g(x)), so I have no idea how the subst type assignature should be. Should f be a function whose one of its arguments is also a function or just a type variable?
 I am starting my studies with Haskell that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m still dumb, please have some patience.
 I am asking this question in this subreddit because there no other one that can help me out.

                              <span>Hello, I know this might be a very dumb way to do this, but I have a test file that imports and runs functions. The problem is because of my particular use case, the function that is being tested may not always be defined. When this happens, the test itself errors out because the function doesn&#x27;t exist and I have to comment out that test. Is there a way to detect if a variable has been defined, and return a Maybe where if the variable doesn&#x27;t exist it returns Nothing and if variable A does exist it returns Just A? I have other ways to go about this but this would be the most convenient way.

                              <span>So i want to use eglot to have autocompletion for html and css in Emacs (Windows). I installed eglot from melpa and installed the language servers using npm as shown in Github. When I run M - x eglot in any HTML file, I get the message &quot;Enter program to execute&#x27;. When i enter vscode-html-language-server.cmd and enter, i get the error message:
 [jsonrpc] Server exited with status 1
  
error in process sentinel: eglot--error: [eglot] -1: Server died 
 error in process sentinel: [eglot] -1: Server died
  
When i enter vscodehtml-language-server.ps1 and enter, i get the error message:
  
Searching for program: Permission denied, vscode-html-language-server.ps1
  
What might be the problem be with this? the language servers are in my path.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been working on writing some wrapper functions in consult for my workflow, and for the life of me can&#x27;t seem to figure out how to get a particular behavior in the consult menu.
 The behavior I&#x27;m looking for is exemplified by consult-gh: https://github.com/armindarvish/consult-gh. If you take a look at the demo GIFs in the README, you&#x27;ll see that when repos are searched for, it shows a list where each repo has multiple &quot;columns:&quot; one for the repo author/name, one for it being public or private, one for a date, and one for a description. Looking at the source code, I see that the author of this package in particular used propertize to get different faces for each part, but it&#x27;s not clear to me how to get the column alignment looking nice. Suggestions on the column alignment would be most appreciated!

                              <span>I&#x27;m pretty new to Emacs, so go easy on me if I&#x27;m missing something obvious, but I&#x27;ve read all of the documentation that I could find on running Emacs as a server and every time I think I&#x27;ve fixed the issue something strange happens again.
 I am on version 29. Currently, the way I start the daemon is with systemd. I enable and start the service as the documentation shows.
 The issue has to do with where the daemon creates the socket. Sometimes when I boot up my machine, everything works exactly as I expect it to: I can simply run &#x60;emacsclient -nc&#x60; and it pops right up. I can also set my shell environment variable EDITOR to emacsclient and open files easily that way. When things are working right, I note that the socket is in /run/user/userID/emacs/server.
 Probably half the time I boot up, the socket is in ~/.emacs.d/server/server, which means I have to pass the path to the socket to emacsclient for it to work. This means I have to change the scripts bound to my keybindings, etc., every time this happens. Pain in the butt. And for some reason I don&#x27;t understand, setting EDITOR&#x3D;emacsclient -cn -s /path/to/server doesn&#x27;t work the way I want it to. It opens up a new frame, but does not open a buffer with the current file.
 So my questions more broadly are
  
How does Emacs determine where it creates the socket? You would think it just looks at server-socket-dir, but there&#x27;s obviously more to it than that, because it changes it up on me regardless of whether I explicitly set that variable.
 And does anybody have any hunches as to what could be causing it to seemingly randomly flip back and forth between socket locations?

                              <span>I would love to have the ephemeral buffers sorted in an extra category below the regular buffers when calling consult-buffer. The following definition doesn&#x27;t work. It does sort them as wanted, but when I choose them, the buffer doesn&#x27;t switch to *Messages* or *scratch*, it just stays as the current buffer. (The regular buffers can be chosen in the upper part of the consult-menu as usual.)
 What did I do wrong?
  (setq consult-buffer-sources &#x27;(consult--source-hidden-buffer consult--source-modified-buffer consult--source-buffer (:name &quot;Ephemeral&quot; :narrow 109 :category buffer :items (&quot;*Messages*&quot; &quot;*scratch*&quot; &quot;*Async-native-compile-log*&quot; &quot;*Bookmark List*&quot;)))) (setq consult-buffer-filter &#x27;(&quot;\\&#x60; &quot; &quot;\\&#x60;\\*Completions\\*\\&#x27;&quot; &quot;\\&#x60;\\*scratch\\*\\&#x27;&quot; &quot;\\&#x60;\\*Messages\\*\\&#x27;&quot; &quot;\\&#x60;\\*Bookmark List\\*\\&#x27;&quot; &quot;\\&#x60;\\*EMMS-Log\\*\\&#x27;&quot; &quot;\\&#x60;\\*Flymake log\\*\\&#x27;&quot; &quot;\\&#x60;\\*Semantic SymRef\\*\\&#x27;&quot; &quot;\\&#x60;\\*tramp/.*\\*\\&#x27;&quot;)) 
 I need to filter them, so they are not listed twice, but just in the extra category. And neither :category buffer nor :category &#x27;buffer works.
 I am grateful for any advice.
 Edit: I am using Emacs 30.0.50 and Consult 1.3.

                              <span>Hi,
 I usually don&#x27;t use emacs but I am getting into org-mode again and I am having trouble installing packages from melpa.
 When I do a &quot;M-x package-refresh-content&quot; emacs tells me that it is contacting host elpa.gnu.org:443 then elpa.nongnu.org:443 , then melpa.org:443 and finally gives up with &quot;failed to download melpa archive&quot;.
 I have this in my init.el:
 (require &#x27;package) (add-to-list &#x27;package-archives &#x27;(&quot;melpa&quot; . &quot;https://melpa.org/packages/&quot;) t) (package-initialize) 
 I can however type the configured melpa-url in my brower, where it works.
 I am on Debian with emacs 29.
 Does anybody have an idea what this problem might me or how to attack it?

                              <span>Hello, I need some help assessing the root of my performance problems when using Emacs, especially while using org mode.
 If while writing an Org document I end up with a rather long paragraph (~550 chars), editing becomes noticeably slow to the point of being pretty annoying and kinda frustrating.
 I ran the profiler of Doom Emacs (https://imgur.com/a/nMYWLOz) and my results show that jit-lock, which IIRC is like a variant of font-lock, and more especifically jit-lock-fontify-keywords-region, is my main culprit here, or at least the most notable one.
 After that, I disabled font-lock-mode in my buffer and the editing was snappy again, so I tried disabling some modes inside that same buffer but to no avail.
 My hunch here is that either I&#x27;m facing an Emacs limitation or maybe it&#x27;s just my hardware being too slow. I&#x27;m leaning more towards the latter, but I&#x27;m pretty new to Emacs so I just don&#x27;t know (and can&#x27;t reliably test this in my other, more powerful laptop).
 So what do you think? What could I do to mitigate this while not sacrificing too much of the eye-candiness of Org?
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Hi Experts
 ‚Äã
 Maybe i am doing this wrong.
 What I want to do is understand what a function in an emacs plugin is doing.
 E.g. I want to understand what consult--fd-make-builder does in consult.el file
 ‚Äã
 What i did was copy over the function locally and renamed (rd/consult--fd-make-builder) it and then added the advice
 ‚Äã
 lisp (advice-add &#x27;consult--fd-make-builder :override #&#x27;rd/advice-consult--fd-make-builder) 
 ‚Äã
 intention is that this will now execute my local function and i can look at it with message
 ‚Äã
 Now when i run consult-fd i get
 ‚Äã
 lisp apply: Invalid function: (&quot;.&quot;) 
 ‚Äã
 i tried just copying the function without renaming.
 ‚Äã
 then i get
 ‚Äã
 lisp Error running timer: (void-variable cmd) \[2 times\] 
 ‚Äã
 ‚Äã
 Can someone help me as to how i can do this or what I am doing wrong?
 ‚Äã
 TIA
 EDIT: Figured out the issue, looks like lexical scope was defined.

                              <span>While doing some package maintenance, I&#x27;ve noticed that when visiting &quot;circe-pkg.el&quot; file, flycheck highlighted the define-package function as obsolete. So I went to the source and found the following, suggesting it has been obsoleted in Emacs 29.1 without a replacement to use:
 (defun define-package ( _name-string _version-string &amp;optional _docstring _requirements &amp;rest _extra-properties) &quot;Define a new package. [...]&quot; (declare (obsolete nil &quot;29.1&quot;) (indent defun)) (error &quot;Don&#x27;t call me!&quot;)) 
 I&#x27;ve checked the git blame output and found nothing useful in the commit message motivating this either:
 ade7a212a882540178d9504e7e0bd3be3bf1fd41 Author: Stefan Kangas  AuthorDate: Mon Jul 11 12:41:50 2022 +0200 Commit: Stefan Kangas  CommitDate: Mon Jul 11 12:51:00 2022 +0200 Parent: c0ced4e4998 Prevent setting user time if the WM doesn&#x27;t support it Merged: emacs-25 Contained: master Follows: emacs-28.1.90 (157359) Precedes: emacs-29.0.90 (6898) * lisp/emacs-lisp/package.el (define-package): Make obsolete. 
 No mention in the NEWS file either or on emacs-devel.
 The best explanation I have for this is the following:
  
You&#x27;re not supposed to call the function, it merely acts as special syntax for package.el to interpret.
 Outright removal of the function is a bad idea due to people looking up its docstring.
 Before actually removing a function, it is obsoleted to detect people still using it and give them ample time to adjust.
  
I still find obsoletion shows the wrong signal here. One is still supposed to use it as seen in the elisp reference and marking the function as obsolete only creates more confusion. What was the motivation to do that?

 ‚Äã
 One question that has come to mind though is whether anyone uses &#x60;query-replace&#x60; over &#x60;query-replace-regex&#x60; and if so why? What are the benefits that &#x60;query-replace&#x60; has over its regex alter ego, or conversely am I instead missing some drawbacks to always defaulting to the &#x60;regex&#x60; version?
 ‚Äã
 For context, I&#x27;ve rebound &#x60;M-%&#x60; to use the &#x60;regex&#x60; version as it&#x27;s already a bit of an awkward key bind, but am I struggling with Chesterton‚Äôs Fence in this case.

                              <span>Hello,
 I&#x27;m starting to use .authinfo to save some encrypted information, that works pretty nice. The problem I&#x27;m facing is that Emacs tries to decrypt the authinfo.gpg file eagerly at startup which when running as daemon is kind of problematic.
 Is there a way to delay the decryption of authinfo.gpg until it is needed?

 Can it by done by a hunk, or by a range of lines?

                              <span>So now that treesitter and eglot come with emacs theres no need for all my plugins. Flycheck was giving wierd errors with LSP, replaced it with built in flymake and the errors reporting is spot on. It&#x27;s also really quick now with native comp built in. Thanks to mickey for this guide. Actually didn&#x27;t even need to build from source though I used homebrew as i&#x27;m on an M1. 
 I&#x27;m late to the party on this stuff as i&#x27;ve not been coding on emacs for a couple years now but this stuff is amazing, finaly emacs is coming out the box with the stuff!

I will now describe how I installed agda, then describe what is not working.
 I installed emacs wayland on arch linux and I installed ghcup by installing ghcup-hs-bin. Using ghcup tui I installed cabal and ghc. Then I installed agda according to agda installation guide. To describe precisely how I did that, I run cabal update cabal install Agda, then agda mode setup, which added (load-file (let ((coding-system-for-read &#x27;utf-8)) (shell-command-to-string &quot;agda-mode locate&quot;))) to my .emacs file and finally run agda-mode compile.
 Now I will describe how agda is behaving. When I run emacs in fish shell or with wofi,‚Ä¶</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m a big fan of org-roam and would like to add all of my old notes in there of course! These notes are spread over a lot of directories on my system and in different formats (.txt, .md, .doc). Migration to org-roam will make navigating through all of my notes much more comfortable and I already migrated most of my notes.
 The last notes I want to migrate have a &quot;directory context&quot;. For instance holiday notes in my pictures directory. I am considering to copy/paste these files to org-roam and add a tag to the directory and delete the old note. The downside is that this is kinda an org-roam lock in, because migrating these notes back could be a PITA. If I use a special tag in the roam-note to the original directory then it is possible to migrate the files back with a simple elisp script I guess but could break when directories are renamed in the future. Hopefully I am making myself clear .
 Just before sending this to Reddit a light bulb went off. I could copy/paste the original note in the org-roam note in a code block and tangle it to this directory. I would prefer to not use a code block but something like this seems to be the way.
 How are you guys dealing with old &quot;directory context&quot; notes?

 Is there a way to make project.el disregard .gitignore?
 I know i can &quot;(project-find-file &#x27;INCLUDE-ALL)&quot;, but is there a way to set 1 one time so i can M-x project-find-file and it will just work (without any addtional flags.)

 I then tried the following code snippet from the documentation (from the &#x60;scala-cli&#x60; repl):

 val xs &#x3D; List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

 The filter command failed with a &quot;Bad symbolic reference&quot; error. I then ran the command &#x60;sudo apt install default-jre&#x60;, which resulted in a few more packages being installed
 This time, the &#x60;filter&#x60; command succeeded, but the &#x60;takeWhile&#x60; command failed with the following error message:

what else do I need to install?
 btw my Java version is:

                              <span>Hey folks, 
 I&#x27;ve been working professionally in Scala for the last year and a half and it was nothing but unrest.
 First, the Scala 3 migration started this painful event that fragments the already fragmented multi versions hassle that everyone needs to go through 2.12 / 2.13, and now 3. Have to mention, this is not only dependent on our codebase. For example, Databricks is still on 2.12, on the other hand, some new libraries are Scala 3 only, or Scala 2 support was deprecated.
 Then Akka became a non-open source, and we had to find a solution and picked the Typelevel ecosystem.
 There was another &quot;shock&quot; to the ZIO ecosystem when their leader left the project. Fortunately for us, we haven&#x27;t invested in ZIO not a single hour, but this is another negative event in Scala ecosystem.
 After working for half a year with Typelevel, we wrote some services and a few internal libraries. It wasn&#x27;t bad, maybe not as simple as Akka, but it worked as expected. However, it was a huge struggle for half of the team to understand this code and for some to even understand the concept.
 Then Pekko came out and we had another meeting, where 100% of the team voted against using Typelevel again.
 So, we are &quot;officially&quot; using Pekko for all our new services, which is basically the old Akka in maintenance mode. I don&#x27;t see how this stack has any future.
 Now, it looks like a few experimental libraries evolve around virtual threads. My bet this is the future of Scala since they are simple yet powerful as Effect systems.
 But I hear more and more people are saying - until these are ready, there will be &quot;no Scala&quot;, since the language in a rapid decline (sad, but true).
 Sharing this because I&#x27;m tired of the constant unrest in Scala, and curious what strategy your team has regarding this.
 Thanks

                              <span>It seems that SkillsMatter is no more (again), and the videos were completely removed from the internet. The Haskell Foundation, apparently, were able to secure the HaskellExchange videos from them, and are now working towards making them available online on youtube (https://discourse.haskell.org/t/haskell-video-archive-call-for-volunteers/8863)
 Can the Scala Center reach out to the SkillsMatter management and do the same? It would be a terrible shame to lose those amazing talks.

                              <span>So, I just finished a project of writing a programming language on Haskell with an interpreter. I tried to use as few libraries as possible to really learn how everything works. However, this was my first big project with the language (and in designing a language) and I would love some feedback on things. Im sure a seasoned functional programmer would see some other better approaches and i&#x27;m all ears

                              <span>Hi,
 This comes up all the time when I try to write some haskell but I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s a better way to handle it, it happens most often when I am using new type
 Suppose I have a new type
  newtype Matrix &#x3D; Matrix [[Int]] 
 and in function pattern matching I am destructuring it:  invertMatrix :: Matrix -&gt; Maybe Matrix invertMatrix (Matrix xss) &#x3D; ................... 
 but then in the function body I might have to use some other util functions that take the newtype Matrix instead of the internal representation. In this example I probably would need  determinant :: Matrix -&gt; Float 
 This often means I am rewrapping xss in Matrix just to pass it to determinant, which is cumbersome and I don&#x27;t know if that would cause performance issue?
 Is there a way in the function pattern matching to get xss and an additional variable to bind the whole Matrix xss so I can pass it around? I believe in rust for example they have a way to do that by using @ like
  match x { Constructor(inner) @ whole &#x3D;&gt; .... }

                              <span>I&#x27;m a beginner in programing.
 Currently, I&#x27;m reading a Haskell (my first language) book and pretend to make a project with the intent of learning by doing things in practice; the project is: Design a game engine, I know there&#x27;s a big potential of learning with such project, because it involves a lot of things (I also would like to make this engine &quot;a real thing&quot;, if things go the right way)
 As I have read, people don&#x27;t recommend using primarily Haskell for such, and I can&#x27;t tell a lot of the reasons, because I&#x27;m a beginner; the reasons I&#x27;m aware of are:
 1 - Worse performance compared to languages like C/C++/Rust (which is relevant to games).
 2 - Haskell is not mainstream, so there&#x27;s not much development being done with regards to games.
 I&#x27;m not sure if in someway it becomes &quot;bad&quot; to do &quot;game engine things&quot; with a functional language for some strange reason, I believe you guys might have the property to know about it.
 I pretend to learn Rust after getting a good understanding of Haskell (although I believe I might need to learn python first, considering the demand nowadays).
 Regarding the game engine project, I&#x27;d like to know if it would be a good idea to use Rust as the main language while Haskell for a lot of parts of it, or would it be a terrible thing to do? (losing a lot of performance or any other problem associated with this association of Rust + Haskell).
 Thanks to everyone.

                              <span>Hi all,
 I have made a guide on how to play media (local and remote) using Emacs and MPV so it works with unified config across both Linux and Android.
 To install and configure the GUI Emacs app on Android and see my unified configuration file you can check out my dotfiles on danijelcamdzic/dotemacs and also read about it in one of my previous posts - Sharing my Emacs workflow and dotfiles
 Up until now, I wasn&#x27;t able to get a working config which would allow me to play media through the MPV commands in my Android Emacs but I have figured it out and would like to share the steps for anyone who, like me, wishes to quickly check out their knowledge base, movie collection, song collection etc. in Emacs and quickly play them on your phone.
 The steps are described in my README - MPV section and this is how it looks like when I try to play a video on my Emacs Android:

                              <span>I need some help resolving a gap in my understanding of elisp. I have a hard time understanding what kinds of arguments a function expects. Here is an example with define-key, but happens to me with lots of functions. Basically, I can never tell if an argument needs to be quoted. Correct usage of define-key:
  (define-key gnus-article-map (kbd &quot;i&quot;) #&#x27;gnus-article-show-images) 
 I frequently make the error where I think I am supposed to quote the keymap. I have to look up some old code to see, oh yeah, you don&#x27;t quote the keymap.
 Then when I use use-package, I would write
 (use-package gnus :bind (:map gnus-article-map (&quot;i&quot; . gnus-article-show-images))) 
 Now the function gnus-article-show-images is unquoted, I guess, because this is a macro? The structure of the arg list to :bind is unclear from the function documentation, so I just have to look up another example where I used :bind to figure out the format. Anther example, in general-define-key both keymap and function are quoted. Why?
 What am I missing so that I can better understand whether args need to be quoted or not?

I like to keep textbooks or wiki pages to the right side of code window. Thanks,

                              <span>Hi all!
 As you may know, mu4e is an email client for emacs. It consists of a server program that scans your email messages and an emacs program talking to this server program, as well as a number of command-line utilities.
 I&#x27;m happy to announce mu 1.12, a new stable release which has been in development for ca. 1 year since the 1.10.
 Some highlights:
  
Significant speedups in both mu and mu4e 
 Reworked message composition, closer to its Gnus origins which adds many of its features
 Overhauled the query parser; squashing a number of bugs/limitations, incl. dealing with CJK messages 
 Experimental folding of message threads 
 Better and faster indexing of HTML messages 
 Experimental search by (human) language wit CLD2

 If I add the following line to config.el in .config/doom on linux
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; (setq doom-font (font-spec :family &quot;FreeSans&quot; :size 20))
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 I do not see any modification after stoping the emacs window and then turning it back on
 If I try doom/reload-fond I receive a warning in the .config/emacs/lisp/lib/fonts.el about unknown type: font.
 I have checked that the font exist with M-x describe font.

                              <span>justl is a major mode for driving justfiles. Justfiles are a way to save and run project-specific commands. Think of them like Makefiles, but they are purely focused on running commands and processes, and not for a build system.
 ‚Äã
 This mode gives the ability to execute just recipes from within the editor itself.
 ‚Äã
 The new release with the changelog details here: https://github.com/psibi/justl.el/blob/master/Changelog.org#014
 ‚Äã
 The major highlight in this release is support for per recipe buffer and a major rewrite from Steve Purcell.

                              <span>(edit, using org-roam, obviously... should have mentioned that in the title...)
 I am trying to extend the functionality of the roam buffer so that it not only updates to show backlinks for the node at point, but also so if point wanders over a link, it will show backlinks for the linked node, rather than the node I currently have open. I tried advising org-roam-node-at-point like this (code generated with chatgpt&#x27;s help, apologies if anything is wrong; my elisp-fu is weak):
 ‚Äã
 (defun my-org-roam-node-at-point (&amp;optional assert) &quot;Return the Org-roam node at point if it exists, or the node corresponding to the link at point.&quot; (interactive) (let ((id (plist-get (link-hint--get-link-at-point) :args))) (if (and id (string-prefix-p &quot;id:&quot; id)) (progn (print (substring id 3)) (org-roam-node-from-id (substring id 3))) (org-roam-node-at-point )))) (advice-add &#x27;org-roam-node-at-point :override #&#x27;my-org-roam-node-at-point) 
 This doesn&#x27;t work, but it does succeed at breaking the roam-buffer, so I suspect an approach sort of like this could work, but I&#x27;m in over my depth. Anyone have any ideas, insight, or a snippet that does this already?
 ‚Äã
 Thanks!

I am kinda new to doom emacs and org, but I&#x27;ve learnt how to set reoccuring tasks (refer to ss attached). However, only recently this issue has occured where tasks of previous days e.g. MATH1061 LEC1, scheduled for a monday, is at the bottom of Friday? Maybe i&#x27;ve accidently turned on a setting or there&#x27;s a syntax error. Thank you!

                              <span>Hi,
 I don&#x27;t have a lot experience with emacs and so I am pretty sure I am doing something wrong here as this is simply too tedious...
 What I am trying to do is to attach a file without a mouse, just by using a keyboard.
 Currently this is how it looks like:
 I want to attach a file to I press C-c c-a to open the attachment-dispatcher where I press another &quot;a&quot;. This gives me a prompt at the bottom. I now press &quot;tab&quot; and the prompt tells me (I write this from memory) something about &quot;not unique&quot;, so I press &quot;tab&quot; another time and now I get a new windows where I can select a file - but this window does not have focus. So I now press C-x o to switch to this window where I finally can select the file to attach...
 I find this extremely clumsy - so could someone please let me know how to properly attach a file using only a keyboard?

                              <span>I am practicing identifiying the types of given functions and I seem to have grasped the concept only partly - I have problems with functions that are defined through other functions. 
 Example : evens &#x3D; filter even
 Since 
 filter :: (a -&gt; Bool) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [a] 
 and 
 even :: Integral a &#x3D;&gt; a -&gt; Bool 
 I thought it should be 
 Integral a &#x3D;&gt; (a -&gt; Bool) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [a]
 But :t gave me Integral a &#x3D;&gt; [a] -&gt; [a]
 Why excactly is Bool not part of it? 
 I tried to find an answer but maybe this is too specific or simple. 
 Help would be appreciated.

The prerequisite is keeping the tabs in a fixed order (also a desired behavior) rather than relying on whatever happens to be the state of buffer-list as is the default.

 This seems like really bizarre behavior to me, and I&#x27;d really prefer it to only use the lsp server for the current project.

 Anybody know how to get that working that way?

                              <span>Hi Experts
 ‚Äã
 A very basic question. I am very new to emacs so please bear with me.
 ‚Äã
 I understand how to pass arguments to an elisp function.
 ‚Äã
 but not able to comprehend how to use it in conjunction with a list
 for example
 (interactive (list (read-shell-command (if shell-command-prompt-show-cwd (format-message &quot;Async shell command in &#x60;%s&#x27;: &quot; (abbreviate-file-name default-directory)) &quot;Async shell command: &quot;) nil nil (let ((filename (cond (buffer-file-name) ((eq major-mode &#x27;dired-mode) (dired-get-filename nil t))))) (and filename (file-relative-name filename)))) current-prefix-arg shell-command-default-error-buffer ) ) 
 i can understand what this code does, but because i dont understand how/what arguments the list will take e.g. &#x60;read-shell-command&#x60;/&#x60;current-prefix-arg&#x60;/&#x60;shell-command-default-error-buffer&#x60;/&#x60;read-string&#x60;
 i am having a hard time creating one myself.
 ‚Äã
 Can someone please explain this to me in a simple way?
 Also what all can i pass?
 ‚Äã
 i can think of command line arguments in couple of forms:
  
shell command
 string
 integer
 file
 buffers
 perfix
  
etc.
 I am guessing there will be a particular form of these commands i should use.
 TIA

 folks from emacs have always been saying that emacs offers a better and well Integrated interface to command line, ie EMACS REPLACES YOUR TERMINAL i am curious to hear your thoughts on similar kind of easy of use in emacs, as shown in video, to avoid a proprietary terminal emulator and go foss.
 i update the post with a shorter 3 min demo of their product

                              <span>Hi,
 Jetbrains Inttelij Idea / NeoVim user here. I&#x27;m thinking about installing Emacs (org-mode is the main selling point) and switching (at least from NeoVim) to Emacs/Doom Emacs. While I was reading about how to install it, I found that there are a couple of different emacs releases that can be installed: 
  
If I search Homebrew for the &quot;Emacs&quot; term, there is one cask called &quot;emacs&quot;, let&#x27;s call it &quot;standard&quot;.
 But there is also &quot;emacs-plus&quot; which should be first tapped: https://github.com/d12frosted/homebrew-emacs-plus?tab&#x3D;readme-ov-file
  
I have a couple of questions: 
  
I&#x27;m wondering what is the &quot;correct&quot; way to install emacs on MacBook Pro M1 with Sonoma - standard or plus release.
 If emacs-plus is the correct way should I include those additional flags like &quot;--with-native-comp&quot; and if yes which ones?
 If emacs-plus is the correct way, what is better to use &quot;emacs-plus@29&quot; or just use the latest version? I guess that if I just use the latest version, then it will be updated whenever I run brew update and upgrade, and I&#x27;m not sure how things are going in emacs world with those updates. I used to have problems with NeoVim updates, as well as plugin updates, so at one point in time, I was afraid to run plugin updates :) Hope Emacs is more stable.
  
Thanks in advance.

                              <span>I feel like this should be pretty obvious, but i&#x27;m pulling my hair out on the order of operations here.
 I want to customize some faces with a box. And i want that box to use a color from my current theme. But i don&#x27;t want to hard code the color value, but for it to use the dark or light color of the modus theme, depending on which is loaded on starting.
 So far i have tried using the function modus-themes-get-color-value but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be available at the point the tab-line gets activated. Then i tried this at the very end of my init.el:
 (custom-set-faces &#x27;(tab-line ((t (:box (:line-width (5 . 5) :color ,(face-background &#x27;tab-line)))))) ) 
 Which seems to be run before the theme is loaded, as i&#x27;m getting a white box on the modus-vivendi theme.
 I tried setting this up in a use-package statement for the tab-line-mode, for the modus theme and for the emacs pseudo package. I tried adding :after (modus-themes) to the use-package statement for the tab-line. All without success. I don&#x27;t even want it to track the theme when i change it after starting emacs. Just, get the background of the tab-line at start, after the modus-theme is loaded and use that for the box color.
 I feel like i&#x27;m somehow overthinking this. How can i get the tab-line border to look right regardless of the configured theme? Is this a case of having to set up a variable for your theme and then making this into a cond statement with hardcoded Color Values? This should work for now, but would mean i&#x27;d have to rewrite the any time i want to change themes.
 Just for completeness, here&#x27;s the entire config, if anyone want&#x27;s to take a look:

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently trying to generate a list of all times backups on my various servers are scheduled. There is a property &quot;BCKSCHED&quot; assigned to each server heading with the time as string. Like
 :PROPERTIES: :BCKSCHED: 01:00 :END: 
 I tried to use org-ql to generate a dynamic block that shows all times as a table. My dynamic block looks like this:
 #+BEGIN: org-ql :query &quot;property: BCKSCHED&quot; :columns (heading property) #+END: 
 When I run it with C-c C-c I get the error
 Symbol&#x27;s function definition is void: org-dblock-write:org-ql 
 So I tried a minimal example like this
 #+BEGIN: org-ql :query &quot;todo: &quot; :columns (heading property) #+END: 
 And also the example from the repository
 #+BEGIN: org-ql :query &quot;todo: priority:A,B&quot; :columns (todo (priority &quot;P&quot;) ((property &quot;agenda-group&quot;) &quot;Group&quot;) deadline heading) :sort (deadline priority) :take 7 :ts-format &quot;%Y-%m-%d %H:%M&quot; #+END: 
 But both have the same error as a result. What am I doing wrong here?

                              <span>I posted about using outline-mode for elisp about 5 years ago and I&#x27;ve gone a bit potty since then on folding most everything I work with - to the extent that I&#x27;ve even dropped most org-mode usage to outline-mode as I never really used the funky stuff (like agenda, todo etc).
 The motivation is that it makes viewing, organising and editing these files so much easier without the need to maintain +BEGIN/END SRC blocks and the tangling that comes with using org mode.
 I&#x27;ve also implemented the imenu index stuff so that I can have an alphabetic index to my headings.
 So far, I&#x27;ve converted elisp mode, org mode, sway, i3wm and waybar configurations to be folding with outline mode. The dotfiles are in my gitlab repo.

                              <span>Hello!
 I am using diff-hl and having a weird issue - in a repository I am unable to stage hunks of files that are not in the root directory of a git project. I am getting an error message when calling &#x60;(diff-hl-stage-diff (current-buffer))&#x60; or just calling the &#x60;diff-hl-stage-current-hunk&#x60; interactive function. 
 error
 Now, as you can see from the screenshot, the &#x60;git apply ...&#x60; tries a temp file but the path is relative to the root of the project instead of the file that I am in.
 I traced it back to vc-git-command but am not proficient in elisp so can&#x27;t make sense of it.
 Has anyone encountered a similar issue?

                              <span>eat is a great terminal inside emacs. I&#x27;m curious if there is a way to make the buffer&#x27;s name show the current path. In vterm, we can set vterm-buffer-name-string to make this, but it seems there is no similar option for eat.

 Thanks.

                              <span>I used doom emacs for a while, but over the last couple of weeks wrote my own config, to be a bit more flexible.
 I want to use org-agenda, and in doom emacs I just let it check all my files under &quot;~/org/&quot;, so I can create TODOs everywhere and don&#x27;t have to think about what I should be putting in which todo file - or manage a single one.
 To achieve this, I have the following lines in my init.el:
 emacs-lisp (use-package org :pin org :commands (org-capture org-agenda) :config ;; agenda (setq org-agenda-start-with-log-mode t) (setq org-log-done &#x27;time) (setq org-log-into-drawer t) (setq org-directory &quot;~/org/&quot;) (setq org-agenda-files &#x27;(&quot;~/org/&quot;))) 
 I always run emacs as a daemon, and this is annoying for two reasons: 1. My recentf history is always filled with org files. I want them there, but not if they were opened by the org-agenda scan 2. I have a lot of org buffers initially
 How can I solve this? Or am I doing something which is not intended? I had the same setup in doom emacs, but never noticed that my recentf history or my buffers are spammed with agenda files. I want the agenda files on startup to work with the emacs-dashboard. I&#x27;m somewhat confused that this is not a more common problem, as I&#x27;m not sure how else I should be using org-agenda
 What I tried so far
  
do not keep org-agenda-files open after generating agenda I don&#x27;t understand that quiet though, I don&#x27;t want a solution that closes buffers when I close the agenda buffer
 Prevent recentf from being flooded - Reddit I neither want to ignore all my org files though

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I have a huge org file, and I get this error &quot;end of file during parsing&quot;.
 This usually means I have parenthesis not matching somewhere, I started removing the chapters of my files one by one, and retried to tangle: no change, I got the same error everytime, this does not make sense to me, I should have been able to tangle at some point!!
 I tried with a diff (I have a backup of this file), but I am not good at reading diff buffers (and I only discovered difftastic yesterday... that I can not implement, due to the error...).
 It forces me to get better at dealing with changes in my configuration &#x3D;&#x3D;&gt; I will better document the changes from now on (Magit)
 Now to my question:
 Is there an emacs function that checks code blocks only, ignoring the litterate content? Using the #+BEGIN_SRC and #+END_SRC entries to locate the blocks, and only checking the content for syntax errors?
 Thanks for your support!!

                              <span>I loved my emacs exwm environment so much. But I had to let go of her eventually because I needed IDE features easily. I mainly work in python and sometimes in typescript, rust. 
 Adding language support (Go to function definition, syntax checking) always proved to be difficult for me. Almost never configured one successfully.
 So I finally just went with VS code. I want to go back to my emacs EXWM full setup. Any recommendations on how I can handle the language support part?
 Note: spacemacs support for EXWM was not so good. Or it might just be my inexperience with it.

                              <span>Have you ever thought to yourself, why should I give Emacs commands like a plebian, when an LLM can just control Emacs for me? Well the first step is now done, we now have a way to make any elisp command callable by an LLM that does function calling. For example, here is me switching buffers by telling the LLM to switch buffers by just describing the buffer I want switched to. It&#x27;s not exactly a huge time-saver, but it&#x27;s cool and shows the potential.

 https://i.redd.it/fy6jnbp2w1kc1.gif
 In my llm package, I&#x27;ve created a new function calling branch after learning that Ollama will soon support function calling. Right now both Open AI and Gemini do this (but Gemini has some limitations). As part of that, I have a utility to use function calling to create function definitions for elisp functions (which aren&#x27;t really rich enough in information to be passed to function calls as-is).
 I&#x27;ll be thinking about interesting new interactions that can be built off by having the LLM just control emacs via a few predefined commands. But it&#x27;s quite useful for certain things where you want the LLM to produce structured information. For example, I created a function that will create an example sentence given a word in a language, and then it can be passed to anki, etc. These things were a bit painful to do previously.
 As normal, I&#x27;m not planning on creating an actual end-user package here, but I want to encourage people to think about what can be done using function calling and, if there is something you want to put into a package, use the &#x60;llm&#x60; package to make it easy and portable (somewhat). Ideas and feedback are most welcome!

 ‚Äã
 I want to load a custom theme (aircon-theme) which is available at list-packages. I have created a folder called el inside .emacs.d In the el folder I have a core folder which has a theme.el file whose content is 
 (use-package aircon-theme :ensure t)
 In the init.el , I refer to the theme via 
 (load-file (expand-file-name &quot;el/core/theme.el&quot; user-emacs-directory))
 I was hoping this would auto-load the theme. However this only downloaded the aircon-theme, which I then selected manually using the drop down menu.
 ‚Äã
 Can someone point out why this method was not sucessful and what can be done to autoload the theme?

                              <span>In procedural/OOP laguages, for loops are O(1) space because they can mutate a single variable.
 If each iteration in a functional program is a recursive function call, would it result in n levels of recursion and hence O(n) space usage in the stack? This seems pretty absurd but I can&#x27;t find any resources on this.

I am running the ghcup recommended 9.4.8 ghc/ghci. Is this a base version issue? Or has it moved somewhere else and hoogle hasn&#x27;t been updated?

                              <span>And I do mean basic! Barely qualifies as a DSL.
 In short, I need/want a way to attach some color metadata to some text, and be able to concatenate those together. I want a bunch of concatenated items to (ideally) be the same type as a single item. (A Semigroup, in other words, I think?) And of course a function that prints it out to the terminal.
 So I want to do something like:
 t &#x3D; R &quot;some red text, &quot;  G &quot;some green text, &quot;  Y &quot;and some yellow!&quot; printColor t 
 I&#x27;ve tried a couple of ways and haven&#x27;t been super happy, wondering if there&#x27;s a better way!
 Attempt 1
 data ColorText &#x3D; R Text -- red | G Text -- green | Y Text -- yellow | N Text -- no color, default | Arr [ColorText] 
 ...and I made it an instance of Semigroup. This recursive definition worked fine practically speaking, bu‚Ä¶</span>

 I want the following behaviour for RET: If I am on a link it should follow it, otherwise I want it to call org-cycle.
 What I cannot figure out atm (being an emacs-noob) is how to test if point is currently located on a link.
 So could someone please explain to me how to test for a link at point?

                              <span>Reading through the Elisp of alphapapa&#x27;s immensely useful package burly.el, I came across this function definition:
 (defun burly--bookmark-window-state-hack (&amp;optional _)
 (unwind-protect
 (progn
 (cl-assert burly--window-state)
 (window-state-put burly--window-state (frame-root-window)))
 (setf bookmark-after-jump-hook (delete #&#x27;burly--bookmark-window-state-hack bookmark-after-jump-hook)
 burly--window-state nil)))
 I could not figure out the function argument, &quot;_&quot;. The function body does not reference it. The argument&#x27;s name seems to be intentionally non-descriptive.
 I Googled for information about Emacs and the underscore character but found nothing helpful. Then I asked ChatGPT, which replied:
 ‚Äã
  
In Emacs Lisp, when the underscore _ character is used as an argument to a function, it conventionally indicates that the argument is not used within the function body. This is a way to signal to other programmers that the argument is intentionally ignored or not relevant to the function&#x27;s operation.
  
If the argument is intentionally ignored, at it seems to be, why include it in the first place? Especially when the argument is &amp;optional anyway? What does it add to the function?

                              <span>I am using lsp-mode with company to edit some Python files. I noticed though that when I use it to edit C my company completions are much more complete. As an example, if I type in 
  void main(){ pri } 
 and select the top option (printf) it gives me
  #include  void main(){ printf(const char *, ...) }  Which puts my cursor on the first argument.
 But if I type in pri in Python and select print it just completes the word without even adding the parenthesis at the end. As a more complete example, I am working with a postgresql database and I type in 
  connection &#x3D; psycopg2.con  and it completes it to connection &#x3D; psycopg2.connect but without parens and it also doesn&#x27;t add in the arguments like how C does with printf. Is this an lsp limitation with Python? I am using an up to date company mode and lsp mode with pyright as my python lsp and clangd as my C lsp.

 If it is possible to find out or create a function in Emacs that can accomplish the same effect in Vim, is it a straightforward matter of binding the key sequence to the function?
 Does the evil framework provide some support for this?
 I was thinking whether there was an automated way of accomplishing this but on reflection it seems impossible.

                              <span>Hi Experts
 Newbie here, I wanted to open file under cursor in a split ... so wrote this elisp function.
 ‚Äã
 Just FYI using DOOM emacs.
 (defun rd/evil-find-file-at-point-with-line-split() &quot;lets extend the evil-find-file-at-point-with-line function to open in a split&quot; (interactive) (require &#x27;evil-commands) (let ((display-buffer-alist &#x27;((&quot;&quot; (display-buffer-reuse-window display-buffer-below-selected)))) (parent-file (current-buffer))) (evil-find-file-at-point-with-line) (split-window-vertically (- height)) (other-window 1) (pop-to-buffer (parent-file)) ) ) (define-key evil-normal-state-map (kbd &quot;C-w C-f&quot;) &#x27;rd/evil-find-file-at-point-with-line-split) 
 It works very inconsistently. File does open but sometimes in the same window, sometimes in a vertical split and sometimes in horizontal split(the intended).
 ‚Äã
 Can someone please point out what i am doing wrong?
 ‚Äã
 TIA

                              <span>Hi all.
 I&#x27;m facing strange problem and couldn&#x27;t figure out.
 Whenever I turn on jinx-mode in latex buffer, auctex (e.g. LaTeX-mode) automatically turned off and switched to latex-mode.
 Same issue occurs when I turn on jinx-mode globally.
 jinx-mode is perfectly working in other major-mode and auctex also works fine if jinx-mode is not turned on. 
 I tried to reinstall both packages and config them with many different settings
 but still no luck. 
 These are part of my configs. What am I missing?
 (use-package auctex :demand t :ensure (auctex :pre-build ((&quot;./autogen.sh&quot;) (&quot;./configure&quot; &quot;--without-texmf-dir&quot; &quot;--with-packagelispdir&#x3D;./&quot; &quot;--with-packagedatadir&#x3D;./&quot;) (&quot;make&quot;)) :build (:not elpaca--compile-info) ;; Make will take care of this step :files (&quot;*.el&quot; &quot;doc/*.info*&quot; &quot;etc&quot; &quot;images&quot; &quot;latex&quot; &quot;style&quot;) :version (lambda (_) (require &#x27;tex-site) AUCTeX-version))) (use-package latex :ensure nil :mode (&quot;\\.tex\\&#x27;&quot; . LaTeX-mode) :after auctex :config (setq-default TeX-master nil) (setq-default TeX-command-extra-options &quot;--shell-escape&quot;)) (use-package jinx :demand t :bind ([remap ispell-word] . jinx-correct) :hook (emacs-startup . global-jinx-mode) :config (setq jinx-languages &quot;en&quot;) (set-face-attribute &#x27;jinx-misspelled nil :underline &#x27;(:color &quot;#ffcc00&quot; :style wave)))

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to get more in-depth in Haskell currently by doing the protohackers.com challenges. These challenges require your program to be a TCP server, accept connections, read some data (sometimes binary, sometimes UTF-8 encoded strings), and reply with some meaningful data.
 I&#x27;ve made decent headway in Haskell&#x27;s flavor of socket programming, using Network.Socket and Network.Socket.ByteString, and have successfully solved the first challenge. I find myself struggling with the myriad ByteString types, in that I&#x27;m constantly fighting to determine which flavor of ByteString each function needs and how to convert between them. When there&#x27;s this much of a struggle, I feel like I might be going about it the wrong way and would appreciate any insight here.
 My ByteString related imports:

                              <span>Update: I can make all tables foldable by changing name to result, ex: +NAME: mytable1 to +RESULTS: mytable1. Not sure what are the cons in this &quot;solution&quot;. It&#x27;s better than incapsulating table in block BEGIN/END.
 Wonder why can&#x27;t be tables (+NAME blocks) be foldable by default? There is so many posts on stackoverflow, etc about it.
  
Original OP: Hello everyone!
 I use org tables with +NAME: field and usually no code block, example
 +NAME: mytable1
 | | col1 | col2 | col3 |
 | row1 | 5 | 10 | aaa |
 | row2 | 10 | 20 | bbb |
 | row3 | 10 | 40 | ccc |
 and i need to be able to fold them. I searched through different solutions online, and seems all stoped working due to recent org update.

                              <span>I want to set-up projects to use with &quot;consult-project-buffer&quot;
 Is it possible to manually select which files go into each project? Example:
 I have following project strucutre:
 myproject/ 
 -----------/.git 
 -----------/mynotes.org 
 -----------/scripts/ 
 -----------/tests/ 
 -----------/logs/ 
 -----------/data/
 that&#x27;s the most logical dir set-up and most conveniet way to access file for me most of the time.
 However sometimes say i am working on &quot;pull_rss_feeds&quot; part of my project and need to access related files in scripts, tests, logs, data folders. So is there a way to manually create project pull_rss_feeds and tell exactly what files i want to be part of this projects?
 Another use case is my emacs config. Part of config is in my emacs folder, part is in .emacs.d folder... I would like to manually create emacs project and tell exactly where files are.

                              <span>I want to use Eglot when editing HTML or CSS files. From Eglot&#x27;s source code,
 (html-mode . ,(eglot-alternatives &#x27;((&quot;vscode-html-language-server&quot; &quot;--stdio&quot;) (&quot;html-languageserver&quot; &quot;--stdio&quot;)))) ((css-mode css-ts-mode). ,(eglot-alternatives &#x27;((&quot;vscode-css-language-server&quot; &quot;--stdio&quot;) (&quot;css-languageserver&quot; &quot;--stdio&quot;)))) 
 In order to install these language servers, I tried to use npm but I&#x27;m not very familiar with it. In particular, if I don&#x27;t want to install them using root privileges, what should I do? npm install -g vscode-langservers-extracted for example, attempts to install everything in /usr/local/lib/node_modules.
 I also tried npm install --save vscode-langservers-extracted to get all packages in a folder but have no idea how to hook it with Eglot.

 if you don&#x27;t know projectile. it&#x27;s basically a package that let&#x27;s you index all your project directories so that later you can just fuzzy find your way to what you want to work on.
 so you look for the project -&gt; tap enter -&gt; then you will be prompted to choose the file from inside that project.
 this is great. but if i close emacs and then i open it again (for whatever reason) i have to look for and re-open the same files i was working on.
 i guess what i need is a way to fuzzy find through my projects (like in projectile) but instead of prompting with choosing a file (after i pick a project) it will re-open the same buffers that were opened last time.
 ps: i sort of asked about this before but i think that i didn&#x27;t communicate my issue properly.
 thanks

                              <span>Hi guys i&#x27;m totally new to emacs and here (this is my first post).
 Let me describe my problem: i installed typescript-language-server protocol on emacs and via npm (don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s required btw, installing both for my system and emacs).
 After 5-6 hours strulling i did it ! I got it working, now i can select any .js file in my react folder, i can activate lsp by &quot;C-x lsp&quot;, works totally great until i move on another .js file. The language server works for only one file i&#x27;m currently on, i need to enable it for every .js file and that&#x27;s odd. Can you help me ? Thanks in advance !
 Edit: Thank you u/Bortolo_II , i solved the problem by adding (add-hook &#x27;js-mode-hook &#x27;lsp) to my ~/.config/doom/config.el file then did doom sync and everyting is fine now !

                              <span>I have been a sporadic Emacs user. it has been my fav text editor. I love its infinite extensibility compared to alternatives like Vim. However I have been wondering if Emacs is on its way down.
 I guess it all started with the birth of NeoVim about a decade back. The project quickly grew and added features which made it better of an IDE than stock Vim (I think). Now i know Vim is not designed to be an IDE, but many NeoVim users seem to want that functionality. Today neovim has plugins t not only code and autocomplete, but also debug code in most languages. i lbelieve it has been steadily attracting users of stock Vim (and of course Emacs)
 Then enter, VSCode about 6 years ago. I guess this project attracted a lot of users from aother text editors (including Emacs). Today it has an extension for everything. Being backed by microsoft means its always going to be better.
 Now whenever I try to look up solutions for Emacs issues on the web, most posts i see are at least 10 years old. For example, I googled for turning Emacs into a web dev IDE. A lot of reddit and Stackoverflow posts that the search turned up were more than a decade old.
 I am wondering if Emacs is on a steady decline . The fact that it is not available by default on many systems seems to be an additional nail in its grave. Even on this sub, a lot of Emacs lovers who used to post regularly, like redguardfoo and Xah are no longer active
 This makes me sad. I absolutely hate having to install a browser disguised as a text editor (VS Code) which will be obsolete probably by another 5 years. I hope that Emacs stays around. Its infinite extensibility is what i love the most (and of course elisp) 
 Would like to hear your thoughts

                              <span>In the world of Emacs, there&#x27;s a perennial debate between purists who swear by Emacs&#x27; native keybindings and those who find solace in the familiarity of Vim keybindings through Evil Mode. Proponents of Emacs keybindings argue for their extensibility and deep integration with Emacs&#x27; ecosystem, while advocates of Evil Mode tout its efficiency and the muscle memory carried over from Vim.
 For those who&#x27;ve made the switch, what are your experiences with either Emacs keybindings or Evil Mode? Did you find one to be more intuitive or productive than the other? How seamless was the transition from Vim to Evil Mode within Emacs? And for Emacs veterans, do you find that sticking to Emacs keybindings offers advantages that outweigh the allure of Evil Mode?
 Share your thoughts, tips, and insights on navigating the Emacs keybindings vs. Vim (Evil Mode) dilemma in Emacs, and help others find their preferred path to a more efficient editing experience.

It&#x27;s still pretty small, and I&#x27;m already seeing it spiral into the spaghettiverse. I do plenty of code reviews, we refactor stuff, we make healthy use of generics and tests, but it still doesn&#x27;t feel clean.
 For context: I&#x27;ve only ever worked on awful codebases. My biggest work project before this was a php + symfony project that was so riddled with dependency hell that the previous devs couldn&#x27;t get composer to work, so they started FTP&#x27;ing the dependencies around to new instances (and to new dev&#x27;s work computers!!).
 So this is the first time I feel like I have an opportunity to work with something that isn&#x27;t a mess. I thought that typescript with a strict focus on type safety would do the tr‚Ä¶</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to get stack traces from a live running GHC (version 9.2.2) compiled Haskell program. 
 I understand I need to send SIGQUIT to the process to get the stacktraces of the currently running threads.
 But everytime I do this I just get the message: &quot;This build does not support backtraces.&quot;
 This is what I have done:
  
Our build is using nix, so I&#x27;ve added the following to the overrides for the GHC build:
  
 ghc &#x3D; old.ghc.overrideAttrs (oldAttrs: { configureFlags &#x3D; oldAttrs.configureFlags ++ [&quot;--enable-dwarf-unwind&quot;]; buildInputs &#x3D; oldAttrs.buildInputs ++ [pkgs.elfutils]; }); 
  
I&#x27;ve added the following flags to all the builds of our packages:
  
 -ticky -g -fprof-auto -fprof-auto-calls 
  
I added the flag --enable-debug-info to the cabal build command. 
  
I don&#x27;t know what else to do. The docs say:
  
On POSIX-compatible platforms GHC‚Äôs runtime system (when built with libdw support) will produce a stack trace on stderr when a SIGQUIT signal is received
  
It doesn&#x27;t say here how to build with libdw support, but I read somewhere elsewhere that one needed to add --enable-dwarf-unwind, and indeed when I did that the GHC build initially complained about not being about to find the libdw library until I added elfutils to the buildInputs.
 The error message also doesn&#x27;t make it clear whether the build of GHC doesn&#x27;t support backtraces or the build of my executable doesn&#x27;t support backtraces. Which makes hunting this down even more difficult.
 What am I missing? Is there anyway to ask GHC whether it&#x27;s compiled with libdw support so I can at least work out whether the problem is with the GHC build or the build of my executable?
 (x-post from https://discourse.haskell.org/t/how-to-get-stack-traces-out-of-ghc-executables/8844 sorry I&#x27;m not sure the best place for these questions)

                              <span>I‚Äôm a software engineer (using TypeScript and Rust mostly) working mainly in Web Development and some Enterprise/Desktop Development.
 I recently used Haskell for the 2023 Advent of Code and fell in love with it. I‚Äôd love to work more with Haskell professionally, but it doesn‚Äôt seem widely used in Web Development.
 Folks using Haskell professionally: what‚Äôs your role/industry? How did you get into that type of work? Do you have any advice for someone interested in a similar career?
 Edit: thanks for all the responses so far! It&#x27;s great to see Haskell being used in so many diverse ways! It&#x27;s my stop-looking-at-screens time for the night, so I wish you all a good night (or day as the case may be). I really appreciate everyone for sharing your experiences and I&#x27;ll check in with y&#x27;all tomorrow!

This is another installment of the What Are You Working On? thread. Add to this discussion by telling us about your zettelkasten journey. Share with us what you&#x27;re learning. Sharing helps me and, hopefully, you, too. It helps me clarify my goals and visualize my thinking. And sometimes, a conversation sparks a magical moment where we can dive into an idea worth exploring. We&#x27;d love to hear more from you.  ü´µüèº
Ideas I&#x27;m exploring with my ZK:
I&#x27;m adventuring on the path of a project-filled life. I&#x27;m using my ZK to document and reflect on ideas and progress centered around a project-filled life. I&#x27;m coming to this late in life; I&#x27;m 67, but that doesn&#x27;t matter. I&#x27;m here now, and I&#x27;ve started. We&#x27;ll see.
Why create a routine of short knowledge cycles, because it&#x27;s a simple process of recording and reviewing.
I&#x27;m looking at OpenAI&#x27;s ChatGPT as a tutor for exploring ideas.
I&#x27;m using my ZK to explore what it means to have an intellectual life.
Things I&#x27;m reading:
Sertillanges, A. G. and Ryan, Mary. The Intellectual Life: Its Spirit, Conditions, Methods. 1987.
Zentner, Jeff. The Serpent King. First Ember edition, Ember, an imprint of Random House Children‚Äôs Books, a division of Penguin Random House LLC, 2017.

                              <span>I have a multi-module application which has a java HTTP application (springboot, java 11) in one module and scala code in the second module.
 The second module is included as a dependency in the first module as code in the second module needs to get invoked on REST invocations.
 Here is a minimal project to reproduce the issue.
 Steps to reproduce the issue
 mvn clean compile java -jar scala-compiler-issue-service/target/scala-compiler-issue-service-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar 
 The above command to run the application fails on initialisation of the scala compiler.
 Caused by: scala.reflect.internal.MissingRequirementError: object scala in compiler mirror not found. at scala.reflect.internal.MissingRequirementError$.signal(MissingRequirementError.scala:24) ~[scala-reflect-2.12.16.jar!/:na] at scala.r‚Ä¶</span>

I also have the grammars (TS and TSX) installed with treesit-install-language-grammar from GitHub.
 The treesit-font-lock-level is the default 3.
 It seems to work OK except that it does not color the code (for instance, the HTML tags and classes):
 Am I missing something important in my configuration?

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently trying to save my org files after every change. I know this might be sub optimal but I want to finish this at least for the purpose of learning how to do something like this.
 So my approach was to add a hook for org mode that adds a hook for after-change-functions. Unfortunately this is active for all files once I&#x27;ve opened an org file. This is the code
 (defun savebuf(begin end length) (if (and (buffer-file-name) (buffer-modified-p)) (save-buffer))) (add-hook &#x27;org-mode-hook (lambda() (add-hook &#x27;after-change-functions &#x27;savebuf))) 
 So I added another hook for major mode changes to remove the after-change-functions hook like this
 (defun leave-org-mode-function() (when (eq major-mode &#x27;org-mode) (lambda() (remove-hook &#x27;after-change-functions &#x27;savebuf)))) (add-hook &#x27;change-major-mode-hook &#x27;leave-org-mode-function) 
 Unfortunately this doesn&#x27;t seem to work. The first hook still stays active and saves everything regardless of major mode. Any Ideas how I could make this work?

                              <span>I recently upgraded to emacs 29.2 on MacOS Sonoma via brew. Not thoughtfully as a mass update of everything. Things are mostly working with one exception that is very annoying to me. If I enable and use the auto-complete package, quitting emacs takes approximately 40 seconds.
 I&#x27;ve profiled the functions listed in kill-emacs-hook and the problematic function is ac-comphist-save. This function writes out a file: ~/.emacs.d/ac-comphist.dat, which on my system is approximately 73K. I searched and found an exchange about someone having the same problem on an older version of emacs on linux, and the only offered solution was to remove ac-comphist-save from kill-emacs-hook. Sadly, this affects the effectiveness of auto-complete as it doesn&#x27;t remember what completions you&#x27;ve used repeatedly and r‚Ä¶</span>

 Anybody knows if there exists a formal representation out there of Haskell&#x27;s hierarchy of typeclasses (see picture below) into some kind of ontology like OWL/RDF? I&#x27;d see value into having this available.
 see: https://www.haskell.org/onlinereport/basic.html

                              <span>After reading and experimenting I&#x27;m about 99% sure this just isn&#x27;t possible. Basically, I was trying to lift the api version into the type system to clean up some code so that the focus of the code was on the business logic instead of determining what api version to use in a bunch of places / passing around a isV1 boolean everywhere. This does mean that the api version would need to be determined at runtime, and nothing I&#x27;ve tried has made it able to get the client implicitly. I thought with everything sealed and having implicit defs for both of V1/V2 that it would work, but I&#x27;m guessing type erasure / something with subtyping makes it indeterminable. I tried classtags and the aux pattern, but couldn&#x27;t get it to work. This is scala 2.12 btw. I have something like this:
 sealed trait ApiVersion object ApiVersion { sealed trait V1 extends ApiVersion sealed trait V2 extends ApiVersion } sealed trait ApiClient[Version &lt;: ApiVersion] class V1Client extends ApiClient[ApiVersion.V1] class V2Client extends ApiClient[ApiVersion.V2] object ApiClient { implicit def v1Client: ApiClient[ApiVersion.V1] &#x3D; new V1Client implicit def v2Client: ApiClient[ApiVersion.V2] &#x3D; new V2Client } abstract class WrapperDomainObject { type Version &lt;: ApiVersion } object WrapperDomainObject { def apply(thing: ApiThing) &#x3D; if (/* some business logic */) new WrapperDomainObject { override type Version &#x3D; ApiVersion.V1 } else new WrapperDomainObject { override type Version &#x3D; ApiVersion.V2 } } class Service { def serviceFn(thing: WrappedDomainObject)(implicit client: ApiClient[thing.Version]) &#x3D; client.doBusinessThing } 
 Is this possible?

                              <span>Hi all,
How do you find notes and chain of thoughts without backlinks, when your ZK grows up?
TL;DR
My ZK is about 455 notes (some atomic, some literature, etc...).
But reading your past threads a question arose in my mind: what happens when my ZK grows bigger, say hundreds or
Furthermore, I realise that the more I get accustomed to backlinks, the more I&#x27;m dependent on specific tools such as Obsidian (not all Markdown editors have backlinks).
That is, I&#x27;d like to move to IA Writer, that I like much more: it has wikilcnks, but not backlinks.
Hope it makes sense.
Thank you!</span>

 If I disable fido mode, no problem. I note this thread from June: https://github.com/alphapapa/org-ql/issues/284
 Can I provide any other info to help answers/fix it? Happy to raise an issue on GitHub if that&#x27;s appropriate. Thanks.

 Sometimes I use VS Code for work, to understand a plugin, and just to explore.
 Window splitting in VS Code drives me nuts. Window management is too closely tied up with tabs. You end up with an hierarchy of &quot;Editor Groups&quot; and &quot;Editors&quot; instead of being able to recall any buffer wherever you want. Then Quick Open (buffer switcher) opens a file multiple times‚Äîone per Editor Group. Using VS Code&#x27;s &#x60;revealIfOpen&#x60; option partially addresses this, but reveals in the previous Editor Group‚Äîit can&#x27;t recall the file into the Editor Group your cursor is currently in like in Emacs.
 We added &#x60;revealIfOpenInActiveGroup&#x60; to fix this. This allows you to make VS Code work just like Emacs buffers. Here are the docs for the Get Started page in VS Code docs:
 ### Simulating Buffers
 If you&#x27;re coming from buffer-centric editors such as Emacs or vi, you can emulate that workflow with:
 &quot;workbench.editor.showTabs&quot;: &quot;single&quot;,
 &quot;workbench.editor.revealIfOpen&quot;: true,
 &quot;workbench.editor.revealIfOpenInActiveGroup&quot;: true,
 &quot;workbench.editor.closeEmptyGroups&quot;: false,
 VS Code has a model where Editors live hierarchically within Editor Groups, and to split your screen you must use Editor Groups. Using &#x60;revealIfOpen&#x60; with &#x60;revealIfOpenInActiveGroup&#x60; causes Quick Open to move already-open Editors into the active Editor Group. This allows you to emulate buffer-centric environments‚Äîno tabs, split your screen, and you can view any Editor within any Editor Group without opening a file multiple times.

I learned the hotkeys for moving around sentences and lines, moving up and down screenfuls etc. I did a lot of looking up about Emacs and am overwhelmed on how to get out of it what I want to. I want to learn more things like those hotkeys and how Emacs can be used to edit and navigate text fast. Are there any resources for that specifically, as well as complete guides to not only Emacs itself but the whole Emacs ecosystem? Are there any lists for all the popular ecosystem things like Spacemacs and Evil mode?

 is it possible to merge &#x60;evil-ex-search-history&#x60; with the &#x60;isearch-history&#x60;?
 I was looking around but could not find anything out of the box.

 #ifdef PLATFORM_ and #endif

 how to do that?
 (i&#x27;m aware outline-mode and hs-minor-mode exist, idk if i&#x27;m even supposed to use them together, or are they their own separate things..?)

                              <span>i started using emacs only for org-mode but i want so bad to just live in it while coding too.
 one thing that&#x27;s keeping me is that i can&#x27;t restore open buffers and what i was working on when opening a directory.
 in neovim it is as easy as installing a plugin an then it will work whenever you open neovim inside a directory.
 in doom emacs i found the workspace feature that i liked because it creates a new workspace whenever i use &quot;projectile switch&quot; but when i kill emacs all i find left is the last workspace (i don&#x27;t know if i am doing anything wrong but i am using SPC TAB . which is like &quot;M-x workspace switch to&quot;)
 i believe that i just don&#x27;t know the keyword to look for my solution (because that&#x27;s how i descovered Projectile too +\) )
 thanks for any help
 edit: lmao why so many down votes?

                              <span>Hi there. I&#x27;ve been back and forth with emacs and neovim for a long while now, preferring emacs but also kind of getting wrapped around the axel a bit with lisp. But, now as I start to move back to emacs (ORG mode is just too good, and I like some of the TUI abilities elsewhere that emacs gives me) , I&#x27;m looking for if there&#x27;s a generic and good way to set up LSP akin to neovim&#x27;s &quot;Mason&quot; project, which lets me just select the languages I need and properly set everything up.
 If not, that&#x27;s cool, but discoverability is still very weird in the editor world. I know how to use package managers and plan on starting a config with elpaca or straight, and then adding on evil and which-key and some doom-themes and doom-modeline, but the whole setup and configuration of various LSPs are where there&#x27;s a plethora of choice and I&#x27;m curious to see how people do it.
 Thanks!

                              <span>One of my favorite questions: How can I improve my Zettelkasten?
As an expert in our field, we are likely to find an answer. However, why not consider a different perspective on potential solutions? Here&#x27;s a concept for thinking outside the box, beyond the confines of one&#x27;s own thoughts. The key to a wide array of solutions lies in adapting well-known principles or frameworks from established sciences or schools of thought.

Can you re-find your own solutions to improve your Zettelkasten?

 It&#x27;s a game changer when you use dependencies like Jackson or OpenTelemetry for instance and want to keep all their modules version consistent easily across the dependency tree.

                              <span>I&#x27;m running Fedora 39 and I have installed xmonad with my distro&#x27;s package manager and it works fine and since I had no previous haskell setup I pulled all the dependencies through dnf. I wanted to install the haskell language server, but on the docs it says that I need to use ghcup. In your experience, could installing ghcup and pulling packages through it cause any conflicts or breaks in my xmonad?

                              <span>I get up four hours before work to bake, brew and grow mushrooms. There are many processes involved in each, and a lot of passive time during each process. 
 What I‚Äôve been trying to figure out is how to automatically determine the best ordering of any given set of processes to maximize passive time, so I can free up as much of time as possible while also being more productive. How would you about accomplishing this?
 So far, I‚Äôve got a ‚Äòprocess.org‚Äô file with a global process tag. I have a list of processes as headers, with properties like ‚ÄòTOTAL_TIME‚Äô, ‚ÄòACTIVE_TIME‚Äô, etc. What makes it challenging is some processes need to occur sequentially and have active time between them or throughout. Like mixing flour and water, waiting, then adding yeast and doing the first fold, waiting, then folding again, waiting, then proofing and preheating oven, waiting, then baking and waiting. 
 What I‚Äôd like to be able to do is go through my process.org file and just change the TODO state to ‚ÄòNEXT‚Äô then have the cumulative list of all processes for the next morning optimized for me.

Now the font size in emacs has increased but it is still the same as it was before in emacsclient. How do I make changes in the configuration so that they are reflected across both emacs and emacsclient? Any help would be appreciated.

                              <span>I last rewrote my init.el a decade ago, before use-package, and now it&#x27;s a giant heap of files, often one per added package to init a package, that get loaded in, along with various global settings that are adjusted through setq or function calls and then a custom.el
 And this works, but it takes some time to start emacs up....
 So I was thinking of re-doing this with the new fangled use-package all the kids are doing and was a bit dismayed to find now there are several other package managers, we went from none to plethora.
 At any rate, I was wondering what the best way to lay out an init.el was, especially regarding ordering of things like
  
loading of packages
 loading of custom.el (do I even need to explicitly load custom.el)
 setting of global settings via setq or function call
 key bindings
 other??
  
When I lay it out like this, I think that&#x27;s a pretty logical way of laying it out, but is it?
 What else should be considered in laying out an init.el to make it survive the decades?

                              <span>When I looked at the version of emacs on Fedora using dnf info, it shows 28.3 but the versions I see on the gnu website show 28.2 then 29.1.
 So I am not sure which version of emacs is the safest to install : the 28.3 one on Fedora that does not exist in the releases page, the 28.2 which got an update, the 29.1 or 29.2 that Fedora does not provide ?

                              <span>hi,
 im new into IT stuff and a freshman in uni and I worked only w vim till now. I decided to switch to emacs (doom) but im so clueless. Idrk which configs I should do, don&#x27;t know wich packages exist and which I should install, so a little instruction would really help me. im so lost and I don&#x27;t even know what I don&#x27;t know if you get what I mean? for now I only work w java, html, css and I can navigate through terminals, currently using wezterm but emacs is a completely new world to discover but it looks very promising but im obviously overwhelmed. Appreciate every help from u guys!

                              <span>I&#x27;m basically brand new to emacs and I&#x27;m trying to use it primarily for latex. I&#x27;ve gotten most things to work alright but I am disappointed with the lack of autocompletion options to far. In particular, TeX-electric-escape seems to do a very poor job in my opinion. It seems like predictive-mode is the solution but I am unsure how to install it. All the links on this page https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/PredictiveMode#h5o-2 seem dead and I&#x27;m unsure how else to access it. I would appreciate any help with this specific problem or advice on a potentially better way to handle autocomplete in latex.

                              <span>In scala 2.X usually there is a method to go from one collection to the other. For instance, you go from a Queue to a List using queue.toList.
 But sometimes there is no method available. Take converting a List to a Queue, there is no toQueue available. You can always do Queue.from and that&#x27;s fine, but I&#x27;m wondering how does the to method works, does anybody have examples or is it just an internal mechanism?
 For instance, I&#x27;ve tried:
 (0 until 5).to(Queue[Int]) (0 until 5).to[Queue[Int]](Queue[Int]) 
 But both seem to be invalid. Any pointers? Just looking for ergonomic ways to do these conversions. One can always foldLeft or use the above-mentioned collection.from but it&#x27;s less ergonomic.

                              <span>This question is not emacs-specific, but I have a feeling that this technical crowd might know a path forward given how customizable emacs is.
 My new work role requires me to spend even more time in email. We use Office 365 / Exchange for our work email, so the Outlook desktop client and the webmail interface is my default interface. Often times, I send an email to a recipient, and wait for their response. The chance that they respond is low, so I always have to send a follow up note. Take this and multiply by 100 threads, which takes up a lot of my time to stay on top of things.
 What I would like to do is set up my follow-up email, and have the note sent out on a certain date if I haven&#x27;t heard back yet. If the person responds before the date, the pre-written note should never be sent and could be discarded. Outlook email rules and delay send feature does not allow for such a complex scenario.
 I am aware of the Boomerang app for Gmail and Outlook, but I don&#x27;t think the cost is worth it; and I don&#x27;t think corporate would allow me to install that add-in in Outlook.
 I looked into Thunderbird as it has a &quot;send later&quot; plugin that appears to have a scripting component, which could probably work. However, I&#x27;m unable to get my work mail account to work with Thunderbird. I could probably try some more to figure out why it isn&#x27;t working.
 Question for the folks in this subreddit: is there a way to achieve the email rules I described using an email client in Emacs? Or some other open source tool?
 I know this is a long shot. Thanks in advance for any insight you might provide.

 I&#x27;d&#x27;ve expected, since, Emacs traffics in text, there&#x27;d&#x27;ve been something in-built but, beyond references to ISO-639-1 for setting the style of fonts (https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Fonts.html), I can&#x27;t seem to find much of anything.
 Plus, any language-related stuff I find (such as the Melpa package Guess Language and https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/GuessBufferLanguage) seem to roll their own (scaled down) version rather than relying on anything within Emacs or, even, a third-party library.
 Figured someone here might know of something, if there is anything.

It is even possible to distinguish between snippets for inline and display math environments. 
 Is there a package that does this possible in emacs ?

                              <span>Please help. I have recently upgraded emacs and tried to adopt LSP &amp; treesitter. I&#x27;m primarily working in Typescript at the moment so I&#x27;m using LSP typescript and tsx-ts-mode. Also using lsp-ui, LSP eslint, flycheck and company-mode.
 The result has become extremely frustrating as I&#x27;ve started to use it beyond trivial use cases. When working quickly, with many files/projects open, the following often happens:
  
make an edit quickly
 no update from language server and any stale errors remain
 tsserver process spins and spins at max CPU for about a minute
 CPU drops and the buffer finally updates... maybe?
  
It can take minutes to respond, and sometimes seems to stall indefinitely. I end up forced to &#x60;lsp-restart-server&#x60; repeatedly throughout the day. I don&#x27;t think this is necessarily specifically an LSP issue, but probably some combination of things, like maybe LSP is getting confused and issuing too many requests? I have already gone through all the recommendations in &#x60;lsp-doctor&#x60; and I&#x27;m a little uncertain where to even look to diagnose further (the &#x60;*lsp-log*&#x60; doesn&#x27;t contain anything illuminating) and the problem seems to get worse and worse.
 Is this a common experience? How can I see better what&#x27;s going on? Any packages I should maybe look for and jettison?

                              <span>I am a sporadic Emacs user. i know some keybinds, i can write elisp by googling and putting together a script. So I am not a complete beginner as such. 
 I have been trying to set up Emacs for front-end web dev work but I cant seem to get error highlighting for HTML to work. i installed packages like emmet, web, company, flymake, js2, etc and was able to get HTML tags autocompletion and indentation. But no matter what i do i cannot seem to get error highlighting for html misspelled tags which oher editors do by default. i have installed flymake and all it does is highlights tags that are left open.
 Will Doom Emacs/Spacemacs solve these configuration issues? if yes, which one would be the best? Also, is there any way to kep my current .emacs file and vanilla emacs installation without having it detected by Doom/Spacemacs?

                              <span>Hello everyone, I have been having trouble with my config for the past day or so. I have been messing with tree sitter because wanted the highlighting to look like doom emacs&#x27; tree-sitter highlights.
 treesit
 When I started I was using the built-in treesit package, however I quickly realized the highlighting was fairly subpar even when the font-lock was at level 4. I looked at the doom source code and saw that they were using the old 3rd party tree-sitter package.
 tree-sitter
 Using this package seems to bring a lot more options into scope and it immediately made the highlighting better. However, I am still having trouble making it look as good as doom&#x27;s highlighting (particularly in python files).

 In the images you will see:
  
Doom emacs&#x27; look that uses 3rd party tree-sitter

(&quot;clangd&quot; &quot;-j&#x3D;8&quot; &quot;--log&#x3D;error&quot; &quot;--malloc-trim&quot; &quot;--background-index&quot; &quot;--clang-tidy&quot; &quot;--all-scopes-completion&quot; &quot;--completion-style&#x3D;detailed&quot; &quot;--pch-storage&#x3D;memory&quot; &quot;--header-insertion&#x3D;never&quot; &quot;--header-insertion-decorators&#x3D;0&quot;)))) 
 Recently I have to work inside some docker containers that use different toolchains, things mostly work on Emacs 29 native support for docker in Tramp, except that I now need to pass the --query-driver option to clangd to effectively index my project, somehting like this:
  (add-to-list &#x27;eglot-server-programs &#x27;((c-ts-mode c++-ts-mode c-mode c++-mode) .

 Is there a way to set eglot-server-programs per project? Maybe as dir-local variable?

 I&#x27;d like the cursor to move as predictably as possible when I scroll. I want it to get back to the original position when I scroll up and down back and forth a few screens.

 There are a couple of issues with the scroll up and down functions. First, the beginning and the end of buffer are an edge case. But I can work with that. The scroll-up-command and scroll-down-command work better for me than scroll-up and scroll-down. I can write a wrapper that remembers the last good position and jumps there when I move in the opposite direction from the beginning or end.

                              <span>Sorry for that difficult title, if it didn&#x27;t give you a stroke, I&#x27;ll give you an example of what I mean.
 So for instance, the command calendar normally reuses the current frame/window. However, with the variable calendar-setup set to two-frames, it creates two new frames, one for the calendar and one for the diary.
 This isn&#x27;t the only command like this, it&#x27;s just an example, and it&#x27;s not even the only one I might like to solve, since I face a similar problems with some gnus workflows I want to build, so please, no specific hacks to get this particular thing to work such as suggesting I not use calendar-setup set to two-frames, I really need a generalisable solution to this.
 So the issue is, if I launch emacsclient -e &#x27;(calendar)&#x27; from a shortcut or the command-line in order to bring up my calendar, this doesn&#x27;t work unless there is a pre-existing emacsclient frame.
 The solution then would seem to be to issue either emacsclient -c -e &#x27;(calendar)&#x27; or emacsclient -r -e &#x27;(calendar)&#x27; in order to create a frame first.
 The problem is this creates a totally useless frame that is both annoying, but also problematic, because you can&#x27;t close it if the calendar and diary frames aren&#x27;t already closed.
 What I&#x27;d like is to be able to run (calendar) and have it create its frames without the need for a pre-existing frame. Or else in a really bad pinch, have the dummy frame created but totally hidden, and have it quit the moment I close the diary and calendar frames.
 Does anybody have any ideas? I&#x27;ve been pulling my hair out here, I dunno if I&#x27;m missing something obvious.

                              <span>I am on emacs 29.2. 
 I tried to setup haskell-ts-mode following the instructions here
 While I was able to successfully setup the treesit mode for python and c++, for haskell I keep getting File mode specification error: (void-function haskell-ts-mode)
 The relevant lines in my dot-file are: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; (use-package haskell-mode :ensure t :defer t ;; :mode ((&quot;\.hs\&#x27;&quot; . haskell-mode)) :init)

                              <span>Hello.
 My last real attempt at an Emacs package was El Gantt which generates gantt charts from orgmode files. I written a couple other buggy things (e.g., https://github.com/legalnonsense/org-visual-outline). I am a lawyer and Emacs helps keep me sane at work. Elisp is the only language I know and only one ever want to know. 
 For the last couple years I have worked on something new. I have been using it for awhile now and think it is good enough to share: https://github.com/legalnonsense/reorg. 
 It is like taxy.el, org-ql, org-sidebar except that it‚Äôs not limited to org files and it‚Äôs messier shotgun of ideas. 
 It allows clones of outline nodes as featured in Leo Editor. This also means it can at least give the appearance of real transclusion. 
 I‚Äôve written a readme that explains everything in a way that I hope makes sense.
 I make no guarantee that you can clone and run this error free.

                              <span>Hi everyone üëã
 When using package vertico and orderless, everytime I want to save a current file with slightly different name using C-x C-w, I can only choose the current one.
 For example, I want to wirte-file from .zprofile to .profile, I hit C-x C-W, and type in .profile, but I can only choose .zprofile.
 How can I write the file to .profile?

 Is there a way to create new files from &quot;missing links&quot; within org-roam?

                              <span>Hi all, I&#x27;ve recently written an article about stuff I&#x27;d love to see Haskell do as a user of the language. I&#x27;ve been using Haskell for over 15 years now, and I believe at least some of those things would make Haskell a better language to work in. I was wondering what everyone else would love to see in Haskell - informally, without the restraints of a fully formal enhancement proposal. Shoot your ideas in the replies, I&#x27;d love to hear it. Also, let me know what you think of the article. Bear in mind this is the first such article I&#x27;ve written in maybe 12 years, so maybe don&#x27;t rip into it too much :) It&#x27;s all meant to be a little informal and inspirational rather than a fully prescriptive solution to every problem.

Does anyone have a working example of just rendering some triangles or something using vertex arrays in Haskell? I&#x27;m probably just missing some binding command or something, but I can&#x27;t figure out what.

                              <span>During experimenting with loom-based development, I wanted a rust like ?- Operator. 
 The implementation turned out to be a little bit tricky, but here it is: https://github.com/reactivecore/quest
 The tricky part is correct return type deduction, consider this:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;scala def operation(): Option[Int] &#x3D; ???
 val result &#x3D; quest { operation().? Some(12) } &#x60;&#x60; The result will beOption[Int]. If it would just look at the inner functon ofquestit would deductSome[Int]&#x60;. 
 This works using a special trait called Resulting[T] which is triggered by quest being a context function. 
 Resulting is also referenced by the question operator, thus the compiler is inferencing T to be None and Some[Int] resulting in Option[Int].
 The library triggers an early exit using Exceptions without Stacktraces. Measurements show, that this creates an overhead of ~5ns, which should be acceptable.
 Of course it won&#x27;t work (and being dangerous) in lazy evaluated code (Futures, Lazy Collections, Effect Systems etc.).
 What do you think?
 Disclaimer: The base idea was already presented by Martin Odersky at Scalar Conference 2023 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;0Fm0y4K4YO8 (which I rembered later in implementation)
 There is also an old thread.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been trying to land a job in Scala for a month now and one thing I&#x27;ve noticed is that there are a lot fewer positions compared to 2 years back when I was last active in the job search. Not only that, most listings have scala as an additional language or a plus. 
 This makes me want to learn something new, but what? My previous company moved away from Scala and to Azure. What else is going on in your companies?

                              <span>Lsp shows error message only when I move cursor on line where error is.
 Especially in rust files, it shows a small arrow opposite the line where there is an error however the error itself (message) shows only when I move my cursor to this line. Or maybe its not even lsp, maybe this is flycheck?

                              <span>Hi everyone üëã
 Okay, so I have this problem where I always had a few hundred buffers open in ibuffer, and I couldn‚Äôt figure out what was doing it - since YEARS. Well, I finally figured it out the other day! Org refiling was the culprit. See, I didn‚Äôt know this but whenever you refile, when it says getting all targets, it‚Äôs opening them up (at least it did in my ibuffer behind the scenes).
 To counter this, I asked an AI to help me, and it did. It wrote the code but it couldn‚Äôt get the last part right about not opening ibuffer to kill everything. I fixed that up myself. So this is a collaboration between an AI and me, but the code works.
 The only ‚Äúissue‚Äù now is that if you have a lot of targets, it will take a few seconds each time to do the gathering part. For me, that‚Äôs not a big deal, ‚Ä¶</span>

                              <span>org-mode defines a serious number of keys in org-mode-map, some of which I want to use for my own nefarious purposes. There&#x27;s org-disputed-keys which is supposed to stop org-mode from squatting on them. The trouble is, it doesn&#x27;t always seem to work.
 For example, I want to use C-M- globally to move the point to the window in those directions (with windmove) and I want to use C-M-S- globally to move the window itself in those directions (using my own defun).
 org-mode squats on those shifted C-M-S- keys, and you would think that this would fix it:
 (setq org-replace-disputed-keys t) ;; restart emacs after changing any of these: (setq org-disputed-keys &#x27;(([(kbd &quot;C-M-S-&quot;)] . [( nil )]) ([(kbd &quot;C-M-S-&quot;)] . [( nil )]) ([(kbd &quot;C-M-S-&quot;)] . [( nil )]) ([(kbd &quot;C-M-S-&quot;)] . [( nil )]) 
 ([(kbd &quot;C-,&quot;)] . [( nil )]) 
 This works fine on other keys that org-mode would otherwise occupy, such as C-&#x27; but not on C-M-S- so I have to resort (in org-mode-hook) to a heavy-handed:
 (define-key org-mode-map (kbd &quot;C-M-S-&quot;) nil) (define-key org-mode-map (kbd &quot;C-M-S-&quot;) nil) 
 Any ideas what I&#x27;m doing wrong? Or is it a bug in org-mode?
 I don&#x27;t use org-mode very much (mainly for elfeed-dashboard) preferring the much simpler outline-minor-mode (plus a few hacks) but I do want org-mode buffers/windows to behave themselves with my window moving global keys.

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to build a shared library with stack such that all dependencies, including GHC runtime, is linked statically into it. I do this by passing -static. This in on Linux.
 However, I get tons of linker errors with ghc libraries like requires unsupported dynamic reloc, recompile with -fPIC
 Now, -fPIC is required to link all that statically into one shared lib. How can I make stack build (re-build?) entire GHC runtime with -fPIC?

                              <span>I like to sum up columns $1..$4 in column $5, if there are numbers to sum up. If not, I would like to check for a dash &quot;-&quot; and output &quot;n/a&quot;. However, doing this using calc I get an error:
 ‚Äã
 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | if(vsum([1, 2, 3])) | |---+---+---+---+---------------------| | 7 | 6 | 5 | 1 | 18 | | 5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 8 | | - | | | | #ERROR | #+TBLFM: $5&#x3D;if($1 &#x3D; &quot;-&quot;, string(&quot;n/a&quot;), vsum($1..$3)) 
 How can I deal with strings in calc?
 Trying the same in elisp leads to another question:
 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | if(vsum([1, 2, 3])) | |---+---+---+---+---------------------| | 7 | 6 | 5 | 1 | #ERROR | | 5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | #ERROR | | - | | | | n/a | #+TBLFM: $5&#x3D;&#x27;(if (equal &quot;-&quot; $1) &quot;n/a&quot; vsum($1..$3)) 
 So, how do I evaluate calc expressions in elisp?

                              <span>There&#x27;s been some blues in the ecosystem, and just wanted to share a brief opinion: Scala is beautiful. 
 I worked past 6 months with different stack (JS/TS), and now got a chance to do little Scala 3 again. It&#x27;s so beautiful it brings tears to my eyes. Really, it does.
 Small things you easily forget, and notice when they are gone (just to mention few): syntax ergonomics, pattern matching, compiler &amp; macros working for you, powerful std library and amazing ecosystem of libraries that make Scala also practical to build real projects with it. 
 EVERYONE who has contributed, please take a moment and receive my sincerest thank you!

 but I do want to test to use my local emacs GUI and make the same things. open files, run process there, etc. 
 I tested to open tramp like &#x60;/ssh:matt@192.168.1.10:/home/matt/code/&#x60; and it open the dir, but I can&#x27;t for example seek project files. Also I use devenv (nix) to load the needed tools, but even if I open vterm and execute it, the main process doesn&#x27;t have it. so I can&#x27;t run things like tests. 
 Is there other way to use it ? or any tutorial in how to configure?
 ‚Äã
 Thanks in advance!

 Loading data into widgets and saving widget data to a file 
 # Background
 Hi team,
 I&#x27;m looking to create a handy little tool for some specific tabletop RPG games (DND-like, Call of Cthulu, Deadlands) and I would like to know if anyone has any ideas for how to get data from a markdown language (such as a .yaml file) into a widget screen and then save from the widget screen back into the file again. 
 My current idea is that I could use an emacs form after running a program to parse the data from the .yaml file, but that eliminates my ability to use the fun widget library in emacs (which has the nice features of checkboxes and buttons). So I would like to be able to have my widget &#x27;UI&#x27;, and load the data from the yaml file interactively, so that I can save back to it as well.
 I&#x27;ve been trying to find the source code for the customize buffer in emacs, which does essentially what I want to do, but my grepping has been to no avail.

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to get my org agenda/TODOs to sync with my Apple Calendar (iCal, I think).
 I&#x27;ve seen about half a dozen pages explain this in various ways, but none are very easy to set up, and they don&#x27;t get too much into specifics about whether it is two-way syncing (which is what I wish for) or not.
 In short: Does anyone have a solution that is fairly easy to set up?
 EDIT: I have tried org-caldav with my NextCloud setup, but it&#x27;s not working entirely correctly and I&#x27;m not certain why. It syncs from the calendar on the server, but not to it. Also, NextCloud appears to be a bit buggy at times as I found it difficult to delete the test calendars at times.

                              <span>I have an init.el pretty much unchanged since 2010 or so. So I&#x27;ve declared emacs init bankruptcy and am starting over.
 I&#x27;ve installed the latest stable version of emacs (29.2) and am using an init.el generated by https://emacs.amodernist.com/
 I am not sure this is the latest and greatest kind of init, I notice it does not use any use-package
 One big change between then and now is the introduction of the nongnu repository and I see that it&#x27;s automatically listed in the package-archives of emacs 29.2.
 What&#x27;s it state?
 Do I need melpa at all?
 If I do need melpa for packages not yet in gnu or nongnu, how do I add melpa in so that it&#x27;s priority is last on the list?
 Right now I have:
 (require &#x27;package) (add-to-list &#x27;package-archives &#x27;(&quot;melpa&quot; . &quot;http://melpa.org/packages/&quot;) t) (setq package-archive-priorities &#x27;((gnu . 10) (nongnu . 5) (melpa . 1))) 
 But even so, when I m-x list-packages I can see that emacs wants to upgrade the nongnu packages to the ones in melpa.
 As an example
 the version of the avy package in melpa is 20230420.404
 but in nongnu the version is 0.5.0
  
When installing packages, the package with the highest version number from the archive with the highest priority is selected. When higher versions are available from archives with lower priorities, the user has to select those manually.
 Archives not in this list have the priority 0, as have packages that are already installed. If you use negative priorities for the archives, they will not be upgraded automatically.
  
Since the version numbers of nongnu and melpa differ so widely, it seems as if there is no way to just set package archive priority such that it will default to nongnu
 Any advice?
 Suggestions on using melpa or not?
 Suggestions if using melpa how to get it to be used only when packages are not found in gnu or nongnu?

                              <span>Today, I am happy to announce the initial release of the botan-bindings and botan-low packages to hackage.
 This is the result of more than 7 months of sustained effort to provide a series of bindings to the Botan C++ cryptography library, and was made possible through support from the Haskell Foundation and funding provided by Mercury.
 Botan is an open-source, BSD-licensed C++ cryptography library with an extensive suite of cryptographic algorithms and utilities, ranging from simple hashes and ciphers to complete protocol implementations of SRP6, X509, and TLS, and even post-quantum cryptography algorithm. Botan is developed and maintained by an active community, has been audited in the past, and provides a Haskell-compatible C FFI.
 As such, it provides a stable, portable cryptography l‚Ä¶</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently doing the #48in24 challenge on Exercism and it has me try to solve the same exercises in many different languages in quick succession, usually ones I need to discover on the spot. This means finding out what features are available in the language itself and in the libraries.
 And this made me realize how lucky I am to work with Haskell! Aside from how featureful the language itself is, I&#x27;m baffled by how many languages have abysmal documentation on the standard library. At least the statically typed ones almost always tell you the types of argument and return value‚Ä¶ Quite often, I need to experiment in the REPL to understand what exactly some function or method does.
 This is in stark contrast with Haskell, where I I&#x27;m used to read the documentation and have every function explained in detail.
 I also find myself reinventing the wheel a lot less with Haskell. Modules like Data.List or Data.Text provide a wider selection of commonly needed operations that almost any other language I tried!

                              <span>I unistalled haskell a few weeks ago and when i tried installing again, I encountered and error when installing hls (the lsp). Whenever I ran the command &#x60;ghcup install hls&#x60;, I got the following error:
  
[ Error ] [GHCup-07210] Both installation and setting the tool failed. Install error was: Failed to merge file tree from /Users/myusername/.ghcup/tmp/ghcup-23fabf36d7c83e0b/Users/myusername/.ghcup/hls/2.5.0.0 to /Users/myusername/.ghcup/hls/2.5.0.0 
 [ ... ] exception was: user error (mergeFileTree: DB file /Users/myusername/.ghcup/db/hls/2.5.0.0 already exists!) 
 [ ... ] ...you may need to delete /Users/myusername/.ghcup/hls/2.5.0.0 manually. Make sure it&#x27;s gone. 
 [ ... ] Set error was: The version 2.5.0.0 of the tool hls is not installed. 
 [ Error ] Also check the logs in /Users/myusername/.ghcup/logs
  
The error message proposed that I delete a certain directory manually, I tried it and it did not work
 Can anyone please help me solve it?

                              <span>I wanted to see how the build time/space usage stacked up for the different parts of a project&#x27;s module tree, so I added a treemap visualization in addition to the old bar charts. 
 The intended use-case is to identify expensive parts of the module hierarchy to split into their own cabal components or packages. You can see it in action below:

                              <span>I have functions that return an Either[Exception,List[Path]]. I would like to do something like
 val res:Either[Exception,List[Path]] &#x3D; for { path1:Path &gt; Either[Exception, B], List, java.nio.file.Path]
  
I&#x27;ve tried adding cats syntax imports to no success. I&#x27;m fairly certain this monadic transform style should be doable for a basic collection. Any help or guidance is appreciated. Thank you!!
 EDIT: I wrote this code to hold the spot, until better code comes. For now this may be useful to others. I took advantage of the fact I&#x27;m only using Either[Exception,List[_]]. The example code basically runs as it. Maybe someone somewhere finds this useful too!
 import scala.annotation.tailrec class ListT[A](val run:Either[Exception,List[A]]) { def flatMap[B](func:A&#x3D;&gt;ListT[B]):ListT[B]&#x3D; run match { case Right(list) &#x3D;&gt; @tailrec def churn(remainder:List[A])(accum:List[B]):ListT[B]&#x3D; remainder match { case Nil &#x3D;&gt; ListT(Right(accum)) case head::tail &#x3D;&gt; val intermediate &#x3D; func(head) intermediate.run match { case l:Left[Exception,List[B]] &#x3D;&gt; intermediate case Right(list) &#x3D;&gt; churn(tail)(list++accum) } } churn(list)(Nil) case l:Left[Exception,_] &#x3D;&gt; this.asInstanceOf[ListT[B]] } def map[B](func:A&#x3D;&gt;B):ListT[B]&#x3D; run match { case l:Left[Exception,List[A]] &#x3D;&gt; l.asInstanceOf[ListT[B]] case Right(list) &#x3D;&gt; ListT(Right(list.map(func))) } }

                              <span>I was following Distro Tube&#x27;s guide on configuring Emacs and when I got to his Enabling Org Bullets section (36:05), I got an error telling me that org-bullets failed to load, so I did some digging and changed the code a bit, but now Org Bullets just doesn&#x27;t load and when I try to enable it using M-x, I got an error telling me &quot;Cannot open load file: No such file or directory, org-bullets&quot;.
 This was the original code from the video  (add-hook &#x27;org-mode-hook &#x27;org-indent-mode) (use-package org-bullets) (add-hook &#x27;org-mode-hook (lambda () (org-bullets-mode 1))) 
 This is what I change the code to:  (use-package org-bullets :hook((org-mode) . org-bullets-mode))

                              <span>Hi guys ! I&#x27;m a computer science student, and I&#x27;m looking for a minimalist, cheap and efficient e-ink tablet for increasing my productivity. My current workflow is like this: I code and annotate PDFs in Emacs, take notes in Org-Mode, and take hand-written notes for math classes. I&#x27;d like to centralize my work database, and for that the tablet should be able to read and annotate PDF files, but also Org ones and push changes on a cloud service. I&#x27;ll take any advice. Thanks in advance, and have a great day !

                              <span>With emms the only success I had reading metadata properly was using python tinytag with the line (setq emms-info-functions &#x27;(emms-info-tinytag)). The only other configuration I did was to set &quot;emms-info-tinytag-python-name&quot; to python3.
 But on new linux distros you can&#x27;t install tinytag via pip and your system python package. You have to install it into a virtual environment. 
 My question is, on new linux distros how do I set emms to use tinytag as installed in a python virtual environment? Do I activate the virtual environment and then set emms-info-tinytag-python-name to the path of python in the virtual environment?
 Thanks for any help.

 I assume that the website has changed their API and that&#x27;s broken it, but wanted to make sure it wasn&#x27;t something I did. I tried to track down the problem but I&#x27;m pretty new to elisp.

 ‚Äã
 I am using evil mode(doom emacs). In that i want to do is have &#x60;N&#x60; always search up in the file and &#x60;n&#x60; search down in the file ...
 ‚Äã
 for that i created this 
 ‚Äã
 #+BEGIN_SRC elisp ;; (define-key evil-motion-state-map (kbd &quot;#&quot;) &#x27;evil-ex-search-word-forward) (advice-add &#x27;evil-ex-re-bwd :after (lambda () (setq evil-ex-search-direction &#x27;forward))) (advice-add &#x27;evil-match :after (lambda () (setq evil-ex-search-direction &#x27;forward))) #+END_SRC 
 ‚Äã
 but it does not reliably work, can one of you experts tell me what i am doing wrong?
 ‚Äã
 TIA

 | col1 | col2 | col3 | col4 | | test | 1 | | | | test2 | 5 | -4 | 6 | | test3 | 4 | 1 | 9 | #+TBLFM: @3$3..@&gt;$3&#x3D;@-1$2-@0$2::@3$4..@&gt;$4&#x3D;@-1$2+@0$2 
 In col3 I show the result of subtracting the value in col2 in the current row from the value col2 in the previous row. col4 does the same with adding the rows
 But what if I wanted to have two table. One for the input data (col1, col2) and one for the calculated data (col3, col4)
 I tried it like this
 #+TBLNAME: data | col1 | col2 | | test | 1 | | test2 | 5 | | test3 | 4 | | col3 | col4 | | | | | -4 | 6 | | 1 | 9 | #+TBLFM: @3$1..@&gt;$1&#x3D;remote(data,@-1$2)-remote(data,@0$2)::@3$2..@&gt;$2&#x3D;remote(data,@-1$2+@0$2) 
 But it throws an error that &quot;Row descriptor -1 leads outside table&quot;. Obviously because the relative positions are not based on the second table

                              <span>new to emacs and been configuring around to setup emacs as my new editor. been doing some c an python and syntax highlighting is okay. typescript on another note seems like it&#x27;s lacking some syntax highlighting. when i set treesit-font-lock-level to 4, i get a message query pattern is malformed: &quot;Node type error at&quot;, 2, &quot;(function name: (identifier) @font-lock-function-name-face)... and a whole bunch of elisp which i still dont understand since i havent learned elisp yet. 
 i didnt do any customization in my init.el for treesitter besides adding treesit-auto 
 should there be customization in my config for typescript-ts-mode to use syntax highlighting?

 here is my config file (heavily copied from DistroTube&#x27;s configuring emacs videos) for reference.

 One of the most important topics in IT is surely the security, it&#x27;s so complicated and intriguing that, either you love it or you hate it, but we can&#x27;t help taking care of it. Nowadays, in a society based on computers and applications, crackers attacks are very concrete and dangerous. In my opinion, when we talk about IT security, it is always better to overestimate the risk and have a large margin of tolerance. The (hard) trade-off we have to make is that the solution is usable, has good performance, and is safe.
  
Often, it is not a single solution that makes something safe; it is the sum of several approaches that mitigate the risk.
  
 History
 It has been a while since I had my first idea for a library that would help developers securely manage secret values within their app‚Ä¶</span>

                              <span>This has been getting on my nerves but here&#x27;s the thing that I have seen. Top big tech companies who recruit in the technical round through experienced java devs suck. I don&#x27;t understand their obsession with Java, all their questions would keep revolving around Java collections, Streams, etc.
 ‚Äã
 So I had this interview with this big company where the interviewer was quite experienced. As they say a dev with &gt; 15 YOE is someone who must be way too much orgasmic about Java and I have always experienced this. Now the role for which they were hiring was Full Stack Dev, however this dude started with problem solving. 
 He asked me first which language would like to pick, so I told him that I would prefer using JavaScript/C++ and then he responded oh don&#x27;t you know Java? Look I don&#x27;t hate Java ‚Ä¶</span>

                              <span>Hi
 Is there a way to mark an org file as archived? I tried to change the file extension to org_archive, but (org-agenda-files nil t) does not include these files, because the same directory does not have a file with the same name but with .org extension

                              <span>I use org-roam and publish my notes online as static HTML. As part of publishing, I export the notes as txt, insert them into an FTS5 SQLite table and I added a small reactive app to an existing server to search and display the results. Everything works well but I recently used docsify at work and thought it was superb so I started thinking about client-side searching. I&#x27;ve thought about the following:
  
modify my export to markdown, generate the appropriate sidebar file and setup docsify in the normal way. My primary objection is the markdown exporter&#x27;s quality is unknown. This would also cut my publish time down significantly and wouldn&#x27;t be too much work.
 index the HTML (Note: getting this only do the relevant piece was difficult the last time I tried as tags and metadata blew up the results) as part of the publishing process and add a Javascript library that gets included in every exported HTML file. We&#x27;ll call this the stork model. While slightly slower than the previous option, this would also reduce publishing time substantially.
  
What other solutions occur to you?
 edit: I ended up doing the first one. It took a couple of hours to convert.

 Are there any emacs packages that include commands for taking the text in the active region and switching between bold, italic, etc using unicode substitutions? 
 ie like these kinds of text generators.
 https://lingojam.com/BoldTextGenerator 
 I realize such a generator can&#x27;t handle every character, but I want it just for highlighting words in comments, etc. 
 Tnx!

                              <span>I have Emacs for Android installed from https://sourceforge.net/projects/android-ports-for-gnu-emacs/ and it&#x27;s setup nicely.
 I&#x27;ve read the manual and it seems Emacs on Adroid (my Android version is 13) doesn&#x27;t have the ability to access the system clipboard - indeed it seems to be that way.
 Is there really no way to copy/paste - share data with other apps? For simple things - like cope a website&#x27;s URL in Firefox and paste it to a document in Emacs?

                              <span>Does the c++-ts-major-mode need the c treesitter language grammar package installed along with the c++ ts language grammar package? I keep getting a warning about it not being able to find the c language grammars when I open .cc files. .cc is an extension that emacs specifically identifies as a c++-major-mode extension. Is there enough language overlap between c and c++ that both grammars are required?

                              <span>The description in the manual says: &quot;On decoding flowed text, lines with soft newline characters are filled together and wrapped after the column decided by fill-flowed-display-column. The default is to wrap after fill-column.&quot;
 But what about lines without soft newline characters? When I open mails in mu4e, all longer lines are nicely wrapped. The lines though that can be shown completely in the buffer stick out and are not wrapped, and this looks ugly and makes reading harder because of the long lines. (See the attached screenshot. The lines at the end are much longer than the wrapped ones above.)

 Has anyone of you found a solution for this?
 (In my system, fill-flowed-display-column is set to fill-column, and fill-column is set to 70.)

                              <span>When I am editing file-a and want to insert file-b and if both files live in different directories (lets say dir-a and dir-b), things become cumbersome: Invoking insert-file gives me the usual dialog starting at dir-a and I then need to navigate to dir-b before I am able to insert file-b. If dir-a and dir-b are far away from each other, this may take a lot of keystrokes.
 This could be made easier, if insert-file would allow me to jump to a bookmarked directory (which might be closer to dir-b). Do you know any such solution ?
 Please note, that in this special use-case (insert-file), the command bookmark-bmenu-list (or similar) does not provide an alternative as far as I can see.
 Thanx

 Thanks!

                              <span>I&#x27;m self-building ghc on riscv64 architecture, and while building the compiler works fine, so far I haven&#x27;t managed to get it to build the internal interpreter:
 $ ghc --interactive : not built for interactive use 
 Is this a limitation of riscv64? Or do I have to pass a flag to the build to get that to be built? There&#x27;s nothing obvious in ./configure, and UserSettings.hs is just plain confusing.

                              <span>TLDR: I&#x27;m testing out htmx with a very small project and I got to the point where I need to validate forms and whatnot, I could do it by hand but I was wondering if there&#x27;s a library for doing complex for validation in haskell.
 I&#x27;ll be using it with servant probably if that changes anything.
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Hello,
 I have set up a simple server with scala+cask (I have set the port to 51934 and the host to be &quot;0.0.0.0&quot;). I was getting connection timeouts when I was trying to connect from a different PC in the local network and when I ran netstat -an | grep LISTEN I got the following output:
 ‚Äã
 tcp 0 0 127.0.0.53:530.0.0.0:* LISTEN
 tcp 0 0 127.0.0.1:6310.0.0.0:* LISTEN
 tcp 0 0 0.0.0.0:220.0.0.0:* LISTEN
 tcp 0 0 0.0.0.0:54320.0.0.0:* LISTEN
 tcp6 0 0 :::51934 :::* LISTEN
 tcp6 0 0 127.0.0.1:8212:::* LISTEN
 tcp6 0 0 127.0.0.1:45459:::* LISTEN
 tcp6 0 0 127.0.0.1:44569:::* LISTEN
 tcp6 0 0 127.0.0.1:35383:::* LISTEN
 tcp6 0 0 :::22 :::* LISTEN
 tcp6 0 0 :::5432 :::* LISTEN
 tcp6 0 0 ::1:631 :::* LISTEN
 ‚Äã
 Now, the third entry on that output is my ssh server which is accessible from everywhere. The first tcp6 entry is the server I am trying to set up now. I see it being listed as tcp6. So I guess I have two questions:
 - Is this an issue (that is my guess)
 - How can I configure the cask server so that it uses tcp instead of tcp6?

                              <span>I love using mindmapping alongside outlining. They both support deconstructing ideas in a tree structure, except that mindmaps offer a spatial way of arranging items, while the outliner does it as a list. I like to mindmap first and then turn it into an outline.
 I figured out a dead simple way of doing it that doesn&#x27;t involve messing around with freeplane plugins that export to Org-mode. (I tried one, it didn&#x27;t work for me.) The One Downside - It only works with the nodes, not it&#x27;s properties like attributes and notes.
 Step 1
  
Open Freeplane, go to Format &gt; Manage Styles &gt; Edit Styles (Or just hit C+f11).
 On the branch called Automatic level styles, select the top level node
 On the right side pane are the controls. Scroll down to Core Text and in the field called Format add this: * %‚Ä¶</span>

                              <span>Hi there!
 I&#x27;m new to programming and am learning Python!
 I decided to go with Emacs, and you might be asking why. Well, I&#x27;ve dabbled a bit with Emacs in the past, and I&#x27;m intrigued by its feature set, which I believe could greatly enhance my programming-fu. I&#x27;m using Termux with an external keyboard because I do not have access to a computer. Is my approach off-base? Is there a significant difference between using emacs vs emacs -nw ? Can I just stick to the vanilla setup for programming in Python?
 Your insights are greatly appreciated.
 Thanks!

                              <span>I downloaded org-superstar from Melpa last evening and immediately emacs prompted me that 7 packages were not being used. Being a newbie, I thought &quot;great, lets clear those out&quot; and I followed the instructions to delete them. On restarting this morning, I realised that the deleted packages were my Modus-themes, Golden-ratio and pdf-tools (with other pdf related files), all of which are loaded every time I start emacs and essential to my newbie workflow.
 Does emacs have a habit of suggesting that you delete files that are actually used and setup in your init.el? ..or more likely, what am I doing wrong that emacs suggested that I delete them?

 I am trying to build an Android Lineage version for a device that is outdated now. 
 I&#x27;m getting errors on the brunch command about some duplicated entries in a file. I know that these entries come from a file called &quot;file_contexts&quot;, and I would like that specific entry in order to remove it from a proper file. But since Android codebase is massive I would like to:
  
Get all the files called &quot;file_contexts&quot; found. For that I could use consult-find, right?
 
Then get all these files as an input for consult-ripgrep somehow.
 
 I have absolutely no idea if this could be a possibility but hey, this is r/emacs!

                              <span>TL;DR - How do I incorporate backlink searches into my org-ql queries?
 ‚Äã
 I am re-structuring my notes to adapt to new demands. I really like the non-hierarchical approach where individual notes are org-mode headers (or files) with an ID property that I can simply link to.
 Org-ql is fantastic at querying org-mode headers, keeping dynamic blocks based on those queries, etc. Using org-ql, I can also query for links within a heading. What I am missing is the option to query for backlinks TO the heading. Has anyone solved this problem?
 ‚Äã
 Simple example:
 * Drug A :drug: :PROPERTIES: :ID: 12345 :END: This is an inhibitor of [[id:54321][Protein X]]. * Protein X :protein: :PROPERTIES: :ID: 54321 :END: This is a trans-membrane protein that is over-expressed in breast cancer. 
 If I&#x27;m interested in the a subset of inhibitor drugs that are linked to Protein X I can do:
 [[org-ql-search:(and (rifle &quot;inhibitor&quot;) (link &quot;Protein X&quot;))]] 
 But what about finding trans-membrane proteins are associated with (i.e. &quot;backlinked to&quot;) inhibitors?
 ‚Äã
 OR - maybe there is a way to use org-ql results as org-ql query inputs? For example: 
  
Query 1: pull out all drugs.
 Query 2: pull out all proteins.
 Query 3: identify all proteins (from Query 2) that have a backlink to drugs (from Query 1).
  
‚Äã
 I&#x27;m a bit stuck. Any help or pointers would be appreciated.

                              <span>tldr; Looking for packages for customizing dired listings.
 Howdy. I&#x27;ve recently gotten an &quot;Emacs splinter&quot; about the format of dired directory listings and after playing with dired-listing-switches I&#x27;ve determined there are not enough knobs there to allow me to filter out some of the stuff I want to filter out. I see that I can write some custom filters also which might take me where I want to go but my elisp skills are still somewhat meager and I have quite a lot on my plate already.
 Does anyone have any recommendations for elisp packages already in the ecosystem which might be a quick win here? More so to filter the contents of the listings and not so much, for example, colors (ex:diredfl).
 thx!

 (use-package emacs :bind ((&quot;C-c C-k&quot; . (lambda () (interactive) (kill-line 0)))) 
 That doesn&#x27;t show a useful hint in the which-key-pop-up.
 The use-package doc says that is uses the function (bind-key) so something like this should work, but actually doesn&#x27;t:
 (use-package emacs :bind ((&quot;C-c C-k&quot; . (&quot;backward-kill-line&quot; . (lambda () (interactive) (kill-line 0))))) 
 Am I just missing some syntactical finesse or is what I want not possible with use-package&#x27;s :bind?

                              <span>Hi guys, I recently started my journey with Emacs, Doom emacs to be exact. Promise, I know what I am getting myself into ;) 
 I would like to dabble in org-brain aside from org-roam. Unfortunately the documentation is pretty thin and there are no instructions what I need to do in order to adapt it to Doom emacs. Org-brain is a flag in the doom config file, but I am pretty sure I need to set it up as well. 
 Can someone aid me in doing it? I am sure some of have done it or at least know what I need to do for adapting packages. I heard you shouldn&#x27;t install as if it was vanilla emacs, but I only starting to understand what that means. 
 Thanks for your help

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m taking agda next semester and the recommended editor is emacs, so I want to set it up before semester begins. My main editor is helix and I would like to have helix movement in emacs, is it possible? Before helix I was using vim and I didn&#x27;t like it, so no evil mode for me. If there is no way to do it, I will just use emacs like notepad.
 EDIT: Thanks everyone for response, I will try meow, because everyone seems to like it. After some time later I will edit this post and write how good meow is for future helix to emacs users, thanks again.

                              <span>This package is for creating Emacs Lisp projects interactively from within Emacs, written 100 % in Emacs Lisp. It is inspired by https://github.com/fukamachi/cl-project, a package for creating Common Lisp projects interactively. Similarly, a directory called skelton is provided, which acts as a template for the project. This makes the setup easy to understand. I used to search how to create an Emacs Lisp project every time I created one, but since I created this one, I don&#x27;t need to do that anymore. I announced this package to the Emacs community in my country, and it was so well received that I am announcing it here on Reddit as well. I hope you will Star it if you like!

                              <span>Sorry if this question has been asked before, I want to learn Haskell and I have very little programming experience(only Python &amp; some robotics C) and I&#x27;m conflicted at the moment.
 My roadmap is:
  
HFTVB by John Whitington or the Haskell Wikibook
 Write yourself a Scheme tutorials
 Learn Haskell by Building a Blog Generator by Gilmi.
  
Is it worth buying on HFTVB? Or is the Wikibook good enough? Or more importantly, am I being redundant since all of the above are focused on beginners? As in, would it be better to just jump into LHBG?
 By looking at the options above, you&#x27;ll notice that I have:
  
A preference for text over video courses.
 A phobia from large books which I see recommended on here. I like things succinct where the questions lead me to discover more of the material and where I am left with space to figure things out for myself.
  
I know at this point this is quite a repetitive question, but I&#x27;m really interested in starting as soon as possible and would like not to go through the phase of trying out a 1000 unrelated things until I figure out which is right for me, I know my preferences and prefer sticking to them.
 I also read about LYAH, and while it seems quaint the no exercises disqualifies it immediately from the race. I like my resources jam-packed with exercises.

                              <span>I wrote a short Haskell book several years ago and every 6 months or so I like to update the stack resolver version for the example programs.
 I noticed that a VSCode Haskell plugin expects a GHCup setup. I am thinking of forking my own code and experimenting with just using Cabal and GHCup installed tools, and also get rid of my stack.yml files in each project directory.
 A few years ago it seemed that stack removed many of the pain points I had with Haskell but now I am re-evaluating that belief.
 Any advice will be appreciated!!

 Release notes:
  
After an upgrade from an earlier version of Stack, on first use only, Stack 2.15.1 may warn that it had trouble loading the CompilerPaths cache.
 The hash used as a key for Stack&#x27;s pre-compiled package cache has changed, following the dropping of support for Cabal versions older than 1.24.0.0.
  
Changes since v2.13.1:
 Behavior changes:
  
Stack does not leave *.hi or *.o files in the setup-exe-src directory of the Stack root, and deletes any corresponding to a setup-
.hs or setup-shim-
.hs file, to avoid GHC issue #21250.
 If Stack&#x27;s Nix integration is not enabled, Stack will notify the user if a nix executable is on the PATH. This usually indicates the Nix package manager is available. ‚Ä¶</span>

 ...actually, for that matter, is there any package that forms the xrefs into a tree from a plain old stack? I&#x27;ll often jump back up, go to another xref, then want to go back to the original branch without losing my place.

 A bit new to Emacs here. Used a little in the past, moved away for a bit and now I&#x27;m back.
 I wanted to get up to speed and start using Treesitter + Eglot but I&#x27;m having a bit of trouble getting the language grammars set up.
 I am aware of the command treesit-install-language-grammar but for some reason, it&#x27;s unable to run properly, at least on Windows.
 Whenever I run it, it eventually fails when trying to clone the grammar repository.
  
Warning (treesit): Error encountered when installing language grammar: (file-missing Setting current directory No such file or directory c:/Users//AppData/Local/Temp/treesit-/repo/src)
  
Any ideas?
 Alternatively for those of you who have had this command succeed, can you give me a rundown of the directory structure you ha‚Ä¶</span>

                              <span>So the other day I spent more than 3 seconds renaming eat buffers, so I decided to spend more than 3 days to make my own package that does it automatically. After finishing, I found that if you launch eat with a prefix argument it does exactly what I wanted.
 Nevertheless, this package has more features (like updating the indexes when a buffer is closed &amp; more formatting options) and not only it works for eat, but for everything that when launched checks if the buffer already exists and uses that instead of creating a new one (I only tested vterm and eat) so it can be used as a simple replacement to multi-vterm and multi-term.
 I really recommend the experience. I&#x27;ve been using emacs for about a year, and even though you do learn by making your config, making a package gives you a waaay higher level of understanding, even if it&#x27;s a basic one like mine.
 I tried to make the best code I could, but I&#x27;m no elisp/lisp programmer, but a C one, so probably the style isn&#x27;t exactly right. There are a few features I didn&#x27;t add yet and it could be way better documented.
 Here&#x27;s the link for anyone interested: https://gitlab.com/vslavkin/multi-buffer.el
 Edit: not sure if the name is good or not, please tell me if you have a better alternative

                              <span>Is it possible to show/go to the matching parenthesis of the same kind?
 Suppose that the buffer has this: ( ] ). If the cursor is at (, emacs shows ] as the (mis)matching parenthesis. Is it possible somehow to make emacs show ) as the matching parenthesis (meaning that emacs should ignore all the other kinds of parenthesis when searching for the pair)?

 I&#x27;m still using Emacs-w32 from Cygwin and I start it elevated:
 cygstart --action&#x3D;runas run emacs-w32 
 so I can edit &quot;privileged&quot; files.
 I wonder if WSL&#x27;s Emacs could be a &quot;system&quot; tool - could I ditch Cygwin completely (having X Server backported by Microsoft to Win 10)...
 It could be frustrating to switch text editor just to edit hosts file...

                              <span>Hello.
 I am learning haskell from this resource: https://learn-haskell.blog/04-markup/04-parsing_02.html
 and I cannot understand certain function call, I mean this one:
 maybe id (:) context (parseLines (Just (Paragraph line)) rest) 
 from this block:
  parse :: String -&gt; Document parse &#x3D; parseLines Nothing . lines -- (1) parseLines :: Maybe Structure -&gt; [String] -&gt; Document parseLines context txts &#x3D; case txts of [] -&gt; maybeToList context -- (2) -- Paragraph case currentLine : rest -&gt; let line &#x3D; trim currentLine in if line &#x3D;&#x3D; &quot;&quot; then maybe id (:) context (parseLines Nothing rest) -- (3) else case context of Just (Paragraph paragraph) -&gt; parseLines (Just (Paragraph (unwords [paragraph, line]))) rest -- (4) _ -&gt; maybe id (:) context (parseLines (Just (Paragraph line)) rest) trim :: String -&gt; String trim &#x3D; unwords . words 
 especially this part:
 (:) context (parseLines (Just (Paragraph line)) rest) 
 Let&#x27;s say we call this function with context &#x3D; Nothing and txts &#x3D; [&quot;abc&quot;, &quot;&quot;]
 so firstly we go to this case:
 maybe id (:) context (parseLines (Just (Paragraph line)) rest) 
 and now is the part I don&#x27;t understand, (:) context in this case is (Nothing : any list that parseLines will return) so Nothing will be prepend to a list of paragraphs, but when Im calling this function in ghci it just returns [Paragraph &quot;abc&quot;] without nothing, but manually calling (Nothing: [Just $ Paragraph &quot;abc&quot;]) returns a list with Nothing at the beginning. 
 Can someone explain this, please?

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m Lucas. I&#x27;m VirtusLab&#x27;s Scala Developer Advocate and this is my first attempt at &quot;open hours&quot;. Given that &quot;sir, this is Reddit&quot; it means this is an AMA in which you can ask questions regarding Scala, Scala at VirtusLab, roadmaps of the teams involved in building and maintaining Scala and so on. I also invite you to share your and your organisation&#x27;s problems, fears, blockers, and issues related to Scala and tooling around the language. I will try my best to answer your questions but I reserve the right not to answer immediately if I don&#x27;t know something - I try to keep tabs on a lot of things but am far from being omniscient. I will let you know if I have to reach out to more in-the-know folks though not to leave you hanging.
 I&#x27;ve chosen Reddit for now because it&#x27;s the most public,‚Ä¶</span>

                              <span>I have been using Emacs for quite long on NixOS. Recently, I switched to a fully managed solution configured with the helper (emacsPackagesFor emacs).emacsWithPackages.
 Despite I am on the nix-unstable channel, due to a bug I was surprised to find packages are a bit old, and were last generated 3 months ago. Things are quite behind ELPA or MELPA Stable, especially taking into consideration this is an unstable channel.
 Do you use Nix or NixOS? If so, how do you manage your own Emacs?

                              <span>I&#x27;m having a problem with mu4e and my sent messages with Apple Mail. I&#x27;m wondering if anyone can help.
 The problem is as follows: I have everything set up and it runs perfectly well. I can download messages, read them, archive/delete them, etc... This is all reflected in Apple Mail in iOS and on the Mac as well. However, the Sent Mail doesn&#x27;t seem to sync in the same way. If I send an email with Mu4e, it will save it to the designated &quot;icloud/Sent Messages&quot; locally, and I can see it in mu4e. But I can&#x27;t see it in Apple Mail at all. It&#x27;s simply not synced. All the other folders are except for this one. Also, Sent items from Apple Mail do not sync to mu4e either.
 Is there something that I&#x27;m missing?

                              <span>Two of the first packages I setup in emacs when I began using it were projectile and perspective. I primarily use emacs as an IDE and wanted to be able to manage different projects. Google said these were good so I started there. Two months on and I still don&#x27;t have a single perspective set and projectile feels like I&#x27;m using a semi truck to tow a hand cart. I&#x27;ve only not removed projectile because it integrates with tree-macs and I&#x27;m hoping to set it up so that I can have tree-macs display my list of folders when I&#x27;m not working on a project and only the project root of the current working directory when I&#x27;m in a python/c++ project. Tree-macs has a variable that allows you to set it to display a single directory and I&#x27;m wondering if that can be done with a .dir-local.el file, eliminating the one thing I think would make projectile worth having. I&#x27;d also like to exclude folders with .gitignore but again, I wonder if there is a way to do that with tree-macs or project.el.
 So, my question. What do you guys use perspective and projectile for. As a hobby programmer, do you think it&#x27;s worth having? What are your thoughts on project.el and what else is out there?

 I was wondering if there was some way to achieve this functionality using Emacs (I&#x27;m using Doom Emacs on Windows) with the Spc-. search function. I know there are tree views and that may help but I was hoping to find a clean solution that integrates with the default file finder if possible.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve got Doom Emacs running on Windows and wanted to use Neotree. I enabled the package and synced Doom and after opening, the Neotree commands are there.
 When I try to use them though, I get an error: &quot;all-the-icons isn&#x27;t installed&quot;
 Now, I know all-the-icons isn&#x27;t installed. The reason is because it was apparently taken out of Doom Emacs in favor of &quot;nerd-icons&quot; which I had to install instead when first setting up Doom. But from this error message, I&#x27;m gathering that Neotree needs, or at least is specifically looking for, all-the-icons.
 Is there a way to tell Neotree to use the icons from the font I have installed? It just won&#x27;t even turn on at this point.

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently setting up my capture templates and want to do the following.
  
Create a file if it doesn&#x27;t exist yet
 Give it a level 1 heading of the current date
 Give it two level 2 headings &quot;Journal&quot; and &quot;activities&quot;
 Have one capture template that creates entries under &quot;Journal&quot; and another one that creates entries uner &quot;activities&quot;
  
I have 1 - 3 implemented and everything works so far. My problem is 4. My capture template for &quot;Journal&quot; looks like this:
 (&quot;ja&quot; &quot;Journal&quot; entry
 (file+olp (lambda()(rmz/create-org-file)) (format-time-string &quot;%Y-%m-%d&quot;) &quot;Journal&quot;)
 &quot;* % - %?&quot;)
 So the first thing in the target is a call to a function that creates the file if it doesn&#x27;t exist and then returns the file name (works). Then I want to create the olp. The level 1 heading needs to be created dynamically while the second (&quot;journal&quot;) is static. This is what the documentation says about it:
 (file+olp &quot;path/to/file&quot; &quot;Level 1 heading&quot; &quot;Level 2&quot; ...)
 For non-unique headings, the full outline path is safer
 If I only add &quot;Journal&quot; as olp in the target emacs throws the error &quot;Heading not found on level 1: Journal&quot; (Sounds different in the documentation)
 If I pass the call to format-time-string emacs throws this error &quot;Wrong type argument: stringp, (format-time-string &quot;%Y-%m-%d&quot;)
 Any ideas how I can pass a dynamic heading in the targets olp?

                              <span>I&#x27;m not entirely certain this is doable, but would love to be proven wrong. I know how to use space-mark in combination with whitespace-display-mapping to convert ALL spaces to a dot, but in all honesty, that isn&#x27;t really helpful. I would rather like to be able to call out spaces that appear before tabs, and also spaces that appear after tabs.
 If I simply use space-before-tab and space-after-tab, without space-mark, I am able to see these spaces because they have a different background color (I modified my theme)... but that all goes away when my cursor goes to the line where these spaces are (I have global-hl-line-mode on). I&#x27;d like to have these spaces still be visible in this case, preferably with a space-mark. Is this achievable?

                              <span>Just downloaded and unzipped emacs 30 for Windows and it sits at 477 MB on disk. I don&#x27;t remember it being this heavy... Low-key wished they stripped a bunch of packages from the distribution.
 Realistically nobody needs doctor, tetris, several git interfaces, etc. If they do, they can always install them, which is ultimately what it is all about; to pick and choose and build your own environment. It should come bundled with the bare minimum and allow users to pick and choose which packages they want and need IMO.

                              <span>I did an &quot;update all&quot; from melpa today and one or more upgrades breaks a lot of functionality for me. It broke things both on emacs 29 running on manjaro i3 and on emacs 28 running in pop os so it doesn&#x27;t seem a version related issue. The first thing I noticed, for instance, is that which-key stopped working, despite &quot;which-key&quot; not being one of the packages upgraded. Is there a way to narrow down the culprit?
 This was the list of packages to upgrade:
 (auctex-14.0.0 company-20240208.1943 doom-modeline-20240205.139 flycheck-20240208.2142 helm-descbinds-20240206.802 magit-20240206.2256 mastodon-20240201.1500 org-noter-20240207.2329 org-ref-20240208.1801 transient-20240201.1100 visual-fill-column-20240205.1505).
 Is there a way to upgrade each one in turn and see which one is interfering with the others? For some reason I&#x27;m confused how to just upgrade one package in melpa at a time. It only seems possible to install a newer version over an older.
 Thanks.

                              <span>I shared this on my blog earlier this week:
https://christiantietze.de/posts/2024/02/example-object-tag-vs-topic-tag-programming-zettelkasten/
So I talked with a fellow iOS developer about tagging recently, then overhauled a note I found by accident and shared this as an example.
The gist is:
I increased specificity of tags. The general #image  becomes ‚Üí #uiimage on iOS, #nsimage on macOS, which are actual types in the macOS API.
I removed the topic tag #appkit which doesn&#x27;t tell me anything interesting here.
Why is the object tag #appkit useless now? Almost all my programming notes are about macOS and thus #appkit, the macOS UI API framework. So it doesn&#x27;t help find anything, and it&#x27;d produce so many notes that it becomes useless. Thousands, if applied consistently!
There are notes about the AppKit framework as a topic. These stay put, of course!
The thing is: for my very first notes on programmatic image manipulation, it sounded sensible to use a tag like #image.  After all, I did not expect to need specificity here at all: &quot;something with image in Appkit&quot; sounded good. But with expertise, I need NSImage-related resources, and I can name contexts better. Like embedding images in text views, as wirh The Archive 
All notes are malleable, so no problem.
By the way, new notes on similar topics I tag with the very specific API titles right away, e.g. #nsimage for image stuff on Mac. This changed in the past couple of years and I don&#x27;t have to think about this, at all. I believe it felt similar back when I used the &quot;&quot;&quot;bad&quot;&quot;&quot; tag. So chances are I could discover even more specific tags in the future and find the current one lacking   At the moment, it&#x27;s the best topic tag I know to describe this.</span>

This is another installment of the What Are You Working On? thread. Add to this discussion by telling us about your zettelkasten journey. Share with us what you&#x27;re learning. Sharing helps me and, hopefully, you, too. It helps me clarify my goals and visualize my thinking. And sometimes, a conversation sparks a magical moment where we can dive into an idea worth exploring. We&#x27;d love to hear more from you.  ü´µüèº
Ideas I&#x27;m exploring with my ZK:
I am exploring the idea of when my body is in motion and when it is at rest, it interacts with inertia.
How do I modify the format of my wikilinks to something more generic? I feel for @ZettelDistraction&#x27;s pain, and he modified his file names and the links in his ZK. Just the thought of attempting this hurts my little brain.
I&#x27;m thinking about adulting my Monk Mornings.
I use my ZK in support of my university literature and writing coursework.
Things I&#x27;m reading:
Quintero, Isabel. Gabi, a girl in pieces. 2014.
Picard, Max. The world of silence. 1948.
Gardner, Dwight. UPSTAIRS DELICATESSEN: on eating, reading, reading about eating, and eating while reading. 2024.
Yoon, Nicola. The sun is also a star. 2016.
Music I&#x27;m listening to:
Schiller
Kaleo
Hania Rani

                              <span>I have this one use case where I have to go through a big json object and check
  
if &quot;mandatory&quot; fields are present.
 condition fields are present if the condition is true. eg If field A&#x27;s value &#x3D; 1, then field B should exist
  
and If these checks fail I need to return a comma seperated list of the fields which are causing the failure.
 And if the checks pass, I need to read this object into a type. 
 Anyone here worked on similar usecases, please shed some light. 
 Also I have been considering using json schema for this, Is there any library to which I can input a json schema file and get the json object validated using the schema?

                              <span>Coming from an OOP background, I&#x27;m finding it difficult to write elisp, for Emacs. I&#x27;ve tried looking for guides, but I haven&#x27;t found information on how to structure the code of a coherent package.
 Particularly, it&#x27;s been hard for me to keep track of the code in my mind because I&#x27;m using mostly plain functions and not many data structures. And the code is so far in one big file, which I don&#x27;t know how to split up, as opposed to classes, which are more conceptually modular. How should I make my code more modular? How should I decide when I need to make a new function?
 If I need to visit and insert text into a buffer, should the visit and insert be done at the lowest, i.e. most nested, level possible? Or should I wrap the whole function body in a with-current-buffer?
 If I find myself needing to store a lot of data in variables, am I doing it wrong? I&#x27;m not using setq, because it seems like overkill and ugly being global, but even with let and let*, keeping track of what variables have been declared and their scope is getting difficult.
 Should I not declare as many variables and instead make monolithic functions where variable&#x27;s aren&#x27;t assigned, rather you just evaluate an expression (xyz) inside the expression you would pass the variable to, i.e. (abc (xyz)) instead of (setq var (xyz)) then (abc var)? I feel like this gets hard to read once you have a lot of nested expressions.

I made my comment, saved it with &#x60;C-c C-c&#x60; and then hit &#x60;r&#x60; and it says to do &#x60;c&#x60; for comment. But when I hit that I get

 I&#x27;m not entirely sure how to interpret this. There was also an option to send a comment immediately but that seems to be a comment on the PR as a whole which isn&#x27;t what I want. 
 I guess what I am asking if for people who use this package to give an overview of their workflow on how they might comment on a section of code and any other pointers that they have.

                              <span>I&#x27;m new to using Emacs and I&#x27;ve looked a basic setup for *-ts-mode, python-ts-mode to be specific. I am also using Elpaca as my package manager. 
 What I did to install a language server is:
 M-x treesit-install-language-grammar python
 And have all set by default. 
 Part of my config file is this:
  (use-package python-ts-mode :hook ((python-ts-mode . eglot-ensure) (python-ts-mode . company-mode)) :mode ((&quot;\\.py\\&#x27;&quot; . python-ts-mode)) ) 
 I get an error in my elpaca-log:
 Info: Unable to determine repo dir: (error &quot;Cannot determine URL from recipe: (:source nil :protocol https :inherit t :depth 1 :package \&quot;python-ts-mode\&quot;)&quot;) 
 Am I doing something wrong here? Been scouring the internet for answers but I don&#x27;t understand elisp that much and the config above is simple and short enough just to get me do my work.

                              <span>I&#x27;m still very new to emacs, org, lisp and the whole eco system in general. I want to transfer my notes from obsidian to org or org-roam and wonder if there are any benefits of org-roam over vanilla org.
 I&#x27;ve read some of the org and org-roam documentation and as far as I understand it the main benefit of org-roam is easy linking. So I cobbled together a bunch of functions to have an easier linking experience in vanilla org (most probably this already exists and I just didn&#x27;t find it).
 It lets me select a file from my org directory using fuzzy find, it lets me enter a name (or select from a list of aliases) and another function adds the selection of a specific item as link target.
 So my questions are:
  
Does org-roam offer more than that if backlinks aren&#x27;t really that interesting to m‚Ä¶</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m bad at merging and I&#x27;d love to change this.
 For context, I can&#x27;t wrap my head around &quot;theirs&quot; and &quot;ours&quot; in merge conflict resolution tools. Especially since I&#x27;m often the solo dev and responsible for both! Since I vaguely remember all the code, I can&#x27;t even go by &quot;this looks foreign to me&quot; as a heuristic to orient myself. I sometimes lose track when I rebase feature branches with 20 commits onto another branch a couple of files and commits down the road. It&#x27;s horrible.
 I usually can&#x27;t make sense of M-x diff output. I often use smerge and 3-way diffing in git projects, that helps a bit to see things in context, but not always.
 For my stupid brain, this is an accessibility problem
 Here&#x27;s the solution I have in mind: to tweak how diff tools show both sides so that the versions have more meaningful names.
 Exmaples:
  
Merging foo into main, it&#x27;d be nice if the label reads &quot;changes to be applied from foo&quot; and &quot;base from main&quot;.
 Rabasing banana onto divergent recipes, with the shared ancestor main, it&#x27;d be great if it reads &quot;changes from banana&quot; and &quot;commonality from main&quot; and &quot;difference from main in recipes&quot;.
  
If you know a diff viewer, conflict resolution tool, whatever that allows this and how one might approach this, pointers would be appreciated! I can Elisp away myself a bit, but don&#x27;t know where to start.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been messing with this problem for a while now, off and on for months, really, and it&#x27;s driving me a little bit crazy, so here we are.
 The specific thing I&#x27;m trying to do is exit insert mode (modal editing, previously evil, currently trying meow) when I arrive back in the main org mode file after editing a src block. I&#x27;m not actually sure why I end up in insert mode sometimes when exiting src edit, but it happens often. Advising &#x60;org-edit-src-exit&#x60; is the place to be for this as far as I can tell, and that works when returning to the main org file.
 The problem I have is that editing a src block without calling &#x60;org-edit-special&#x60;, thus staying in the main org file, will also trigger the advice. Pressing RET, or using anything that makes a new line in the src block (like &#x60;meow-insert-above/below&#x60;) will call &#x60;org-edit-src-exit&#x60; and its advice, and I can&#x27;t find any way to tell in the context of that advice whether the edit is happening in a special edit buffer or not. I&#x27;m guessing that editing src blocks without calling &#x60;org-edit-special&#x60; happens in a background buffer anyway so the process is indistinguishable?
 I&#x27;ve tried checking the major-mode before exiting the edit buffer, but it&#x27;s always org-mode. I&#x27;ve tried using &#x60;org-in-src-block-p&#x60;, &#x60;org-src-edit-buffer-p&#x60;, checking &#x60;org-src-mode&#x60;, setting a local variable after &#x60;org-edit-special&#x60; that I can check in my advice, so many things that haven&#x27;t worked.
 It&#x27;s very possible that I&#x27;m missing something obvious, or there&#x27;s a very different solution to my specific problem, but even if so, I&#x27;m still curious about how to distinguish these src block editing situations. Anybody have any ideas?

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I am doing sorting related exercises on CSES and getting stuck at this problem, https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1619/ 
 Here is my code so far
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; import Data.List (sort) import Data.Set qualified as S import Data.ByteString.Char8 qualified as B import Data.ByteString (ByteString) import Debug.Trace
 readPair :: ByteString -&gt; (Int, Int) readPair s &#x3D; let Just (a, s1) &#x3D; B.readInt s Just (b, _) &#x3D; B.readInt $ B.tail s1 in (a, b)
 main :: IO () main &#x3D; do _  Int solve xs &#x3D; fst $ foldl step (0, S.empty) xs where step (m, bs) (a&#x27;, b&#x27;) &#x3D; case S.lookupGT a&#x27; bs of Nothing -&gt; (max m 1, S.singleton b&#x27;) Just gt -&gt; let i &#x3D; S.findIndex gt bs (_, gts) &#x3D; S.splitAt i bs in (max m (S.size gts + 1), S.insert b&#x27; gts) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Without sorting after map readPair, this code takes 0.1s to run the largest test case and passes the time constraint of 1s. With sorting present, it cannot satisfy the time constraint. I tried using Seq instead of List, but the running time was even worst.
 Please help. Thanks.

                              <span>Question for the community. How are you serving static files from your Scala web backend? Eg Play, http4s, etc. Specifically, if you want to serve on the route /static/..., all files under src/main/resources/static/.... How do you set this up in your preferred framework? Is this built-in functionality? Did you write a custom handler for it?
 Just looking for ideas.

 But I&#x27;ve never received any update. Some chapters at the end of the book are not completed. I would like to have to full finished version.
 I tried contacted using the email provided but nobody ever replied.
 Does anybody knows how to contact him? Am I the only one with the earlier version? Does anybody received or know about the finished version?

 I have some dependencies embedded in them like:
 //&gt; using dep com.lihaoyi::os-lib:0.9.3 //&gt; using dep com.lihaoyi::requests:0.8.0 
 and I&#x27;d like to have code completion for these libraries.
 I&#x27;ve tried:
  
IntelliJ IDEA + Scala plugin, it doesn&#x27;t recognize dependencies. I&#x27;ve created imported in a separate module for the directory that contains my scripts, by using BSP, as it recommends the scala-cli documentation. It works fine for regular SBT projects.
 VisualStudio.code + Metals, code completion doesn&#x27;t work. I don&#x27;t have much experiencie with this tool.
  
In addition, with scala-cli, it is easy to experiment with newest Scala versions, before I migrate my SBT project from Scala 2.13 to Scala 3.
 IDEA doesn&#x27;t realize that my scala script is using Scala 3.3.1 instead of 2.13.
 Which tools do you use for nice editing of scripts?

                              <span>Hey! I&#x27;m trying to do something in Scala and looking for an advice on why it might be a bad idea or on how to do it better.
 I have a CRUD application with several independent modules, where each one is responsible for one or more resources. Resources are classes such as &quot;Task&quot; or &quot;User&quot; with a specific given and modules are well... just traits:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; trait Module[Name &lt;: String]: def description: String &#x3D; ???
 trait Resource[M, A]: def description: String &#x3D; ???
 given Module[&quot;todo_list&quot;] &#x3D; new Module[&quot;todo_list&quot;] {} given Resource[&quot;todo_list&quot;, Task] &#x3D; Resource.register[&quot;todo_list&quot;, Task] // checks that &quot;todo_list&quot; is a known module &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Using this approach I can write generic functions such as:
  // Check that both module and resource are available to the User canRead[R: Resource](resource: R, by: User): IO[Boolean] 
 ...which is cool. But now I want to find out in runtime what resources are registered for a particular module:
  Module[&quot;todo_list&quot;].resources.map(_.description) // a set of descriptions 
 How do I do that? I see two approaches:
  
Having a mutable ListBuffer inside the Module trait and just append instances when Resource.register is called - simple, but mutable
 Attaching every resource explicitly somewhere - logs of boilerplate
  
Could there be a better way?

 def init() &#x3D; { // called by another class foo &#x3D; ... bar &#x3D; ... ... } } &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 This will work but it&#x27;s sad that foo, bar have to be var, not val.
 My workaround is like this:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; class Clazz { lazy (foo, bar) &#x3D; initFooBar()
 def init() &#x3D; { foo bar ... }
 def initFooBar() &#x3D; { foo &#x3D; ... bar &#x3D; ... (foo, bar) } } &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 But this is awkward. Any better way in scala 2? Or is there any library to leverage?

                              <span>So the premise is I want to adjust a buffer but, then, make sure that the window point is at a certain location within said buffer (so, when switching to that buffer at any point, the cursor is where I&#x27;d expect.
 Using with-current-buffer doesn&#x27;t work as it manipulates the buffer just fine but won&#x27;t affect the window point (so switching to the buffer has the point in the same location where it last was, regardless of any changes made to the buffer).
 Is there a best practice of how to do this? Is it just making use of switch-to-buffer and switching back, once done with editing said buffer?

 Does anyone know of a way to do this or something similar? I think I could so something similar-ish by using org-transclusion, but it seems to go in the opposite direction (namely, that the separate documents are included into the big org file, but I would still need to edit them and export them from separate files).
 Any help would be greatly appreciated, and thank you for reading and for any tips in advance!

                              <span>Hey, I am using the CaskaydiaCove Nerd Font (I updated to make sure both are on most recent versions) on both my Linux and MacOS with same configuration (Doom Emacs config). For some reason, ligatures that work perfectly on Linux (e.g. true, false) are not working on MacOS, although some do work. I&#x27;ll post an example screenshot; in Linux all of them work, but as you can see some are not visible in this MacOS screenshot. Anyone seen something like this before?

                              <span>So I just started out with Emacs because I wanted to use SLIME for Lisp, but I quickly realized how helpful it can be even without knowing most commands and keybindings.
 The fact that I can have something like a web browser integrated in Emacs is extremely helpful for my ADHD because I can just fire up Emacs in the tty, edit my code in one window and have online docs in the other window, and jump between them and copy stuff from the browser to my code, all in a single workflow, and without anything like YouTube distracting me or getting lost in tabs or desktop.
 While with other editors/environments I have to context-switch between at least 3 different workflows (editor, WM/tmux, browser, and usually other stuff like terminals), carefully configure them to not clash, and implement all sorts of nasty hacks to move data between them. And of course getting my thought process cut short is inevitable.
 Emacs makes it so much easier to stay focused on my project.

                              <span>Context, I use Gnus for IMAP email (Fastmail). I like it enough, but figured I could give Rmail a try - you know, the endless itch to try things. In my case I am leaning on built-ins and if possibly smaller packages. Which Gnus is not. And Rmail is the &quot;primary email reader&quot;. 
 I got the impression this setup could be less straightforward than the &quot;it just works&quot; approach of Gnus, but still. I installed movemail, made a backup copy with offlineimap in case I deleted all my messages by accident :) and then
 (setq rmail-primary-inbox-list &#x27;(&quot;imaps://my-user%40fastmail.com:the-password@imap.fastmail.com:993&quot;)) 
 It worked! Nice!. Except that I have a bunch of aliases (bills@mydomain.com, subscriptions@mydomain.com, etc.) and rules to redirect the messages to sub-directories of Inbox and I don&#x27;t see a way to get those with movemail.
 I am guessing the config would be one mail file for each one of those directories? But still can&#x27;t find how to set that up. 
 I might try pointing Rmail to the Maildir back up too, but just like IMAP, it is a one way conversion so I figured I would ask in case I destroy that synced copy for nothing :) 
 Thank you!
 PS: I would try Maildir as describe here: https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Other-Mailbox-Formats.html

                              <span>When I run ipython src-blocks, all console output automatically pops up in ob-ipython-out and ob-ipython-traceback, instead of in the Inferior Python:one buffer that I&#x27;ve opened with C-c C-v C-z. The Inferior Python still has access to the results of the cells (if they define a new variable for example), but it&#x27;s just not showing any output, and the popups from the other ob-ipython buffers are very annoying. Is this expected behavior, and if so, is there some way I can reroute the output?

                              <span>i use nvchad neovim distro and loved what emacs is it really will be fun when i know all bindings in doom emacs
 ‚Äã
 but i&#x27;m in college so i have to ask,
 will it be helpful if i spent hours learning emacs?
 i used emacs for three days and couldn&#x27;t change the tab spaces from 8 to 4
 i don&#x27;t know how elisp works neither do i know what lisp is.
 are there themes in emacs that we can choose from because doom emacs looked really pale when i installed it
 is Emacs future proof?
 currently only highly elite people use emacs, and if we look at statistics the vim users are dominating the number of people using emacs, will emacs have good support in future because i will be sticking to my favourite editor for my entire lifetime i will be bound to it.
 should i learn emacs after my college ends?
 i learnt how to configure and use window managers but i honestly regret using them as my college sem cgpa lowered a lot using it converting to arch linux was a similar choice i love doing both things but they took a lot of time affecting my career if i had time i would absolutely choose learning window managers and using arch linux. will it be the same with emacs??

                              <span>Greetings, comrades!
 I&#x27;m currently getting acquainted with Doom Emacs, and I&#x27;ve already experienced the benefits of org roam and local Python development. However, problems start to arise when I try to start developing in Python on a remote host for work. Not only have I not found any eglot configurations specific to working through Tramp, but the installation of pylsp for Python 3.7.3 is also not as smooth as I would like (perhaps it needs to be installed not in the user directory, but in the venv of the project).
 If anyone has any insights, guides, or experience working under these conditions, I am completely open to suggestions. Maybe I am completely wrong when I try to set all this up through Tramp and ssh-deploy, or the installation of a remote instance on the host will work much better.
 Please, help me!

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I&#x27;ve been using org-modern for ages now and I just took it out as it really has some weird issues with certain things (like with tables). So I&#x27;m back to straight up org-mode with org-superstar, as well as hiding markdown stuff. That all works great! But, I&#x27;m wondering:
 Is there a way to hide #+,  and [ ]? Specifically:
 Turn #+filename: into filename: at the top and  or [2024-07-02] into just 2024-07-02? I find them kinda ugly to look at in really nicely presented documents/files.
 Thanks!

 This is a new package for working with tree-sitter based text objects. Also, it provides some edit/movement commands. The package uses new things machinery added in Emacs 30.0.50. The only user interface available now is evil. Maybe it will be useful for someone.

                              <span>The Scala Center plans have been released for 2024,
 Basically, they want to unfreeze the scala standard library, improve build times. They also say that they are going to improve the Scala 3 support in IntelliJ.
 Finally, participation in events and ambassador program are discussed to bring people closer to the language.
 What do you think?

Anyways I wanna use hscurses but how do I even begin where do I read more. Is there a youtube channel that explains hscurses? I want more than the documentation but hopefully that is not all I have to work with? Recommend beginner friendly books too if you know but about hscurses and in the worst case scenario any TUI?

                              <span>Hello all,
 I am setting up a blog (what kind of computer scientist would I be without one!) and I am opting to write it in markdown. I have a shell script that converts these into HTML files using Pandoc (because what kind of Haskell enthusiast would I be if I didn&#x27;t use Pandoc!).
 I am using the Haskell library to make filters for my Pandoc, and I see I can use multiple instances of --filter but I would rather not and just have my one filter do everything I need. Lets say I wanted to do something to any Inline Str instance that starts with a @ and I also want to act on any Block Codeblock instance that is a $haskell type: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;haskell module Main where
 import qualified Data.Text as T import Text.Pandoc.JSON
 main :: IO () main &#x3D; do -- toJSONFilter dollarHaskellBlock toJSONFilter linkToBlog return ()
 -- | Lets me act specially on codeblocks labeled &#x27;$haskell&#x27; dollarHaskellBlock :: Block -&gt; Block dollarHaskellBlock (CodeBlock (identifier, cls:clss, keyValue) codeText) | cls &#x3D;&#x3D; T.pack &quot;$haskell&quot; &#x3D; CodeBlock (identifier, T.pack &quot;haskell&quot;:clss, keyValue) newCodeText where newCodeText &#x3D; codeText -- do something here dollarHaskellBlock x &#x3D; x
 -- | adds a link to any blog with a word in the form @word linkToBlog :: Inline -&gt; Inline linkToBlog (Str strText) | head strString &#x3D;&#x3D; &#x27;@&#x27; &#x3D; linkTo where strString &#x3D; T.unpack strText linkTo &#x3D; Link ( T.empty , [] , [] ) [ Underline [ Str (T.tail strText) ] ] ( T.pack (&quot;./&quot; ++ (tail . T.unpack . T.toLower) strText ++ &quot;.html&quot;) , T.empty ) linkToBlog x &#x3D; x &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 In this case I can use one or the other here and the executable will act as a filter, but I feel like I should be able to do one after the other, but just running both in the do block fails :(.
 Is there a solution here? Thanks. 
 P.S. If you don&#x27;t know what I am talking about here, IT IS GREAT, and you should totally check out Pandoc and Pandoc FIlters.

                              <span>Hi all, I&#x27;m curious to get the opinion of the Emacs community on this issue, as basically all of my side projects revolve around Emacs package development.
 Background: I am looking to get away from GitHub for development. I would like something a little more in line with FOSS/Libre ideals.
 I&#x27;ve been on SourceHut for a while and I really like that there is 0 Javascript‚Äîit&#x27;s fast, reliable, and has worked well so far. Trouble is, collaboration is a little trickier as it&#x27;s all via mailing lists right now. I&#x27;ve appreciated learning about mailing lists and I have had some people collaborate with me on some software via email‚Äîso cool!‚Äîbut I know this is a blocker for some people. Also, it&#x27;s technically still in alpha; I know Prot recently left SourceHut due to some missing features, and I kind of look up to Prot&#x27;s deliberate approach to all things development.
 An alternative I&#x27;m considering is Forgejo. (The Codeberg instance, specifically.) They seem to have similar goals in regards to free software and portability, but the workflow is much more PR-based, which is much more comfortable for many users.
 I&#x27;m curious to hear people&#x27;s opinions on the two forges: where do you like developing software? (Especially Emacs related software.)

                              <span>I&#x27;ve recently picked up org-roam as part of an attempt to better organize studies with org-mode. As I create org-roam nodes, I C-c C-c them after filling out my templates, but this is not killing the buffer and over time they are building up. Is there a better command that I&#x27;ve not found for closing and auto killing the buffer?

                              <span>I do software consulting work, and each project has different requirements for what a C++/h/js/python file should look like. I&#x27;d like an easy way to configure &quot;default file content&quot; for new files in a per-project way, maybe through .dir-locals.el. I use skeleton-mode for my own projects, but setting that up requires using its mini-language, so not easy to do with dir-locals. Is there a package I could use for this? Perhaps some way to use yasnippets?

                              <span>When opening a binary file, I want to show the metadata obtained from some shell commands, instead of the real content of that file. For example, I want to do emacs binary.h5, but instead of showing the binary code, I want to show the result from h5ls binary.h5. 
 Of course I can use some hook to run the function I like, but the problem is that emacs would load the content of the file at some point, and I want to avoid this, because the size of the binary file can be huge.
 I think one way to solve this problem is to define my own functions in shell/emacs, and only use those functions to open the file. But I&#x27;m curious if there is a way to avoid emacs to load certain files. 
 Thanks.

                              <span>Does anybody use the Johnny.decimal system with org? If so (or also if not) I have a couple of questions:
  
does org also work well in a directory structure with Nester sub folder?
 is there a good way for liking files which will fuzzy find in that structure?
 do you have any other tips for me?
  
Thank you!

I&#x27;m sure these questions get asked a lot, but I can not get it working as I expect. As you can see in the image below there is very little being highlighted, especially inside js objects:
 https://preview.redd.it/z72124lfczgc1.png?width&#x3D;1374&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;700c6b6e9c9a12e4d711fdec2a634b6d1c319001
 From what I&#x27;ve read, having (global-fontlock-mode t) and (setq font-lock-maximum-decoration t) set should be enough, and it&#x27;s described as over the top, yet very little is being highlighted. I did try tree-sitter, but then everything is highlighted to a ridiculous degree and even with the package tree-sitter-langs installed non eof the -ts modes find a configuration. I&#x27;ve read that font-lock mode is good enough, so I&#x27;m wondering what I&#x27;m missing to get more highlighting?
 Thanks for any help.

                              <span>Hello everyone!
 I&#x27;ve been using Emacs for a couple months now as my primary editor and a little longer before for just Lisp-related stuff. I have my config (~500 LOC) I&#x27;m pretty comfortable with but it&#x27;s far from perfect. It&#x27;s a little messy, not everything works as expected. Like I still don&#x27;t know how to set custom font for Emacs client or solaire mode doesn&#x27;t work for some reason despite using themes that support it, not a big deal but it&#x27;d be nice to make them work. Now I&#x27;m thinking whether is it better to polish my current config so I have everything set up exactly how I want or to use some distribution that makes it all easier. I know it&#x27;s pretty much matter of preferences, but it&#x27;s hard to make a decision by myself not knowing what I miss from Doom/Spacemacs nor what trade-offs there are + I already have somehow functional config and I don&#x27;t know if at this point making a switch is a right move.
 And, despite I&#x27;m ex hardcore Vim user I don&#x27;t use evil-mode in Emacs (I mostly do program in Lisp languages in which Vim keybinding is just useless thanks to structural editing and paredit), but I know both of these distribution use evil-mode by default. So what is their support for Emacs keybinding?

                              <span>I would much prefer to have my LaTeX in org mode src blocks but then preview doesn&#x27;t work. Whats the reasoning for this? If I just embed the LaTeX with no begin/end then I can&#x27;t edit it using org-edit-special : if I do put it in a begin_export or begin_src I can edit it as LaTex but I can&#x27;t preview it. Am I missing something? Is there a way to preview inside block delimiters that I am missing? Very new to LaTeX inside org so probably overlooked something.

 When ever I save the whitespace around the : is removed, I have been looking for some kind of function called on the autosave hook to disable this functionality but I can&#x27;t find one, anyone know how I can configure / disable change the behavior so that the whitespace stays ?

                              <span>For a frontend project, I&#x27;ve started running a dev server with M-x Compile. This generally works well except it&#x27;s not respecting a .nvmrc, of course, and I&#x27;m debating writing some elisp to switch nvm versions when compiling and there exists an .nvmrc (for non JS devs, this a file that specifies the Node version to use in a directory).
 Got me to think, are there any alternative, and perhaps superior, ways to start long running processes like this? Obviously opening a shell is an option but I&#x27;ve been tending to avoiding doing that where possible.

                              <span>Hi folks!
 I was wondering if anyone knows the current state of macro annotations in Scala 3 LTS:
 It all started a long time ago; I was intrigued by the new style of defining newtypes that libraries like Iron introduced in place of the typical @newtype annotation of the popular Scala 2 library, then I asked &quot;why so much more boilerplate to create a value class?&quot;.
 Then I saw that more metaprogramming and macro-based libraries stopped using annotations in Scala 3 as well, and wondered if maybe it was just a change in style in general.
 So my question is, is it no longer possible to create macro annotations? If so, what is the reason for this? Compile time annotations like @tailrec or @depreciation still work, and I also saw that a MacroAnnotation class was introduced under an experimental flag in Scala 3.3.0, but I&#x27;m not sure what is left to accomplish so that it could be merged into the latest Scala version.
 I appreciate any clarification on this topic! Happy coding üòÑ.

                              <span>I have asked about quiet syntax before, and I know some love and some hate it. I just want to say I respect the developers of Scala for their boldness to adopt it in a world where languages have generally become a conservative affair in the mainstream. Kudos!
 edit : it&#x27;s been brought to my attention the title is confusing, bringing to mind AWS S3 -- sorry about that. decided not to delete and repost.

                              <span>I&#x27;m interested in having an automated way of getting cabal&#x27;s interface files (either a copy/symlink to them or redirecting the output). Unfortunately the closest thing to getting a directory is &#x60;cabal list-bin&#x60; which seems fragile for this (would require some string manipulation/isn&#x27;t guaranteed). 
 I would prefer against setting &#x60;-hidir&#x60; if possible as some programs (cabal/ghc-pkg) assume that the location is not changed (though I do have workarounds for this case). Notably setting &#x60;-hidir&#x60; causes build failures with cabal unless you do a build without the flag first... 
 If anyone has any ideas here I would greatly appreciate it.

                              <span>It&#x27;s a sad fact that instances of typeclasses cannot be automatically verified for adherence to the typeclass laws, nor is Haskell&#x27;s type system expressive enough to prove their correctness. (Yes I&#x27;m aware of testing libraries that can mitigate this problem.)
 If an instance doesn&#x27;t satisfy the laws, that can cause all sorts of problems. But how big of an issue is this, empirically speaking? I&#x27;m looking for examples of real-world bugs in typeclass instances. I&#x27;d like to get a sense of things like:
 - How common are these bugs?
 - How are unlawful typeclass instances discovered? E.g., are they found via property testing, or by tracking down the issue from some other bug? Are they found by maintainers of the package or other users?
 - Are there typeclasses whose laws seem particularly prone to bugs?

Despite their many capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) have a serious
limitation: they‚Äôre stuck in time and their knowledge is limited to the data
they have been trained on.
Updating the knowledge of an LLM can take two forms: fine-tuning, which we will
address in a future post, and the ever-present RAG.
RAG, short for Retrieval Augmented Generation, has garnered a lot of attention
in the GenAI community and for good reasons. You ‚Äúsimply‚Äù hook the LLM up to your
documents (more on that later), and it can suddenly tackle any question, as
long as the answer is somewhere in the documents.
This is almost too good to be true: it offers endless possibilities, a simple
concept and, thanks to advances in the tooling ecosystem, a straightforward
implementation.

 Cannot find file at &#x27;c:\tools\emacs\bin\emacs.exe&#x27; (c:\tools\emacs\bin\emacs.exe). This usually indicates a missing or moved file.
 i tried looking at environment vars, path, ps1 profile, nothing. what more can i do?
 i&#x27;m looking to get &quot;The term &#x27;emacs&#x27; is not recognized as a name of a cmdlet...&quot; so i can reinstall everything

 Switching above works as expected with a single window or when horizontally splitting

 However, when you do a vertical split window. All of a sudden the tooltip reverts to the default behavior despite no changes in the mode-line-buffer-identification variable.

 Does anyone know what&#x27;s going on and how to fix the behavior so it works as expected?

 I&#x27;d like to make the window (Emacs Frame) stand out from the other windows but the only thing I&#x27;ve been able to do is to undecorate the frame, but it removes any shadow and rounded corners and looks kind of out of tone with the rest of the windows. It would be neat to have rounded corners but no title bar or some similar customization, but I do not know if Emacs can edit its client side decorations. (I&#x27;m using GNOME 45)

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I&#x27;m currently facing an issue with configuring Emacs on WSL to open Excel files using the Windows Excel program. I&#x27;ve tried the following configuration, inspired by the awesome Bozhidar&#x27;s blog post on setting the default browser[1] by:
  (when (and (eq system-type &#x27;gnu/linux) (getenv &quot;WSLENV&quot;)) ;; Configure opening Excel files from WSL (setq org-file-apps &#x27;((&quot;\\.xlsx\\&#x27;&quot; . &quot;cmd.exe /c start excel \&quot;%s\&quot;&quot;)))) 
 Then in Org file in the same directory as xlsx file I have following link:
  [[file:test.xlsx][test]] 
 finally I run org-open-at-point (C-c C-o) being with the point over the link.
 While Excel opens successfully, the specified file doesn&#x27;t get passed as an argument to the Excel command. I&#x27;m wondering if there&#x27;s a correct way to pass the file path as the last argument in the command. Has anyone encountered a similar issue or can provide insights on how to resolve it?
 Also I tested from the terminal of the WSL distro the command itself
  cmd.exe /c start excel test.xlsx 
 And it works properly.
 Any help would be greatly appreciated!
 Thank you.

 Still when using org-contrib I see elpa.nongnu.org/nongnu and 1) I have no clue where that is coming from; and 2) how can I get rid of it.

                              <span>ekg is a note taking package that is tag-based, and uses sqlite for storage. The new version 0.5.0 is out, featuring the following major changes:
  
Inline tags! Now you can just add tags as you type, which I find very convenient. The tags are, in org-mode, turned into org-mode links, so those who like this style of having links in one note that enable &quot;backlinks&quot; will find this more familiar. The backlinks here are just the tag showing the notes that have the link to that tag.
 
ekg-auto-save, a module by Qingshui Zheng that let&#x27;s you enable saving notes automatically as you write them, which works in a similar way to the emacs auto-save functionality. If you write longer notes, this should be useful.
 
Improvements to org-mode notes. Because of the way our notes buffer works, it has metadata at the top which has read-only elements that interfere with org-mode. We now have some ability to narrow the buffer before the appropriate org-mode commands so that they work correctly. But this solution isn&#x27;t perfect, and more work needs to be done. 
 
Trash simplification - I previously had the notion that trashing a note should trash the individual tags, prepending them all with &quot;trash/&quot;. That idea never really panned out, and was adding too much complication, so now there&#x27;s just a &quot;trash&quot; tag. If your note has that tag, it&#x27;s in the trash.
 
Aborting a note. If you are capturing a note, save it as a draft, but then want to just abandon both the note and the draft, you can do that with C-c C-k. Also thanks to Qingshui Zheng!
 
Many bug fixes.

                              <span>I wanted to have the the option to call magit-status as the first thing I do when opening a project. Project.el allows to define this kind of behavior using projects-switch-commands and, in fact magit does that once magit-project-statusis called.
 I&#x27;m not able to make this work the way I want without resorting to the following: explicitly requiring project.el, and copy/pasting the code from magit-extras that sets the magit command to so:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; (require &#x27;project)
 ;; Git management (use-package magit)
 ;; Copied from magit/magit-extras.el (when (and (boundp &#x27;project-prefix-map) ;; Only modify if it hasn&#x27;t already been modified. (equal project-switch-commands (eval (car (get &#x27;project-switch-commands &#x27;standard-value)) t))) (keymap-set project-prefix-map &quot;m&quot; #&#x27;magit-project-status) (add-to-list &#x27;project-switch-commands &#x27;(magit-project-status &quot;Magit&quot;) t)) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 There must be a way to do this without the need of repeating code, but I failed to make other approaches work.
 Any help is welcomed.
 Thanks!

 The description of the problem is below. My solution for anyone who faced with such an issue: 1. Emacs has amazing tool M-x describe-variable 2. M-x describe-variable RET lsp-diagnostics-provider RET should open a window with explanation of this variable and current value 3. To resolve the problem the value should be &quot;flycheck&quot;, here is details what is it https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/page/settings/diagnostics/#lsp-diagnostics-provider 4. And here is about flycheck https://www.flycheck.org/en/latest/index.html 5. You can set the value programmatically or with Emacs UI 6. Enjoy your errors!)
 But still, I get separate window on hover, even with (setq lsp-ui-sideline-show nil)

 Just back to using latex after many years away. I&#x27;d forgotten what a complex eco structure it is.

 Something obvious? I have auctex installed in case thats relevant.

TeX-macro-global is a variable defined in ‚Äòtex.el‚Äô.

                              <span>I came across a link to a webpage, &quot;A physical analogy for monads&quot; in my files. The web page is defunct, but I&#x27;d really like to find something like that. I know people are skeptical in general of this kind of thing, but I think very concretely, and also like having multiple models of concepts in my head, to draw on.
 Does anyone know where I can find something like this? (Googling the above phrase didn&#x27;t get me anywhere.)

                              <span>Note, I still have a lot to learn.
 One thing that I find valuable in programming is abstracting the implementation. For example, we can have a module A that defines a certain function type, that is actually implemented in a separate module.
 For the purpose of learning, I made a simple example of the StopWatch implementation: https://github.com/igr/exemplatory/tree/main/stopwatch/haskell-mtl
 My goal is to have Stopwatch module that is NOT aware of the implementation of the function that returns (IO) current time. Of course, I am using current time just for the sake of the example; it can be any other function that the module does not need to know about.
 I know that Haskell allows that, but would warn about orphan instances. For that purpose, I followed the GHC compiler advice and used the wrapped type; although I liked the code better with orphan instance.
 I wonder‚Äîwhat would be the better way to implement such StopWatch? I could make everything simpler and have a function that just accepts the timestamp instead of a function that generates one; but would I encapsulate the stopwatch business capabilities in a correct way?

                              <span>I have the function below which currently returns a pair of Finite n:
 haskell closestInternalNodes :: Point2D m -&gt; Point2D m -&gt; Vector (n + 1) (Point2D n2) -&gt; (Finite (n + 1), Finite (n + 1)) closestInternalNodes mostPrev mostNext inner &#x3D; (closestNodeTo mostPrev, closestNodeTo mostNext) where closestNodeTo p &#x3D; V.minIndexBy (\p1 p2 -&gt; compare (dist p1 p) (dist p2 p)) inner dist :: Point2D n -&gt; Point2D m -&gt; Double dist p1 p2 &#x3D; norm $ p1 &#x60;minus&#x60; p2 
 but what I&#x27;d really want is to do this:
 haskell -- TODO: There must be a way to return a pair of Proxies. This is *really close* to full dependent types -- though. These proxies should be tagged with proofs that their Nat is less than i, which is something -- we *do* know at compile-time, but the problem is that we can&#x27;t know what these values are until runtime. -- So while the only information we have about these type level numbers is that they are less than i (which -- is a compile-time fact), we don&#x27;t know what they are exactly until runtime. closestInternalNodes :: forall n m i mostprev mostnext. Point2D n -&gt; Point2D n -&gt; Vector i (Point2D m) -&gt; (Proxy mostprev, Proxy mostnext) closestInternalNodes mostPrev mostNext inner &#x3D; (closestNodeTo mostPrev, closestNodeTo mostNext) where closestNodeTo :: forall ind. Point2D n -&gt; Proxy ind closestNodeTo p &#x3D; ??? 
 But I suspect it&#x27;s just not possible, at least not with vector-sized.

                              <span>Hi,
 Intro: I&#x27;m new to OrgMode. Currently using Workflowy. 
 I currently use a daily template with a predefined series of tasks on top of which I add new ones.
 Separately I have a weekly template for the training routine. I usually &quot;instantiate&quot; this template at the beginning of the week and then on specific days I refer to items from it.
 Questions:
  
I have read about Capture templates. Are these the mechanism I should use to define templates?
 How can I link/refer to a task somewhere in the tree from another subtree?
  
with gratitude,
 Alex

 What&#x27;s the best way to do that in Emacs? I know that C-c is technically what that&#x27;s for, but a lot of mode-specific commands are already bound with it. Like if I want a quick way to invoke M-x customize, should I do some prefix like C-z c? If I want to view my agenda while in some random prog-mode buffer maybe I could type C-z a...

                              <span>Hi everyone. I&#x27;m new to Julia and language servers. I&#x27;ve set up Eglot with eglot-jl and it seems to be working fine. The only thing that&#x27;s off is that Eglot takes 15 to 30 s to start up. It&#x27;s not a big deal but it got me wondering if I misconfigured something.
 I&#x27;m running Emacs 30.0.50 with the latest version of the packages as of yesterday. My emacs config goes like this:

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to use Emacs (doom, 29.1) via the daemon in MacOS (14.3, apple M2). I used to have the emacs-plus installed, but switched to emacs-macport. The first one seemed to have a homebrew service installed for the daemon, but it never worked for me, not sure why. I&#x27;m now trying to set up the daemon for emacs-macport.
 What I&#x27;ve gathered so far:
 - Opening emacs GUI and doing m-x start-server make the process be attached to that OS Window and, when it is closed, it all dies together.
 - running /opt/homebrew/opt/emacs-mac/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs --daemon gives me the terminal output I would expect when starting the daemon and a process, but when I try to emacsclient -cn, it opens a terminal emacs, not a GUI.
 Daemon start command output:
 Starting Doom Emacs in daemon mode! Initializing org-roam database... Clearing removed files... Clearing removed files...done Processing modified files... Processing modified files...done Copilot agent started. Starting Emacs daemon. Doom loaded 285 packages across 47 modules in 5.113s 
 - when using the launchctl, as indicated in the wiki (with the modifications to emacs&#x27; path, and --fg-daemon), it starts the process with the same output as above. But, when trying to emacsclient -cn it gives me *ERROR*: Terminal type xterm-kitty is not defined. Doing export TERM&#x3D;xterm does fix that, but it still opens a (rather very bugged) terminal frame.
 - Lastly, I tried creating an Emacs.app via Automator, but when invoked, it gives me the error could not get terminal name, which, I suppose, comes from the fact it is trying to open in a terminal, not GUI.
 TL;DR: It seems I&#x27;ve managed to open the server, but not to open a GUI frame. Any tips?

                              <span>I am using awesome-tray and like the layout a lot. It does have some problems though, for instance there are errors on startup and I&#x27;m not able to set the color successfully. I&#x27;m wondering if anyone has experience with these type of packages?
 Another one that works well is mini-echo which is free of errors, but the code is structured in an advanced lisp style that&#x27;s hard for me to interpret, so I have not been able to customize it for different reasons.
 It would be good to fix the errors in awesome-tray and improve it. The errors I get are fairly simple:
 awesome-tray.el: Warning: Pattern t is deprecated. Use _ instead [2 times]
 Warning: setting attribute ‚Äò:background‚Äô of face ‚Äòmode-line-buffer-id‚Äô: nil value is invalid, use ‚Äòunspecified‚Äô instead.
 Warning: setting attribute ‚Äò:foreground‚Äô of face ‚Äòregion‚Äô: nil value is invalid, use ‚Äòunspecified‚Äô instead.Unable to load color &quot;color&quot; [2 times]
 I&#x27;ve been able to override how awesome-tray displays major modes with a list of shorthand strings and change the time format, so it seems easy to customize. I suspect setq awesome-tray-mode-line-active-color doesn&#x27;t work because of the above errors, but I&#x27;m not certain.
 Anyway are there any other packages that would be a good choice, or does anyone have some advice on how I might go about fixing or improving awesome-tray? My lisp knowledge on it&#x27;s own is not enough to locate the problem.

                              <span>What kinds of buffers do you wish you could bookmark in Emacs that you can&#x27;t usefully bookmark already? Emacs can of course bookmark specific locations in regular text files, but also several types of non-file buffers: dired, eshell, Man, eww, Info, help, image, vc-dir, doc-view, possibly others. Are there any others you&#x27;d like to be able to bookmark?
 Here are some ideas:
  
occur and grep buffers (jumping to the bookmark would rerun the search).
 
REPLs. I can imagine this being useful: you bookmark a Python REPL and later jumping to the bookmark starts a new REPL and reruns all the import statements you had run before (or maybe just reruns everything?, or everything marked with a special comment?)
 
shells. The eshell bookmarks are great, and that&#x27;s what I use, but not everyone uses eshell. A shell bookmarker should preserve the current directory and whether you were ssh&#x27;ed into some other computer.
 
Shell command output buffers, the bookmarks should rerun the command. Same for compilation buffers (revert-buffer already knows how to rerun the compilation!).
 
 I&#x27;d love to see some more ideas for missing bookmark capabilities.

                              <span>Hello,
 I&#x27;m trying to find a good, generic, folding solution based on indentation level. This is just because I tend to have formatting outputs that don&#x27;t have specific configuration for hs-minor-mode. hs-minor-mode seems like a good solution in general, but looks like it doesn&#x27;t come with an obvious indentation-based level solution?
 I have used yafolding but in general I have found that I can&#x27;t get yafolding-toggle-all to do something predictable. What it chooses to fold is never predictable to me.
 Any solution using hs-minor-mode?

                              <span>I am using emacs on windows. scrolling with the mouse works fine. but i cannot scroll down with the touchpad. specifically, emacs scrolls up whether i move up or down with two fingers on my touchpad.
 Emacs in WSL works fine with the touchpad.
 I&#x27;ve checked the Emacs Wiki and https://emacsdocs.org/docs/emacs/Scrolling. but nothing mentions the problem I&#x27;ve encountered.
 Can anyone help me identify the problem? Thank you in advance

                              <span>New to org, I&#x27;d like to create a database of people: some alive, mostly dead.
 The point is to be able to link to an entry from any of the org files in my org/ directory (say maths.org, music.org, etc.).
 The data will be very simple: date/place of birth, short description, some tags, ...
 Isn&#x27;t BBDB too much for the thing? Could GNU Recutils be a good shot?
 What would you recommend?

                              <span>Is the _ALL suffix not allowed for Special Properties?
 I&#x27;ve been trying to restrict the values that can be given to the CATEGORY property. Now I know that for a property I define -- MYPROP, say -- I can specify a set of allowed values by giving them as a list to the property MYPROP_ALL for example:
 #+PROPERTY: MYPROP_ALL Value1 Value2 Value3 
 Then if I use ‚ÄòC-c C-x p‚Äô (‚Äòorg-set-property‚Äô) and answer &quot;MYPROP&quot; to its first prompt, the second prompt (which wants the value) forces me to stick to the list in MYPROP_ALL.[1] Also, both ‚ÄòS-‚Äô (‚Äòorg-property-next-allowed-value‚Äô) and ‚ÄòS-‚Äô (‚Äòorg-property-previous-allowed-value‚Äô respect the MYPTOP_ALL list as well.
 But when it comes to Special Properties that doesn&#x27;t appear to work. So if I have:
 #+PROPERTY: CATEGORY_ALL Value1 Value2 Value3 
 then ‚ÄòC-c C-x p‚Äô (‚Äòorg-set-property‚Äô) ignores the list in CATEGORY_ALL.[1] Furthermore, neither ‚ÄòS-‚Äô (‚Äòorg-property-next-allowed-value‚Äô) nor ‚ÄòS-‚Äô (‚Äòorg-property-previous-allowed-value‚Äô pay attention to it either. In fact both of them respond with &quot;Allowed values for this property have not been defined&quot;.
 Is that the expected behavior, or am I doing something wrong?
 [1] Org may well give a completion list, but only if CATEGORY has already been given values elsewhere in the file, and then the list consists of all those values, and it still ignores CATEGORY_ALL. And that list of pre-used values is not enforced, the way an _ALL list is. It is merely a list of suggestions that can be ignored; brand new values can be entered without being trapped.

 don&#x27;t show up repeating on the agenda view (just at first date) no matter how I seem to format them, scheduled timestamps are also failing to do this (or deadline timestamps but I think that makes sense in that case idk).
 *sigh* I hope I am missing something silly!

                              <span>Sorry for verbose, detail is here.
 At first, I&#x27;m reading https://okmij.org/ftp/Haskell/extensible/more.pdf to understand &quot;Free monad&quot;. I mean the word FFree in title is from this paper.
 And maybe I have been able to understand what is FFree in this paper. This paper says FFree is a data type which has two aspects Pure and Impure, especially Impure works as an action handler like monad&#x27;s &gt;&gt;&#x3D; and it presents fmap. I think that FFree seems very simple and reasonable.
 So I implemented FFree monad as written in the paper. &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;haskell {-# LANGUAGE GADTs #-} import Control.Monad ((&gt;&#x3D;&gt;)) data FFree f a where Pure :: a -&gt; FFree f a Impure :: f x -&gt; (x -&gt; FFree f a) -&gt; FFree f a
 instance Monad (FFree f) where Impure fx k&#x27; &gt;&gt;&#x3D; k &#x3D; Impure fx (k&#x27; &gt;&#x3D;&gt; k) Pure a &gt;&gt;&#x3D; k &#x3D; k a &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 And I need Functor and Applicative for Monad instance.
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;haskell instance Functor (FFree f) where fmap f (Pure a) &#x3D; Pure (f a) -- Continuous is here, impressible. fmap f (Impure fx k) &#x3D; Impure fx (fmap f . k)
 instance Applicative (FFree f) where pure &#x3D; Pure Pure f  Pure a &#x3D; Pure (f a) Pure f  Impure fx k &#x3D; Impure fx (fmap f . k) Impure fx f  p@(Pure _) &#x3D; Impure fx (\x -&gt; f x  p) -- I have no idea how implement this pattern. Impure fx f  Impure gx g &#x3D; undefined &#x60;&#x60; I could writeFunctorwith no problem (maybe), but I couldn&#x27;t writeimplementation betweenImpurecase. Here is my question again, how do I implementFFree&#x60; of Applicative?
 From the first, What does Applicative applying between Impure mean theoretically?
 P.S. No need to ensure what a compiler says, I know why I can&#x27;t it. Left hand f x and right hand one are rigid types each other.

                              <span>Hey guys, I want to understand how we write verilog code in EMACS and take the advantage of the emacs editor. I am new to emacs so not able to understand anything. I have attached an image of a simple verilog code which I got from internet. Can anyone explain how the above template generate the final code. And what is AUTO mode and how it used to automate the code and how it saves time for RTL coding.

This will be so helpful, since you can constantly re-estructure your own text. How did I manage to miss this? 
 Do you have any other really obvious features that I am idiotically missing? Thank you!

                              <span>Does anyone else find it odd that many computer scientists use multiple text editors? A common combo I see is VScode + notepad++. They open text files that contain &quot;code&quot; in one, and everything else in the other. I&#x27;ve only seen one example of someone realizing this was weird and taking the time to configure notepad++ to be able to handle code as well. (why not open regular text in VSCode?). I&#x27;ve also seen an example of someone running two VScodes, one for the project and the other for the test project, and notepad++ for editing config files.
 Does anyone find it weirder that no one seems to think this is a weird thing to do?

This is my work flow, although things are working fine, I feel there is lot more I could do to improve my work flow. I am a long time emacs user (20+ years), I‚Äôm but I feel bad that I had the motivation to learn lisp. 
 Work flow: - Multiple emacs daemons running on remote Linux - From MAC book pro, open iTerm and ssh to remote machine - Connect to emacs daemon in no-window mode - Use emacs vterm when i need a terminal
 I did try Tramp with emacs running on MacBook but it had been very slow, I deal with very large files 
 Any suggestion or improvements are greatly appreciated

Immediately stops the process you are typing at, and selects an idle lisp-listener (creating one if there aren‚Äôt any). This is the key to use to get to &quot;command level&quot; without destroying the computation in progress. 
  
Do you want me to file a bug report /u/zaretskii?

 TLDR: With the confusing advice on how to setup a new typescript dev setup. I have wasted a long time until I realized, I had updated the typescript tree-sitter grammar to one that wasn&#x27;t compatible with emacs 29.2 on fedora. Reverting to an older version fixed it. See fix below.
 So I am just starting programming in typescript for work. Up until now I have been focused on Python. I have enjoyed quite a lot the features that emacs 29 brought out of the box (eglot, treesit modes). In Python, in combination with envrc and pyright I was able to create a very pleasant development environment. On my quest t‚Ä¶</span>

                              <span>I was recently working on a &quot;Durable Key-Value Store&quot; implementation in ZIO. The implementation was pretty straightforward, but I had to make sure that the log file is not accessed concurrently by multiple fibers. I could have used a Ref to keep track of the state, but I came across Semaphore in ZIO and decided to give it a try. I was pleasantly surprised by how easy it was to use. 
 This is my new blog post about how to use Semaphore to implement concurrency control in ZIO.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been learning Scala on and off for some time and recently I&#x27;ve decided to give it a go again. I decided to re-implement https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic as a cli application.
 I&#x27;m reading a string from console:
 add vet james bond espionage    
 My ADTs looked like this:
 object Context: case object Vet extends Context case object Owner extends Context trait Command trait ContextedCommand[T  validate command &amp; context -&gt; validate arguments depending on context and command (pattern matching) -&gt; execute specific &quot;Repository&quot; method depending on command + context (pattern matching) .
 What refactoring should I do, if I&#x27;m trying to go to the tagless final approach?
 Currently I&#x27;m going in circles fiddling with the code from the command and implementing something that seems wrong and scrapping it.
 Would the correct refactoring steps be:
  
remove context: T from Command proprties
 validate command &amp; context the same way 
 create separate given instances for validators addVetValidator() / addOwnerValidator()
 continue with distinct given instances for command handling logic 
  
I&#x27;ve watched RockTheJvm&#x27;s video/article and DevInsideYou&#x27;s series but I feel like I&#x27;m too grug brained.
