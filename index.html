                              <span>i want to display the current git revision that my program was built with in an info menu. to do that i have a template haskell function that looks like this
  git &#x3D; $(readProcess &quot;git&quot; [&quot;rev-parse&quot;, &quot;--short&quot;] &quot;&quot;) 
 this is simplified for the purpose of this post
 the problem is, it runs this command every time the program runs, rather than once at compile time, so it always tries to read the revision of whatever your cwd is. is there a way to make this only run at compile time and never again?

 Release notes:
  
With one exception, this release fixes bugs.
  
Changes since v2.15.1:
 Behavior changes:
  
stack path --global-config, --programs, and --local-bin no longer set up Stack’s environment.
  
Bug fixes:
  
Due to a bug, Stack 2.15.1 did not support versions of GHC before 8.2. Stack now supports GHC versions from 8.0.
 --haddock-for-hackage does not ignore --haddock-arguments.
 On Windows, package locations that are Git repositories with submodules now work as intended.
 The ghc, runghc and runhaskell commands accept --package values that are a list of package names or package identifiers separated by spaces and, in the case of package identifiers, in the same way as if they were specified as targets to stack build.
  
Thanks to all our contributors for this release:

 Following the handover of the Stackage project to the Haskell Foundation the file at Stack’s default URL is no longer up to date.
 stack init uses this file to decide which snapshots to try when creating a stack.yaml file. stack new uses stack init by default.

                              <span>Hi,
 What is the Haskell way to manage this kind of nested workflow? Here is an example in JS:
 /**
 * Reduces a sequence of names to initials.
 * u/function makeInitials
 * u/param {String} authors A comma-delimited list of authors.
 * u/param {String} sep A period separating the initials.
 * u/param {String} trail A period ending the initials.
 * u/param {String} hyph A hyphen separating double-barrelled names.
 * u/return {String} Properly formatted initials.
 */
 function makeInitials(authors, sep &#x3D; &quot;.&quot;, trail &#x3D; &quot;.&quot;, hyph &#x3D; &quot;-&quot;) {
 const rDot &#x3D; new RegExp(&#x60;[\\s${sep}]+&#x60;);
 return authors
 .replace(/\&quot;(?:\\.|[^\&quot;\\])*\&quot;/g, &quot; &quot;)
 .replaceAll(&#x27;&quot;&#x27;, &quot; &quot;)
 .split(&quot;,&quot;)
 .filter((author) &#x3D;&gt; author.replaceAll(sep, &quot;&quot;).replaceAll(hyph, &quot;&quot;).trim())
 .map(
 (author) &#x3D;&gt;
 author
 .split(hyph)
 .filter((barrel) &#x3D;&gt; barrel.replaceAll(sep, &quot;&quot;).trim())
 .map((barrel) &#x3D;&gt;
 barrel
 .split(rDot)
 .filter((name) &#x3D;&gt; name)
 .map((name) &#x3D;&gt; name[0])
 .join(sep)
 .toUpperCase(),
 )
 .join(hyph) + trail,
 )
 .join(&quot;,&quot;);
 }
 This kind of stuff looks pretty much the same in Dart, Kotlin, PHP, Rust, etc. Somehow I can&#x27;t figure out how to structure it in Haskell. There must be a way to keep uniformity and readability in Haskell; autoformat should like it, too.
 PS I still can&#x27;t figure out how to make code snippets readable. If it&#x27;s Markdown, why the &#x60;backticks&#x60; won&#x27;t work?

                              <span>I am trying to make e-mail scheduling possible in Emacs based on gnus-delay but for notmuch.
 A lot of stuff in notmuch calls pop-to-buffer-same-window and similar functions which is making things complicated. Like when calling notmuch-draft-resume (which I call to bring up the postponed message, check headers and send).
 I would also like to run the queue processing in the background on a schedule, which will disrupt my work if I am doing something and all of a sudden windows start to move around.
 So I think I have two options when processing the queue:
  
Save the current window configuration, process the queue and restore it.
 Create a new frame, make-frame-invisible it, and delete the frame when done.
  
On the second option, something does not work after calling make-frame-invisible, as if pop-to-buffer-same-window would not work on an invisible frame. Is that possible?
 On the first option, as I would like to have the queue processing run on a schedule, I guess I&#x27;d need some way to &quot;run this function every X minutes ONLY ONLY ONLY if the session is inactive&quot; to not disrupt my work. Is there such a function/package available to detect if the session is inactive?

                              <span>Hi,
 Before someone runs in and suggests project.el or projectile, hear me out please. 
 My work consists of both programming and a lot of designing. I manage my repositories nicely with projectile, but my design resources are a complete mess. 
 I have directories with org-mode files, diagrams made both inside of emacs (with plantuml) and outside of emacs. I also have presentations and other miscellaneous files. 
 I am looking for a smart way to access and organize all these directories and files in a way that resembles org-roam. Would such a thing exist? 
 My current alternative approach that I haven’t tested yet involves swapping altering the org-roam database using .dir-locals.el together with projectile, but I haven’t tried this.

 LSP errors look unreadable as they&#x27;re single line... Anyone knows how to configure these errors to look more readable? Or to see one error at a time? Or open details of an error?

                              <span>Is it possible to have the org-habit graph display a day where a task was missed with a solid colour block rather than a glyph? For example having a red block on a day where a habit was missed followed by a green block where it was done? It seems that all the various org-habit faces are used to identify when habits are due vs overdue and such but there are none that actually denote what is a completed task vs failed one. Is a glyph the only way to identify this or is there any alternative?

                              <span>If you see my post history, I have been trying to move to Emacs full time for both, work and personal. I used my own config, then moved to Spacemacs, tried Doom and finally settled in Spacemacs.
 For personal stuff, I have a few annoyances but nothing major but, for work, there are a few things that hurt my productivity - I need to get things done and don&#x27;t have much time to fix, so I am using VSCode instead.
 Some of the things that are blocking me: - multi-vterm refuses to work. It just says that it cannot find vterm-mode. vterm works, so the mode is there but nope - vterm keeps on scrolling down to the prompt, making going through logs or things like that impossible - LSP seems to be unable to find my .venv and use the pyright inside, even when I start it from the shell
 It is possible that I am &#x27;holding it the wrong way&#x27; but I am not ready to change my full workflow for this.
 This is not a complain, just a post so people see what it is if you are not an expert - Google shows no solutions to these issues, no matter what I do and I don&#x27;t have the time to fix them. I understand that Emacs is more of a &#x27;here are the parts, put them together in any way you want&#x27; but that same approach, while mitigated by distributions like Spacemacs, make it way harder for people who need to get things done now, if you happen to hit any issues.

                              <span>Is there some kind of option/package, which can create C block comments in a way that it only puts a comment marker at the beginning and at the end of region?
 I mean, if I comment this with comment-region:
 Something here and there 
 I get this:
 /* Something here */ /* and there */ 
 But I&#x27;d like to have this:
 /* Something here and there */ 
 comment-region is inconsistent with the behavior if I write the comment by hand. I mean, if I start creating the comment by /* Some ..., emacs creates the second version. But if I uncomment it with uncomment-region, and then add the comment back with comment-region, I get the first version.

                              <span>I picked up obsidian recently after taking over a job from another guy. I love its TODO features and the beautiful markdown format it has which is really easy to use, but that is all I really use it for. I am normally a minimalist, I used to take notes and todo lists only in notepad (its very manageable with ok formatting), as well as physical notes in a few notebooks I regularly replace. My work is in Mechanical Engineering so its normally just about task management in the background while I have my CAE software &amp; outlook in front. Work PC is windows and obviously I cannot change that. 
 I discovered Emacs a few weeks ago, and its been rough trying to learn its systems since I have limited free time. I am really interested in org-mode, and the possibility of not only task management, but interlocking its systems with email, IRC (and therefore slack/discord), maybe learning VIM keybinds, etc but I really have no interest in using it as a coding interface, or in writing academic papers.
 Is emacs right for my use case?

                              <span>Eglot has this feature where the variable at point and its references in the code below get highlighted in bold.
 Does anyone know a feature or package that adds the same or similar highlighting to emacs lisp?
 And I mean not just highlight by name, but by binding, so if I (re-)bind the same name many times in multiple nested let expressions or let*, it should correctly highlight only the references of the same binding.
 Side-note:
 I really feel like emacs lisp is falling behind a bit with all the cool treesitter and LSP features other languages have now. I understand that treesitter support would be hard due to elisp&#x27;s syntactic ambiguity between macros and functions and highlighting and indentation would probably be worse than emacs itself which can respect the indentation guides and highlighting provided by the functions/macros themselves. 
 But a language server would really help a lot, for example to get xref-find-references working with functions not currently defined in the running emacs instance, for example when writing stand-alone scripts.

                              <span>Hello everyone, how do you handle the situation where you want certain keybindings to be conditionally bound. Here is what I have as an example:
 My config
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; ... (defvar-keymap my/code-keymap &quot;d&quot; #&#x27;xref-find-definitions ) 
 (defvar-keymap my/lsp-code-keymap &quot;d&quot; #&#x27;lsp-find-definition &quot;i&quot; #&#x27;lsp-find-implementation ) 
 (defvar-keymap my/leader-keymap &quot;.&quot; #&#x27;find-file &quot;/&quot; #&#x27;consult-ripgrep &quot;g&quot; #&#x27;magit &quot;:&quot; #&#x27;consult-mode-command &quot;Q&quot; #&#x27;ave-buffers-kill-terminal
 &quot;f&quot; my/file-keymap &quot;p&quot; my/project-keymap &quot;w&quot; my/window-keymap &quot;b&quot; my/buffer-keymap &quot;r&quot; my/rings-and-regs-keymap &quot;e&quot; my/edit-keymap &quot;!&quot; my/error-keymap &quot;i&quot; my/insert-keymap &quot;t&quot; my/toggle-keymap &quot;c&quot; my/code-keymap ) 
 (unbind-key &quot;SPC&quot; evil-motion-state-map) (bind-key &quot;SPC&quot; my/leader-keymap evil-motion-state-map)
 (add-hook &#x27;lsp-mode-hook (lambda () (make-local-variable &#x27;my/leader-keymap) (bind-key &quot;c&quot; my/lsp-code-keymap my/leader-keymap)) )
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Here I replace my-code-keymap with my-lsp-code-keymap if I am in an lsp-mode buffer. This nearly works, but making the keymap buffer-local doesn&#x27;t seem to work. Thus once lsp-mode is turned on in any buffer, all buffers have their code keymap replaced. 
 What I don&#x27;t want to do:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; (defvar-keymap my/not-wanted-lsp-code-keymap &quot;d&quot; (lambda () (if lsp-mode (call-interactively #&#x27;lsp-find-definition) (call-interactively #&#x27;lsp-find-definition)))
 &quot;i&quot; (lambda () (if lsp-mode (call-interactively #&#x27;lsp-find-definition) (message &quot;lsp is not available&quot;))) ) 
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 I want to avoid binding keys to some function that checks if lsp is bound and runs the appropriate command. This is because I don&#x27;t want which-key showing the &quot;SPC c i&quot; option in non lsp buffers since it doesn&#x27;t do anything because lsp is not available.
 Can keybindings even be buffer-local?
 I would appreciate examples of how this is handled in your config.

                              <span>Have you ever heard of Worked Examples from Cognitive Load Theory?
If not, this simple, teacher/student oriented video explains worked examples quite well.
As I have been learning a bit about cognitive load theory and the effects of worked examples, I was wondering what how it applies to the Zettelkasten Method. Specifically, in the video above, it seems that elaborative encoding might not be as effective without the schema being represented well to the learner first when they are a novice.
It seems that a lot of the ideas around ZKM or just Zettelkasten more generally are heavily founded upon deep processing or elaborative encoding from a more constructivist flavor.
I was wondering if there was more of a need for worked examples as one develops knowledge within their ZK and even as one works on getting better at the method itself (ZKM).
Would love to hear if any others have thoughts on this.
Note: I know that Math is focused on this video. But, it seems to me that zettling is a practice/skill. And, even a lot of what we develop within the ZK should be able to used in some skill. So, worked examples seems relevant. Feel free to pick at that assumption too!</span>

                              <span>TL;DR: LLMs are unreliable, but oh my, this unreliable?!?
I have been working through a beautiful (and funny!) book, A.C. Grayling&#x27;s &quot;The History of Philosophy&quot; (2019). My main interest has been the ideas therein and less biography, but I decided to have a note each for the major philosophers I care about, and started using Claude 3 Opus (the latest model from Anthropic, claimed to be GPT-4 level) for just the biography part. What could possibly go wrong?!?
Well, in the dozen philosophers I have had Claude write a short bio for, maybe nothing wrong was seen. But then, I am hardly an expert on Thales (born around 624 BC) so wouldn&#x27;t have spotted a small lie here or there.
So I asked it to write a biographical note for someone I know well --- me. The results were horrendous. I report them in full detail (with correction) here: https://amahabal.substack.com/p/dissecting-the-people-make-errors (as part of the bigger question in response to someone saying &quot;but people make errors, too!&quot;).

 Its actually more of a rant about people not learning their tools. But I use my emacs setup to drive the point home.

 Would love some feedback!

                              <span>r/emacs is such a valuable resource; I&#x27;ve learned so much in conversation with you all. I&#x27;ve recently discovered that we have only one active moderator (thanks to them!). While so far I haven&#x27;t noticed issues arising from this, I think we can all agree that drawing additional moderator support from among our most active members would strengthen an already strong community. The advantages of a larger pool of moderators include distributing the work effort and bringing in other viewpoints. The former is especially important, as we all know how work and life commitments ebb and flow.
 If you are interested in serving as a moderator for r/emacs, please reply with your short &quot;Emacs bio&quot; — how long you&#x27;ve been involved with Emacs, what areas of the Emacs landscape most interest you, and what approach you&#x27;d bring to moderation.
 If you have concerns about moderation in general, please save those for another thread. If, like myself, you are supportive but cannot yourself commit to moderating, please join me in thanking our current moderator along with those who volunteer!

I wanted to have same experience with emacs, but I don&#x27;t have above features and I would like to have them. If that helps, I&#x27;m opening ipython shell with run-python and have  (setq python-shell-interpreter &quot;ipython&quot; python-shell-interpreter-args &quot;-i --simple-prompt --InteractiveShell.display_page&#x3D;True&quot;)  inside .emacs.

                              <span>I just managed to get my emacs to have that modernistic blurred background look so I thought I&#x27;d share the result. My approach is unfortunately platform specific (requiring some modification to the wayland compositor). I&#x27;m not sure if this belongs here so sorry in advance if it doesn&#x27;t!

 EDIT:If you&#x27;re interested, you need to do 2 things:
  
Make Emacs&#x27; background transparent (for example by doing this in init.el). This is to take advantage of a feature in Plasma to blur windows that are transparent.

                              <span>Hello everyone, I am relatively new to emacs and have stumbled on a problem that has completely stumped me.
 My setup:
 I have a leader keybinding setup. I press “SPC” and which key shows the next prefix keys. I can do “SPC b” to get to buffer-specific keybindings and “SPC c” for code-specific keybindings. 
 This is achieved by having a my-leader-key-map, where “c” is bound to my-code-key-map, and “b” is bound to my-buffer-key-map. 
 “d” is bound to xref-find-definition in my-code-key-map. Thus “SPC c d” will call that command.
 What I am trying to accomplish:
  
“SPC c d” to be lsp-find-definition if and only if I am connected to lsp in that particular buffer.
 “SPC c i” to be lsp-find-implementation if the lsp supports it and I am connected to lsp in this particular buffer. Keep in mind …</span>

                              <span>I am trying to get to the bottom of a strange issue with omnisharp [1] and eglot, and I&#x27;d appreciate any pointers. The issue is documented here [2] and here [3], but I haven&#x27;t got very far with it so I thought I&#x27;d ask here. My setup is as follows:
  
Operative System: Windows 10
 LSP server: Omnisharp 1.39
 Emacs: 29.1
 Programming language: C# (csharp-mode)
  
In general, omnisharp and eglot work great, but when I choose code actions nothing seems to happen. You can see a screenshot of this as well as the JSON RPC debug log:
  
https://github.com/joaotavora/eglot/discussions/1322#discussioncomment-8711304
  
I am just trying to understand:
  
if this is an eglot issue or an omnisharp issue;
 any pointers as to additional means to figure out what is failing. I have tried debugging with edebug as well as additional logging (JSON RPC etc) but no luck.

                              <span>Hello, i&#x27;m a little new in this subreddit, i want to share with you all a little hack that makes flymake support error indicators in margins, like flychecks does.
 This allow showing flymake&#x27;s error indicators in TUI and in GUI makes it more modern with scaling better for HIDPI screens.
 The solution i&#x27;ve found is make an advice for flymake--fringe-overlay-spec function:
 (advice-add #&#x27;flymake--fringe-overlay-spec :override (lambda (bitmap &amp;optional recursed) (if (and (symbolp bitmap) (boundp bitmap) (not recursed)) (flymake--fringe-overlay-spec (symbol-value bitmap) t) (and flymake-fringe-indicator-position bitmap (propertize &quot;!&quot; &#x27;display &#x60;((margin left-margin) ,bitmap)))))) 
 The only change here is in the propertize part for use left margin instead of fringe (if you want to use the righ…</span>

                              <span>Personally I have a habit.org file that I add to and then I use org journal for a personal diary which I add single item to-dos.
 I mark things done at the end of the day and try to use org pomodoro timers if I&#x27;m on my laptop.
 I&#x27;m having some problems having a fully functional workload using orgmode and am looking for some examples of what the workflow is like day to day.
 Some of the biggest things I feel like I&#x27;m missing is visibility on other platforms. I like the idea of having my habit scorecard and schedule in my face whether on emacs, laptop, phone, watch.
 I have problems with tracking away from my laptop. I assume some use a mobile org or maybe a third party app with an open api. Only a few of my tasks a day am I going to have my laptop on hand.
 How are you using org mode for scheduling? What other tools do you use in conjunction?

                              <span>Hey guys.
 Ive used org-mode and roam for about a year now. Recently I started taking notes for a new DnD campaign, and was thinking of using the zettlekasten method with org-roam like i usually do. 
 However, once i started to think about it, It didn&#x27;t make sense to me why i cant just keep the whole campaign in one file? I know that this is not the zettlekasten idea, but how does it logically change anything? I can links to all other headings when needed to have it work like a wiki, still use org-roam-ui AND get a clearer navigation system since its in one file and i can see all the headings above a node to make mental connections on the big picture on how things are connected. 
 Am i missing something? I understand that having separate files for two completely different topics can be useful, but i can&#x27;t see it for a single topic.

 Does Obelisk use something different to target the Android NDK? Where can I learn more about that and see an overview of the architecture of an Obelisk app beyond the browser – like what renderer is used for the UI of an Android native Obelisk app?

                              <span>are there good examples of libraries or plugins that allow users to modify behavior (e.g. how typeclasses are derived) by adding annotations to values and types? An example present in other languages is annotating record fields to change how de/serialization (e.g. from/to JSON) works.

                              <span>Hi, in my work I use Scala for a Spark powered app. It&#x27;s a part of a big Spring Boot application and it&#x27;s 100% vanilla Scala, because most devs in the company use primarily Java (sometimes i rewrite their vars and imperative loops into nice flatmaps and for comprehensions).
 I&#x27;d like to find out what problems would be solved if we started to use and effect system like Cats Effect (it won&#x27;t happen, but i&#x27;d like to know what we&#x27;re missing out).
 So in my free time I&#x27;m creating a http4s program which will expose endpoints to run various transformations using Flink. 
 At first I&#x27;ve created methods without any effects (writeToIceberg in the code below) and only in the end i would wrap them in IO (writeToTarget). This is the code if you&#x27;re curious, it&#x27;s quite regular Flink code glued together fr…</span>

                              <span>I have a situation where I have several traits with each trait containing a set of methods. I have now to expose these functionalities to the external world through profiles. For example., a basic profile will be another trait, but this contains just the methods a and 2 from trait 1, methods 4 and 5 from trait 2 etc.,I can create these profiles as a new trait and repeat the method implementation, but how can I reuse the already defined methods in my trait and just create the profile traits more elegantly? For example.,
 trait InternalTrait1 { def method1(int: Int): Int def method2(int: Int): Int } trait InternalTrait2 { def method3(int: Int): Int def method4(int: Int): String } 
 I would now like to have:
 trait BasicProfile { def method2(int: Int): Int dev method4(int: Int): String } 
 I want to refer the method2 and method4 from Trait1 and Trait2 respectively. Any ideas? Self traits come to my mind, but not sure if that is a good idea?

 I am considering writing a new mode for running .NET / C# unit tests, and I thought I&#x27;d ask for some advice on how to go about it. Or, if there already is an existing mode which does what I&#x27;m after, if you could please point it out. The remainder of this post describes my requirements, what I have found out so far, and the approach I intend to take. I apologise in advance for the length of this post, but it seemed easier to lay down all the information I have thus far.
 High-Level Requirements
 My requirements are as follows:
  
the ability to see a unit test tree across all projects in a solution.
 ability to run individual tests, or nodes from the tree.
 ability to see which tests have failed and which tests have passed within the tree.
 ability to see details of the failure.

                              <span>Hello Emacs Community!,
 ​
 I just configured Forge at some Gitlab Repositories, I now can see issues related to the projects I&#x27;m in,
 Now, my team doesn&#x27;t use the issues on specific projects much, but open issues in a different Board on gitlab, which is not a project but contains all the important issues I do want to see.
 ​
 I see that I can see issues and posts on each project, but I want to see the one that is in a board, problem being that as it is not a project, it doesn&#x27;t end with .git, but /team-1/board, while a project would be /project-1.git.
 ​
 Adding the board repository will result in a wait without messages, just a Pulling wait that doesn&#x27;t seem to be pulling anything.
 ​
 Is there a way to add this board?, and even better, to have it globally?, or can I only see those PRs and issues related to the project I have added?
 ​
 Thanks!

                              <span>This is something that has bothered me for many years now, but I was always too lazy to dig in. Well, this time I&#x27;m at least not too lazy to ask:
 Is there a way to make Emacs buffer ordering be per-window and remembered separately for each window?
 The way I work is using eyebrowse to create &quot;screens&quot; or &quot;workspaces&quot; (I used escreen before eyebrowse, a long time ago). Each of these is usually further separated into windows. That means that certain buffers naturally end up &quot;belonging&quot; in certain workspaces. For example, my Clojure REPL always lives in screen 4.
 This setup is great, but the way buffer switching works doesn&#x27;t play nice with it. If I jump from screen 1 to screen 4 and back to 1, my previous buffer will be my REPL, which is not what I want. Screen 1, and more specifically, the window in that screen that I&#x27;m working in, should remember which buffers were used in it recently, so that I can use previous-buffer/next-buffer predictably.
 I think I would expect all other buffers (ones not visited in that window) to be appended at the end, as I don&#x27;t want to limit myself. I might want to switch to some of those some day.
 Does something like this exist? Is it possible at all?

                              <span>I make updates to my bib file that I have embedded, and the changes do not take effect when I refresh the preview pane (all changes within the .tex do) and even when I fully exit my emacsclient. 
 Even killing the preview buffer, re-starting emacs client, does not help. Even with using a new emacs instance it does not work. Last time to fix this, I wiped the files in the directory and re-opened the tex file (after copying them in from another place) for the bib to work.

 My current config is:

 (defun org-done-and-archive ()

 (org-archive-subtree-default)
 )))
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; 
 However, I cant get it to work along with org-log-done. The function would archive the todo item then add logbook to the next item. Can anyone help me out?

                              <span>Ultimately, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a single perfect book for getting into Haskell.
 Learn You A Haskell For Great Good is an excellent starter, especially for introducing FP concepts and the basics.
 I like Will Kurt&#x27;s Get Programming With Haskell, the explanations are very clear and visually, it&#x27;s got great design.
 Although I like the book very much, I struggle a bit with Chris Allen and Julie Moronuki&#x27;s very in-depth Haskell Programming From First Principles after the first few chapters.
 The one I&#x27;m most excited about is the one I just got. It&#x27;s Tom Schrijver&#x27;s Soar With Haskell and am finding this quite good. It covers some of the territory that Allen and Moronuki cover, but in a more accessible manner (albeit in less depth). This strikes me as a very solid intro to the language that doesn&#x27;t avoid advanced features or oversimplify.
 Curious what others think of these books.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve just switched over to ghcup and away from exclusively stack. I&#x27;m also trying to use Emacs&#x27; org-mode Babel, which is Jupyter notebook-style literate programming with more functionality than the Jupyter, IMHO. The going is not smooth getting the code blocks in the org-mode text to work, as they are run in a ghci session -- with all the restrictions such as multiple line versus single line to deal with. So when working with Haskell on org-mode, I first start a project with cabal init inside a directory, e.g., .../myproj. This will just be a skeleton, since I will throw my org-mode Babel files in this directory too. Next, I want to install Hackage packages, so I add them to the myproj.cabal build-depends section and do cabal run. Now, since org-mode&#x27;s Babel is sending my Haskell code blocks to ghci, can that ghci session see and use the packages of myproj? If I do :show paths in the ghci buffer it reports .../myproj so no need to do a :cd  Very well. But my question is, does the ghci session see, can use my included packages from the project? As I understand, packages are installed per project (ergo per directory). But is there a global way with ghcup to install a package for all projects to use? For example, if I want QuickCheck globally and not have to include it per project, is this possible? Similarly, if I want to open a ghci REPL anywhere, how can I access packages?

                              <span>I see this has been brought up in the past, but no definite solution. I&#x27;ve got a reliably failing scenario in a pretty vanilla system (emacs-mac from brew, GNU Emacs 29.1 (build 1, aarch64-apple-darwin22.5.0, Carbon Version 169 AppKit 2299.6) of 2023-08-08, current m2 mac, working through the emacs-bedrock configuration so there&#x27;s not a lot loaded).
 Essentially if I use the right click context menu, and move the pointer around said menu, I&#x27;ll get the briefly spinning and then forever frozen beachball cursor. C-g does nothing, pkill -SIGUSR2 also did nothing helpful.
 I don&#x27;t need the context menu, so I&#x27;ve removed the code in init.el that enables context-menu-mode.
 Anyone else still seeing these hangs, or have any ideas on a real solution?

                              <span>I am a long time vim user. I started using emacs about four years ago mainly for notmuch email.
 I tried evil for a while, but it had some quirks and incompatibilities with other packages, so I went back to the default key bindings.
 I find the default key bindings to just not stick with me. I keep reverting to using the cursor keys or mouse. Do the majority of folks use the default key bindings? Or do you map them to something that suites you? Or do I just need to force myself to use the default keys?
 In the various discussions I have never gotten a feel for just how wide spread evil is.
 Thanks.

                              <span>There was a recent thread about writing org mode init files where I noted that tangling an org file doesn&#x27;t fit my workflow due to several considerations I&#x27;m going to leave aside here but I like having a nicely formatted documentation file for sharing.
 Basically what I wanted was a way to postprocess my elisp files (primarily init.el but in theory any one) and generate either markdown or org that looked similar to literate programming examples that I could then publish if desired on github etc.
 I didn&#x27;t find anything that fit my scenario so I went ahead and wrote a fairly simple proto-package at
 https://github.com/benleis1/elispdoc
 I haven&#x27;t figured out publishing yet and its still in beta stage but you can clone and load-file it to try it out. Already the output is pretty enough for my purposes.
 I auto-generated the readme.md on the repo using elispdoc on itself.
 I&#x27;m hoping someone else will find this useful and I&#x27;m interested in any feedback.

                              <span>Emacs is a fantastic software that has become my swiss army knife as a pentester. The problem is that recently I&#x27;ve had a muscle issue, radiculopathy, and navigating around DWM with my current configuration is my personal hell. This is fixable with a reworked sxhkd configuration. 
 Questions regarding the issue:
 Q1: Is there a prefix key on the left side of the keyboard that can feel as smooth as firing C-x without creating any real pressure between the thumb and index finger?
 BLABLABLA: Define smooth, right? lmao... ig the same way you can glide on and off the defaults for save-buffer, or new-window-on-right. 
 Q2: Is there a way to get Emacs to use the same exact hotkey you&#x27;re using globally? 
 BLABLABLA: This is obviously the magical, superfast route, so I don&#x27;t expect a response to this question. Maybe though... a script, syntactical directive, something... 
 Answer either question at your leisure. I&#x27;m still hacking away at it myself and just wanted to delegate the task to anyone willing. C-x and M-x appear to be masterful in terms of flexibility.

                              <span>I am trying to set up my own config and want to use lsp-mode.
 I have a pretty minimal config with lsp-mode, lsp-ui, and vertico. When I open a JS file I can see diagnostic messages and hover over functions for information. When I try to type, I expect a popup to appear with suggestions from typescript-language-server as well as pieces of text from my buffer, but this does not happen.
 Do I need to install another package or set up some keybindings for this? I&#x27;m sort of confused at what consult/company/ivy/helm/vertico/etc are and where each of them fit in and want to understand this all better.

 I&#x27;m using doom with company and vertico enabled in the :completion section; I&#x27;m not sure which one is responsible.
 Has anyone seen this behaviour? Any suggestions of how I can determine which package is causing it, or even better, how to fix it? Thanks!

                              <span>i am a college student and nobody i know uses emacs, i learnt vim by watching my mentors use it but i feel emacs will be much better than vim
 i&#x27;m so bad at emacs i spent 3 days trying to change my indentations from 8 to 4 and still couldn&#x27;t manage to do it
 i tried liberachat #emacs on IRC but people aren&#x27;t much present on irc
 i wish there was a discord channel where i could talk to people who use emacs
 i have never online seen a person use emacs as his goto IDE/OS :D
 neither have i seen a person offline 
 my teacher who i really respect uses vim and says it would&#x27;ve been better if he had got hang of emacs
 i wish i don&#x27;t comfort myself with vim for too long or it would be painful switching editor to emacs
 i use tmux, vim , arch , hyprland, i3 , dwm 
 however i&#x27;ve never felt the fear of using these while starting 
 but emacs scares me as i know how much time i spent trying to learn it and it was all vain

                              <span>I would like to be able to write a bunch of functions that call company-complete and then continue doing things after I&#x27;ve selected the completion. The idea is to pretend company-complete has been called from inside a \ref.
 This is a simple example
  (defun f1 () (interactive) (insert &quot;\\ref{}&quot;) (backward-char) (company-complete) ;; now choose the completion, etc (backward-char 4) (insert &quot;i_used_to_be_a_&quot;)) 
 If the above worked, I&#x27;d be using company-completeas if it was being called from a \ref, but then I&#x27;d modify the \ref to, in this example, \i_used_to_be_a_ref.
 The problem is that the above immediately modifies \ref, but I never get to choose the completions . I&#x27;ve tried variations of the above, like call-interactively, without success. I think I am missing something very obvious (emacs lisp novice here).
 Why do I want to do this? Because I want to use company-complete for arbitrary macros in latex as if they were \ref. I can do this modifying company-reftex&#x27;s company-reftex-labels-regexp, but ideally I&#x27;d like to do it without modifying that variable, or when company-reftex is not called, for example when using LSP.

 Read on - this is not a rant but an exchange wheather I should subimt a bug report
 Using GNU Emacs 30.0.50 (build 1, x86_64-w64-mingw32), pre-built treesitter libraries version v0.12.148 from https://github.com/emacs-tree-sitter/tree-sitter-langs/releases
 When I open a prettified JSON with 17944 lines, 370 kB in size, opening takes
  
js-json-mode: 1 Second
 json-ts-mode: 10 Seconds
  
Larger files also open, but become simply unwildly to use as eg. an undo seems to completely re-parse the file in json-ts-mode, which makes operating files in that mode really cumbersome.
 So using json-ts-mode is an order of magnitude slower and I wonder if my settings are wrong, this is to be expected or if I should submit a bug report?

                              <span>I want to learn emacs as a long-time neovim user. I love the way emacs is self documented as I find it so challenging to understand/fix things myself in neovim.
 I work on a monorepo at my job - a variety of projects in different languages inside of a single git repo. I will open a tmux session in my terminal emulator and keep a window open for whatever number of the projects I&#x27;m working with on. Typically I will use an alias to open a project in a new window, open neovim, and open a vertical split with a shell for running the project.
 The thing I like about this is it&#x27;s super easy to switch between projects and they all keep whatever pane layout I have set up. I can also spawn new windows for any other work I need to do.
 I&#x27;m not really getting how I can do this in emacs. I have set up dashboard.el and projectile.el and can open a project, but I have to then open another emacs frame if I want to open another project. I would much prefer to have a little tab bar or some shortcuts to switch between projects in a single frame.
 Any guidance is appreciated!

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 We are very excited to announce Copilot 3.19 [2]. Copilot is a stream-based EDSL in Haskell for writing and monitoring embedded C programs, with an emphasis on correctness and hard realtime requirements. Copilot is typically used as a high-level runtime verification framework, and supports temporal logic (LTL, PTLTL and MTL), clocks and voting algorithms.
 Copilot is being used at NASA in drone test flights. Through the NASA tool Ogma [1] (also written in Haskell), Copilot also serves as a runtime monitoring backend for NASA&#x27;s Core Flight System, Robot Operating System (ROS2), and FPrime (the software framework used in the Mars Helicopter) applications.
 This release drastically increases the test coverage of copilot-core. We also remove deprecated functions from copilot-core…</span>

                              <span>Hi,
 I tried Neovim and VScodium as the most popular Haskell IDEs. Curiously, the problem looks exactly the same with those mostly unrelated tools: the informative part gets lost beyond hope to the right of the right margin. No status bar, no hovering, nothing. It&#x27;s hard to believe that it&#x27;s intended to be so. What do I miss?

                              <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;ve been trying out Cursor recently - it&#x27;s a fork of VSCode with AI codegen baked in.
 They do some interesting things like indexing your codebase via embeddings and then use RAG to help do contextual codegen. You can provide your own API keys as well.
 This has been by far the best AI codegen experience, IMO. I was wondering if there are any good packages that replicate similar functionality in emacs.

                              <span>I noticed my computer was running hot and discovered that emacs was using 100% CPU usage on one core. I ran the profiler and it shows ~80% usage by redisplay_internal (C function) &gt; jit-lock-function &gt; jit-lock-fontify-now &gt; jit-lock--run-functions &gt; run-hook-wrapped. I then noticed this only occurred with org files that had links to web pages. For example, I opened an org file without links and CPU usage was low, I then added a link to a webpage and CPU usage went to 100%. In case it&#x27;s relevant, I&#x27;m using doom with emacs 28.1. 
 Please let me know if you have any ideas or if there&#x27;s any other info I should provide.
 Edit: Full profiler report Also forgot to mention I&#x27;m using Linux Mint

 Is there a way to skip the intermediate variable? What I really want is:

 Ideas? The docs are pretty thin on this.

 I&#x27;ve set TERM &#x3D; xterm-256color in Windows Terminal, I&#x27;ve set it in my emacs init.el but yet whenever I check getenv TERM it returns &#x27;dumb&#x27; and doing a meta-x list-colors-display shows me 16 colours. I know the actual Windows Terminal can display 256 colours because I ran some Python to get it to display them and it worked as expected. Any idea how I can get this to work? Is it even possible? Sadly it&#x27;s a work PC so I have no option but to use Windows otherwise I&#x27;d just use Linux and be done with it.

 (&quot;1&quot; &quot;2,3&quot; &quot;4,5,6&quot;) 
 If the value of crm-separator is [ \t]*,[ \t]*, selecting the second candidate will result in the list (&quot;2&quot; &quot;3&quot;), and not (as one might have expected) (&quot;2, 3&quot;). This is not very surprising of course, and if you are building your own completion tables for use with completing-read-multiple, the problem can be avoided by keeping the value of crm-separator in mind. The problem is that sometimes the completion table is generated on the basis of input the user may have no control over. 
 For example, in mu4e there&#x27;s a function mu4e-view-save-attachments which does what the name suggests: it lists all attachments in a given message for the user to choose (possibly more than one) and then saves the selected attachments in a specific directory. If you are dealing with a message with files whose names contain a comma, selecting one of those files will lead to trouble. 
 Now, I can just define a little function that will temporarily change the value of crm-separator to handle these cases, e.g.: 
 (defun my/toggle-crm-separator () (interactive) (let ((original-separator &quot;[ \t]*,[ \t]*&quot;)) (if (string&#x3D; crm-separator original-separator) (let ((separator (completing-read &quot;Select one of the following options&quot; &#x27;(&quot;;&quot; &quot;,,&quot; &quot;-&quot;)))) (setq crm-separator (replace-regexp-in-string &quot;,&quot; separator crm-separator))) (setq crm-separator original-separator)))) 
 Still, I wonder if there&#x27;s a smarter solution out there. Off the cuff, I can imagine scanning the completion candidates to ensure none of them contain an instance of the value of crm-separator and, if they do, at least alerting the user of the need to pick a different value for crm-separator? But I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s a better way to handle this situation. 
 Thoughts?

                              <span>Greetings everyone,
 I wanted to share a function that I&#x27;ve found incredibly useful while conducting qualitative data analysis of interviews. During this type of research, structuring my interview data and maintaining a clear overview is crucial. To assist with this, I&#x27;ve developed a function in Emacs Lisp that uses tags to extract specific headlines into a new buffer.
 This function, extract-headlines-by-tag, prompts the user to enter a tag. The function then scans the entire buffer, and for each headline that contains the specified tag, it extracts not only the headline but also its content. These extracted parts are then transferred into a new buffer. I&#x27;ve made the new buffer pop up for immediate review after the extraction process.
 Here&#x27;s the piece of code:
 (defun extract-headlines-by-tag (tag) &quot;Extract headlines and their content from current buffer by TAG.&quot; (interactive &quot;sEnter tag: &quot;) (save-excursion (let ((result-buffer (generate-new-buffer (concat &quot;/Extracted Headlines &quot; tag &quot;*&quot;)))) (with-current-buffer result-buffer (org-mode) (insert &quot;* Extracted Headlines by Tag: &quot; tag &quot; *\n\n&quot;)) (org-element-map (org-element-parse-buffer) &#x27;headline (lambda (headline) (when (member tag (org-element-property :tags headline)) (with-current-buffer result-buffer (insert (org-element-interpret-data headline) &quot;\n&quot;))))) (pop-to-buffer result-buffer)))) 
 This has greatly improved the way I manage and analyze my qualitative interview data. Sharing it here in case it&#x27;s of use to anyone else in similar situations.

                              <span>I implemented a custom JSON parser for emacs. Instead of using a library which creates an intermediary JSON representation which is then converted to Lisp objects, my solution creates Lisps objects from the JSON stream without any intermediary steps.
 Measured by ~1 MB of clang LSP messages, it works ~8x faster than the current emacs JSON parser. Maybe it can be helpful for people whose LSP works slowly, as an alternative solution to emacs-lsp-booster (I didn&#x27;t do any comparisons).
 You can check out the faster-json-parsing branch here: https://github.com/geza-herman/emacs/tree/faster-json-parsing. Is it based on master, but I think it can be easily applied to any recent version of Emacs (it&#x27;s just one commit).
 This JSON parser misses some error handling, like for example it doesn&#x27;t check for utf-8 encoding errors. So please consider it as a proof of concept, not as a production quality thing. But I&#x27;ve been using it for a while, it works for me with clangd perfectly.

                              <span>Hi all!
 I have evil mode enabled in my minibuffer by setting the evil-want-minibuffer variable to true. Is there a way to rebind C-n and C-p specifically in the minibuffer? I tried remapping it using the following but it didn&#x27;t work
  (define-key minibuffer-local-map (kbd &quot;C-p&quot;) &#x27;previous-line) 
 Before I used to be able to scroll up and down through my Ivy completions using C-n and C-p but now I cant. When pulling up the minibuffer with &quot;:&quot;, those ctrl keys map to the following when no text is inputted to the minibuffer.
 Note: These keybinds actually work as intended
  C-n next-complete-history-element [2 times] C-p previous-complete-history-element [4 times] 
 When I start typing and my ivy completion comes up, the ctrl keys map to the following
  C-p evil-complete-previous [6 times] C-n evil-complete-next [3 times] 
 The C-p and C-n dont go up and down the list of items as intended, which is why i want to rebind them to the original next-line and previous-line
 Any help would be awesome. Thank you! - Queztaz
 ANSWER
 This code fixed it
  (eval-after-load &quot;evil-maps&quot; (dolist (map &#x27;(evil-motion-state-map evil-insert-state-map evil-emacs-state-map)) (define-key (eval map) &quot;\C-n&quot; nil) (define-key (eval map) &quot;\C-p&quot; nil) ))

                              <span>I&#x27;m in need of a good contract-first approach to REST services. What I would like is to be able to generate the server-side code based on Li&#x27;s https://com-lihaoyi.github.io/cask/ framework (It&#x27;s great, and good for the scala community to have lovely approachable, useful and simple platforms like his).
 I&#x27;ve made a start here:
 https://github.com/kindservices/openapi-generator 
 The additional goal is to take a slightly different approach to traditional OpenApi templates, where the team is expected to have the generated code alongside the hand-cranked code.
 This template is intended to be packaged up in a jar, which can then be brought in to a clean new project as a simple jar dependency, allowing engineers to just &quot;insert your business logic here&quot; in a simple, tiny scala-cli style app.
 ​
 The main pieces are there, but it would really benefit from some collaboration, sanity checking, and getting ready for production use.
 So - does that make sense? Is anyone interested?

                              <span>Hey everyone. We are looking for two engineers to work new long-term project in the payments area. Haskell is already giving us an edge in terms of maintainability and developer efficiency so I&#x27;m keen to meet anyone who is wanting to take a new position to work with Haskell in their day job.
 The project is still rather young, so there&#x27;s plenty of opportunities to make an impact. We&#x27;re open to having remote employees. We sponsor visas and help with relocation too. Unlike a couple years ago, we are looking for more senior engineers. That is, people who have real life experience in production systems and whose expertise goes beyond Haskell. Experience with data modelling, infrastructure or frontend programming is highly appreciated.
 I&#x27;m happy to answer any questions about the role here, but if you want to apply for the position, please use our page.
 About the company
 We are a leading, fast-growing Nordic fashion and beauty e-commerce company. You can find our headquarters in Malmö, Sweden, but we also have a few physical retail stores in the Copenhagen area. We also have development teams in Aarhus, Copenhagen, Vilnius, and Poznan. We are also running a fully automated warehouse in Ängelholm, Sweden.

                              <span>Functional programming is a very new concept to me, and all I&#x27;ve known is imperative python and some oop java. 
 I&#x27;ve played with JS/TS before, but never learnt any of the theory behind it. 
 So, what is FP? Why would you use it over OOP? 
 Everything is immutable, but what&#x27;s the benefits of that? I get that mutability implies certainty of input-&gt;output, but why does that even matter?
 If anyone can give an ELI5 or tldr, that&#x27;d be great!

                              <span>The idea of one note &#x3D; one object of attention is rocket fuel—a change in attention &#x3D; a link to a new note. The level of detail depends on the elevation of the perspective you are paying attention to. If you are studying to be a sports trainer, the details you&#x27;d view ketosis with would be different from those of a person studying contemporary art design. The trainer might have a note mentioning William Wegman, and the artist might have a note mentioning macro balancing, but neither should feel the need to do a deep dive into topics outside primary areas of exploration. That doesn&#x27;t mean notes have to be exclusive, without the flavor of life.
This object of attention was sparked from watching Bianca Pereira, Linked Knowledge Does Not Work.</span>

                              <span>The most important thing the GPT for Zettel Critique does for me is point out areas where my note (thinking) is weak (has gaps) and offer suggestions like a patient and watchful tutor. This alone is a fine-tuned game-changer. If the GPT had a persona, it would be a smart, but not snarky, it would be patient, but not hold back, it would act with my best interests in mind. The GPT doesn&#x27;t have a persona. It is a huge algorithm of &#x27;linked knowledge,&#x27; and the benefit comes from its ability to pull out appropriate threads and apply them to the case at hand.
My role in this shindig is to be honest when reviewing the critique. I dream of &quot;What Would Richard Feynman Do?&quot; Maybe I should get this tattooed on my wrist. W.W.R.F.D. This would be a great slogan to go along with zettelkasting.  Try to be responsible and not give up independence to the machine. That doesn&#x27;t mean that the GPT is wrong in its critique, it means the it should be viewed like any tutorial, describing best practices while leaving open the opportunities to think in ways that support your individual style and goals.</span>

                              <span>Three years ago, a blog post introduced destination-passing style (DPS) programming in Haskell, focusing on array processing, for which the API was made safe thanks to Linear Haskell. Today, I’ll present a slightly different API to manipulate arbitrary data types in a DPS fashion, and show why it can be useful for some parts of your programs.
The present blog post is mostly based on my recent paper Destination-passing style programming: a Haskell implementation, published at JFLA 2024. It assumes basic knowledge of Linear Haskell and intermediate fluency in Haskell.

                              <span>Summary:
 I&#x27;ve encountered code that mixes the infix and non-infix (DSL style?) syntaxes. It is sufficiently abstract that despite 13 years of Scala experience, I cannot mentally parse and understand it. And that is even after unsuccessfully attempting to refactor it into a consistent infix style manually.
 What resources, if any, exist to transform an existing snippet of Scala source code such that it reformats it into a consistent infix style? And then enables reformatting it to a consistent non-infix (DSL style?)?
 Details:
 I&#x27;ve been using Scala since 2011. I come from a strong OOP background (Eiffel, Delphi, C++, Java, etc.), meaning that learning FP has been a bit of a cognitive dissonance over the years. That said, I have persisted and have mostly wrapped my head around FP in Scala.…</span>

                              <span>So my first instinct when I have some notes to take is to fire up notepad++, despite having used emacs for 20 years. I&#x27;ve never liked using emacs for plain text; it&#x27;s always felt like a code editor only to me. 
 I&#x27;d kind of like to use it for more text things, but one thing that I&#x27;m not sure how to do is maybe fire up a frame that only has access to txt/org files and won&#x27;t be cross-contaminated by all the code buffers I have open. Is there a good way to have a frame/window be dedicated to a type of file?

                              <span>The query syntax varies between the function treesit-query-capture and the inbuilt tree-sitter-query-builder in Emacs 29 Let&#x27;s take this JavaScript code example: js console.log(); console.info(); hello.world();  I want to find only the call expression for console.log My query for treesit-query-capture is: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;lisp ((call_expression function: (member_expression object: (identifier) @call.object (:match &quot;console&quot; @call.object) property: (property_identifier) @call.property (:match &quot;log&quot; @call.property) )) @call )
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 But in the query builder buffer my query looks like this: lisp ((call_expression function: (member_expression object: (identifier) @call.object property: (property_identifier) @call.property)) @call (#match? @call.object &quot;console&quot;) (#match? @call.property &quot;log&quot;) )  The query builder works perfect, since it highlights only one node but the function returns me more than one node, it is returning all the console calls

                              <span>Hi,
 In projectile or emacs&#x27;s project.el, is there a way to support a project consisting of disjoint folders? i.e. folders without common parents? Or a way to exclude folders that I don&#x27;t want to be included?
 ​
 Thanks

                              <span>When I run emacs (GNU Emacs 26.1 (build 1, x86_64-redhat-linux-gnu, GTK+ Version 3.22.30)), I get a bunch of warnings like this:
  
(emacs:870588): Gtk-WARNING **: 17:46:44.937: Theme parsing error: gtk.css:978:50: Missing closing bracket for :not()
  
I do have a gtk.css file in .config/gtk-3.0, but it just imports a colors.css file - and that file just calls @define-color a bunch of times. And I tried commenting out the import - didn&#x27;t help.
 The default theme seems to be HighContrast, so I checked its gtk-3.0/gtk.css and there&#x27;s nothing it in. Could the problem being coming from another theme?
 It&#x27;s not a huge problem, but these warnings fill up my terminal. I can keep two terminals open to the same directory so I can see what I&#x27;m doing, but I was wondering if there&#x27;s any way to suppress this stuff.
 Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve tried:
  
I got rid of my .emacs file.
 I created a configuration file (~/.emacs.d/early-init.el) containing:
  
 (setq warning-minimum-level :emergency) 
 (setq warning-minimum-log-level :emergency) 
 (load-theme &#x27;leuven&#x27; t)
  
The theme takes effect, but the warnings are still there. Is there a global location that could be overriding my configuration? I got pissed and sent the warnings to /dev/null, but that means I can&#x27;t see any warnings at all - so not the best solution. Any better suggestions?

                              <span>A while back I installed Haskell using stack. I seemed to have a system-wide install that has ghc as version 9.0.2 from a terminal prompt in any directory. Then I created projects with
 stack new projname stack setup stack build 
 So I just installed ghcup according to the instructions and did ghcup tui where I chose ghc 9.4.8. But now ghc --version reports 9.0.2 -- as if it doesn&#x27;t know about my ghcup choice. I do ghcup set ghc 9.4.8 -- and again ghc --version still gives 9.0.2. I fear I&#x27;m messing things up. How can I get my Haskell world totally into ghcup and out of stack? The ghcup set ghc did say /usr/bin/ghc is &quot;shadowing&quot; and I should remove it. Will this solve this issue entirely, or is my previous stack world going to linger and cause more problems? I see in /usr/bin a cabal and cabal --version and which cabal yields, yes, /usr/bin/cabal and this not the ghcup cabal. Remove it too? What else?

                              <span>Hi,
 This is an old story, once solved with {-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}
 Now I&#x27;ve got two errors:
 167 | strp path &#x3D; T.unpack $ fromRight &quot;&quot; (FPS.toText path)
 187 | Just ext -&gt; (T.unpack $ T.toUpper ext)
 https://github.com/Tyrn/dahastes/blob/master/src/Lib.hs
 Once it was ghc 8.x, now it&#x27;s 9.4.8. What could be the cause of the error?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve made this repository which was supposed to try out the parallel library, but using parallelism in Haskell, just in general, seems to not work any more. It&#x27;s no longer faster than just using a single thread. I&#x27;ve tried monitoring multi-threaded Haskell programs using htop, and I think the problem is that they&#x27;re not using the setpriority system call to get a high enough priority. 
 ​
 I can&#x27;t find any information on how to set the thread priority for the latest version of ghc (9.8.2), and I still haven&#x27;t gotten a follow up on any bug reports I&#x27;ve made.

So if I do a list-packages and don&#x27;t see it offered to install, but I notice it&#x27;s listed below in the dependency section, that means it is already installed, ready to use, and I won&#x27;t see offered in the available section, correct? I test out ht and it seems to work fine. So what is this mechanism with dependencies? I don&#x27;t remember installing ht, but I&#x27;ve got it -- as a dependency.

                              <span>In orgmode, I am using org-id to create a CUSTOM_ID property in each org headline.
 For example:
  
* Test Headline 
 :PROPERTIES: 
 :CUSTOM_ID: id-3d58ec46-5e2a-4453-bf10-41f8b2767afc 
 :CREATED: [2024-03-04 14:31:14] 
 :END:
  
​
 When I go to do an internal link somewhere, I need it to be:
  
[[#id-3d58ec46-5e2a-4453-bf10-41f8b2767afc][Test Headline]]
  
​
 I would like a function to call that could create that link from an org headline that I could yank (paste) elsewhere in the file.
 ​
 Additionally, if possible, I would like to learn how I would figure this out on my own for future ideas.

 /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs -q -batch --eval (&quot;require &#x27;em-script)&quot; --eval &quot;(catch &#x27;eshell-replace-command (eshell-source-file \&quot;t.es\&quot; &#x27;() t))&quot; 
 but none of them run and print to stdout. I figure there must be a way to do this but it&#x27;s surprisingly difficult (I found an old post from another account but it wasn&#x27;t quite there either).

                              <span>I created an emacs extension named org-linker that allows users to link a file in org-mode (the attachment is identified as a UUID), offering a secure and flexible method for referring to other files in org-mode. Try it out!
 Comparison with org-attach
 org-linker differs from org-attach in its approach to file attachment. 
 org-attach uses an org heading as a basic storing unit, which can lead to issues if not managed carefully (e.g. refiling or adding shadowing subtrees). 
 On the other hand, org-linker assigns a unique UUID to each attached file, ensuring a more robust linkage system. By treating individual files as the fundamental unit, org-linker provides a safer and more flexible approach to handling attachments in org-mode documents. For example, this allows easy movement and copying of links across various org files and headings.
 Both tools have their strengths and are suitable for different use cases. However, if you prioritize a secure and straightforward attachment system, org-linker might be the preferred choice.
 Example
 For instance, if the root is /tmp/org-linker/, and the UUID for the transaction is 20240101-235959, and the file is readme.md, the file will be copied to /tmp/org-linker/20240101-235959/readme.md with the transaction recorded in /tmp/org-linker/db.tx. And an org-link [[linker:20240101-235959/readme.md]] is inserted at point.
 You can customize the uuid generator. In particular, you don&#x27;t have to use timestamp.
 You can also remove the uuid easily by fuzzy searching with M-x org-linker/trash-folder-uuid, or just remove the uuid at point with M-x org-linker/trash-folder-at-point. The trashing function is customizable too.

 There is quick way to switch to a todo/agenda view, maybe of multiple files?
 ​
 thanks

                              <span>I know it is natively possible to save the folded state of each sub-tree. Is there any elisp snippet or package that can help achieving that?
 I am asking about a snippet/package because simply having the property :VISIBILITY: folded&#x60; as described in the org-manual, like below, does not work for me. When I re-open the file, all sub-trees are unfolded.:
 * Main ** A - Level 1 *** A - level 2 :properties: :VISIBILITY: folded :end: Lorem ipsum ** B - level 1 *** B - level 2 :properties: :VISIBILITY: folded :end: Lorem ipsum ** C 
 I need to save the folded state in the file itself, using the VISIBILITY property, so that every time I open that file all subfolders have the desired folded/unfolded state.
 It must be something very simple which I am overlooking, any pointers, please?
  
 Edit: wording

                              <span>I am trying to refactor some of my old code with type parameter and can&#x27;t come up with a clean approach. Any suggestion is appreciated.
 ​
 I have two methods like following
 def doSomething(input: model1): model2 &#x3D; {
 ......
 }
 ​
 def doSomething2(input: model3): model4 &#x3D; {
 ....
 }
 ​
 doSomething() and doSomething2() are doing the same thing. So, i thought of passing the type as parameter and came up with the following
 ​
 def doSomethingGood[A, B] (input: A): B &#x3D; {
 ...
 return value.asInstanceOf[B] //---&gt;Is this good?
 }
 Now the issue is i have to cast the return value to B, is this good practice? Is there any better way to refactor it?

                              <span>Hello scala community! Basically the question in the title. We have a webapp that is implemented with finagle. Json is handled with Jackson. What are some of the benefits that we could have by moving to the typelevel ecosystem: http4s, cats-effect and circe. Also, what are some inconveniences that might come with such migration. Thanks!

                              <span>Since I couldn&#x27;t find any obvious online resources for this issue I thought I&#x27;d write a small post.
 I&#x27;ve been experimenting with turning on mouse mode when using emacs in the terminal via
 (unless window-live system (require &#x27;mouse) (xterm-mouse-mode t) (defun track-mouse (e)) (setq mouse-sel-mode t)) 
 This has some side effects that mess with cutting via the system command-c combination since the mouse selections are managed by emacs rather than my terminal, iterm2. I can live with that but I wanted some kill-ring / system clipboard integration since I do frequently want to cut text from inside emacs and paste outside of it in another app. So I added some advice to do that 
 ​
 ;; Advice to the kill functions that also copies the last kill ring entry to ;; the system clipboard. ;; This is called after the copy so we can ignore parameters. (defun pbcopy-region-filter (begin end &amp;optional region) (let* ((text (current-kill 0)) (process-connection-type nil) (proc (start-process &quot;pbcopy&quot; &quot;*Messages*&quot; &quot;pbcopy&quot;))) (process-send-string proc text) (process-send-eof proc))) ;; For terminal mode add advice to copy to clipboard (unless window-system (advice-add &#x27;kill-region :after #&#x27;pbcopy-region-filter) (advice-add &#x27;kill-ring-save :after #&#x27;pbcopy-region-filter))

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to set up Emacs on my personal computer in the same way it&#x27;s configured at my office, and I was surprised by how copying my init file from one to the other didn&#x27;t set up my font faces as I wanted.
 Turns out there&#x27;s a different set of colors available on each, even though both are running with xterm-256color. Doing list-colors-display in one gives the list of X11 color names that I expect -- 556 of them -- and in the other there&#x27;s a list of only 256 colors, the 16 ANSI terminal colors followed by colors numbered 16 to 256.
 I can&#x27;t find any documentation about this list of numbered colors anywhere, where is it coming from?

                              <span>I&#x27;m using latest master emacs with treesit support, ts-auto etc. So when I load a .cpp file it&#x27;s in c++-ts-mode. All good so far, but I notice none of my custom C++ snippets load anymore, because they&#x27;re in snippets/c++-mode. Is anyone working on solving that?
 It seems to me, from a user perspective, that the c++-mode/c++-ts-mode split is causing a lot of headaches. It may be solving some that I don&#x27;t know about, but it is frustrating sometimes.

 I am also open to methods to accomplish this other than adding an entry to my display-buffer-alist.

                              <span>Hi Experts
 Maybe I am not asking the right question, but please bear with me...
 Lets say i created an org document in which i used different org source blocks like shell, python, lisp ... and finally i get the data ... 
 How do finally wrap everything up in an interactive function, like i call that function and the whole org document is evaluated and gives me result 
 Is it even possible to achieve that?
 TIA.

                              <span>I&#x27;m on FreeBSD and have gotten suspend and resume working. Everything looks fine if I leave emacs open between suspend and resume, but if I restart emacs after resume, the fonts look like the standard unconfigured xterm-like font.
 Everything else renders fonts correctly. I have checked via M-x describe-fontset and it seems to be my font: Fontset: -PfEd-DejaVu Sans Mono-regular-normal-normal-*-16-*-*-*-m-0-fontset-auto2.
 What&#x27;s weird is this is after restarting emacs, so it&#x27;s something surviving in the system between restarts. Rebooting my laptop resolves the issue.
 Any ideas where to look to debug this?

                              <span>For using languages like python or julia, there are options like ob-ipython and ob-julia, which should interact with the REPLs directly. On the other hand, there is emacs-jupyter, which provides an interface with Jupyter, which also allows us to use like python.
 My question is: What is the benefit of emacs-jupyter for lang like python, when using org-babel? I think ob-python has provided the same functionalities.

                              <span>Hello, I am here to solve some doubts about &quot;Solarized Dark&quot; theme.
 I am considering these 2 versions:
 - Solarized-Dark 
 - Doom-Solarized-Dark
 ​
 I have these questions:
  
Is &quot;Doom-Solarized-Dark&quot; supposed to be better than the ordinary &quot;Solarized-Dark&quot; ? I would like to use the most complete theme and the one that supports more extensions. I don&#x27;t use Doom Emacs but that&#x27;s not an impediment to use the doom-solarized-dark theme. Which one is better and which one would you recommend me to use ?
 Solarized theme is a legendary theme, however it seems that has some flaws in its design (at least under my eyes). It is also true that I am not an expert in the topic. I am referring specifically to the fact that, talking about syntax highlighting, there is no color for strings (Font Lock String Face). That is, color for strings and foreground is exactly the same. Does it have any logical explanation ? Is it a flaw at a design level that needs to be improved ?
  
Thank you in advance for your help.

                              <span>The magit package available on the nongnu elpa is v3.3.0 (https://elpa.nongnu.org/nongnu/magit.html), which requires transient 0.3.6. The stock transient that comes with Emacs 29.2 has the version 0.4.3.
 When magit 3.3.0 is installed, either from nongnu archive or directly from its tar file, it will pull down the latest 0.5.3 from the elpa archive.
 Is there a way to let magit not install transient 0.5.3 but use the built-in 0.4.3, which should satisfy the dependency requirement ?
 Edit: another package, transient-dwim, shows the same issue by pulling the latest transient even though this 2022-year package specifies transient 0.1 as its dependency.
 Solution:
 A temporary workaround until the bug reported by u/nv-elisp is fixed. Put this in init.el:
 (add-to-list &#x27;package--builtin-versions &#x27;(transient 0 4 3)) 
 Hope this is helpful and many thanks to all the people who chimed in!

                              <span>Hi!! I have been working as a Fullstack Dev for al most 2 years and, for most of my daily working routine I have been using VsCode. I am a Linux fan, but... During my studies I started with atom and finally moved to VsCode, using vi/vim/nano/fish/tmux for server managing and quick file modifications.
 I imagine that moving all my dev working routine from VsCode to Emacs is going to be... Hard, specially for the first days but this is the way my future working routine is going to be so... I am really excited and affraid to. I have a few tutorial from YouTube marked as &quot;to watch&quot; but I would like to have your personal experience feedback and your opinion for the usual question: why should I use emacs instead of, for example, VsCode?

 [ As part of 3.0.0-dev, we fixed an issue where a C-u prefix argument was needed to select a silo. ]
 I am aware that the top two functions currently still need the C-u prefix fix to correctly let you select silos (since I&#x27;m still on denote 2.2.4) Aside from this, I&#x27;m still running into two problems:
  
whenever i enter my silo in dired it always prompts me about the local variables list in my silo or .dir-locals.el containing values that may not be safe (*) and asking me to perform the action of ignoring it or applying the local variable list. But even after i choose the ! to permanetly mark these values as safe, the effect only lasts for that session and the next time I start up emacs and dired into that directory, it ends up asking me again.
 the three denote-silo-extras functions (aside from the C-u prefix issue on 2.2.4 which will be fixed in 3.0), all three of these functions when used don&#x27;t seem to pick up on my silo&#x27;s local variable denote-known-keywords for the silos when i execute the functions - they just show my normal global denote-known-keywords. They only seem to work when I manually dired into the silo directory first and then execute the functions while physically in the silo.
  
​
 ;;; Directory Local Variables. For more information evaluate: ;;; ;;; (info &quot;(emacs) Directory Variables&quot;) ((nil . ((denote-directory . &quot;~/Documents/recipes/&quot;) (denote-known-keywords . (&quot;french&quot; &quot;italian&quot; &quot;american&quot; &quot;mexican&quot; &quot;chinese&quot; &quot;japanese&quot; &quot;korean&quot; &quot;thai&quot;)) (denote-infer-keywords . nil)))) 
 Anyone encountering these problems?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve just released a compiler plugin that allows for auto-instrumenting an application for emitting open telemetry traces based on user configured rules. It relies on the wonderful hs-opentelemetry project by Ian Duncan for all open telemetry functionality.
  
github
 hackage
  
This is being used in production at my work and has provided useful insights around performance bottlenecks, exception context, and overall visibility into code execution.
 The plugin makes it so that you do not need to manually insert instrumentation code into function definitions, improving maintainability and reducing noise. By defining rules in a config file, you can specify which functions to instrument based on their return type or constraint context. This gives you control over whether you want the blanket approach of targeting your application&#x27;s primary monad/constraint or a more conservative approach of defining a type that explicitly indicates that it will be instrumented.
 A MonadUnliftIO instance must be available for a function to be instrumentable. In particular, pure functions are not eligible.

 About month ago I updated ghc to 9.6.4 and all related packages, such as HSL, cabal and so on.
 And now HSL behaves strange in tandem emacs&#x27; eglot.
 For example: I&#x27;ve created test project, made a mistake in a file and ran HSL in the directory where I did mistake. And that&#x27;s what it shows:

 Also, I created another project and ran there too and it showed me mistake, however on the next run, it started showing the same error
 How to fix that? I&#x27;ll appreciate any hints or something

                              <span>Hi, I freshly installed my PC with Ubuntu 22.04 and I want to set up a dev environment for Haskell.
 I run the curl command to install ghcup and let install everything including hls.
 Then I run stack new hello to build a neu project. The first thing I noticed is that another GHC version was installed.
 [GHCup-00130] The version 9.6.4 of the tool ghc is not installed.
 It installes GHC 9.6.4, which is neither recommended nor hls-powered
 It also installes HLS 
 If I run stack build I get the next error
 ghc-9.6.4: \gcc&#x27; failed in phase &#x60;Linker&#x27;. (Exit code: 1)&#x60;
 And if I open the project in VSCode (with the Haskell extension) I also get errors
 I had trouble figuring out the exact GHC version for the project. Falling back to using &#x27;ghc&#x27;.
 Failed to find the GHC version of this Stack project. Error when calling stack --stack-yaml /home/markus/dev/haskell/hello/stack.yaml setup --silent
 What went wrong? Did I miss some steps while installation? Do I need to install something additional on the OS?
 seems that I needed some packages. I installed these, But stack still wants to install a newer version of ghc. Does that matter?

Saving my org file generates the toc with links formatted like this: - [[#introduction][Introduction]] ; can I get it to simply make the link [[Introduction]]?

 Thanks!

                              <span>Dear Zettlers,
you might have heard it: ChatGPT challenged me and my honour. Let&#x27;s see if I can keep it, or bow down in shame.
Here is a 100% authenticated record of a conversation I had yesterday (what a coincidence):

  
LUHMANN: What is best in life?


See this thread for full context: https://forum.zettelkasten.de/discussion/2837/gpt4-zettel-critique-assistant-robo-zettel-feedback
The idea is to compare the feedback of ChatGPT and me. So, we need notes. 2--3 are enough. The content needs to be accessible to me. So, I cannot deal with mathematical content software code. Also: Really intricate details in specific domains might be out of reach. However, I have broad knowledge in the basics of most domains. So, just give it a try.
Please, submit notes for this battle.
Live long and prosper

 This loaded on startup in the warning screen as soon as I downloaded doom (before I changed anything to the init or downloaded any packages). I tried adding the following to packages.el and my config.el respectively:

                              <span>A couple of days back I made a post here asking how I can replicate my Emacs configuration for Front-end web dev in case I have to use a new computer. Some asked me to share my configuration.
 I installed the following packages from MELPA:
  
Company
 Emmet-mode
 lsp-mode
 web-mode
 yasnippet
  
I added these lines to my .emacs:
 ​
 (require &#x27;web-mode) (add-to-list &#x27;auto-mode-alist &#x27;(&quot;\\.html?\\&#x27;&quot; . web-mode)) (add-to-list &#x27;auto-mode-alist &#x27;(&quot;\\.css\\&#x27;&quot; . web-mode)) (add-to-list &#x27;auto-mode-alist &#x27;(&quot;\\.phtml\\&#x27;&quot; . web-mode)) (add-to-list &#x27;auto-mode-alist &#x27;(&quot;\\.tpl\\.php\\&#x27;&quot; . web-mode)) (add-to-list &#x27;auto-mode-alist &#x27;(&quot;\\.[agj]sp\\&#x27;&quot; . web-mode)) (add-to-list &#x27;auto-mode-alist &#x27;(&quot;\\.as[cp]x\\&#x27;&quot; . web-mode)) (add-to-list &#x27;auto-mode-alist &#x27;(&quot;\\.erb\\&#x27;&quot; . web-mode)) (add-to-list &#x27;auto-mode-alist &#x27;(&quot;\\.mustache\\&#x27;&quot; . web-mode)) (add-to-list &#x27;auto-mode-alist &#x27;(&quot;\\.djhtml\\&#x27;&quot; . web-mode)) (defun my-web-mode-hook () &quot;Hooks for Web mode.&quot; (setq web-mode-markup-indent-offset 2) (setq web-mode-css-indent-offset 2) (setq web-mode-code-indent-offset 2) ) (add-hook &#x27;web-mode-hook &#x27;my-web-mode-hook) (require &#x27;emmet-mode) (add-hook &#x27;web-mode-hook &#x27;emmet-mode) ;; Auto-start when the web-mode starts (add-hook &#x27;emmet-mode-hook (lambda () (setq emmet-indent-after-insert nil))) (add-hook &#x27;emmet-mode-hook (lambda () (setq emmet-indentation 2))) ;; indent 2 spaces. (require &#x27;lsp-mode) (add-hook &#x27;web-mode-hook #&#x27;lsp-deferred) 
 I installed VSCodes&#x27;s language servers by running this command on the terminal:
 npm install -g vscode-langservers-extracted 
 I added the directory (where the language server was installed) to my PATH variable.
 That&#x27;s all. This config provides me with HTML/CSS autocomplete, autoclosing HTML tags and syntax checking CSS syntax.
 Any tips/opinions would be appreciated. I have not yet been able to get syntax checking of HTML, like what VSCode does (highlighting misspelled tags in red)

 Anyone had the same experience and know how to fix it? Or maybe where I should report a bug?

                              <span>Hi,
 In python it is possible to create a class that inherits a slew of methods and properties, how can I make these visible in emacs?
 People often mention speedbar,occur or imenu, but these only deal with the structure present in the current buffer. I need a way to see the entire resulting object and all of its methods and properties.
 I have been looking for a solution to this for a minute now and all I have right now is to open a python shell, import the class and do ´´dir(MyClass)´ and parse this.
 ECB is broken for emacs29, pyreverse breaks on our codebase and many people here mention just using a jump-to-definition type of function, which I consider to be only better than poking in the dark by having a cigarette lighter on you.
 Is it possible at all in emacs? 
 ​
 thx,

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been trying to get org-noter to work as demonstrated in this video by its maintainer. Here is a minimal init.el:
 (require &#x27;package) (setq package-archives &#x27;((&quot;elpa&quot; . &quot;https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/&quot;) (&quot;melpa&quot; . &quot;https://melpa.org/packages/&quot;) (&quot;org&quot; . &quot;https://orgmode.org/elpa/&quot;))) (package-initialize) (unless package-archive-contents (package-refresh-contents)) (unless (package-installed-p &#x27;use-package) (package-install &#x27;use-package)) (require &#x27;use-package) (setq use-package-always-ensure t) (use-package org :mode (&quot;\\.org\\&#x27;&quot; . org-mode)) (use-package pdf-tools) (pdf-tools-install) (use-package org-noter) 
 But unlike in the video (timestamp1 timestamp2), my pdf-buffer does not highlight passages in the pdf that have annotations. Things I have tried to no avail:
  
looking into the the maintainer&#x27;s emacs configuration, but nothing springs to my eye there.
 playing around with org-noter-highlight-selected-text as mentioned in this solved issue
 installing packages such as org-pdftools
  
Does anybody have an init.el with an org-noter setup that highlights pdfs, which they would be willing to share with me?

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently using protobuf-mode (https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/main/editors/protobuf-mode.el) and I want to solve some highlighting issues. I&#x27;m new to this so excuse me if my description is not accurate.
 The problem I have is with the following statement:
  syntax &#x3D; &quot;proto3&quot;; 
 Even though, in the mode, syntax is declared as a keyword (c-other-decl-kwds) it is not highlighted. My guess is that it is not declared in the right category because syntax &#x3D; &quot;proto3&quot;; is considered as an assignment in C/C++.
 Can anyone point me to the documentation to highlight syntax in this case but only if its followed by &#x3D; &quot;proto3&quot;;? Also, I&#x27;d like to highlight in the same color as import if possible, is there a way to change the color?

                              <span>I have been thinking about how to build a distributed database and it seem like a reasonable idea, may be terrible, to store all data and relations in a distributed map. However, I have only seen information on distributed hash maps and not maps that group related data to a node or group of close nodes. Does something like this exist?
 If not, would a key comprised of group id, table id, time, and data hash organize the data in the map so that table queries could still run quickly and not have to search all machines for the randomly distributed records.
 Also, I am intending this to be distributed across less than a hundred nodes, not thousands.

And sometimes, a conversation sparks a magical moment where we can dive into an idea worth exploring. We&#x27;d love to hear more from you.  🫵🏼
Ideas I&#x27;m exploring with my ZK:
A mindset that revolves around the organization and clarity of thought processes in note-making. How notes are proxies for ideas, and if I want clarity in my ideas, I need clarity in my notes.
Again, with the mindset. Having a mindset that matches the challenge is the key to flourishing.

                              <span>This version brings some minor enhancements to Iron&#x27;s internals and API as well as support for another library: Borer.
 Main changes
 First order types support
 Iron now provides refinement methods for first order types:
 List(1, 2, 3).refineAllOption[Positive] //Some(List(1, 2, 3)): List[Int :| Positive] List(-1, 2, 3).refineAllOption[Positive] //None 
 Such methods exist for:
  
Imperative (refine/refineUnsafe)
 Option
 Either
 &quot;Further&quot; equivalents
  
Borer support
 Iron now supports Borer&#x27;s codec derivation:
 type Username &#x3D; String :| DescribedAs[Not[Blank], &quot;Username must not be blank&quot;] type Age &#x3D; Int :| DescribedAs[Positive, &quot;Age must be positive&quot;] case class User(name: String :| Not[Blank], age: Int :| Positive) derives Codec Json.decode(&quot;&quot;&quot;{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;hey&quot;,&quot;age&quot;:25}&quot;&quot;&quot;.getBytes).to[User] //Right(...) Json.decode(&quot;&quot;&quot;{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;age&quot;:25}&quot;&quot;&quot;.getBytes).to[User] //Left(ValidationFailure(&quot;Username must not be blank&quot;)) 
 Other changes
  
Gen/Arbitrary instances for types such as List[Int :| Positive] will not fail anymore, even for big sizes.
 refine is now deprecated in favor of refineUnsafe
 Upgraded doobie dependency to 1.0.0-RC5
 Minor changes to existing documentation
  
Adopters
 Marss was added to the list of adopters.

 ​
 title, I am working in a django repo and most classes have inheritances sometimes 8 levels deep and it is as good as impossible for me to have an understanding of what this class at point is capable of.
 ​
 thx

                              <span>AUCTeX (Emacs modes for LaTeX documents) adds metadata to the end of LaTeX files like this:
 %%% Local Variables: %%% TeX-master: &quot;master&quot; %%% End: 
 I&#x27;m slightly bothered by this. How portable is this syntax when the same LaTeX file is opened by a different IDE, such as VSCode, TeXLive or (cloud-based) Overleaf? This is a concern when collaborating with others on editing a LaTeX file.
 Is it possible for the original LaTeX file to be untouched, while saving the &quot;local variable&quot; information in a different place for AUCTeX to access?

                              <span>For quite some time I&#x27;ve had electric-pair-inhibit-predicate set to electric-pair-conservative-inhibit, which prevents the automatic insertion of closing delimiters in certain situations—even when electric-pair-mode is active.
 Recently I tried to get to the bottom of what this actually does, in case I wanted to further tweak its behavior. Unfortunately, I&#x27;ve found myself a little confused by some small things.
 The documentation for electric-pair-inhibit-predicate states
  
The function is called with a single char (the opening char just inserted). If it returns non-nil, then electric-pair-mode will not insert a matching closer.
  
The source code for electric-pair-conservative-inhibit is
 (defun electric-pair-conservative-inhibit (char) (or ;; I find it more often preferable not to pair when the ;; same char is next. (eq char (char-after)) ;; Don&#x27;t pair up when we insert the second of &quot;&quot; or of ((. (and (eq char (char-before)) (eq char (char-before (1- (point))))) ;; I also find it often preferable not to pair next to a word. (eq (char-syntax (following-char)) ?w))) 
 I find this code a little confusing and am left with a few small questions.
  
Is there any difference between calling (char-after) and (following-char) in the context of this function?
 
Inside the and, why is it tested that char is equal to (char-before)? If char was just inserted, then I would imagine that this will just always be true.

 But still EGLOT never managed to be able to connect to it,
 until
 For Python, I just installed pylsp, changed my config to use it, and suddenly EGLOT was able to connect! prompting both servers, I chose pylsp and it works well, and even has the module functions when you import them in the popup. I shutdown the server and chose the pyright option and was disconnected after connecting (RIP).
 I did the same thing for clangd and installed a newer version of it, likewise, EGLOT managed to conenct.
 Moral of the story? Update your LSP&#x27;s or just install a different one? :P
 I just need to get external libraries for C to be recognised by Company and then I&#x27;m good.

                              <span>In order to improve my geek chops I have obtained a compact keyboard with no function, arrow keys and PageUp/PageUp/Home group and the going is getting tough, but I&#x27;m sure I will get there.
 One of my problems now in Emacs is to navigate up and down the M-x list which usually involves the up and down arrow keys. Those keys are available by using the function key in combination with the others, and also with the help of the mouse in GUI programs like this browser, but that is CHEATING.
 What are the native Emacs keys for that?
 Are there some cheatsheets that can help with these keyboards, for both regular emacs and evil-mode?
 I&#x27;m mostly an evil person, but having to switch to normal mode to navigate makes learning those Emacs key combinations worthwhile.

                              <span>This has been a problem for me ever since I started using it. I press C-c C-w for example, and it says it&#x27;s not defined. I have to switch to the treemacs window first before I can do that.
 In some rare cases, even when I click on the Treemacs window, it&#x27;s not actually active. I wasn&#x27;t able to reproduce this.
 I can&#x27;t seem to be able to remember which window I&#x27;m actually on since I keep switching between them often I keep forgetting to check the statusbar to verify which window is actually active. Even when I&#x27;m trying to write code, sometimes I forget whether I&#x27;m in Insert or Normal mode and there seems to be some other mode sometimes that I can&#x27;t get out of and when I type ESC, it takes that as part of a new macro. After trying it frustratingly, I manage to get back to the mode where I can actually start typing.
 Even having to check the statusbar every time before I need to do something does not seem correct to me. Is this what everybody does or am I missing something fundamental?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve started experimenting with the javascript framework Astro. 
 Astro templates have their own file extension: .astro.
 Unsurprisingly, by default emacs doesn&#x27;t know anything .astro files. 
 I can load web-mode for .astro files.
 .asto files seem to combine css and js.
 This would seem to make it suitable to use with web-mode.
 This seems to give me syntax highlighting and indentation. 
 It&#x27;d be great to get completions. 
 Over the last few months I&#x27;ve been using lsp-mode for completions.
 But because my lisp knowledge is limited, I&#x27;m reliant on finding snippets online for configuring lsp-mode.
 Do any emacs&#x27;ers here use astro?
 If so, what does your configuration look like?

                              <span>Hello,
 I&#x27;m struggling with setting up an org-roam capture template that adds notes to a single, pre-defined file as org-mode headers instead of saving each note as a separate file.
 ​
 The following tests write the note into a file of my choosing, but the properties drawer with the ID is placed at the top of the file, not under the created header.
 Test 1:
 (add-to-list &#x27;org-roam-capture-templates &#x27;(&quot;a&quot; &quot;test&quot; entry &quot;* ${title}&quot; :if-new (file &quot;/mypath/myfile.org&quot;))) 
 ​
 Test 2:
 (add-to-list &#x27;org-roam-capture-templates &#x27;(&quot;a&quot; &quot;test&quot; entry &quot;* ${title}&quot; :if-new (file+head &quot;/mypath/myfile.org&quot; &quot;#+title: ${title}\n&quot;))) 
 ​
 Test 3:
 (add-to-list &#x27;org-roam-capture-templates &#x27;(&quot;a&quot; &quot;test&quot; plain &quot;* ${title}&quot; :if-new (file+head &quot;/mypath/myfile.org&quot; &quot;#+title: ${title}\n&quot;))) 
 ​
 This test is adapted from https://systemcrafters.net/build-a-second-brain-in-emacs/keep-a-journal/ and will create a header with the properties drawer + ID - but that will always stay the top header of the file. Subsequent captures are placed within the same file but without property drawer and ID:
 (add-to-list &#x27;org-roam-capture-templates &#x27;(&quot;a&quot; &quot;test&quot; plain &quot;* ${title}&quot; :if-new (file+head+olp &quot;/mypath/myfile.org&quot; &quot;#+title: ${title}\n&quot; (&quot;${title}&quot;)))) 
 ​
 I&#x27;m currently making things work using regular org-mode capture templates. But I&#x27;d rather use org-roam capture templates so I can create new notes on the fly when searching for notes and finding they don&#x27;t exist yet.
 ​
 Any ideas what else I can try to get this to work?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been attempting The One Billion Row Challenge in Haskell and my current solution is embarrassingly slow, taking roughly 6m15s. I&#x27;m still trying to eke out single-threaded performance for now, and I&#x27;m constraining myself to GHC boot packages (although I think &#x60;async&#x60; and &#x60;parallel&#x60; would probably be in the spirit of the challenge). With profiling it seems like currently most of my time is spent inserting into a Set in order to keep the weather station names sorted, but I don&#x27;t know how to do better. Does anyone have advice and/or suggestions for how to optimise my solution?
 Edit: I optimised set insertion and now it&#x27;s no longer the bottleneck, the new runtime is 3m20s:

 I was wondering if there are any conventions for the org filetree structure.
 Do you all just make directories and files randomly or how do i do this? All in one directory, or several for different topics, or do you even put everything in one file?

                              <span>Okay, I&#x27;ve finally gotten around to setting up emacs-lsp-booster, and my first impression is: it works. And it works really well. I already liked LSP-Mode in general, but it was too slow for my very large Unreal project. I&#x27;d get constant timeouts, suggestions and completions just outright wouldn&#x27;t work, and it was a very disappointing experience.
 I switched to LSP-Bridge because it promised better performance, and that was 100% true. It did completions where LSP-Mode and Eglot would choke, but it was a bit of a hassle to set up. I&#x27;m on a Windows machine and that always makes things a little more complicated for me. I had to make sure to write a project-root-finding-function or it wouldn&#x27;t understand my project setup (devs: not everyone uses git, stop assuming that we do), etc.
 Ultimately, I&#x27;m switching back to LSP-Mode because it integrates with xref and helm and various other things a lot better. The LSP-Bridge built-in completion is adequate, but it worked in ways that I wasn&#x27;t expecting/didn&#x27;t like (the lsp-bridge-find-references function, for example, would split the buffer, and when I quit it, sometimes it would kill the buffer I&#x27;d been visiting as well. User error? A bug? Don&#x27;t know.) You just end up having more flexibility with lsp-mode.
 What I can tell you is that no matter how you slice it, for a project of moderate to large size, you should be using something like lsp-bridge or emacs-lsp-booster. (For reference, based on my compile-commands.json file, there are about 17000 files in my project.)
 Also, it seems that the root of this problem is emacs&#x27; ability (or lack thereof) to parse JSON efficiently. That really should be looked at; emacs-lsp-booster is a project that shouldn&#x27;t have to exist, but I&#x27;m grateful that it does.

                              <span>Have used Emacs as my daily-driver text editor for years now, but always on Linux systems. Setting it up now on my work laptop (a Mac) and having difficulty getting it to launch the way I want. If I try to run it from the terminal with the plain old emacs command, I run into the problem described here. The stty -tostop suggestion didn&#x27;t work. However, elsewhere I found the suggestion to directly invoke the application from its installation directory, e.g. /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs.
 This solves the &#x27;suspended output&#x27; issue and does indeed launch a GUI Emacs session. However, if I attempt to do this with the --init-directory flag, it fails to load the specified init.el and Emacs greets me with an &#x27;unknown option&#x27; error. On the other hand, if I run Emacs in the foreground in the terminal, the --init-directory flag works and it sets up (as much as possible) according to the specified init.el file. I&#x27;m running version 29.2
 Does anyone know how to get this to work?

                              <span>One solution to wrapping tables in the buffer is to use org-table-wrap-functions to wrap cell contents of an org table. The issue with this is that the wrapped text will be recognized as different cells when exporting to latex, and does not look the best. Would it be possible for me to define a special character sequence and an use an export filter such that if I have one of these manually inserted line breaks, that on export, the filter will essentially use a temporary buffer, search for these sequences, rejoin the cells affected, and remove the escape sequences? If so, what would be the best way to do this? Thanks.

                              <span>Hello, I&#x27;m trying to configure polymode for Databricks notebooks. They are text files that have their content like this for some NotebookExample.sql :
 -- Databricks notebook source -- MAGIC %python -- MAGIC print(&quot;Hello&quot;) -- MAGIC print(&quot;World&quot;) -- COMMAND SELECT 1 FROM table 
 I&#x27;ve tried to replicate the configuration from their documentation and got to this:
 (use-package polymode :straight t :config (define-hostmode poly-databricks-hostmode :mode &#x27;sql-mode) (define-innermode poly-python-databricks-innermode :mode &#x27;python-mode :head-matcher &quot;-- MAGIC &quot; :tail-matcher &quot;-- COMMAND &quot; :head-mode &#x27;host :tail-mode &#x27;host) (define-polymode poly-databricks-mode :hostmode &#x27;poly-databricks-hostmode :innermodes &#x27;(poly-python-databricks-innermode) ) ) 
 But this is not working as expected because from my investigations it expects to have some closed block. Like on this (another great one from u/mickeyp) post https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/polymode-multiple-major-modes-how-to-use-sql-python-in-one-buffer where the SQL code is contained with a well delimited piece of code between the:
 r&quot;&quot;&quot; CODE &quot;&quot;&quot; 
 Anyone knows if there&#x27;s a way to make it ignore the &quot;--MAGIC&quot; markers between the beginning and the end? I also tried the indent option but it seems to just work with whitespace.
 Thanks

                              <span>Hi, I have a feature in mind that I can&#x27;t find, but am also struggling to articulate, so I&#x27;m still not sure if it exists or not!
 I&#x27;m thinking of something like literate programming, but without tangling, as the source code lives in files separately from the text. Instead of source blocks containing code in the literate document, the literate document instead specifies &quot;views&quot; into the source files. The views would be specified by a file name and a line number range, and that range of lines would be visible in the literate buffer as if that was where the text lived, but it actually lives in its own source file.
 So on-disk this &quot;view src block&quot; might look like this:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 +begin_view :file src/main.rs :lines 120-124
 +end_view
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Whereas in the emacs buffer it might look like this:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 +begin_view :file src/main.rs :lines 120-124
 let rectangle &#x3D; Rectangle { length: 3.0, height: 4.0 }; let triangle &#x3D; Triangle { length: 3.0, height: 4.0 }; print_debug(&amp;rectangle); println!(&quot;Area: {}&quot;, area(&amp;rectangle));
 +end_view
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Editing text within this view would be propagated back to the source file, and adding a newline at the end of the view would increment the end of the line range.
 The motivations for this would be avoiding problems with eglot/lsp in an org document for example, or a document explaining some bits of code in detail, without committing to the full literate workflow.
 Does this have a name and does anyone know of any implementations of something similar to this? If not, does anyone have any insight into how hard this would be to achieve in emacs?

 I&#x27;ve been using emacs for some time now so, in that regard I&#x27;m not so new. I learned a couple of things about elisp in that time. However the creation of a major mode and a package development is completely new to me. I would appreciate first of all some general feedback and constructive criticism on my code and good practices.
 Also I&#x27;d like to ask if somebody here (or maybe there&#x27;s a forum for that) would be open to give me advice from time to time. My references are usually the emacs lisp manual and internet search (i.e., emacs.stackexchange.com) but sometimes is difficult to find the exact info that you need, or the good practices or conventions. I&#x27;d appreciate if I could ask from time to time and get an experienced opinion and/or at least a good reference to solve particular problems.
 Any ideas, pointers or comments are welcome.

                              <span>I have been a happy user of project.el for a while. I also like monorepos, and I&#x27;m glad to say that the support for them is good in project.el. One thing that I haven&#x27;t figured out, is how to use project.el on projects outside of version control. I&#x27;d like to ask how I could fill that gap.
 For monorepo support, I have the following config, which probably looks straightforward to most of you.
 (defun common-lisp-project-p (dir) (directory-files dir nil &quot;.*.asd$&quot;)) (defvar monorepo-root-markers &#x27;(&quot;package.json&quot; &quot;mix.exs&quot; common-lisp-project-p)) (defun monorepo-try-find-project (dir) (when (file-exists-p dir) (let* ((root (seq-some (lambda (root-marker) (locate-dominating-file dir root-marker)) monorepo-root-markers)) (vc-backend (ignore-errors (vc-responsible-backend root)))) ;; I require a vc-backend, otherwise things break (when (and root vc-backend) (list &#x27;vc vc-backend root))))) (setq project-find-functions &#x27;(monorepo-try-find-project project-try-vc)) 
 The problem is simply that this only works for projects under version control.
 How do people deal with this while using project.el?

                              <span>I have been trying really hard to set up Emacs for front-end web development. After a lot of trial and error I finally got the major stuff working (snippets, autocomplete, syntax checking). To do this I had to install several packages and also add some elisp to my .emacs as mentioned on the websites of those packages.
 If i need to replicate this configuration later, maybe on another machine, how can I do it easily without having to go Googling again? Like is there some code to ensure that if a particular package is not found it will be installed automatically by Emacs, so the elisp in the .emacs that deals with this package wont throw an error? I do keep a record of my .emacs in my GitHub
 I don&#x27;t know how to put this in a better way, but I just want to be able to replicate this configuration with another emacs installation without the same amount of effort.

                              <span>Hey, I&#x27;m trying to go through Crafting Interpreters (parsing chapter) using Scala and somehow I&#x27;m messing up the direct instructions. I&#x27;ve finished the parser, but every time I use the REPL it just gives me this kind of stuff:
 &gt; 2+2 [line 1] Error: Expect expression. &gt; &quot;yes&quot; [line 1] Error: Expect expression. &gt; [line 1] Error: Expect expression. &gt; true [line 1] Error: Expect expression. &gt; 
 I&#x27;ve been going through my code trying to fix it and I honestly can NOT figure out what I did wrong. I hate to just ask to look through my entire page of code and find out but idk what I&#x27;m missing, and I imagine a lot of people here have read the book too... I haven&#x27;t used Scala before this so please bear with my non-idiomatic/bad code lmao. I was mostly just trying to do what the book did without much deviation.
 Here&#x27;s my Parser &amp; Expression files, which I think are the culprits:
 Parser – https://pastes.io/3cx3m2y8bx
 Expression – https://pastes.io/xyqhkan7ql

                              <span>I am still evaluating Scala 3 and decide to do a small imperative project (i.e. drawing a triangle with LWJGL). I immediately got bitten when I accidentally ignored a Try[Unit] and it swallowed an exception without warning:
 scala Using.Manager: use &#x3D;&gt; //... some code that threw an exception // ^-- return value not used! 
 That I forgot to handle the Try did not generate any warning, and the ignored error caused bugs in a completely different place. This sounds pretty dangerous and I think there must be a way to avoid it. Am I missing some design patterns here?

                              <span>Hi all - just wanted to share a library I&#x27;ve been working on for a while. I love using Tidal but I have not found it very easy to take the source apart to target backends other than SuperDirt/OSC. For this reason, I have been working on minipat, which is largely Tidal-compatible but hopefully makes it easy to add new backends! Currently, there are two - SuperDirt and MIDI. If anyone is interested, I would love some help adding backends for DAWs like Bitwig or Renoise, turning the system into a tool for rapid composition. Anyway, check it out if you are interested. Contributions welcome. Thanks!

                              <span>I am writing a toy program.. it takes a string say &quot;tom&quot; and splits it into individual characters and gives out the following data 
 t &#x3D; thriving o &#x3D; ornate m &#x3D; mad here the adjectives thriving, ornate and mad are stored in a data structure as key value pairs eg: (&#x27;a&#x27; , &quot;awesome&quot;) 
 The issue i have is when a string has the same characters, the same adjective gets repeated and i don&#x27;t want repetitions. 
 eg:- if i give the name sebastian, the adjectives &quot;serene&quot; and &quot;awesome&quot; is repeated twice.. which i don&#x27;t want..
 It should select another adjective for the letters s and a ? How do i do that? Should i add more data structures? How do i move from one to another so as to avoid repetitions? 
 I am reproducing the code done till now below 
 ​
 -- Main.hs module Main where import qualified Data.Map as Map -- Define a map containing key-value pairs of alphabets and their values alphabetMap :: Map.Map Char String alphabetMap &#x3D; Map.fromList [ (&#x27;a&#x27;, &quot;awesome&quot;), (&#x27;b&#x27;, &quot;beautiful&quot;), (&#x27;c&#x27;, &quot;creative&quot;), (&#x27;d&#x27;, &quot;delightful&quot;), (&#x27;e&#x27;, &quot;energetic&quot;), (&#x27;f&#x27;, &quot;friendly&quot;), (&#x27;g&#x27;, &quot;graceful&quot;), (&#x27;h&#x27;, &quot;happy&quot;), (&#x27;i&#x27;, &quot;innovative&quot;), (&#x27;j&#x27;, &quot;joyful&quot;), (&#x27;k&#x27;, &quot;kind&quot;), (&#x27;l&#x27;, &quot;lovely&quot;), (&#x27;m&#x27;, &quot;mad&quot;), (&#x27;n&#x27;, &quot;nice&quot;), (&#x27;o&#x27;, &quot;ornate&quot;), (&#x27;p&#x27;, &quot;peaceful&quot;), (&#x27;q&#x27;, &quot;quiet&quot;), (&#x27;r&#x27;, &quot;radiant&quot;), (&#x27;s&#x27;, &quot;serene&quot;), (&#x27;t&#x27;, &quot;thriving&quot;), (&#x27;u&#x27;, &quot;unique&quot;), (&#x27;v&#x27;, &quot;vibrant&quot;), (&#x27;w&#x27;, &quot;wonderful&quot;), (&#x27;x&#x27;, &quot;xenial&quot;), (&#x27;y&#x27;, &quot;youthful&quot;), (&#x27;z&#x27;, &quot;zealous&quot;) ] -- Function to look up a character in the map and return its value lookupChar :: Char -&gt; String lookupChar char &#x3D; case Map.lookup char alphabetMap of Just val -&gt; val Nothing -&gt; &quot;Unknown&quot; -- Function to split a string into characters and look up their values lookupString :: String -&gt; [String] lookupString str &#x3D; map lookupChar str main :: IO () main &#x3D; do putStrLn &quot;Enter a string:&quot; input &lt;- getLine let result &#x3D; lookupString input putStrLn &quot;Result:&quot; mapM_ putStrLn result

                              <span>Hi all, newcomer here. 
 I am a technical consultant in IT. Currently I have a lot of client projects running in parallel. Every client case I log meticulously in Orgmode and it gives me and my clients a lot of comfort. Also the end product is plain text and I can store it on every knowledge repository they use. I think it upgraded me as a professional. Being organized to the max goes a long way. 
 I’m totally hooked! Orgmode is addictive! 
 2 questions: - I use doom emacs, some orgmode packages and Org Agenda. Are there any more cool packages I should know about? - ODT exports are ugly. Weird line splits. I know about using templates but is there a simple way to make them more usable out of the box?

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to migrate all Markdown files from Obsidian to org mode but but also keep the linking between files working. Anyone that has done that could point me in the right direction?
 Thanks

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I am a computer science student and one of my future lesson is on contribution to open source software. I&#x27;ve been using Emacs for 3 years now, and I always wanted to deep into Elisp. Moreover, I discovered the functional language Coq last year, and I&#x27;ve become fond of it.
 Linking those two, I&#x27;d like to contribute to Proof General, the interface for proof assistants and especially for Coq inside Emacs. Do you have any advice on how to start ? i.e how to get enough knowledge on the software, getting in touch with contributors, general manners...
 Thanks in advance !

                              <span>hi
 ​
 I have a basic question about &#x60;embark-export&#x60;
 ​
 So i can run &#x60;consult-ripgrep&#x60; and export the results using &#x60;embark-export&#x60; 
 ​
 I can modify in the exported buffer and they get reflected. 
 ​
 But i am not able to find a way to filter further or delete the result from the exported buffer.
 ​
 How do i filter the exported results further ?
 ​
 TIA

                              <span>It’s annoying to org-agenda-switch-to every time I want to adjust a clock. The clock is shown in the agenda buffer and said function jumps straight to where it is. I don’t want to make some weird custom function for something I think we could use in vanilla org mode.
 Does anyone know about something like this? Do you guys experience this same problem adjusting clocks?

                              <span>When I run shell command I get buffer with output. Its major mode is shell-mode.
 When I try to print names of faces for selected texts I get something like:

 (ansi-color-bold (:foreground black))
 How can I change value for black color? It is barely visible on dark background.

 I tried setting &#x60;(setq forge-notifications-selection &#x27;(unread))&#x60;, but it always seems to attempte load 400 pages but fails eventually.
 There are about 21000 &quot;done&quot; notifications and a few hundred unread. 
 Why are read notifications fetched at all (by default)?

                              <span>Okay, so first of all, I think it is super interesting that the shell utilities like find, ls, grep, etc. are all implemented in Eshell.
 I just don&#x27;t understand why. The native binaries are gonna be faster so what was achieved from doing a reimplementation of these utilities in Lisp? I asked ChatGPT about this and it says this enables deep integration between the shell and emacs. But, what does that even mean? Whether I type ls or grep as a shell command or the lisp version of it, the output is the same anyway. So what kind of integration are we talking about?
 I&#x27;m coming from the vim world and just been using Emacs since a few days. So I&#x27;m trying to understand it. I&#x27;m really curious what people actually do in Eshell that the other shells can&#x27;t do.
 EDIT: Got some great, insightful answers. I&#x27;m glad I asked this. Clearly there&#x27;s a lot for me to learn. This is gonna be a fun journey. Thank you everyone!

                              <span>Hello fellow emacsers,
 A question that I could not find an answer to so far is how one can expand/raise minibuffer window in emacs in a similar fashion to vim when you press &#x60;C-f&#x60; during a command. This will raise the command line prompt, allowing you to edit it with usual vim keys. An equivalent in emacs would remove the need to have copied (yanked) a long text for the prompt and paste it in the minibuffer.

 I know of &#x60;flymake-show-project-diagnostics&#x60;, but I prefer the ux of grouping errors by file. Does flymake have a different &quot;frontend&quot; that&#x27;s more tree-based?

                              <span>Hi, everyone. I wanted to post a quick tip to help other noobs like myself. I love org-capture, but I sometimes want to make a completely new file out of quick note, rather than append it to an existing org-mode file. I searched and only found outdated or kind of hard-to-understand answers. So here is a quick snippet to put into your init.el and capture templates to enable creating a new file. 
 (defun jj/open-new-project-file () (let ((fpath (read-file-name &quot;File name: &quot; &quot;~/Sync/inbox/&quot; nil nil nil))) 
 As prescribed in the org docs, this creates a new function that will prompt you for a file name to create, starting in the directory you specify in the function. Then, in your org-capture templates add:
 (&quot;i&quot; &quot;New note in Inbox&quot; plain (function jj/open-new-project-file) &quot;#+title: %?&quot;) 
 This will use your function to create the file and set your cursor ready to type the title in your new org file.
 ​
 I hope this helps someone. I know most people would probably just append to an inbox.org file or similar. I was doing the same thing, but after reading Building a Second Brain, I&#x27;m trying to separate the notes into files that can be dragged-and-dropped via Treemacs into the PARA setup I&#x27;ve made. It&#x27;s a little simpler than trying to use org-refile because in the PARA method, your directories are constantly changing and moving.
 ​
 This solution was heavily inspired by this post: https://www.jesseevers.com/org-capture-function/
 I just modified it to fit my own use case and thought someone searching on Google in the future might appreciate it. Cheers!

 I am using doom emacs and enable the latex language module and setup everything else, anyways, I am not sure how to use Latex in emacs, so I was wondering if you know of good instructions on how to do this correctly, and for my case I am not sure if I should go with org mode as well, because I have never used it, thanks for the help.

                              <span>Hello! I am an org-mode newbie and am having trouble getting a usable configuration set up. I am using Doom Emacs and have installed org-modern as well. I think there may be some problems with how they integrate together as the style is broken in agenda mode.
 The warning shown below occurs any time my cursor goes over any headings such as &quot;Important&quot; or &quot;Habits&quot; and gets stuck. I have to use my mouse or error keys to get off the heading line.
 I&#x27;m not sure how I would go about debugging this as I&#x27;m not getting any warnings or errors that gives me any real information. Does anyone have any tips to try to get more information?
 Here is my org-super-agenda part of the config
 (setq org-agenda-skip-deadline-if-done t org-agenda-include-deadlines nil org-agenda-block-separator nil org-agenda-compact-blocks t org-agenda-start-day nil ;; i.e. today org-agenda-span 1 org-agenda-start-on-weekday nil org-super-agenda-groups &#x27;(;; Each group has an implicit boolean OR operator between its selectors. (:name &quot;Important&quot; ; Optionally specify section name :todo &quot;TODAY&quot; :tag &quot;bills&quot; :priority &quot;A&quot;) (:name &quot;Habits&quot; ; Optionally specify section name :todo &quot;TODAY&quot; :habit t) (:name &quot;Errands&quot; :todo &quot;TODAY&quot; :tag &quot;errand&quot;) (:name &quot;Media&quot; :todo (&quot;TO-READ&quot; &quot;TO-WATCH&quot; &quot;WATCHING&quot;)) (:name &quot;Other&quot; :priority&lt;&#x3D; &quot;B&quot;))) (org-super-agenda-mode)

 Is there even an equivalent? Do I have to mix two styles to get some local variables?

                              <span>Happy to announce the release of Apache Pekko 1.0.3-M1! Ordinarily I wouldn&#x27;t make an announcement for a patch release but this one is special because the major headline change is the capability to migrate from Akka to Pekko clusters as a rolling upgrade (see https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/PEKKO/Pekko+Akka+Compatibility). This is also why its a milestone release, we wan&#x27;t people to test this functionality out before making a full release.
 For more details on the release please see https://pekko.apache.org/docs/pekko/1.0/release-notes/index.html#1-0-3-m1

                              <span>I might be missing something very obvious here. I am learning Scala 3 and trying to do a test project (last experience with scala was 2.11). However, I notice that while the project is using Scala 3, build.sbt itself seems to support only Scala 2.
 Does sbt still only runs on scala 2? It feels very strange to use two different versions of the same language for the build system and the main project.
 I also see scala-cli, but I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s powerful enough to handle platform-specific dependencies like lwjgl.

                              <span>Hi,
 Is there a way to get a Haskell toolchain that just works? I&#x27;ve got sour experience with Haskell from the Linux repos (Arch). It&#x27;s huge, unwieldy and is apt to turn into a brick on update (if it used to work before the update).
 https://hub.docker.com/r/fpco/stack-build/
 This one is much better. Ideal, I&#x27;d say, if it weren&#x27;t for Docker :) . Several years ago I&#x27;ve seen a project on GitHub dedicated exactly to this purpose: A Haskell Toolchain that Just Works. Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t remember the name of the project, and can&#x27;t find it.
 The OS is Linux. Any suggestion is welcome.

GHC 9.8.2 is now available by Zubin Duggal

More QualifiedDo examples by Oleg Grenrus
Qualified do-notation, QualifiedDo, is a nice syntactical extension in GHC. Probably its best property is that it changes semantics only locally, by using explicit “annotation”: by qualifying the do keyword. This means that enabling the extension doesn’t change meaning of other &amp; existing code.

I usually read novels before I go to sleep, it’s the habit I use to replace the use of my phone before bed. To try to improve my english I usually read while following the audiobook (I don’t even know if it’s useful though, but I like it). Novels and other kind of fiction content is the only one I hear with an audiobook.

                              <span>Tweag developed rules_nixpkgs to empower Bazel users with the ability to leverage
Nix’s reproducible builds and its extensive package registry. That ruleset has proven to be
especially advantageous in endeavors demanding intricate dependency administration and the
maintenance of uniform build environments.
However, rules_nixpkgs is incompatible with remote execution. This is a major limitation given that remote
execution is possibly the main reason why people switch to Bazel. And that rules_nixpkgs provides a great way to configure hermetic toolchains, which are an important ingredient for reliable remote execution. There is no trivial fix as
can be seen in the related, longstanding open issue. At Tweag we
investigated a promising solution presented at Bazel eXchange 2022 (recording), but …</span>

 I&#x27;ve opened a php buffer and enabled lsp-mode.
 Now, after a type a few characters the Warnings buffer pops up. 
 This is intrusive and unneccessary.
 How can I stop this from happening? 
 I&#x27;m using Emacs 29.2 on linux.

                              <span>The immense popularity of org-mode is completely justified, but I would like to caution new users against starting their Emacs journey by creating their configuration file in org-mode.
 Because that approach is useful when we want to comment code extensively, elaborate on the reasons behind specific settings in the configuration.
 This is particularly relevant when the configuration is complex or when creating tutorials for others.
 A great example of such configuration is https://protesilaos.com/emacs/dotemacs.
 However, these needs do not apply to beginners or even moderately advanced users.
 And these functionalities come with significant costs:
  
Increased difficulty and complexity
 Increased boilerplate with +begin/end src blocks
 Complicates debugging

                              <span>So my vanilla GNU Emacs (no Doom, no Spacemacs, etc) with catppuccin-theme looks like [see image below] when looking at my home directory, which isn&#x27;t very cool. It looks decent enough when actually editing text, but the bland white colours when browsing directories just doesn&#x27;t do it for me. The catppuccin/emacs git promised me this, and mine looks nothing like that. Probably because the example uses Doom, which I don&#x27;t like and I&#x27;m not willing to use.

                              <span>When you look at a consult/marginalia mini buffer, the right hand column are descriptions of the item in the list. So if you look at the ctl-x-map variable in the mini buffer it says
 Default keymap for C-x commands.
 Is there a way to do an isearch or regex search of these descriptions from within the mini buffer? So that I can filter the list of candidates based on text in those descriptions, instead of the names of the commands/variables/functions/etc?
 I know you could embark export the list of candidates and then search them that way and that works with small lists but embark export does a lot of things in the buffer that I don&#x27;t always need. If I just want to find something, don&#x27;t know what it&#x27;s called but do have an idea of what it does, this could be a very helpful way of refining the list of candidates.

                              <span>I use both RefTeX and company-reftex for latex documents. For choosing the bibliographic reference, I much prefer company-reftex. But I like how C-c ] (reftex-citation) allows choosing from a list of citation formats (ditto for reftex-reference). The problem is that reftex-citation takes you to RefTeX&#x27;s mechanism for choosing the bibliographic reference, which is not company-reftex.
 So I am now doing this:
  ;; From my reftex-cite-format; for real, this is a longer list (defvar my-cite-options &#x27;(&quot;\\cite[][]{}&quot; &quot;\\citep[][]{}&quot; &quot;\\citealp[][]{}&quot; &quot;\\citep[][p.~]{}&quot;)) (defun my-cite-menu () &quot;Insert citation based on user choice.&quot; (interactive) (insert (completing-read &quot;Choose citation type: &quot; my-cite-options)) (backward-char) (company-complete)) ;; Preserve muscle memory (bind-key (kbd &quot;C-c [&quot;) &#x27;my-cite-menu reftex-mode-map) 
 (Same comments apply to reftex-reference, where I reuse my reftex-ref-style-alist, and create a my-reference-menu).
 This seems to me like the obvious solution because: a) it preserves muscle memory; b) I can reuse my lists of citation options and reference styles, and if I wanted to go back to a pure-reftex solution it would be simple; c) I can continue easily choosing structure; d) I use company-reftex; e) it seems simple enough.
 But I have not found anything similar when searching for it. I wonder if I am doing something silly, or reinventing a wheel (and ending up with a square wheel as a result, given my elisp ignorance).

                              <span>Recently, I&#x27;ve started using Emacs again, mainly because Emacs 29.2 has built-in eglot and treesit. I spent about a week configuring it to see if the current Emacs can achieve the smoothness of lsp code completion on par with Neovim.
 My system is a MacBook Pro M1 MAX, so there should be no problem with hardware performance.
 I am using emacs-plus@29 and have enabled nativecomp. Here are the parts related to lsp code completion and performance in my configuration, I did everything I can find to boost the performance but still not as fast as Neovim&#x27;s lsp (via gopls and rust-analyzer).
 Is there anything to improve?

 I use dape for debugging and plz to test an api.
 When you set a breakpoint in the api and you try to test this method with a request then the UI will be freeze...
 I think this is because both different thread try to use the same UI thread ...
 I don&#x27;t know it is an issue or just as designed and I can use the curl from console as well but I think it is a limitation if I think correctly.
 What do you think ?

 I&#x27;m using doom emacs, and I followed all the instructions to enable Latex in doom emacs, but, when I use gptel to query with gpt4all, whenever I query math equations it&#x27;s not showing up in the nice latex, so, any tips on how to get this working, so I can view the math and physics equations in a nice way. Thanks for the help.

 I am just dabbling into emacs and elisp code so please assume i have no idea what i am doing
 ​
 So i have a string of the form
 ​
 Exp pkt:req: (req_uvc::transaction@6094583) { response_expected: 0x0 txn_phase: TXN_PHASE_UNINITIALIZED begin_cycle: x end_cycle: x pd: { txn_id: 0xc54 resp_err: CHI_RSPERR_OK req_size: CHI_SIZE_32B resp: CHI_RSP_I opcode: CHI_DAT_NONCOPYBACKWRDATA tgt_id: 0xcc src_id: 0x25 } enable_a1: 0xx reset_: 0xx } 
 ​

 And i want to convert it into something like this 
 ​

And now I&#x27;m testing flyckeck Grammarly, it is better but the explanation of the issue with text is not helpful. My English is not perfect and I have problems understanding what to do to fix the grammar mistakes. Example:
  
The noun phrase first element seems to be missing a determiner before it. Consider adding an article.
  
I don&#x27;t understand what this hint suggests. The browser extension has a suggestion that you can click to fix the grammar mistakes. Does any Emacs mode have something similar? I thought that lsp mode use company mode to allow fixing grammar mistakes from dropdown menu, but I was told that the company mode only works with completion and doesn&#x27;t work with lsp-grammarly.
 I can fix mistakes by hand, but I need to have a list of fixes to apply. lsp-grammarly had even more cryptic hints &quot;Correct article usage&quot;. Those are only in browser extension but there is a proper grammar listed that I can apply.

 Hope you&#x27;re all doing awesome! I&#x27;m Jesse Amos, and I&#x27;m excited to announce that I&#x27;ve conquered the Haskell course (Haskell MOOC)! Now, I&#x27;m diving into a personal project and on the lookout for a mentor and buddy. I&#x27;d love to have someone I can hit up with questions as I tackle hurdles. Your wisdom and insights would be super valuable to me. Can&#x27;t wait to connect with someone willing to share their expertise. Thanks a million!

                              <span>So I am working on a web backend using scotty, and I would like the server to rebuild and restart whenever I change some file in the project. Its a cabal project not a stack one.
 How would one generally go about doing that?

                              <span>For the past years, I had to write encoders and decoders for a bunch of datatype files. In this time, a common theme was a separation between the encoder and the decoder part. While with some trickery, you can get a specification such as code &#x3D; Constructor  extractA  extractB to work for newtypes, I have never found a nice approach for ADTs that let me plug-and-play codes for field (without changing the type definitions, anyway. I know you can do some magic with an additional functor argument that you put in front of every field. Your mileage may vary).
 In any case, I found the state unsatisfactory and set out to find a solution and - to my own surprise - was successful. If you just want code here is a proof of concept on github. It even has a few comments and a nice README.

                              <span>Hi so im very new to haskell and i was wondering how do you fix the variable not in scope error.
 double x &#x3D; x + x
 quadruple x &#x3D; double (double x) 
 i know this is a very simple code, but when i try to run quadruple 2 in powershell, it just gives me an error of Variable not in scope: quadruple :: t0 -&gt; t. I still dont know what im doing wrong.

                              <span>Hi everyone, I&#x27;m a newbie in Haskell and just learned it for about a week. I got this error while trying to build a library.
 : error: panic! (the &#x27;impossible&#x27; happened) GHC version 9.6.4: Couldn&#x27;t find module Data.Type.Ord CallStack (from HasCallStack): panic, called at compiler/GHC/Utils/Error.hs:454:29 in ghc:GHC.Utils.Error 
 FYI, I&#x27;m using rules_haskell as builder and base-4.18.2.0.
 As I checked https://www.stackage.org/lts-22.12/package/base-4.18.2.0, this base does have Data.Type.Ord.
 I tried to downgrade the ghc version but it still didn&#x27;t fix this issue.

                              <span>This is my first time trying to edit files remotely using emacs. When trying to ssh into a remote server using C-x C-f /ssh:user@host:/path tramp hangs after the second colon and sometimes after pressing C-g will display in the minibuffer the message [Tramp: opening connection nil for user@host using ssh...failed]. I thought the issue might be that I was using windows, so I tried /plink:user@host:/path and got the same message, albeit without emacs hanging and it instead saying &quot;using plink...failed&quot;. The only person I&#x27;ve been able to find with the same problem is here https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/qnyv6r/tramp_is_unusable_in_the_latest_git_version/ and I&#x27;m not using mac so their solution doesn&#x27;t apply to me. Does anybody have any ideas for how to fix this?

My main issue is emacs presuming to create new windows when I do not want it to. I especially want all of my regular file buffers to always open in the same window. Does anyone have suggestions for controlling your windows? Are there any really good packages or dot-files I should be looking at to solve this issue?

                              <span>I am trying to use Nicholar Rougier&#x27;s &#x60;mu4e-dashboard-mode&#x60; (https://github.com/rougier/mu4e-dashboard). It was quite easy to use it, except for one small issue. Suppose I am in the dashboard and click or select “Inbox”. Now when I quit “Inbox” it goes the mu4e&#x27;s default (ugly) dashboard. How do I prevent that from happening and only use the dashboard from above?

                              <span>For anyone that&#x27;s interested. I have a debug template that works well for me running dap-mode for debugging rust with lldb. Here&#x27;s what works for me, including finding the target debug binary. I think the projectile functions could be replaced with LSP workspace variables/functions but this works for me so I haven&#x27;t tried.
 (add-hook &#x27;rustic-mode-hook (lambda () (dap-register-debug-template &quot;Rust LLDB Debug Configuration&quot; (list :type &quot;lldb-mi&quot; ;; Make sure the path to lldb-mi is in your path :request &quot;launch&quot; :name &quot;Rust::Run&quot; :MIMode &quot;lldb&quot; :target (concat (projectile-project-root) &quot;target/debug/&quot; (projectile-project-name)) ;; Requires that the rust project is a project in projectile :environment [] :cwd &quot;${workspaceFolder}&quot;))))

                              <span>I have been using go templ and htmx to write web server for a while. There is a templ-ts-mode for Emacs user to use. But the functionalities are so limited that it does not have HTML keyword completion. I tried to integrate web-mode or html-mode into it but no success. Both the source code of web-mode and html-mode are so complicated that I don&#x27;t even know where to find the auto-completion related functions.
 So I decided to do it my own way, with the help of built-in treesit, it was a fun and successful experience. I recommend more of you try out the treesit related stuffs. 
 Here is my blog post about it.

 I&#x27;m trying to get GPT4ALL working with the gptel package, after getting past some errors, now another error got thrown while trying to use gptel: could not parse http response?
 The gpt4all-chat gui works fine, but in emacs with gptel, it throws this error.
 I found a similar issue in the gptel repo, so I posted my issue there, if any of you would like to take a look, thanks.

                              <span>I just installed Fedora KDE and I&#x27;ve run into an embarrassing problem. Neither my terminal of choice (wezterm) nor Emacs can find my installation of nerd fonts. I installed them as per normal in ~/.local/share/fonts and they show up in the fonts section of the GUI appearance manager (and are completely usable in KDE). However, they can&#x27;t be found by wezterm or Emacs.
 Anyone had this problem before? I&#x27;ve never had an issue with openSUSE or Arch. 
 I&#x27;ve also installed them in /usr/share/fonts and of course ran sudo fc-cache -v.

                              <span>are there any good examples of specific tasks to compare these paradigms, especially ones where haskell is more convenient than imperative languages?

                              <span>By comparing the parser combinator implementation in the paper Parsec: Direct Style Monadic Parser Combinators For The Real World and the one actually used in the parsec library, I found they are quite different.
 The implementation in the paper defines the Parser type as follows
 type Parser a &#x3D; String → Consumed a data Consumed a &#x3D; Consumed (Reply a) | Empty (Reply a) data Reply a &#x3D; Ok a String | Error 
 The implementation in the parsec library uses
 newtype ParsecT s u m a &#x3D; ParsecT {unParser :: forall b . State s u -&gt; (a -&gt; State s u -&gt; ParseError -&gt; m b) -- consumed ok -&gt; (ParseError -&gt; m b) -- consumed err -&gt; (a -&gt; State s u -&gt; ParseError -&gt; m b) -- empty ok -&gt; (ParseError -&gt; m b) -- empty err -&gt; m b } 
 The latter uses a continuation-based approach instead of different constructors. I can see why it works. But until yesterday I did not know that this method had a formal name - &quot;church encoding&quot;.
 My question is
  
Why does church encoding improve the performance of parser combinators? Surely it avoids the &quot;wrapping&quot;/&quot;unwrapping&quot; data into/out of constructors. So the abstraction and application of lambdas must be cheaper, right?
 And how much? I haven&#x27;t found a paper describing refactoring of parser combinator libraries using church encoding and the benchmark comparison.

                              <span>I have been using org-roam for a while. But I have found its template system confusing.
 I think there are two use cases:
  
Creating a new node (for this the templates work well)
 
Adding data to an already existing node.
 
 The templates are also used when the user runs org-roam-node-find and the selected node-title does not exist. This is probably whey templates in org-roam behave very different than org templates.
 Last weekend I finally spent time and address some of these issues. The commits are here:
 https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam/compare/main...dmgerman:org-roam:main
 for example.The first template will only work when creating a new file (see :create-file). It will ask for the node-title and use it to create the file (the slug).
  (add-to-list &#x27;org-roam-capture-templates &#x60;(&quot;A&quot; &quot;area&quot; plain &quot;%?&quot; :target (file+head ,(eval (dmg-roam-build-path &quot;areas/${slug}.org&quot;)) ,(eval (dmg-roam-template &quot;plain.txt&quot;))) :create-file yes :unnarrowed t)) 
 If the path is provided, the user will not be asked for the destination. if the template has :create-file no, and the file does not exist, the capture will be aborted.
 In contrast, this template will ask for a node id, and then search for the &quot;Tasks&quot; header. node and node+olp will not create a new file.
  (add-to-list &#x27;org-roam-capture-templates &#x60;(&quot;t&quot; &quot;todo&quot; entry &quot;*** TODO %?\n%t\n%a\n\n%i&quot; :target (node+olp nil (&quot;Tasks&quot;)) :unnarrowed t)) 
 If the node id is provided, the user will NOT be asked for the node id.

                              <span>alphapapa&#x27;s org-ql package looks really nice.
 I&#x27;m looking for a good way to use it to &quot;filter&quot; an org buffer as explained below.
 The idea is:
 [input org buffer] --&gt;  --&gt; [new output org buffer]
  
Starting with some org buffer (the &quot;input&quot;)
 Produce a new &quot;filtered&quot; org buffer (the &quot;output&quot;)
 Where the &quot;filtered&quot; buffer would contain those nodes of the first org buffer which satisfied some &quot;matching&quot; criteria.
 The &quot;structure&quot; of the &quot;filtered&quot; buffer would be the same as the first org buffer, but with unmatched nodes effectively pruned.
 The matching criteria would ideally be based on alpha-papa&#x27;s nice org-ql package.
 The &quot;output&quot; is a new org buffer 
 not a sparse tree folding of the original buffer
 not an agenda view into the original buffer

 I am trying to install scala using courser but it cannot access the internet (work limitation) so it cannot get the json file that tells it what JVM I have or if one is installed. I have openJDK 8 installed and verified that when running java -version. Is there a way to use courser without the internet?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hi, I am trying to cache immutable maps(string keys and case class values ) to Hazlecast. I tried using old Hazlecast lib but it is giving errors as it was compatible with 3.12 version of Hazlecast not latest version. If I go with Java implementation I have to write my own serializaton implementations(I have 50+ maps to serialize). Is there any other way I can serialize so that I can store maps easily. I am using scala dotty.

                              <span>Hello! :-)
It is good practice to keep the titles of a Zettel short:
On the one hand, the task of writing a short title helps the learning process.
On the other hand, the visualization of the notes is better if the title is short.
However, my question is, do you know if there is a sweet spot for the length of a title?
In my case, I try to write titles of 80 characters or less (with the UUID included). I selected this quantity due to my background in programming, where it is recommended to limit code lines to 80 characters. In my experience, this length is a good challenge that helps both objectives (1) and (2).
But I am considering increasing it a bit: maybe 100 characters.
What maximum length for titles do you use?</span>

                              <span>Someone has to ask again the age old question: How is Dependent Haskell going? The last I&#x27;ve heard was from this Serokell post. Call it anxiety (and you would be right) but the community has been longing for dependent types for a long time and I&#x27;m no exception, lol.

 Do you have any resources ?
 EDIT Update &#x3D;&gt; Ok Update. The problem was only in the version 9.2.8.

                              <span>Suppose I have the following in my emacs config.
  (use-package general :config (general-create-definer leader-key :prefix leader-key-pfx) (general-create-definer local-leader-key :prefix local-leader-key-pfx)) 
 I could then use the above to create a binding in a specific key map (e.g., for emacs-lisp-mode) as follows.
  (local-leader-key :keymaps &#x27;emacs-lisp-mode-map &quot;e s&quot; &#x27;eval-surrounding-sexp) 
 I would like to group such bindings, for instance, based on the mode they affect.
 If I understand correctly, use-package could be used for arbitrary configurations and does not need to be tied to a specific package.
 So, I tried the following.
  (use-package emacs-lisp-mode :config (local-leader-key :keymaps &#x27;emacs-lisp-mode-map &quot;e s&quot; &#x27;eval-surrounding-sexp)) 
 Now, the settings do not take into effect when I open an elisp file or a buffer in emacs-lisp-mode.
 Could someone help me fix the config?

                              <span>Hi, I installed emacs in macOS (emacs-plus@29) and immediately noticed that the font rendering was a bit off, slightly darker or bolder than in other apps. For example, this is Source Code Pro (Regular 15) in VSCode (above) and in emacs (below):
 https://preview.redd.it/ctq8s69dyzkc1.png?width&#x3D;342&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;079e1ee0f334bf0a80516fd81ce8ff0123d75bbf
 Does emacs use a different font rendering engine than the rest of the system?
 I tried setting ns-use-thin-smoothing but found no difference in rendering.
 Thanks!

                              <span>On Friday I updated all my lsp language servers (I use ts-ls) and all my emacs packages, and now whenever I save it&#x27;s overwriting all my imports incorrectly; it&#x27;s also (stupidly) adding an emacs backup file to my &#x60;tsconfig.json&#x60; file. I&#x27;ve been looking at the lsp-mode documentation, but I can&#x27;t figure out how to disable code actions on save (and honestly, I&#x27;d rather keep that and just turn off whatever it&#x27;s trying to do to the imports, but I haven&#x27;t found a setting for that). I&#x27;ve also been looking at the configuration options on the ts-ls repo, but I&#x27;m unsure of how to set those through emacs-lsp, and couldn&#x27;t find any documentation on setting server-specific settings. 
 Here&#x27;s what it&#x27;s doing:

 #+name: sus-questionnaire-results #+caption: SUS Questionnaire Results #+attr_latex: :align l|r|r|r|r|r|r|r|r|r|r|l :font \fontspec{Noto Sans Condensed Light} | USER | Q1 | Q2 | Q3 | Q4 | Q5 | Q6 | Q7 | Q8 | Q9 | Q10 | SUS | |------+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+-----+------| | U1 | 5 | 2 | 2 | 1 | 3 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 60.0 | | U2 | 5 | 2 | 4 | 2 | 5 | 1 | 4 | 1 | 4 | 1 | 87.5 | | U3 | 5 | 2 | 4 | 1 | 4 | 2 | 4 | 1 | 4 | 3 | 80.0 | #+tblfm: $12&#x3D;&#x27;(ux:sus-calc-score-per-row &#x27;($2..$11));N 
 The SUS column is calculated for each row using the values from column 2 to 11. When the ‘N’ flag is used, all referenced elements are parsed as numbers and interpolated as Lisp numbers
 Here is the elisp function:
 (defun ux:sus-calc-score (lst) (let ((counter 0)) (mapcar (lambda (x) (setq counter (1+ counter)) (if (&#x3D; 0 (% counter 2)) (- 5 x) (1- x))) lst))) (defun ux:sus-calc-score-per-row (lst) (* (apply &#x27;+ (ux:sus-calc-score lst)) 2.5)) 
 Thats all!

                              <span>A while back i made a post on a different Problem where i mentioned this as well, but i&#x27;m not able to track this down. So i&#x27;m, once again, asking for help here.
 Basically, at a random point in time after starting emacs, it will create buffers named &quot;*emacs*&quot; in the background.
 https://preview.redd.it/sy147bu3mxkc1.png?width&#x3D;898&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;72f99a091f59e8332e2a1a067b2b2ad8eeff33ae
 They seem to be somehow related to me moving through files. I have only my init.el file open and moving up and down makes new buffers appear in that list. This isn&#x27;t consistent though. If i restart emacs, i can move through my init file just fine. And at some point, this just starts happening.
 Some of those buffers are empty, and some have just &quot;Lisp Expression:&quot; with nothing else written in them.
 I already tried stripping down my config and haven&#x27;t been able to track it down. I ripped the whole completion setup out, threw out treemacs and such, ran without all the eglot and language modes and tried without org and evil configuration. Nothing seems to help.
 Is there a hook or option i can use to get more information on how or by what those buffers are created? Maybe write a verbose log on those events or such? Although i&#x27;ve worked with emacs for quite some time, i seem to be pretty bad at configuring and troubleshooting it, so some hints would help me a lot here.
 If someone wants to look at my config, the current state is here: Dominik Schlack / Domacs · GitLab

                              <span>Hi 👋
 I&#x27;ve always had this problem and I want to see if someone can please help me: I have the following code in my config:
  ;; Set backup directory for files (setq backup-directory-alist &#x60;((&quot;.&quot; . ,(expand-file-name &quot;backups/&quot; user-emacs-directory)))) ;; Set auto-saves directory for buffers (make-directory (expand-file-name &quot;auto-saves/&quot; user-emacs-directory) t) (setq auto-save-list-file-prefix (expand-file-name &quot;auto-saves/sessions&quot; user-emacs-directory) auto-save-file-name-transforms &#x60;((&quot;.*&quot; ,(expand-file-name &quot;auto-saves/&quot; user-emacs-directory) t))) ;; Disable lock files - enable if they cause trouble while compiling ;; (setq create-lockfiles nil) ;; Set directory for temp projectile and lsp files (setq projectile-known-projects-file (expand-file-name &quot;tmp/projectile-bookmarks.eld&quot; user-emacs-directory) lsp-session-file (expand-file-name &quot;tmp/.lsp-session.v1&quot; user-emacs-directory)) ;; Make backups to backup directory (setq backup-by-copying t delete-old-versions t kept-new-versions 6 kept-old-versions 2 version-control t) 
 It creates ## files as backups in the directory, which is really nice. But, if I have a [/] in an org header (a progress thing for a checklist), it continually asks upon hitting &#x60;C-x s&#x60; if I want to save the file. If I quit out of Emacs with &#x60;C-x C-c&#x60;, then it will not only ask, but also say that some buffers are modified, and do I want to really quit? I find this behavior to be a little weird. I&#x27;m just looking to see if anyone can help me make it so that backups are saved/taken care of silently in the background, and when hitting &#x60;C-x s&#x60;, it doesn&#x27;t prompt me to save the backup file each time. Instead, it prompts for normal (non-backup) buffers.
 I don&#x27;t know *why* it continually updates the backup files if I have a [/] in the header, but it does. If anyone has any ideas, please let me know?
 Thanks! 🙃

                              <span>Hi, 
 I have a perfectly working setup in emacs 28 using eglot and tresitter. I am moving to emacs 29, and trying to figure out which parts of the configuration can be removed since both eglot and treesitter are part of emacs now. I know that treesitter-auto can do a lot of heavy lifting in emacs 29. The relevant config from the emacs 28 installation is: 
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; (use-package eglot :straight :hook ((python-mode julia-mode) . eglot-ensure) :config (add-to-list &#x27;eglot-server-programs &#x27;(python-mode . (&quot;python-lsp-server&quot;)) &#x27;(julia-mode . (&quot;eglot-jl&quot;))))
 (use-package tree-sitter :straight t :config (global-tree-sitter-mode) (add-hook &#x27;tree-sitter-after-on-hook #&#x27;tree-sitter-hl-mode)) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; Any help/tips would be awesome. Thank you!

                              <span>Greetings,
 I&#x27;m having trouble getting this to work, linked below is the github issue, if any of you would like to take a look, thanks.
 https://github.com/karthink/gptel
 Recently I installed the gpt4all-chat package from the nix packages unstable channel:
 gpt4all-chat
 And it works really well, but I wanted to get gpt4all working in emacs since I do everything in there. Anyways, your gptel package is just what I need in order to have gpt4all working smoothly in emacs. But I&#x27;ve run into some an error when trying to setup gpt4all working in emacs with your gptel package.
 Warning (gptel): Preferred &#x60;gptel-model&#x27; &quot;gpt4all-falcon-newbpe-q4_0.gguf&quot; notsupported in &quot;GPT4All&quot;, using &quot;nil&quot; instead Disable showing Disable logging
 I copied the model files from the settings section of the gpt4all-chat gui app, then pasted them in the gptel configuration in config.el(I&#x27;m using nix-doom-emacs). But this error is getting thrown? nix-doom-emacs repo broke a while back so it&#x27;s stuck at doom emacs version 28.2, but that shouldn&#x27;t be an issue for this gptel package, at least I don&#x27;t think so?
 Thanks in advance for the help.
 Here&#x27;s my config.el configuration for gptel below:
 ;;---------------------------------------------------
 ;; gptel llm configuration:
 (use-package! gptel
 :config
 ;;(setq! gptel-api-key &quot;your key&quot;)
 ;; OPTIONAL configuration
 (setq-default gptel-model &quot;gpt4all-falcon-newbpe-q4_0.gguf&quot; ;Pick your default model
 gptel-backend (gptel-make-gpt4all &quot;GPT4All&quot; :protocol &quot;http&quot;))
 (setq-default gptel-max-tokens 500))
 ;; gptel llm backend configurations:
 (gptel-make-gpt4all &quot;GPT4All&quot;
 :protocol &quot;http&quot;

                              <span>Just wanted to show you how to use org tables with custom elisp functions, in case you dont know its possible:
 The following table shows results from a questionnaire:
 #+name: sus-questionnaire-results #+caption: SUS Questionnaire Results #+attr_latex: :align l|r|r|r|r|r|r|r|r|r|r|l :font \fontspec{Noto Sans Condensed Light} | USER | Q1 | Q2 | Q3 | Q4 | Q5 | Q6 | Q7 | Q8 | Q9 | Q10 | SUS | |------+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+-----+------| | U1 | 5 | 2 | 2 | 1 | 3 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 60.0 | | U2 | 5 | 2 | 4 | 2 | 5 | 1 | 4 | 1 | 4 | 1 | 87.5 | | U3 | 5 | 2 | 4 | 1 | 4 | 2 | 4 | 1 | 4 | 3 | 80.0 | #+tblfm: $12&#x3D;&#x27;(ux:sus-calc-score-per-row &#x27;($2..$11));N 
 The SUS column is calculated for each row using the values from column 2 to 11. When the ‘N’ flag is used, all referenced elements are parsed as numbers and interpolated as Lisp numbers
 Here is the elisp function:
 (defun ux:sus-calc-score (lst) (let ((counter 0)) (mapcar (lambda (x) (setq counter (1+ counter)) (if (&#x3D; 0 (% counter 2)) (- 5 x) (1- x))) lst))) (defun ux:sus-calc-score-per-row (lst) (* (apply &#x27;+ (ux:sus-calc-score lst)) 2.5)) 
 Thats all!

                              <span>I am using org-mode to takes notes and inserting images, which are stored in local in a relative directory. I am really puzzled because some images are not displayed and instead i see a simple link to the image. 
 The format i am usiing is
 [[file:images/img.jpg][DESCRIPTION]]
 Images are correctly placed in folder because clicking the link open the image.
 Things i have tried:
 - org-display-inline-images from the config and toggling it in the same buffer, no luck 
 - org-toggle-inline-images, no luck 
 - remove all configurations from my emacs
 - install latest org-mode using package-manager replacing the native one
 I am sure is something silly I am not figuring out. Help?
 emacs: 29.2
 org-mode: 9.6.19
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hi. I am using &#x60;org-msg&#x60; to write emails but it always exports code blocks with some kind of formatting, even in a text export, example:
 ┌────
 │ (require &#x27;org)
 │ (load-theme &#x27;leuven t)
 │ 
 │ (dolist (face &#x27;(org-level-1 org-level-2 org-level-3 org-level-4 org-level-5
 │ org-level-6 org-level-7 org-level-8))
 │ (set-face-attribute face nil :extend t))
 │ 
 │ (setq org-fontify-whole-heading-line t)
 │ (scratch-buffer)
 │ (org-mode)
 │ (insert &quot;#+title: (Infty, 2) Reading Group
 │ #+ROAM_TAGS: \&quot;Quasicategories\&quot;
 ...
 How can I export such a code block completely in plain text, like if I had just copy-pasted the code directly?

                              <span>Following on from this question about restricting property values during capture, I have a followup.
 I&#x27;m currently implementing that value restriction in my init.el with something like this:
 (setq org-global-properties &#x27;( (&quot;MEETING_ALL&quot; . &quot;Staff Finance ProjectX ProjectY&quot;) (&quot;FLAVOR_ALL&quot; . &quot;Strawberry Chocolate Vanilla&quot;) ;; ... and so on )) 
 However, I want to be able to have some property values that contain whitespace. So &quot;Project X&quot; and &quot;Project Y&quot; instead of ProjectX and ProjectY. I read the org-global-properties description but I still haven&#x27;t got enough hang of car and cdr and cons to know for sure what it&#x27;s on about. So I guessed and simply \-escaped some &quot;&quot;, like this:
 (setq org-global-properties &#x27;( (&quot;MEETING_ALL&quot; . &quot;Staff Finance \&quot;Project X\&quot; \&quot;Project Y\&quot;&quot;) (&quot;FLAVOR_ALL&quot; . &quot;Strawberry Chocolate Vanilla&quot;) ;; ... and so on )) 
 To my surprise, that works fine, but is it The Right Way to do it? One small thing that concerns me is that it doesn&#x27;t appear to be handled very well by emacs&#x27; lisp mode. So if I have it as a vertical list, I get this:
 (setq org-global-properties &#x27;( (&quot;MEETING_ALL&quot; . &quot;Staff Finance \&quot;Project X\&quot; \&quot;Project Y\&quot;&quot;) (&quot;FLAVOR_ALL&quot; . &quot;Strawberry Chocolate Vanilla&quot;) ;; ... and so on )) 
 None of this is the end of the world, I know, but I just wanted to check in case I&#x27;m really supposed to code it as some kind of nested parens monstrosity, but one that&#x27;s at least indented according to some sensible aesthetic! Ye know -- the kind of thing you come to expect with Lisp :-)

 subst f g x &#x3D; f x g(x)
 As far as I understood, f is a function that takes two arguments f (x , y). But, in this particular case, one of its arguments is a function g, f (x, g(x)), so I have no idea how the subst type assignature should be. Should f be a function whose one of its arguments is also a function or just a type variable?
 I am starting my studies with Haskell that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m still dumb, please have some patience.
 I am asking this question in this subreddit because there no other one that can help me out.

                              <span>Hello, I know this might be a very dumb way to do this, but I have a test file that imports and runs functions. The problem is because of my particular use case, the function that is being tested may not always be defined. When this happens, the test itself errors out because the function doesn&#x27;t exist and I have to comment out that test. Is there a way to detect if a variable has been defined, and return a Maybe where if the variable doesn&#x27;t exist it returns Nothing and if variable A does exist it returns Just A? I have other ways to go about this but this would be the most convenient way.

                              <span>So i want to use eglot to have autocompletion for html and css in Emacs (Windows). I installed eglot from melpa and installed the language servers using npm as shown in Github. When I run M - x eglot in any HTML file, I get the message &quot;Enter program to execute&#x27;. When i enter vscode-html-language-server.cmd and enter, i get the error message:
 [jsonrpc] Server exited with status 1
  
error in process sentinel: eglot--error: [eglot] -1: Server died 
 error in process sentinel: [eglot] -1: Server died
  
When i enter vscodehtml-language-server.ps1 and enter, i get the error message:
  
Searching for program: Permission denied, vscode-html-language-server.ps1
  
What might be the problem be with this? the language servers are in my path.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been working on writing some wrapper functions in consult for my workflow, and for the life of me can&#x27;t seem to figure out how to get a particular behavior in the consult menu.
 The behavior I&#x27;m looking for is exemplified by consult-gh: https://github.com/armindarvish/consult-gh. If you take a look at the demo GIFs in the README, you&#x27;ll see that when repos are searched for, it shows a list where each repo has multiple &quot;columns:&quot; one for the repo author/name, one for it being public or private, one for a date, and one for a description. Looking at the source code, I see that the author of this package in particular used propertize to get different faces for each part, but it&#x27;s not clear to me how to get the column alignment looking nice. Suggestions on the column alignment would be most appreciated!

                              <span>I&#x27;m pretty new to Emacs, so go easy on me if I&#x27;m missing something obvious, but I&#x27;ve read all of the documentation that I could find on running Emacs as a server and every time I think I&#x27;ve fixed the issue something strange happens again.
 I am on version 29. Currently, the way I start the daemon is with systemd. I enable and start the service as the documentation shows.
 The issue has to do with where the daemon creates the socket. Sometimes when I boot up my machine, everything works exactly as I expect it to: I can simply run &#x60;emacsclient -nc&#x60; and it pops right up. I can also set my shell environment variable EDITOR to emacsclient and open files easily that way. When things are working right, I note that the socket is in /run/user/userID/emacs/server.
 Probably half the time I boot up, the socket is in ~/.emacs.d/server/server, which means I have to pass the path to the socket to emacsclient for it to work. This means I have to change the scripts bound to my keybindings, etc., every time this happens. Pain in the butt. And for some reason I don&#x27;t understand, setting EDITOR&#x3D;emacsclient -cn -s /path/to/server doesn&#x27;t work the way I want it to. It opens up a new frame, but does not open a buffer with the current file.
 So my questions more broadly are
  
How does Emacs determine where it creates the socket? You would think it just looks at server-socket-dir, but there&#x27;s obviously more to it than that, because it changes it up on me regardless of whether I explicitly set that variable.
 And does anybody have any hunches as to what could be causing it to seemingly randomly flip back and forth between socket locations?

                              <span>I would love to have the ephemeral buffers sorted in an extra category below the regular buffers when calling consult-buffer. The following definition doesn&#x27;t work. It does sort them as wanted, but when I choose them, the buffer doesn&#x27;t switch to *Messages* or *scratch*, it just stays as the current buffer. (The regular buffers can be chosen in the upper part of the consult-menu as usual.)
 What did I do wrong?
  (setq consult-buffer-sources &#x27;(consult--source-hidden-buffer consult--source-modified-buffer consult--source-buffer (:name &quot;Ephemeral&quot; :narrow 109 :category buffer :items (&quot;*Messages*&quot; &quot;*scratch*&quot; &quot;*Async-native-compile-log*&quot; &quot;*Bookmark List*&quot;)))) (setq consult-buffer-filter &#x27;(&quot;\\&#x60; &quot; &quot;\\&#x60;\\*Completions\\*\\&#x27;&quot; &quot;\\&#x60;\\*scratch\\*\\&#x27;&quot; &quot;\\&#x60;\\*Messages\\*\\&#x27;&quot; &quot;\\&#x60;\\*Bookmark List\\*\\&#x27;&quot; &quot;\\&#x60;\\*EMMS-Log\\*\\&#x27;&quot; &quot;\\&#x60;\\*Flymake log\\*\\&#x27;&quot; &quot;\\&#x60;\\*Semantic SymRef\\*\\&#x27;&quot; &quot;\\&#x60;\\*tramp/.*\\*\\&#x27;&quot;)) 
 I need to filter them, so they are not listed twice, but just in the extra category. And neither :category buffer nor :category &#x27;buffer works.
 I am grateful for any advice.
 Edit: I am using Emacs 30.0.50 and Consult 1.3.

                              <span>Hi,
 I usually don&#x27;t use emacs but I am getting into org-mode again and I am having trouble installing packages from melpa.
 When I do a &quot;M-x package-refresh-content&quot; emacs tells me that it is contacting host elpa.gnu.org:443 then elpa.nongnu.org:443 , then melpa.org:443 and finally gives up with &quot;failed to download melpa archive&quot;.
 I have this in my init.el:
 (require &#x27;package) (add-to-list &#x27;package-archives &#x27;(&quot;melpa&quot; . &quot;https://melpa.org/packages/&quot;) t) (package-initialize) 
 I can however type the configured melpa-url in my brower, where it works.
 I am on Debian with emacs 29.
 Does anybody have an idea what this problem might me or how to attack it?

                              <span>Hello, I need some help assessing the root of my performance problems when using Emacs, especially while using org mode.
 If while writing an Org document I end up with a rather long paragraph (~550 chars), editing becomes noticeably slow to the point of being pretty annoying and kinda frustrating.
 I ran the profiler of Doom Emacs (https://imgur.com/a/nMYWLOz) and my results show that jit-lock, which IIRC is like a variant of font-lock, and more especifically jit-lock-fontify-keywords-region, is my main culprit here, or at least the most notable one.
 After that, I disabled font-lock-mode in my buffer and the editing was snappy again, so I tried disabling some modes inside that same buffer but to no avail.
 My hunch here is that either I&#x27;m facing an Emacs limitation or maybe it&#x27;s just my hardware being too slow. I&#x27;m leaning more towards the latter, but I&#x27;m pretty new to Emacs so I just don&#x27;t know (and can&#x27;t reliably test this in my other, more powerful laptop).
 So what do you think? What could I do to mitigate this while not sacrificing too much of the eye-candiness of Org?
 Thanks in advance!
 My PC specs:
  
CPU: AMD Ryzen 3 3250U (2 cores, 4 threads @ 2.6 GHz) w/integrated GPU.
 RAM: 12 GB DDR4 @ 2400 MT/s
 Screen: 1920x1080p LCD LED

                              <span>Hi Experts
 ​
 Maybe i am doing this wrong.
 What I want to do is understand what a function in an emacs plugin is doing.
 E.g. I want to understand what consult--fd-make-builder does in consult.el file
 ​
 What i did was copy over the function locally and renamed (rd/consult--fd-make-builder) it and then added the advice
 ​
 lisp (advice-add &#x27;consult--fd-make-builder :override #&#x27;rd/advice-consult--fd-make-builder) 
 ​
 intention is that this will now execute my local function and i can look at it with message
 ​
 Now when i run consult-fd i get
 ​
 lisp apply: Invalid function: (&quot;.&quot;) 
 ​
 i tried just copying the function without renaming.
 ​
 then i get
 ​
 lisp Error running timer: (void-variable cmd) \[2 times\] 
 ​
 ​
 Can someone help me as to how i can do this or what I am doing wrong?
 ​
 TIA
 EDIT: Figured out the issue, looks like lexical scope was defined.

 I have installed and have libtree-sitter-elisp.so (and -lisp.so), but I am having trouble on which mode to use when editing .emacs or other elisp files. There&#x27;s no lisp-ts-mode nor elisp-ts-mode that can be run interactively.
 I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s user error, but what am I doing wrong? (And/or, where should I be searching for this, or what did I miss when searching here?)

                              <span>While doing some package maintenance, I&#x27;ve noticed that when visiting &quot;circe-pkg.el&quot; file, flycheck highlighted the define-package function as obsolete. So I went to the source and found the following, suggesting it has been obsoleted in Emacs 29.1 without a replacement to use:
 (defun define-package ( _name-string _version-string &amp;optional _docstring _requirements &amp;rest _extra-properties) &quot;Define a new package. [...]&quot; (declare (obsolete nil &quot;29.1&quot;) (indent defun)) (error &quot;Don&#x27;t call me!&quot;)) 
 I&#x27;ve checked the git blame output and found nothing useful in the commit message motivating this either:
 ade7a212a882540178d9504e7e0bd3be3bf1fd41 Author: Stefan Kangas  AuthorDate: Mon Jul 11 12:41:50 2022 +0200 Commit: Stefan Kangas  CommitDate: Mon Jul 11 12:51:00 2022 +0200 Parent: c0ced4e4998 Prevent setting user time if the WM doesn&#x27;t support it Merged: emacs-25 Contained: master Follows: emacs-28.1.90 (157359) Precedes: emacs-29.0.90 (6898) * lisp/emacs-lisp/package.el (define-package): Make obsolete. 
 No mention in the NEWS file either or on emacs-devel.
 The best explanation I have for this is the following:
  
You&#x27;re not supposed to call the function, it merely acts as special syntax for package.el to interpret.
 Outright removal of the function is a bad idea due to people looking up its docstring.
 Before actually removing a function, it is obsoleted to detect people still using it and give them ample time to adjust.
  
I still find obsoletion shows the wrong signal here. One is still supposed to use it as seen in the elisp reference and marking the function as obsolete only creates more confusion. What was the motivation to do that?

 ​
 One question that has come to mind though is whether anyone uses &#x60;query-replace&#x60; over &#x60;query-replace-regex&#x60; and if so why? What are the benefits that &#x60;query-replace&#x60; has over its regex alter ego, or conversely am I instead missing some drawbacks to always defaulting to the &#x60;regex&#x60; version?
 ​
 For context, I&#x27;ve rebound &#x60;M-%&#x60; to use the &#x60;regex&#x60; version as it&#x27;s already a bit of an awkward key bind, but am I struggling with Chesterton’s Fence in this case.

 I&#x27;m starting to use .authinfo to save some encrypted information, that works pretty nice. The problem I&#x27;m facing is that Emacs tries to decrypt the authinfo.gpg file eagerly at startup which when running as daemon is kind of problematic.
 Is there a way to delay the decryption of authinfo.gpg until it is needed?

                              <span>So now that treesitter and eglot come with emacs theres no need for all my plugins. Flycheck was giving wierd errors with LSP, replaced it with built in flymake and the errors reporting is spot on. It&#x27;s also really quick now with native comp built in. Thanks to mickey for this guide. Actually didn&#x27;t even need to build from source though I used homebrew as i&#x27;m on an M1. 
 I&#x27;m late to the party on this stuff as i&#x27;ve not been coding on emacs for a couple years now but this stuff is amazing, finaly emacs is coming out the box with the stuff!

                              <span>I&#x27;m a big fan of org-roam and would like to add all of my old notes in there of course! These notes are spread over a lot of directories on my system and in different formats (.txt, .md, .doc). Migration to org-roam will make navigating through all of my notes much more comfortable and I already migrated most of my notes.
 The last notes I want to migrate have a &quot;directory context&quot;. For instance holiday notes in my pictures directory. I am considering to copy/paste these files to org-roam and add a tag to the directory and delete the old note. The downside is that this is kinda an org-roam lock in, because migrating these notes back could be a PITA. If I use a special tag in the roam-note to the original directory then it is possible to migrate the files back with a simple elisp script I guess but could break when directories are renamed in the future. Hopefully I am making myself clear .
 Just before sending this to Reddit a light bulb went off. I could copy/paste the original note in the org-roam note in a code block and tangle it to this directory. I would prefer to not use a code block but something like this seems to be the way.
 How are you guys dealing with old &quot;directory context&quot; notes?

                              <span>Title. I have projectA, and some of it files are .gitignored (for the purposes of version control), but i still would to be able to see in them in emacs when using project-find-file, etc.
 Is there a way to make project.el disregard .gitignore?
 I know i can &quot;(project-find-file &#x27;INCLUDE-ALL)&quot;, but is there a way to set 1 one time so i can M-x project-find-file and it will just work (without any addtional flags.)

                              <span>Hey folks, 
 I&#x27;ve been working professionally in Scala for the last year and a half and it was nothing but unrest.
 First, the Scala 3 migration started this painful event that fragments the already fragmented multi versions hassle that everyone needs to go through 2.12 / 2.13, and now 3. Have to mention, this is not only dependent on our codebase. For example, Databricks is still on 2.12, on the other hand, some new libraries are Scala 3 only, or Scala 2 support was deprecated.
 Then Akka became a non-open source, and we had to find a solution and picked the Typelevel ecosystem.
 There was another &quot;shock&quot; to the ZIO ecosystem when their leader left the project. Fortunately for us, we haven&#x27;t invested in ZIO not a single hour, but this is another negative event in Scala ecosystem.
 After working for half a year with Typelevel, we wrote some services and a few internal libraries. It wasn&#x27;t bad, maybe not as simple as Akka, but it worked as expected. However, it was a huge struggle for half of the team to understand this code and for some to even understand the concept.
 Then Pekko came out and we had another meeting, where 100% of the team voted against using Typelevel again.
 So, we are &quot;officially&quot; using Pekko for all our new services, which is basically the old Akka in maintenance mode. I don&#x27;t see how this stack has any future.
 Now, it looks like a few experimental libraries evolve around virtual threads. My bet this is the future of Scala since they are simple yet powerful as Effect systems.
 But I hear more and more people are saying - until these are ready, there will be &quot;no Scala&quot;, since the language in a rapid decline (sad, but true).
 Sharing this because I&#x27;m tired of the constant unrest in Scala, and curious what strategy your team has regarding this.
 Thanks

                              <span>It seems that SkillsMatter is no more (again), and the videos were completely removed from the internet. The Haskell Foundation, apparently, were able to secure the HaskellExchange videos from them, and are now working towards making them available online on youtube (https://discourse.haskell.org/t/haskell-video-archive-call-for-volunteers/8863)
 Can the Scala Center reach out to the SkillsMatter management and do the same? It would be a terrible shame to lose those amazing talks.

                              <span>So, I just finished a project of writing a programming language on Haskell with an interpreter. I tried to use as few libraries as possible to really learn how everything works. However, this was my first big project with the language (and in designing a language) and I would love some feedback on things. Im sure a seasoned functional programmer would see some other better approaches and i&#x27;m all ears

                              <span>Hi,
 This comes up all the time when I try to write some haskell but I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s a better way to handle it, it happens most often when I am using new type
 Suppose I have a new type
  newtype Matrix &#x3D; Matrix [[Int]] 
 and in function pattern matching I am destructuring it:  invertMatrix :: Matrix -&gt; Maybe Matrix invertMatrix (Matrix xss) &#x3D; ................... 
 but then in the function body I might have to use some other util functions that take the newtype Matrix instead of the internal representation. In this example I probably would need  determinant :: Matrix -&gt; Float 
 This often means I am rewrapping xss in Matrix just to pass it to determinant, which is cumbersome and I don&#x27;t know if that would cause performance issue?
 Is there a way in the function pattern matching to get xss and an additional variable to bind the whole Matrix xss so I can pass it around? I believe in rust for example they have a way to do that by using @ like
  match x { Constructor(inner) @ whole &#x3D;&gt; .... }

                              <span>I&#x27;m a beginner in programing.
 Currently, I&#x27;m reading a Haskell (my first language) book and pretend to make a project with the intent of learning by doing things in practice; the project is: Design a game engine, I know there&#x27;s a big potential of learning with such project, because it involves a lot of things (I also would like to make this engine &quot;a real thing&quot;, if things go the right way)
 As I have read, people don&#x27;t recommend using primarily Haskell for such, and I can&#x27;t tell a lot of the reasons, because I&#x27;m a beginner; the reasons I&#x27;m aware of are:
 1 - Worse performance compared to languages like C/C++/Rust (which is relevant to games).
 2 - Haskell is not mainstream, so there&#x27;s not much development being done with regards to games.
 I&#x27;m not sure if in someway it becomes &quot;bad&quot; to do &quot;game engine things&quot; with a functional language for some strange reason, I believe you guys might have the property to know about it.
 I pretend to learn Rust after getting a good understanding of Haskell (although I believe I might need to learn python first, considering the demand nowadays).
 Regarding the game engine project, I&#x27;d like to know if it would be a good idea to use Rust as the main language while Haskell for a lot of parts of it, or would it be a terrible thing to do? (losing a lot of performance or any other problem associated with this association of Rust + Haskell).
 Thanks to everyone.

                              <span>Hi all,
 I have made a guide on how to play media (local and remote) using Emacs and MPV so it works with unified config across both Linux and Android.
 To install and configure the GUI Emacs app on Android and see my unified configuration file you can check out my dotfiles on danijelcamdzic/dotemacs and also read about it in one of my previous posts - Sharing my Emacs workflow and dotfiles
 Up until now, I wasn&#x27;t able to get a working config which would allow me to play media through the MPV commands in my Android Emacs but I have figured it out and would like to share the steps for anyone who, like me, wishes to quickly check out their knowledge base, movie collection, song collection etc. in Emacs and quickly play them on your phone.
 The steps are described in my README - MPV section and this is how it looks like when I try to play a video on my Emacs Android:

                              <span>I need some help resolving a gap in my understanding of elisp. I have a hard time understanding what kinds of arguments a function expects. Here is an example with define-key, but happens to me with lots of functions. Basically, I can never tell if an argument needs to be quoted. Correct usage of define-key:
  (define-key gnus-article-map (kbd &quot;i&quot;) #&#x27;gnus-article-show-images) 
 I frequently make the error where I think I am supposed to quote the keymap. I have to look up some old code to see, oh yeah, you don&#x27;t quote the keymap.
 Then when I use use-package, I would write
 (use-package gnus :bind (:map gnus-article-map (&quot;i&quot; . gnus-article-show-images))) 
 Now the function gnus-article-show-images is unquoted, I guess, because this is a macro? The structure of the arg list to :bind is unclear from the function documentation, so I just have to look up another example where I used :bind to figure out the format. Anther example, in general-define-key both keymap and function are quoted. Why?
 What am I missing so that I can better understand whether args need to be quoted or not?

                              <span>Hi all!
 As you may know, mu4e is an email client for emacs. It consists of a server program that scans your email messages and an emacs program talking to this server program, as well as a number of command-line utilities.
 I&#x27;m happy to announce mu 1.12, a new stable release which has been in development for ca. 1 year since the 1.10.
 Some highlights:
  
Significant speedups in both mu and mu4e 
 Reworked message composition, closer to its Gnus origins which adds many of its features
 Overhauled the query parser; squashing a number of bugs/limitations, incl. dealing with CJK messages 
 Experimental folding of message threads 
 Better and faster indexing of HTML messages 
 Experimental search by (human) language wit CLD2

 If I add the following line to config.el in .config/doom on linux
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; (setq doom-font (font-spec :family &quot;FreeSans&quot; :size 20))
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 I do not see any modification after stoping the emacs window and then turning it back on
 If I try doom/reload-fond I receive a warning in the .config/emacs/lisp/lib/fonts.el about unknown type: font.
 I have checked that the font exist with M-x describe font.

                              <span>justl is a major mode for driving justfiles. Justfiles are a way to save and run project-specific commands. Think of them like Makefiles, but they are purely focused on running commands and processes, and not for a build system.
 ​
 This mode gives the ability to execute just recipes from within the editor itself.
 ​
 The new release with the changelog details here: https://github.com/psibi/justl.el/blob/master/Changelog.org#014
 ​
 The major highlight in this release is support for per recipe buffer and a major rewrite from Steve Purcell.

                              <span>(edit, using org-roam, obviously... should have mentioned that in the title...)
 I am trying to extend the functionality of the roam buffer so that it not only updates to show backlinks for the node at point, but also so if point wanders over a link, it will show backlinks for the linked node, rather than the node I currently have open. I tried advising org-roam-node-at-point like this (code generated with chatgpt&#x27;s help, apologies if anything is wrong; my elisp-fu is weak):
 ​
 (defun my-org-roam-node-at-point (&amp;optional assert) &quot;Return the Org-roam node at point if it exists, or the node corresponding to the link at point.&quot; (interactive) (let ((id (plist-get (link-hint--get-link-at-point) :args))) (if (and id (string-prefix-p &quot;id:&quot; id)) (progn (print (substring id 3)) (org-roam-node-from-id (substring id 3))) (org-roam-node-at-point )))) (advice-add &#x27;org-roam-node-at-point :override #&#x27;my-org-roam-node-at-point) 
 This doesn&#x27;t work, but it does succeed at breaking the roam-buffer, so I suspect an approach sort of like this could work, but I&#x27;m in over my depth. Anyone have any ideas, insight, or a snippet that does this already?
 ​
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hello, so I&#x27;m currently in uni trying my best to manage my time and I&#x27;ve found org-agenda very useful for that cuz of how simple it is. I am kinda new to doom emacs and org, but I&#x27;ve learnt how to set reoccuring tasks (refer to ss attached). However, only recently this issue has occured where tasks of previous days e.g. MATH1061 LEC1, scheduled for a monday, is at the bottom of Friday? Maybe i&#x27;ve accidently turned on a setting or there&#x27;s a syntax error. Thank you!

                              <span>Hi,
 I don&#x27;t have a lot experience with emacs and so I am pretty sure I am doing something wrong here as this is simply too tedious...
 What I am trying to do is to attach a file without a mouse, just by using a keyboard.
 Currently this is how it looks like:
 I want to attach a file to I press C-c c-a to open the attachment-dispatcher where I press another &quot;a&quot;. This gives me a prompt at the bottom. I now press &quot;tab&quot; and the prompt tells me (I write this from memory) something about &quot;not unique&quot;, so I press &quot;tab&quot; another time and now I get a new windows where I can select a file - but this window does not have focus. So I now press C-x o to switch to this window where I finally can select the file to attach...
 I find this extremely clumsy - so could someone please let me know how to properly attach a file using only a keyboard?

                              <span>I am practicing identifiying the types of given functions and I seem to have grasped the concept only partly - I have problems with functions that are defined through other functions. 
 Example : evens &#x3D; filter even
 Since 
 filter :: (a -&gt; Bool) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [a] 
 and 
 even :: Integral a &#x3D;&gt; a -&gt; Bool 
 I thought it should be 
 Integral a &#x3D;&gt; (a -&gt; Bool) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [a]
 But :t gave me Integral a &#x3D;&gt; [a] -&gt; [a]
 Why excactly is Bool not part of it? 
 I tried to find an answer but maybe this is too specific or simple. 
 Help would be appreciated.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve settled on using tab-line for my tabbing because it fits my normal workflow. However I like my tabs to basically operate the same way as in the browser and terminal. After some work and references to the tab-bar implementation I finally have drag and drop tab movement working. The prerequisite is keeping the tabs in a fixed order (also a desired behavior) rather than relying on whatever happens to be the state of buffer-list as is the default.

 This seems like really bizarre behavior to me, and I&#x27;d really prefer it to only use the lsp server for the current project. 
 ​
 Anybody know how to get that working that way?

                              <span>Hi Experts
 ​
 A very basic question. I am very new to emacs so please bear with me.
 ​
 I understand how to pass arguments to an elisp function.
 ​
 but not able to comprehend how to use it in conjunction with a list
 for example
 (interactive (list (read-shell-command (if shell-command-prompt-show-cwd (format-message &quot;Async shell command in &#x60;%s&#x27;: &quot; (abbreviate-file-name default-directory)) &quot;Async shell command: &quot;) nil nil (let ((filename (cond (buffer-file-name) ((eq major-mode &#x27;dired-mode) (dired-get-filename nil t))))) (and filename (file-relative-name filename)))) current-prefix-arg shell-command-default-error-buffer ) ) 
 i can understand what this code does, but because i dont understand how/what arguments the list will take e.g. &#x60;read-shell-command&#x60;/&#x60;current-prefix-arg&#x60;/&#x60;shell-command-default-error-buffer&#x60;/&#x60;read-string&#x60;
 i am having a hard time creating one myself.
 ​
 Can someone please explain this to me in a simple way?
 Also what all can i pass?
 ​
 i can think of command line arguments in couple of forms:
  
shell command
 string
 integer
 file
 buffers
 perfix
  
etc.
 I am guessing there will be a particular form of these commands i should use.
 TIA

Perhaps point people to How to Ask Questions the Smart Way in the rules or posting guidelines?

 folks from emacs have always been saying that emacs offers a better and well Integrated interface to command line, ie EMACS REPLACES YOUR TERMINAL i am curious to hear your thoughts on similar kind of easy of use in emacs, as shown in video, to avoid a proprietary terminal emulator and go foss.
 i update the post with a shorter 3 min demo of their product

                              <span>Hi,
 Jetbrains Inttelij Idea / NeoVim user here. I&#x27;m thinking about installing Emacs (org-mode is the main selling point) and switching (at least from NeoVim) to Emacs/Doom Emacs. While I was reading about how to install it, I found that there are a couple of different emacs releases that can be installed: 
  
If I search Homebrew for the &quot;Emacs&quot; term, there is one cask called &quot;emacs&quot;, let&#x27;s call it &quot;standard&quot;.
 But there is also &quot;emacs-plus&quot; which should be first tapped: https://github.com/d12frosted/homebrew-emacs-plus?tab&#x3D;readme-ov-file
  
I have a couple of questions: 
  
I&#x27;m wondering what is the &quot;correct&quot; way to install emacs on MacBook Pro M1 with Sonoma - standard or plus release.
 If emacs-plus is the correct way should I include those additional flags like &quot;--with-native-comp&quot; and if yes which ones?
 If emacs-plus is the correct way, what is better to use &quot;emacs-plus@29&quot; or just use the latest version? I guess that if I just use the latest version, then it will be updated whenever I run brew update and upgrade, and I&#x27;m not sure how things are going in emacs world with those updates. I used to have problems with NeoVim updates, as well as plugin updates, so at one point in time, I was afraid to run plugin updates :) Hope Emacs is more stable.
  
Thanks in advance.

                              <span>I feel like this should be pretty obvious, but i&#x27;m pulling my hair out on the order of operations here.
 I want to customize some faces with a box. And i want that box to use a color from my current theme. But i don&#x27;t want to hard code the color value, but for it to use the dark or light color of the modus theme, depending on which is loaded on starting.
 So far i have tried using the function modus-themes-get-color-value but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be available at the point the tab-line gets activated. Then i tried this at the very end of my init.el:
 (custom-set-faces &#x27;(tab-line ((t (:box (:line-width (5 . 5) :color ,(face-background &#x27;tab-line)))))) ) 
 Which seems to be run before the theme is loaded, as i&#x27;m getting a white box on the modus-vivendi theme.
 I tried setting this up in a use-package statement for the tab-line-mode, for the modus theme and for the emacs pseudo package. I tried adding :after (modus-themes) to the use-package statement for the tab-line. All without success. I don&#x27;t even want it to track the theme when i change it after starting emacs. Just, get the background of the tab-line at start, after the modus-theme is loaded and use that for the box color.
 I feel like i&#x27;m somehow overthinking this. How can i get the tab-line border to look right regardless of the configured theme? Is this a case of having to set up a variable for your theme and then making this into a cond statement with hardcoded Color Values? This should work for now, but would mean i&#x27;d have to rewrite the any time i want to change themes.
 Just for completeness, here&#x27;s the entire config, if anyone want&#x27;s to take a look:

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently trying to generate a list of all times backups on my various servers are scheduled. There is a property &quot;BCKSCHED&quot; assigned to each server heading with the time as string. Like
 :PROPERTIES: :BCKSCHED: 01:00 :END: 
 I tried to use org-ql to generate a dynamic block that shows all times as a table. My dynamic block looks like this:
 #+BEGIN: org-ql :query &quot;property: BCKSCHED&quot; :columns (heading property) #+END: 
 When I run it with C-c C-c I get the error
 Symbol&#x27;s function definition is void: org-dblock-write:org-ql 
 So I tried a minimal example like this
 #+BEGIN: org-ql :query &quot;todo: &quot; :columns (heading property) #+END: 
 And also the example from the repository
 #+BEGIN: org-ql :query &quot;todo: priority:A,B&quot; :columns (todo (priority &quot;P&quot;) ((property &quot;agenda-group&quot;) &quot;Group&quot;) deadline heading) :sort (deadline priority) :take 7 :ts-format &quot;%Y-%m-%d %H:%M&quot; #+END: 
 But both have the same error as a result. What am I doing wrong here?

                              <span>Hi all! I compiled a hello world library with sbt-assembly, and linked the jar in a Kotlin Android Studio project. The Scala library targets Java 1.8: javacOptions ++&#x3D; Seq(&quot;-source&quot;, &quot;1.8&quot;, &quot;-target&quot;, &quot;1.8&quot;). The symbols from the Scala code are being resolved, however deploying to the device fails. I removed the annotated main function as it is seemingly mentioned in the error, but it didn&#x27;t help. Any idea how to fix this?

                              <span>I posted about using outline-mode for elisp about 5 years ago and I&#x27;ve gone a bit potty since then on folding most everything I work with - to the extent that I&#x27;ve even dropped most org-mode usage to outline-mode as I never really used the funky stuff (like agenda, todo etc).
 The motivation is that it makes viewing, organising and editing these files so much easier without the need to maintain +BEGIN/END SRC blocks and the tangling that comes with using org mode.
 I&#x27;ve also implemented the imenu index stuff so that I can have an alphabetic index to my headings.
 So far, I&#x27;ve converted elisp mode, org mode, sway, i3wm and waybar configurations to be folding with outline mode. The dotfiles are in my gitlab repo.

                              <span>Hello!
 I am using diff-hl and having a weird issue - in a repository I am unable to stage hunks of files that are not in the root directory of a git project. I am getting an error message when calling &#x60;(diff-hl-stage-diff (current-buffer))&#x60; or just calling the &#x60;diff-hl-stage-current-hunk&#x60; interactive function. 
 error
 Now, as you can see from the screenshot, the &#x60;git apply ...&#x60; tries a temp file but the path is relative to the root of the project instead of the file that I am in.
 I traced it back to vc-git-command but am not proficient in elisp so can&#x27;t make sense of it.
 Has anyone encountered a similar issue?

                              <span>eat is a great terminal inside emacs. I&#x27;m curious if there is a way to make the buffer&#x27;s name show the current path. In vterm, we can set vterm-buffer-name-string to make this, but it seems there is no similar option for eat.

 Thanks.

                              <span>I used doom emacs for a while, but over the last couple of weeks wrote my own config, to be a bit more flexible.
 I want to use org-agenda, and in doom emacs I just let it check all my files under &quot;~/org/&quot;, so I can create TODOs everywhere and don&#x27;t have to think about what I should be putting in which todo file - or manage a single one.
 To achieve this, I have the following lines in my init.el:
 emacs-lisp (use-package org :pin org :commands (org-capture org-agenda) :config ;; agenda (setq org-agenda-start-with-log-mode t) (setq org-log-done &#x27;time) (setq org-log-into-drawer t) (setq org-directory &quot;~/org/&quot;) (setq org-agenda-files &#x27;(&quot;~/org/&quot;))) 
 I always run emacs as a daemon, and this is annoying for two reasons: 1. My recentf history is always filled with org files. I want them there, but not if they were opened by the org-agenda scan 2. I have a lot of org buffers initially
 How can I solve this? Or am I doing something which is not intended? I had the same setup in doom emacs, but never noticed that my recentf history or my buffers are spammed with agenda files. I want the agenda files on startup to work with the emacs-dashboard. I&#x27;m somewhat confused that this is not a more common problem, as I&#x27;m not sure how else I should be using org-agenda
 What I tried so far
  
do not keep org-agenda-files open after generating agenda I don&#x27;t understand that quiet though, I don&#x27;t want a solution that closes buffers when I close the agenda buffer
 Prevent recentf from being flooded - Reddit I neither want to ignore all my org files though

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I have a huge org file, and I get this error &quot;end of file during parsing&quot;.
 This usually means I have parenthesis not matching somewhere, I started removing the chapters of my files one by one, and retried to tangle: no change, I got the same error everytime, this does not make sense to me, I should have been able to tangle at some point!!
 I tried with a diff (I have a backup of this file), but I am not good at reading diff buffers (and I only discovered difftastic yesterday... that I can not implement, due to the error...).
 It forces me to get better at dealing with changes in my configuration &#x3D;&#x3D;&gt; I will better document the changes from now on (Magit)
 Now to my question:
 Is there an emacs function that checks code blocks only, ignoring the litterate content? Using the #+BEGIN_SRC and #+END_SRC entries to locate the blocks, and only checking the content for syntax errors?
 Thanks for your support!!

                              <span>I loved my emacs exwm environment so much. But I had to let go of her eventually because I needed IDE features easily. I mainly work in python and sometimes in typescript, rust. 
 Adding language support (Go to function definition, syntax checking) always proved to be difficult for me. Almost never configured one successfully.
 So I finally just went with VS code. I want to go back to my emacs EXWM full setup. Any recommendations on how I can handle the language support part?
 Note: spacemacs support for EXWM was not so good. Or it might just be my inexperience with it.

                              <span>Have you ever thought to yourself, why should I give Emacs commands like a plebian, when an LLM can just control Emacs for me? Well the first step is now done, we now have a way to make any elisp command callable by an LLM that does function calling. For example, here is me switching buffers by telling the LLM to switch buffers by just describing the buffer I want switched to. It&#x27;s not exactly a huge time-saver, but it&#x27;s cool and shows the potential.
 ​

 In my llm package, I&#x27;ve created a new function calling branch after learning that Ollama will soon support function calling. Right now both Open AI and Gemini do this (but Gemini has some limitations). As part of that, I have a utility to use function calling to create function definitions for elisp functions (which aren&#x27;t really rich enough in information to be passed to function calls as-is).
 I&#x27;ll be thinking about interesting new interactions that can be built off by having the LLM just control emacs via a few predefined commands. But it&#x27;s quite useful for certain things where you want the LLM to produce structured information. For example, I created a function that will create an example sentence given a word in a language, and then it can be passed to anki, etc. These things were a bit painful to do previously.
 As normal, I&#x27;m not planning on creating an actual end-user package here, but I want to encourage people to think about what can be done using function calling and, if there is something you want to put into a package, use the &#x60;llm&#x60; package to make it easy and portable (somewhat). Ideas and feedback are most welcome!

                              <span>I am a noob trying to set up the init.el file from scratch.
 ​
 I want to load a custom theme (aircon-theme) which is available at list-packages. I have created a folder called el inside .emacs.d In the el folder I have a core folder which has a theme.el file whose content is 
 (use-package aircon-theme :ensure t)
 In the init.el , I refer to the theme via 
 (load-file (expand-file-name &quot;el/core/theme.el&quot; user-emacs-directory))
 I was hoping this would auto-load the theme. However this only downloaded the aircon-theme, which I then selected manually using the drop down menu.
 ​
 Can someone point out why this method was not sucessful and what can be done to autoload the theme?

                              <span>In procedural/OOP laguages, for loops are O(1) space because they can mutate a single variable.
 If each iteration in a functional program is a recursive function call, would it result in n levels of recursion and hence O(n) space usage in the stack? This seems pretty absurd but I can&#x27;t find any resources on this.

                              <span>And I do mean basic! Barely qualifies as a DSL.
 In short, I need/want a way to attach some color metadata to some text, and be able to concatenate those together. I want a bunch of concatenated items to (ideally) be the same type as a single item. (A Semigroup, in other words, I think?) And of course a function that prints it out to the terminal.
 So I want to do something like:
 t &#x3D; R &quot;some red text, &quot;  G &quot;some green text, &quot;  Y &quot;and some yellow!&quot; printColor t 
 I&#x27;ve tried a couple of ways and haven&#x27;t been super happy, wondering if there&#x27;s a better way!
 Attempt 1
 data ColorText &#x3D; R Text -- red | G Text -- green | Y Text -- yellow | N Text -- no color, default | Arr [ColorText] 
 ...and I made it an instance of Semigroup. This recursive definition worked fine practically speaking, bu…</span>

 I want the following behaviour for RET: If I am on a link it should follow it, otherwise I want it to call org-cycle.
 What I cannot figure out atm (being an emacs-noob) is how to test if point is currently located on a link.
 So could someone please explain to me how to test for a link at point?

                              <span>Reading through the Elisp of alphapapa&#x27;s immensely useful package burly.el, I came across this function definition:
 (defun burly--bookmark-window-state-hack (&amp;optional _)
 (unwind-protect
 (progn
 (cl-assert burly--window-state)
 (window-state-put burly--window-state (frame-root-window)))
 (setf bookmark-after-jump-hook (delete #&#x27;burly--bookmark-window-state-hack bookmark-after-jump-hook)
 burly--window-state nil)))
 I could not figure out the function argument, &quot;_&quot;. The function body does not reference it. The argument&#x27;s name seems to be intentionally non-descriptive.
 I Googled for information about Emacs and the underscore character but found nothing helpful. Then I asked ChatGPT, which replied:
 ​
  
In Emacs Lisp, when the underscore _ character is used as an argument to a function, it conventionally indicates that the argument is not used within the function body. This is a way to signal to other programmers that the argument is intentionally ignored or not relevant to the function&#x27;s operation.
  
If the argument is intentionally ignored, at it seems to be, why include it in the first place? Especially when the argument is &amp;optional anyway? What does it add to the function?

                              <span>I am using lsp-mode with company to edit some Python files. I noticed though that when I use it to edit C my company completions are much more complete. As an example, if I type in 
  void main(){ pri } 
 and select the top option (printf) it gives me
  #include  void main(){ printf(const char *, ...) }  Which puts my cursor on the first argument.
 But if I type in pri in Python and select print it just completes the word without even adding the parenthesis at the end. As a more complete example, I am working with a postgresql database and I type in 
  connection &#x3D; psycopg2.con  and it completes it to connection &#x3D; psycopg2.connect but without parens and it also doesn&#x27;t add in the arguments like how C does with printf. Is this an lsp limitation with Python? I am using an up to date company mode and lsp mode with pyright as my python lsp and clangd as my C lsp.

 If it is possible to find out or create a function in Emacs that can accomplish the same effect in Vim, is it a straightforward matter of binding the key sequence to the function?
 Does the evil framework provide some support for this?
 I was thinking whether there was an automated way of accomplishing this but on reflection it seems impossible.

                              <span>Hi Experts
 Newbie here, I wanted to open file under cursor in a split ... so wrote this elisp function.
 ​
 Just FYI using DOOM emacs.
 (defun rd/evil-find-file-at-point-with-line-split() &quot;lets extend the evil-find-file-at-point-with-line function to open in a split&quot; (interactive) (require &#x27;evil-commands) (let ((display-buffer-alist &#x27;((&quot;&quot; (display-buffer-reuse-window display-buffer-below-selected)))) (parent-file (current-buffer))) (evil-find-file-at-point-with-line) (split-window-vertically (- height)) (other-window 1) (pop-to-buffer (parent-file)) ) ) (define-key evil-normal-state-map (kbd &quot;C-w C-f&quot;) &#x27;rd/evil-find-file-at-point-with-line-split) 
 It works very inconsistently. File does open but sometimes in the same window, sometimes in a vertical split and sometimes in horizontal split(the intended).
 ​
 Can someone please point out what i am doing wrong?
 ​
 TIA

                              <span>Hi all.
 I&#x27;m facing strange problem and couldn&#x27;t figure out.
 Whenever I turn on jinx-mode in latex buffer, auctex (e.g. LaTeX-mode) automatically turned off and switched to latex-mode.
 Same issue occurs when I turn on jinx-mode globally.
 jinx-mode is perfectly working in other major-mode and auctex also works fine if jinx-mode is not turned on. 
 I tried to reinstall both packages and config them with many different settings
 but still no luck. 
 These are part of my configs. What am I missing?
 (use-package auctex :demand t :ensure (auctex :pre-build ((&quot;./autogen.sh&quot;) (&quot;./configure&quot; &quot;--without-texmf-dir&quot; &quot;--with-packagelispdir&#x3D;./&quot; &quot;--with-packagedatadir&#x3D;./&quot;) (&quot;make&quot;)) :build (:not elpaca--compile-info) ;; Make will take care of this step :files (&quot;*.el&quot; &quot;doc/*.info*&quot; &quot;etc&quot; &quot;images&quot; &quot;latex&quot; &quot;style&quot;) :version (lambda (_) (require &#x27;tex-site) AUCTeX-version))) (use-package latex :ensure nil :mode (&quot;\\.tex\\&#x27;&quot; . LaTeX-mode) :after auctex :config (setq-default TeX-master nil) (setq-default TeX-command-extra-options &quot;--shell-escape&quot;)) (use-package jinx :demand t :bind ([remap ispell-word] . jinx-correct) :hook (emacs-startup . global-jinx-mode) :config (setq jinx-languages &quot;en&quot;) (set-face-attribute &#x27;jinx-misspelled nil :underline &#x27;(:color &quot;#ffcc00&quot; :style wave)))

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to get more in-depth in Haskell currently by doing the protohackers.com challenges. These challenges require your program to be a TCP server, accept connections, read some data (sometimes binary, sometimes UTF-8 encoded strings), and reply with some meaningful data.
 I&#x27;ve made decent headway in Haskell&#x27;s flavor of socket programming, using Network.Socket and Network.Socket.ByteString, and have successfully solved the first challenge. I find myself struggling with the myriad ByteString types, in that I&#x27;m constantly fighting to determine which flavor of ByteString each function needs and how to convert between them. When there&#x27;s this much of a struggle, I feel like I might be going about it the wrong way and would appreciate any insight here.
 My ByteString related imports:

                              <span>Hi there. I have a big org file that, after a batch conversion, is displaying all Spanish characters (ñ, á, é, í, ó, ú) with digits combinations. But only with I open it with emacs, not with any other editors like leafpad or mousepad. Any tip? 
 This is a sample of what I see: 
  
Trascripci\303\263n del texto escrito durante el d\303\255a del 30 de junio de 2016...
  
But open in leafpad, I see this: 
  
Trascripción del texto escrito durante el día del 30 de junio de 2016...

                              <span>Update: I can make all tables foldable by changing name to result, ex: +NAME: mytable1 to +RESULTS: mytable1. Not sure what are the cons in this &quot;solution&quot;. It&#x27;s better than incapsulating table in block BEGIN/END.
 Wonder why can&#x27;t be tables (+NAME blocks) be foldable by default? There is so many posts on stackoverflow, etc about it.
  
Original OP: Hello everyone!
 I use org tables with +NAME: field and usually no code block, example
 +NAME: mytable1
 | | col1 | col2 | col3 |
 | row1 | 5 | 10 | aaa |
 | row2 | 10 | 20 | bbb |
 | row3 | 10 | 40 | ccc |
 and i need to be able to fold them. I searched through different solutions online, and seems all stoped working due to recent org update.

 Is it possible to manually select which files go into each project? Example:
 I have following project strucutre:
 myproject/ 
 -----------/.git 
 -----------/mynotes.org 
 -----------/scripts/ 
 -----------/tests/ 
 -----------/logs/ 
 -----------/data/
 that&#x27;s the most logical dir set-up and most conveniet way to access file for me most of the time.
 However sometimes say i am working on &quot;pull_rss_feeds&quot; part of my project and need to access related files in scripts, tests, logs, data folders. So is there a way to manually create project pull_rss_feeds and tell exactly what files i want to be part of this projects?
 Another use case is my emacs config. Part of config is in my emacs folder, part is in .emacs.d folder... I would like to manually create emacs project and tell exactly where files are.

                              <span>I want to use Eglot when editing HTML or CSS files. From Eglot&#x27;s source code,
 (html-mode . ,(eglot-alternatives &#x27;((&quot;vscode-html-language-server&quot; &quot;--stdio&quot;) (&quot;html-languageserver&quot; &quot;--stdio&quot;)))) ((css-mode css-ts-mode). ,(eglot-alternatives &#x27;((&quot;vscode-css-language-server&quot; &quot;--stdio&quot;) (&quot;css-languageserver&quot; &quot;--stdio&quot;)))) 
 In order to install these language servers, I tried to use npm but I&#x27;m not very familiar with it. In particular, if I don&#x27;t want to install them using root privileges, what should I do? npm install -g vscode-langservers-extracted for example, attempts to install everything in /usr/local/lib/node_modules.
 I also tried npm install --save vscode-langservers-extracted to get all packages in a folder but have no idea how to hook it with Eglot.

                              <span>tl;dr: what i want is fuzzy find my way through my projects, and then after choosing one, all the buffers or terminals get re-opened from last time.
 if you don&#x27;t know projectile. it&#x27;s basically a package that let&#x27;s you index all your project directories so that later you can just fuzzy find your way to what you want to work on.
 so you look for the project -&gt; tap enter -&gt; then you will be prompted to choose the file from inside that project.
 this is great. but if i close emacs and then i open it again (for whatever reason) i have to look for and re-open the same files i was working on.
 i guess what i need is a way to fuzzy find through my projects (like in projectile) but instead of prompting with choosing a file (after i pick a project) it will re-open the same buffers that were opened last time.
 ps: i sort of asked about this before but i think that i didn&#x27;t communicate my issue properly.
 thanks

                              <span>Hi guys i&#x27;m totally new to emacs and here (this is my first post).
 Let me describe my problem: i installed typescript-language-server protocol on emacs and via npm (don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s required btw, installing both for my system and emacs).
 After 5-6 hours strulling i did it ! I got it working, now i can select any .js file in my react folder, i can activate lsp by &quot;C-x lsp&quot;, works totally great until i move on another .js file. The language server works for only one file i&#x27;m currently on, i need to enable it for every .js file and that&#x27;s odd. Can you help me ? Thanks in advance !
 Edit: Thank you u/Bortolo_II , i solved the problem by adding (add-hook &#x27;js-mode-hook &#x27;lsp) to my ~/.config/doom/config.el file then did doom sync and everyting is fine now !

                              <span>I have been a sporadic Emacs user. it has been my fav text editor. I love its infinite extensibility compared to alternatives like Vim. However I have been wondering if Emacs is on its way down.
 I guess it all started with the birth of NeoVim about a decade back. The project quickly grew and added features which made it better of an IDE than stock Vim (I think). Now i know Vim is not designed to be an IDE, but many NeoVim users seem to want that functionality. Today neovim has plugins t not only code and autocomplete, but also debug code in most languages. i lbelieve it has been steadily attracting users of stock Vim (and of course Emacs)
 Then enter, VSCode about 6 years ago. I guess this project attracted a lot of users from aother text editors (including Emacs). Today it has an extension for everything. Being backed by microsoft means its always going to be better.
 Now whenever I try to look up solutions for Emacs issues on the web, most posts i see are at least 10 years old. For example, I googled for turning Emacs into a web dev IDE. A lot of reddit and Stackoverflow posts that the search turned up were more than a decade old.
 I am wondering if Emacs is on a steady decline . The fact that it is not available by default on many systems seems to be an additional nail in its grave. Even on this sub, a lot of Emacs lovers who used to post regularly, like redguardfoo and Xah are no longer active
 This makes me sad. I absolutely hate having to install a browser disguised as a text editor (VS Code) which will be obsolete probably by another 5 years. I hope that Emacs stays around. Its infinite extensibility is what i love the most (and of course elisp) 
 Would like to hear your thoughts

Yank works successfully and kill/save only works when running the function under edebug… it successfully shows up in my system when stepping through and just letting it continue. But when I disable debug on entry it stops working again.
 In debug mode I see it enters the following function, iterates through some selection stuff, then shows up in my clipboard. Has anyone seen this before, the C code hasn’t seem to changed in years. https://github.com/emacsmirror/emacs/blob/670e8db683c94cfaf7c3328b47be54147795250f/src/pgtkselect.c#L143.

                              <span>In the world of Emacs, there&#x27;s a perennial debate between purists who swear by Emacs&#x27; native keybindings and those who find solace in the familiarity of Vim keybindings through Evil Mode. Proponents of Emacs keybindings argue for their extensibility and deep integration with Emacs&#x27; ecosystem, while advocates of Evil Mode tout its efficiency and the muscle memory carried over from Vim.
 For those who&#x27;ve made the switch, what are your experiences with either Emacs keybindings or Evil Mode? Did you find one to be more intuitive or productive than the other? How seamless was the transition from Vim to Evil Mode within Emacs? And for Emacs veterans, do you find that sticking to Emacs keybindings offers advantages that outweigh the allure of Evil Mode?
 Share your thoughts, tips, and insights on navigating the Emacs keybindings vs. Vim (Evil Mode) dilemma in Emacs, and help others find their preferred path to a more efficient editing experience.

                              <span>I&#x27;m in charge of a small team working on a small web app, which is a typescript/express project. It&#x27;s still pretty small, and I&#x27;m already seeing it spiral into the spaghettiverse. I do plenty of code reviews, we refactor stuff, we make healthy use of generics and tests, but it still doesn&#x27;t feel clean.
 For context: I&#x27;ve only ever worked on awful codebases. My biggest work project before this was a php + symfony project that was so riddled with dependency hell that the previous devs couldn&#x27;t get composer to work, so they started FTP&#x27;ing the dependencies around to new instances (and to new dev&#x27;s work computers!!).
 So this is the first time I feel like I have an opportunity to work with something that isn&#x27;t a mess. I thought that typescript with a strict focus on type safety would do the tr…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to get stack traces from a live running GHC (version 9.2.2) compiled Haskell program. 
 I understand I need to send SIGQUIT to the process to get the stacktraces of the currently running threads.
 But everytime I do this I just get the message: &quot;This build does not support backtraces.&quot;
 This is what I have done:
  
Our build is using nix, so I&#x27;ve added the following to the overrides for the GHC build:
  
 ghc &#x3D; old.ghc.overrideAttrs (oldAttrs: { configureFlags &#x3D; oldAttrs.configureFlags ++ [&quot;--enable-dwarf-unwind&quot;]; buildInputs &#x3D; oldAttrs.buildInputs ++ [pkgs.elfutils]; }); 
  
I&#x27;ve added the following flags to all the builds of our packages:
  
 -ticky -g -fprof-auto -fprof-auto-calls 
  
I added the flag --enable-debug-info to the cabal build command. 
  
I don&#x27;t know what else to do. The docs say:
  
On POSIX-compatible platforms GHC’s runtime system (when built with libdw support) will produce a stack trace on stderr when a SIGQUIT signal is received
  
It doesn&#x27;t say here how to build with libdw support, but I read somewhere elsewhere that one needed to add --enable-dwarf-unwind, and indeed when I did that the GHC build initially complained about not being about to find the libdw library until I added elfutils to the buildInputs.
 The error message also doesn&#x27;t make it clear whether the build of GHC doesn&#x27;t support backtraces or the build of my executable doesn&#x27;t support backtraces. Which makes hunting this down even more difficult.
 What am I missing? Is there anyway to ask GHC whether it&#x27;s compiled with libdw support so I can at least work out whether the problem is with the GHC build or the build of my executable?
 (x-post from https://discourse.haskell.org/t/how-to-get-stack-traces-out-of-ghc-executables/8844 sorry I&#x27;m not sure the best place for these questions)

                              <span>I’m a software engineer (using TypeScript and Rust mostly) working mainly in Web Development and some Enterprise/Desktop Development.
 I recently used Haskell for the 2023 Advent of Code and fell in love with it. I’d love to work more with Haskell professionally, but it doesn’t seem widely used in Web Development.
 Folks using Haskell professionally: what’s your role/industry? How did you get into that type of work? Do you have any advice for someone interested in a similar career?
 Edit: thanks for all the responses so far! It&#x27;s great to see Haskell being used in so many diverse ways! It&#x27;s my stop-looking-at-screens time for the night, so I wish you all a good night (or day as the case may be). I really appreciate everyone for sharing your experiences and I&#x27;ll check in with y&#x27;all tomorrow!

This is another installment of the What Are You Working On? thread. Add to this discussion by telling us about your zettelkasten journey. Share with us what you&#x27;re learning. Sharing helps me and, hopefully, you, too. It helps me clarify my goals and visualize my thinking. And sometimes, a conversation sparks a magical moment where we can dive into an idea worth exploring. We&#x27;d love to hear more from you.  🫵🏼
Ideas I&#x27;m exploring with my ZK:
I&#x27;m adventuring on the path of a project-filled life. I&#x27;m using my ZK to document and reflect on ideas and progress centered around a project-filled life. I&#x27;m coming to this late in life; I&#x27;m 67, but that doesn&#x27;t matter. I&#x27;m here now, and I&#x27;ve started. We&#x27;ll see.
Why create a routine of short knowledge cycles, because it&#x27;s a simple process of recording and reviewing.
I&#x27;m looking at OpenAI&#x27;s ChatGPT as a tutor for exploring ideas.
I&#x27;m using my ZK to explore what it means to have an intellectual life.
Things I&#x27;m reading:
Sertillanges, A. G. and Ryan, Mary. The Intellectual Life: Its Spirit, Conditions, Methods. 1987.
Zentner, Jeff. The Serpent King. First Ember edition, Ember, an imprint of Random House Children’s Books, a division of Penguin Random House LLC, 2017.

I&#x27;m tempted to try replacing the current buttons it depends on with a tree widget or perhaps try my hand at getting the caret icon to change from left to down depending on whether the subsection is folded or not.

I also have the grammars (TS and TSX) installed with treesit-install-language-grammar from GitHub.
 The treesit-font-lock-level is the default 3.
 It seems to work OK except that it does not color the code (for instance, the HTML tags and classes):
 Am I missing something important in my configuration?

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently trying to save my org files after every change. I know this might be sub optimal but I want to finish this at least for the purpose of learning how to do something like this.
 So my approach was to add a hook for org mode that adds a hook for after-change-functions. Unfortunately this is active for all files once I&#x27;ve opened an org file. This is the code
 (defun savebuf(begin end length) (if (and (buffer-file-name) (buffer-modified-p)) (save-buffer))) (add-hook &#x27;org-mode-hook (lambda() (add-hook &#x27;after-change-functions &#x27;savebuf))) 
 So I added another hook for major mode changes to remove the after-change-functions hook like this
 (defun leave-org-mode-function() (when (eq major-mode &#x27;org-mode) (lambda() (remove-hook &#x27;after-change-functions &#x27;savebuf)))) (add-hook &#x27;change-major-mode-hook &#x27;leave-org-mode-function) 
 Unfortunately this doesn&#x27;t seem to work. The first hook still stays active and saves everything regardless of major mode. Any Ideas how I could make this work?

                              <span>I recently upgraded to emacs 29.2 on MacOS Sonoma via brew. Not thoughtfully as a mass update of everything. Things are mostly working with one exception that is very annoying to me. If I enable and use the auto-complete package, quitting emacs takes approximately 40 seconds.
 I&#x27;ve profiled the functions listed in kill-emacs-hook and the problematic function is ac-comphist-save. This function writes out a file: ~/.emacs.d/ac-comphist.dat, which on my system is approximately 73K. I searched and found an exchange about someone having the same problem on an older version of emacs on linux, and the only offered solution was to remove ac-comphist-save from kill-emacs-hook. Sadly, this affects the effectiveness of auto-complete as it doesn&#x27;t remember what completions you&#x27;ve used repeatedly and r…</span>

 Anybody knows if there exists a formal representation out there of Haskell&#x27;s hierarchy of typeclasses (see picture below) into some kind of ontology like OWL/RDF? I&#x27;d see value into having this available.

                              <span>After reading and experimenting I&#x27;m about 99% sure this just isn&#x27;t possible. Basically, I was trying to lift the api version into the type system to clean up some code so that the focus of the code was on the business logic instead of determining what api version to use in a bunch of places / passing around a isV1 boolean everywhere. This does mean that the api version would need to be determined at runtime, and nothing I&#x27;ve tried has made it able to get the client implicitly. I thought with everything sealed and having implicit defs for both of V1/V2 that it would work, but I&#x27;m guessing type erasure / something with subtyping makes it indeterminable. I tried classtags and the aux pattern, but couldn&#x27;t get it to work. This is scala 2.12 btw. I have something like this:
 sealed trait ApiVersion object ApiVersion { sealed trait V1 extends ApiVersion sealed trait V2 extends ApiVersion } sealed trait ApiClient[Version &lt;: ApiVersion] class V1Client extends ApiClient[ApiVersion.V1] class V2Client extends ApiClient[ApiVersion.V2] object ApiClient { implicit def v1Client: ApiClient[ApiVersion.V1] &#x3D; new V1Client implicit def v2Client: ApiClient[ApiVersion.V2] &#x3D; new V2Client } abstract class WrapperDomainObject { type Version &lt;: ApiVersion } object WrapperDomainObject { def apply(thing: ApiThing) &#x3D; if (/* some business logic */) new WrapperDomainObject { override type Version &#x3D; ApiVersion.V1 } else new WrapperDomainObject { override type Version &#x3D; ApiVersion.V2 } } class Service { def serviceFn(thing: WrappedDomainObject)(implicit client: ApiClient[thing.Version]) &#x3D; client.doBusinessThing } 
 Is this possible?

                              <span>Hi all,
How do you find notes and chain of thoughts without backlinks, when your ZK grows up?
TL;DR
My ZK is about 455 notes (some atomic, some literature, etc...).
But reading your past threads a question arose in my mind: what happens when my ZK grows bigger, say hundreds or
Furthermore, I realise that the more I get accustomed to backlinks, the more I&#x27;m dependent on specific tools such as Obsidian (not all Markdown editors have backlinks).
That is, I&#x27;d like to move to IA Writer, that I like much more: it has wikilcnks, but not backlinks.
Hope it makes sense.
Thank you!</span>

 Windows emacs 29 (but same problem on Debian Bookworm).
 With fido mode enabled (built-in):
 org-ql-find
 [Error in post-command-hook (icomplete-post-command-hook): error &quot;Invalid completion style flex&quot;)]
 If I disable fido mode, no problem. I note this thread from June: https://github.com/alphapapa/org-ql/issues/284
 Can I provide any other info to help answers/fix it? Happy to raise an issue on GitHub if that&#x27;s appropriate. Thanks.

 Sometimes I use VS Code for work, to understand a plugin, and just to explore.
 Window splitting in VS Code drives me nuts. Window management is too closely tied up with tabs. You end up with an hierarchy of &quot;Editor Groups&quot; and &quot;Editors&quot; instead of being able to recall any buffer wherever you want. Then Quick Open (buffer switcher) opens a file multiple times—one per Editor Group. Using VS Code&#x27;s &#x60;revealIfOpen&#x60; option partially addresses this, but reveals in the previous Editor Group—it can&#x27;t recall the file into the Editor Group your cursor is currently in like in Emacs.
 We added &#x60;revealIfOpenInActiveGroup&#x60; to fix this. This allows you to make VS Code work just like Emacs buffers. Here are the docs for the Get Started page in VS Code docs:
 ### Simulating Buffers
 If you&#x27;re coming from buffer-centric editors such as Emacs or vi, you can emulate that workflow with:
 &quot;workbench.editor.showTabs&quot;: &quot;single&quot;,
 &quot;workbench.editor.revealIfOpen&quot;: true,
 &quot;workbench.editor.revealIfOpenInActiveGroup&quot;: true,
 &quot;workbench.editor.closeEmptyGroups&quot;: false,
 VS Code has a model where Editors live hierarchically within Editor Groups, and to split your screen you must use Editor Groups. Using &#x60;revealIfOpen&#x60; with &#x60;revealIfOpenInActiveGroup&#x60; causes Quick Open to move already-open Editors into the active Editor Group. This allows you to emulate buffer-centric environments—no tabs, split your screen, and you can view any Editor within any Editor Group without opening a file multiple times.

                              <span>I did the first half of the tutorial and skimmed the second half. I learned the hotkeys for moving around sentences and lines, moving up and down screenfuls etc. I did a lot of looking up about Emacs and am overwhelmed on how to get out of it what I want to. I want to learn more things like those hotkeys and how Emacs can be used to edit and navigate text fast. Are there any resources for that specifically, as well as complete guides to not only Emacs itself but the whole Emacs ecosystem? Are there any lists for all the popular ecosystem things like Spacemacs and Evil mode?

 is it possible to merge &#x60;evil-ex-search-history&#x60; with the &#x60;isearch-history&#x60;?
 I was looking around but could not find anything out of the box.

                              <span>I want to tell emacs to, for every c/c++ file, fold every syntax which starts and ends with, lets say:
 {{{ and }}}
 #ifdef PLATFORM_ and #endif
 and maybe i want to add few other syntaxes
 how to do that?
 (i&#x27;m aware outline-mode and hs-minor-mode exist, idk if i&#x27;m even supposed to use them together, or are they their own separate things..?)

                              <span>i started using emacs only for org-mode but i want so bad to just live in it while coding too.
 one thing that&#x27;s keeping me is that i can&#x27;t restore open buffers and what i was working on when opening a directory.
 in neovim it is as easy as installing a plugin an then it will work whenever you open neovim inside a directory.
 in doom emacs i found the workspace feature that i liked because it creates a new workspace whenever i use &quot;projectile switch&quot; but when i kill emacs all i find left is the last workspace (i don&#x27;t know if i am doing anything wrong but i am using SPC TAB . which is like &quot;M-x workspace switch to&quot;)
 i believe that i just don&#x27;t know the keyword to look for my solution (because that&#x27;s how i descovered Projectile too +\) )
 thanks for any help
 edit: lmao why so many down votes?

                              <span>Hi there. I&#x27;ve been back and forth with emacs and neovim for a long while now, preferring emacs but also kind of getting wrapped around the axel a bit with lisp. But, now as I start to move back to emacs (ORG mode is just too good, and I like some of the TUI abilities elsewhere that emacs gives me) , I&#x27;m looking for if there&#x27;s a generic and good way to set up LSP akin to neovim&#x27;s &quot;Mason&quot; project, which lets me just select the languages I need and properly set everything up.
 If not, that&#x27;s cool, but discoverability is still very weird in the editor world. I know how to use package managers and plan on starting a config with elpaca or straight, and then adding on evil and which-key and some doom-themes and doom-modeline, but the whole setup and configuration of various LSPs are where there&#x27;s a plethora of choice and I&#x27;m curious to see how people do it.
 Thanks!

                              <span>One of my favorite questions: How can I improve my Zettelkasten?
As an expert in our field, we are likely to find an answer. However, why not consider a different perspective on potential solutions? Here&#x27;s a concept for thinking outside the box, beyond the confines of one&#x27;s own thoughts. The key to a wide array of solutions lies in adapting well-known principles or frameworks from established sciences or schools of thought.

Can you re-find your own solutions to improve your Zettelkasten?

                              <span>Is it possible to specify directories that are used whenever org-wikinodes is looking for a headline? Right now it only works either in-file or in the same directory the file is in.

 It&#x27;s a game changer when you use dependencies like Jackson or OpenTelemetry for instance and want to keep all their modules version consistent easily across the dependency tree.

I wanted to install the haskell language server, but on the docs it says that I need to use ghcup. In your experience, could installing ghcup and pulling packages through it cause any conflicts or breaks in my xmonad?

                              <span>I get up four hours before work to bake, brew and grow mushrooms. There are many processes involved in each, and a lot of passive time during each process. 
 What I’ve been trying to figure out is how to automatically determine the best ordering of any given set of processes to maximize passive time, so I can free up as much of time as possible while also being more productive. How would you about accomplishing this?
 So far, I’ve got a ‘process.org’ file with a global process tag. I have a list of processes as headers, with properties like ‘TOTAL_TIME’, ‘ACTIVE_TIME’, etc. What makes it challenging is some processes need to occur sequentially and have active time between them or throughout. Like mixing flour and water, waiting, then adding yeast and doing the first fold, waiting, then folding again, waiting, then proofing and preheating oven, waiting, then baking and waiting. 
 What I’d like to be able to do is go through my process.org file and just change the TODO state to ‘NEXT’ then have the cumulative list of all processes for the next morning optimized for me.

                              <span>I just started using doom emacs and I wanted to increase it&#x27;s font size so I added the line (setq doom-font (font-spec :family &quot;Fira Code&quot; :size 18 :weight &#x27;regular)) to the config.el file in ~/.doom.d folder. Now the font size in emacs has increased but it is still the same as it was before in emacsclient. How do I make changes in the configuration so that they are reflected across both emacs and emacsclient? Any help would be appreciated.

                              <span>I last rewrote my init.el a decade ago, before use-package, and now it&#x27;s a giant heap of files, often one per added package to init a package, that get loaded in, along with various global settings that are adjusted through setq or function calls and then a custom.el
 And this works, but it takes some time to start emacs up....
 So I was thinking of re-doing this with the new fangled use-package all the kids are doing and was a bit dismayed to find now there are several other package managers, we went from none to plethora.
 At any rate, I was wondering what the best way to lay out an init.el was, especially regarding ordering of things like
  
loading of packages
 loading of custom.el (do I even need to explicitly load custom.el)
 setting of global settings via setq or function call
 key bindings
 other??
  
When I lay it out like this, I think that&#x27;s a pretty logical way of laying it out, but is it?
 What else should be considered in laying out an init.el to make it survive the decades?

 So I am not sure which version of emacs is the safest to install : the 28.3 one on Fedora that does not exist in the releases page, the 28.2 which got an update, the 29.1 or 29.2 that Fedora does not provide ?

                              <span>hi,
 im new into IT stuff and a freshman in uni and I worked only w vim till now. I decided to switch to emacs (doom) but im so clueless. Idrk which configs I should do, don&#x27;t know wich packages exist and which I should install, so a little instruction would really help me. im so lost and I don&#x27;t even know what I don&#x27;t know if you get what I mean? for now I only work w java, html, css and I can navigate through terminals, currently using wezterm but emacs is a completely new world to discover but it looks very promising but im obviously overwhelmed. Appreciate every help from u guys!

                              <span>I&#x27;m basically brand new to emacs and I&#x27;m trying to use it primarily for latex. I&#x27;ve gotten most things to work alright but I am disappointed with the lack of autocompletion options to far. In particular, TeX-electric-escape seems to do a very poor job in my opinion. It seems like predictive-mode is the solution but I am unsure how to install it. All the links on this page https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/PredictiveMode#h5o-2 seem dead and I&#x27;m unsure how else to access it. I would appreciate any help with this specific problem or advice on a potentially better way to handle autocomplete in latex.

                              <span>In scala 2.X usually there is a method to go from one collection to the other. For instance, you go from a Queue to a List using queue.toList.
 But sometimes there is no method available. Take converting a List to a Queue, there is no toQueue available. You can always do Queue.from and that&#x27;s fine, but I&#x27;m wondering how does the to method works, does anybody have examples or is it just an internal mechanism?
 For instance, I&#x27;ve tried:
 (0 until 5).to(Queue[Int]) (0 until 5).to[Queue[Int]](Queue[Int]) 
 But both seem to be invalid. Any pointers? Just looking for ergonomic ways to do these conversions. One can always foldLeft or use the above-mentioned collection.from but it&#x27;s less ergonomic.

                              <span>This question is not emacs-specific, but I have a feeling that this technical crowd might know a path forward given how customizable emacs is.
 My new work role requires me to spend even more time in email. We use Office 365 / Exchange for our work email, so the Outlook desktop client and the webmail interface is my default interface. Often times, I send an email to a recipient, and wait for their response. The chance that they respond is low, so I always have to send a follow up note. Take this and multiply by 100 threads, which takes up a lot of my time to stay on top of things.
 What I would like to do is set up my follow-up email, and have the note sent out on a certain date if I haven&#x27;t heard back yet. If the person responds before the date, the pre-written note should never be sent and could be discarded. Outlook email rules and delay send feature does not allow for such a complex scenario.
 I am aware of the Boomerang app for Gmail and Outlook, but I don&#x27;t think the cost is worth it; and I don&#x27;t think corporate would allow me to install that add-in in Outlook.
 I looked into Thunderbird as it has a &quot;send later&quot; plugin that appears to have a scripting component, which could probably work. However, I&#x27;m unable to get my work mail account to work with Thunderbird. I could probably try some more to figure out why it isn&#x27;t working.
 Question for the folks in this subreddit: is there a way to achieve the email rules I described using an email client in Emacs? Or some other open source tool?
 I know this is a long shot. Thanks in advance for any insight you might provide.

                              <span>Namely, I want to do look-up (give a code such as ang and get back the human-readable name for it) and, potentially, some sort of reverse lookup (if feasible).
 I&#x27;d&#x27;ve expected, since, Emacs traffics in text, there&#x27;d&#x27;ve been something in-built but, beyond references to ISO-639-1 for setting the style of fonts (https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Fonts.html), I can&#x27;t seem to find much of anything.
 Plus, any language-related stuff I find (such as the Melpa package Guess Language and https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/GuessBufferLanguage) seem to roll their own (scaled down) version rather than relying on anything within Emacs or, even, a third-party library.
 Figured someone here might know of something, if there is anything.

It is even possible to distinguish between snippets for inline and display math environments. 
 Is there a package that does this possible in emacs ?

                              <span>Please help. I have recently upgraded emacs and tried to adopt LSP &amp; treesitter. I&#x27;m primarily working in Typescript at the moment so I&#x27;m using LSP typescript and tsx-ts-mode. Also using lsp-ui, LSP eslint, flycheck and company-mode.
 The result has become extremely frustrating as I&#x27;ve started to use it beyond trivial use cases. When working quickly, with many files/projects open, the following often happens:
  
make an edit quickly
 no update from language server and any stale errors remain
 tsserver process spins and spins at max CPU for about a minute
 CPU drops and the buffer finally updates... maybe?
  
It can take minutes to respond, and sometimes seems to stall indefinitely. I end up forced to &#x60;lsp-restart-server&#x60; repeatedly throughout the day. I don&#x27;t think this is necessarily specifically an LSP issue, but probably some combination of things, like maybe LSP is getting confused and issuing too many requests? I have already gone through all the recommendations in &#x60;lsp-doctor&#x60; and I&#x27;m a little uncertain where to even look to diagnose further (the &#x60;*lsp-log*&#x60; doesn&#x27;t contain anything illuminating) and the problem seems to get worse and worse.
 Is this a common experience? How can I see better what&#x27;s going on? Any packages I should maybe look for and jettison?

                              <span>I am a sporadic Emacs user. i know some keybinds, i can write elisp by googling and putting together a script. So I am not a complete beginner as such. 
 I have been trying to set up Emacs for front-end web dev work but I cant seem to get error highlighting for HTML to work. i installed packages like emmet, web, company, flymake, js2, etc and was able to get HTML tags autocompletion and indentation. But no matter what i do i cannot seem to get error highlighting for html misspelled tags which oher editors do by default. i have installed flymake and all it does is highlights tags that are left open.
 Will Doom Emacs/Spacemacs solve these configuration issues? if yes, which one would be the best? Also, is there any way to kep my current .emacs file and vanilla emacs installation without having it detected by Doom/Spacemacs?

                              <span>Hello everyone, I have been having trouble with my config for the past day or so. I have been messing with tree sitter because wanted the highlighting to look like doom emacs&#x27; tree-sitter highlights.
 treesit
 When I started I was using the built-in treesit package, however I quickly realized the highlighting was fairly subpar even when the font-lock was at level 4. I looked at the doom source code and saw that they were using the old 3rd party tree-sitter package.
 tree-sitter
 Using this package seems to bring a lot more options into scope and it immediately made the highlighting better. However, I am still having trouble making it look as good as doom&#x27;s highlighting (particularly in python files).

 In the images you will see:

 I use eglot with clangd which I configure as follows:
  (add-to-list &#x27;eglot-server-programs &#x27;((c-ts-mode c++-ts-mode c-mode c++-mode) . (&quot;clangd&quot; &quot;-j&#x3D;8&quot; &quot;--log&#x3D;error&quot; &quot;--malloc-trim&quot; &quot;--background-index&quot; &quot;--clang-tidy&quot; &quot;--all-scopes-completion&quot; &quot;--completion-style&#x3D;detailed&quot; &quot;--pch-storage&#x3D;memory&quot; &quot;--header-insertion&#x3D;never&quot; &quot;--header-insertion-decorators&#x3D;0&quot;)))) 
 Recently I have to work inside some docker containers that use different toolchains, things mostly work on Emacs 29 native support for docker in Tramp, except that I now need to pass the --query-driver option to clangd to effectively index my project, somehting like this:
  (add-to-list &#x27;eglot-server-programs &#x27;((c-ts-mode c++-ts-mode c-mode c++-mode) . (&quot;clangd&quot; &quot;-j&#x3D;8&quot; &quot;--query-driver&#x3D;/path/to/gcc,/path/to/g++&quot; &quot;--log&#x3D;error&quot; &quot;--malloc-trim&quot; &quot;--background-index&quot; &quot;--clang-tidy&quot; &quot;--all-scopes-completion&quot; &quot;--completion-style&#x3D;detailed&quot; &quot;--pch-storage&#x3D;memory&quot; &quot;--header-insertion&#x3D;never&quot; &quot;--header-insertion-decorators&#x3D;0&quot;)))) 
 Is there a way to set eglot-server-programs per project? Maybe as dir-local variable?

                              <span>Update: Never mind, I managed to write custom scroll functions that don&#x27;t use the built-in ones, and I like how they behave. See the code below.
  
  
 
 The original post:
  
 I&#x27;d like the cursor to move as predictably as possible when I scroll. I want it to get back to the original position when I scroll up and down back and forth a few screens.
  
 There are a couple of issues with the scroll up and down functions. First, the beginning and the end of buffer are an edge case. But I can work with that. The scroll-up-command and scroll-down-command work better for me than scroll-up and scroll-down. I can write a wrapper that remembers the last good position and jumps there when I move in the opposite direction from the beginning or end. I know about all the options for these commands, incl…</span>

                              <span>Sorry for that difficult title, if it didn&#x27;t give you a stroke, I&#x27;ll give you an example of what I mean.
 So for instance, the command calendar normally reuses the current frame/window. However, with the variable calendar-setup set to two-frames, it creates two new frames, one for the calendar and one for the diary.
 This isn&#x27;t the only command like this, it&#x27;s just an example, and it&#x27;s not even the only one I might like to solve, since I face a similar problems with some gnus workflows I want to build, so please, no specific hacks to get this particular thing to work such as suggesting I not use calendar-setup set to two-frames, I really need a generalisable solution to this.
 So the issue is, if I launch emacsclient -e &#x27;(calendar)&#x27; from a shortcut or the command-line in order to bring up my calendar, this doesn&#x27;t work unless there is a pre-existing emacsclient frame.
 The solution then would seem to be to issue either emacsclient -c -e &#x27;(calendar)&#x27; or emacsclient -r -e &#x27;(calendar)&#x27; in order to create a frame first.
 The problem is this creates a totally useless frame that is both annoying, but also problematic, because you can&#x27;t close it if the calendar and diary frames aren&#x27;t already closed.
 What I&#x27;d like is to be able to run (calendar) and have it create its frames without the need for a pre-existing frame. Or else in a really bad pinch, have the dummy frame created but totally hidden, and have it quit the moment I close the diary and calendar frames.
 Does anybody have any ideas? I&#x27;ve been pulling my hair out here, I dunno if I&#x27;m missing something obvious.

 My last real attempt at an Emacs package was El Gantt which generates gantt charts from orgmode files. I written a couple other buggy things (e.g., https://github.com/legalnonsense/org-visual-outline). I am a lawyer and Emacs helps keep me sane at work. Elisp is the only language I know and only one ever want to know. 
 For the last couple years I have worked on something new. I have been using it for awhile now and think it is good enough to share: https://github.com/legalnonsense/reorg. 
 It is like taxy.el, org-ql, org-sidebar except that it’s not limited to org files and it’s messier shotgun of ideas. 
 It allows clones of outline nodes as featured in Leo Editor. This also means it can at least give the appearance of real transclusion. 
 I’ve written a readme that explains everything in a way that I hope makes sense.
 I make no guarantee that you can clone and run this error free.

 When using package vertico and orderless, everytime I want to save a current file with slightly different name using C-x C-w, I can only choose the current one.
 For example, I want to wirte-file from .zprofile to .profile, I hit C-x C-W, and type in .profile, but I can only choose .zprofile.
 How can I write the file to .profile?

                              <span>I&#x27;m not sure how I ended up in that situation (did a series of bad decision at some point...), but in short I&#x27;ve hundreds of missing nodes in org-roam to which other notes points to. Those nodes where &quot;tags&quot; so the content do not matter. 
 Is there a way to create new files from &quot;missing links&quot; within org-roam?

                              <span>Hello, I’m relatively new to using org mode, but I was curious how everyone here takes notes on mobile devices? Specifically, how do those of you who use iPhones take notes and sync them with org mode? Also, I am a Doom Emacs user. Thank you!

                              <span>Hi all, I&#x27;ve recently written an article about stuff I&#x27;d love to see Haskell do as a user of the language. I&#x27;ve been using Haskell for over 15 years now, and I believe at least some of those things would make Haskell a better language to work in. I was wondering what everyone else would love to see in Haskell - informally, without the restraints of a fully formal enhancement proposal. Shoot your ideas in the replies, I&#x27;d love to hear it. Also, let me know what you think of the article. Bear in mind this is the first such article I&#x27;ve written in maybe 12 years, so maybe don&#x27;t rip into it too much :) It&#x27;s all meant to be a little informal and inspirational rather than a fully prescriptive solution to every problem.

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to convert an old project of mine to use the vertex arrays instead of discrete vertex specification to improve performance, but OpenGLs insane state machine, that gives absolutely no indication of what is missing, combined with the almost nonexistent documentation of the Haskell wrappers is frustrating my attempts to do this. Does anyone have a working example of just rendering some triangles or something using vertex arrays in Haskell? I&#x27;m probably just missing some binding command or something, but I can&#x27;t figure out what.

                              <span>During experimenting with loom-based development, I wanted a rust like ?- Operator. 
 The implementation turned out to be a little bit tricky, but here it is: https://github.com/reactivecore/quest
 The tricky part is correct return type deduction, consider this:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;scala def operation(): Option[Int] &#x3D; ???
 val result &#x3D; quest { operation().? Some(12) } &#x60;&#x60; The result will beOption[Int]. If it would just look at the inner functon ofquestit would deductSome[Int]&#x60;. 
 This works using a special trait called Resulting[T] which is triggered by quest being a context function. 
 Resulting is also referenced by the question operator, thus the compiler is inferencing T to be None and Some[Int] resulting in Option[Int].
 The library triggers an early exit using Exceptions without Stacktraces. Measurements show, that this creates an overhead of ~5ns, which should be acceptable.
 Of course it won&#x27;t work (and being dangerous) in lazy evaluated code (Futures, Lazy Collections, Effect Systems etc.).
 What do you think?
 Disclaimer: The base idea was already presented by Martin Odersky at Scalar Conference 2023 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;0Fm0y4K4YO8 (which I rembered later in implementation)
 There is also an old thread.

Not only that, most listings have scala as an additional language or a plus. 
 This makes me want to learn something new, but what? My previous company moved away from Scala and to Azure. What else is going on in your companies?

 Especially in rust files, it shows a small arrow opposite the line where there is an error however the error itself (message) shows only when I move my cursor to this line. Or maybe its not even lsp, maybe this is flycheck?

                              <span>Hi everyone 👋
 Okay, so I have this problem where I always had a few hundred buffers open in ibuffer, and I couldn’t figure out what was doing it - since YEARS. Well, I finally figured it out the other day! Org refiling was the culprit. See, I didn’t know this but whenever you refile, when it says getting all targets, it’s opening them up (at least it did in my ibuffer behind the scenes).
 To counter this, I asked an AI to help me, and it did. It wrote the code but it couldn’t get the last part right about not opening ibuffer to kill everything. I fixed that up myself. So this is a collaboration between an AI and me, but the code works.
 The only “issue” now is that if you have a lot of targets, it will take a few seconds each time to do the gathering part. For me, that’s not a big deal, …</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been using emacs for golang for about a month or 2.
 This is my current list of packages/Worflow: 
 SyntaxHighlighting --&gt; lsp-mode ( go ), go-mode
 CodeCompletion --&gt; company
 Checker --&gt; FlyCheck, Flycheck-golangci-lint
 Go Debugging --&gt; dap-mode (go-dlv)
 GolangTags --&gt; Emacs go-tag
 magit/Forge --&gt; version control
 ​
 What packages are you using for Go? Are there any packages that do similar things or are outdated?

                              <span>org-mode defines a serious number of keys in org-mode-map, some of which I want to use for my own nefarious purposes. There&#x27;s org-disputed-keys which is supposed to stop org-mode from squatting on them. The trouble is, it doesn&#x27;t always seem to work.
 For example, I want to use C-M- globally to move the point to the window in those directions (with windmove) and I want to use C-M-S- globally to move the window itself in those directions (using my own defun).
 org-mode squats on those shifted C-M-S- keys, and you would think that this would fix it:
 (setq org-replace-disputed-keys t) ;; restart emacs after changing any of these: (setq org-disputed-keys &#x27;(([(kbd &quot;C-M-S-&quot;)] . [( nil )]) ([(kbd &quot;C-M-S-&quot;)] . [( nil )]) ([(kbd &quot;C-M-S-&quot;)] . [( nil )]) ([(kbd &quot;C-M-S-&quot;)] . [( nil )]) 
 ([(kbd &quot;C-,&quot;)] . [( nil )]) 
 This works fine on other keys that org-mode would otherwise occupy, such as C-&#x27; but not on C-M-S- so I have to resort (in org-mode-hook) to a heavy-handed:
 (define-key org-mode-map (kbd &quot;C-M-S-&quot;) nil) (define-key org-mode-map (kbd &quot;C-M-S-&quot;) nil) 
 Any ideas what I&#x27;m doing wrong? Or is it a bug in org-mode?
 I don&#x27;t use org-mode very much (mainly for elfeed-dashboard) preferring the much simpler outline-minor-mode (plus a few hacks) but I do want org-mode buffers/windows to behave themselves with my window moving global keys.

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to build a shared library with stack such that all dependencies, including GHC runtime, is linked statically into it. I do this by passing -static. This in on Linux.
 However, I get tons of linker errors with ghc libraries like requires unsupported dynamic reloc, recompile with -fPIC
 Now, -fPIC is required to link all that statically into one shared lib. How can I make stack build (re-build?) entire GHC runtime with -fPIC?

                              <span>I like to sum up columns $1..$4 in column $5, if there are numbers to sum up. If not, I would like to check for a dash &quot;-&quot; and output &quot;n/a&quot;. However, doing this using calc I get an error:
 ​
 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | if(vsum([1, 2, 3])) | |---+---+---+---+---------------------| | 7 | 6 | 5 | 1 | 18 | | 5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 8 | | - | | | | #ERROR | #+TBLFM: $5&#x3D;if($1 &#x3D; &quot;-&quot;, string(&quot;n/a&quot;), vsum($1..$3)) 
 How can I deal with strings in calc?
 Trying the same in elisp leads to another question:
 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | if(vsum([1, 2, 3])) | |---+---+---+---+---------------------| | 7 | 6 | 5 | 1 | #ERROR | | 5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | #ERROR | | - | | | | n/a | #+TBLFM: $5&#x3D;&#x27;(if (equal &quot;-&quot; $1) &quot;n/a&quot; vsum($1..$3)) 
 So, how do I evaluate calc expressions in elisp?

                              <span>There&#x27;s been some blues in the ecosystem, and just wanted to share a brief opinion: Scala is beautiful. 
 I worked past 6 months with different stack (JS/TS), and now got a chance to do little Scala 3 again. It&#x27;s so beautiful it brings tears to my eyes. Really, it does.
 Small things you easily forget, and notice when they are gone (just to mention few): syntax ergonomics, pattern matching, compiler &amp; macros working for you, powerful std library and amazing ecosystem of libraries that make Scala also practical to build real projects with it. 
 EVERYONE who has contributed, please take a moment and receive my sincerest thank you!

                              <span>Hello there!
 I have a server that I access through ssh, open emacs in the terminal and use it. very happy so far,
 but I do want to test to use my local emacs GUI and make the same things. open files, run process there, etc. 
 I tested to open tramp like &#x60;/ssh:matt@192.168.1.10:/home/matt/code/&#x60; and it open the dir, but I can&#x27;t for example seek project files. Also I use devenv (nix) to load the needed tools, but even if I open vterm and execute it, the main process doesn&#x27;t have it. so I can&#x27;t run things like tests. 
 Is there other way to use it ? or any tutorial in how to configure?
 ​
 Thanks in advance!

 Loading data into widgets and saving widget data to a file 
 # Background
 Hi team,
 I&#x27;m looking to create a handy little tool for some specific tabletop RPG games (DND-like, Call of Cthulu, Deadlands) and I would like to know if anyone has any ideas for how to get data from a markdown language (such as a .yaml file) into a widget screen and then save from the widget screen back into the file again. 
 My current idea is that I could use an emacs form after running a program to parse the data from the .yaml file, but that eliminates my ability to use the fun widget library in emacs (which has the nice features of checkboxes and buttons). So I would like to be able to have my widget &#x27;UI&#x27;, and load the data from the yaml file interactively, so that I can save back to it as well.
 I&#x27;ve been trying to find the source code for the customize buffer in emacs, which does essentially what I want to do, but my grepping has been to no avail.

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to get my org agenda/TODOs to sync with my Apple Calendar (iCal, I think).
 I&#x27;ve seen about half a dozen pages explain this in various ways, but none are very easy to set up, and they don&#x27;t get too much into specifics about whether it is two-way syncing (which is what I wish for) or not.
 In short: Does anyone have a solution that is fairly easy to set up?
 EDIT: I have tried org-caldav with my NextCloud setup, but it&#x27;s not working entirely correctly and I&#x27;m not certain why. It syncs from the calendar on the server, but not to it. Also, NextCloud appears to be a bit buggy at times as I found it difficult to delete the test calendars at times.

                              <span>I have an init.el pretty much unchanged since 2010 or so. So I&#x27;ve declared emacs init bankruptcy and am starting over.
 I&#x27;ve installed the latest stable version of emacs (29.2) and am using an init.el generated by https://emacs.amodernist.com/
 I am not sure this is the latest and greatest kind of init, I notice it does not use any use-package
 One big change between then and now is the introduction of the nongnu repository and I see that it&#x27;s automatically listed in the package-archives of emacs 29.2.
 What&#x27;s it state?
 Do I need melpa at all?
 If I do need melpa for packages not yet in gnu or nongnu, how do I add melpa in so that it&#x27;s priority is last on the list?
 Right now I have:
 (require &#x27;package) (add-to-list &#x27;package-archives &#x27;(&quot;melpa&quot; . &quot;http://melpa.org/packages/&quot;) t) (setq package-archive-priorities &#x27;((gnu . 10) (nongnu . 5) (melpa . 1))) 
 But even so, when I m-x list-packages I can see that emacs wants to upgrade the nongnu packages to the ones in melpa.
 As an example
 the version of the avy package in melpa is 20230420.404
 but in nongnu the version is 0.5.0
  
When installing packages, the package with the highest version number from the archive with the highest priority is selected. When higher versions are available from archives with lower priorities, the user has to select those manually.
 Archives not in this list have the priority 0, as have packages that are already installed. If you use negative priorities for the archives, they will not be upgraded automatically.
  
Since the version numbers of nongnu and melpa differ so widely, it seems as if there is no way to just set package archive priority such that it will default to nongnu
 Any advice?
 Suggestions on using melpa or not?
 Suggestions if using melpa how to get it to be used only when packages are not found in gnu or nongnu?

 Is it possible for orderless to search though the &quot;marginalia&quot; text also?

 I executed eglot-reconnect

 Botan is an open-source, BSD-licensed C++ cryptography library with an extensive suite of cryptographic algorithms and utilities, ranging from simple hashes and ciphers to complete protocol implementations of SRP6, X509, and TLS, and even post-quantum cryptography algorithm.

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently doing the #48in24 challenge on Exercism and it has me try to solve the same exercises in many different languages in quick succession, usually ones I need to discover on the spot. This means finding out what features are available in the language itself and in the libraries.
 And this made me realize how lucky I am to work with Haskell! Aside from how featureful the language itself is, I&#x27;m baffled by how many languages have abysmal documentation on the standard library. At least the statically typed ones almost always tell you the types of argument and return value… Quite often, I need to experiment in the REPL to understand what exactly some function or method does.
 This is in stark contrast with Haskell, where I I&#x27;m used to read the documentation and have every function explained in detail.
 I also find myself reinventing the wheel a lot less with Haskell. Modules like Data.List or Data.Text provide a wider selection of commonly needed operations that almost any other language I tried!

                              <span>I have functions that return an Either[Exception,List[Path]]. I would like to do something like
 val res:Either[Exception,List[Path]] &#x3D; for { path1:Path &gt; Either[Exception, B], List, java.nio.file.Path]
  
I&#x27;ve tried adding cats syntax imports to no success. I&#x27;m fairly certain this monadic transform style should be doable for a basic collection. Any help or guidance is appreciated. Thank you!!
 EDIT: I wrote this code to hold the spot, until better code comes. For now this may be useful to others. I took advantage of the fact I&#x27;m only using Either[Exception,List[_]]. The example code basically runs as it. Maybe someone somewhere finds this useful too!
 import scala.annotation.tailrec class ListT[A](val run:Either[Exception,List[A]]) { def flatMap[B](func:A&#x3D;&gt;ListT[B]):ListT[B]&#x3D; run match { case Right(list) &#x3D;&gt; @tailrec def churn(remainder:List[A])(accum:List[B]):ListT[B]&#x3D; remainder match { case Nil &#x3D;&gt; ListT(Right(accum)) case head::tail &#x3D;&gt; val intermediate &#x3D; func(head) intermediate.run match { case l:Left[Exception,List[B]] &#x3D;&gt; intermediate case Right(list) &#x3D;&gt; churn(tail)(list++accum) } } churn(list)(Nil) case l:Left[Exception,_] &#x3D;&gt; this.asInstanceOf[ListT[B]] } def map[B](func:A&#x3D;&gt;B):ListT[B]&#x3D; run match { case l:Left[Exception,List[A]] &#x3D;&gt; l.asInstanceOf[ListT[B]] case Right(list) &#x3D;&gt; ListT(Right(list.map(func))) } }

                              <span>I was following Distro Tube&#x27;s guide on configuring Emacs and when I got to his Enabling Org Bullets section (36:05), I got an error telling me that org-bullets failed to load, so I did some digging and changed the code a bit, but now Org Bullets just doesn&#x27;t load and when I try to enable it using M-x, I got an error telling me &quot;Cannot open load file: No such file or directory, org-bullets&quot;.
 This was the original code from the video  (add-hook &#x27;org-mode-hook &#x27;org-indent-mode) (use-package org-bullets) (add-hook &#x27;org-mode-hook (lambda () (org-bullets-mode 1))) 
 This is what I change the code to:  (use-package org-bullets :hook((org-mode) . org-bullets-mode))

                              <span>Hi guys ! I&#x27;m a computer science student, and I&#x27;m looking for a minimalist, cheap and efficient e-ink tablet for increasing my productivity. My current workflow is like this: I code and annotate PDFs in Emacs, take notes in Org-Mode, and take hand-written notes for math classes. I&#x27;d like to centralize my work database, and for that the tablet should be able to read and annotate PDF files, but also Org ones and push changes on a cloud service. I&#x27;ll take any advice. Thanks in advance, and have a great day !

                              <span>I have some latex environments for special blocks in org mode. Is there a way that I can create a list of blocks that company can cycle through and select? Thanks.

                              <span>With emms the only success I had reading metadata properly was using python tinytag with the line (setq emms-info-functions &#x27;(emms-info-tinytag)). The only other configuration I did was to set &quot;emms-info-tinytag-python-name&quot; to python3.
 But on new linux distros you can&#x27;t install tinytag via pip and your system python package. You have to install it into a virtual environment. 
 My question is, on new linux distros how do I set emms to use tinytag as installed in a python virtual environment? Do I activate the virtual environment and then set emms-info-tinytag-python-name to the path of python in the virtual environment?
 Thanks for any help.

 I assume that the website has changed their API and that&#x27;s broken it, but wanted to make sure it wasn&#x27;t something I did. I tried to track down the problem but I&#x27;m pretty new to elisp.

                              <span>hi experts
 ​
 I am using evil mode(doom emacs). In that i want to do is have &#x60;N&#x60; always search up in the file and &#x60;n&#x60; search down in the file ...
 ​
 for that i created this 
 ​
 #+BEGIN_SRC elisp ;; (define-key evil-motion-state-map (kbd &quot;#&quot;) &#x27;evil-ex-search-word-forward) (advice-add &#x27;evil-ex-re-bwd :after (lambda () (setq evil-ex-search-direction &#x27;forward))) (advice-add &#x27;evil-match :after (lambda () (setq evil-ex-search-direction &#x27;forward))) #+END_SRC 
 ​
 but it does not reliably work, can one of you experts tell me what i am doing wrong?
 ​
 TIA

                              <span>I want to seperate input data and calculated data in two tables. But how can I reference one table from another if I need relative column and row positions.
 Here is an example of what I mean:
 | col1 | col2 | col3 | col4 | | test | 1 | | | | test2 | 5 | -4 | 6 | | test3 | 4 | 1 | 9 | #+TBLFM: @3$3..@&gt;$3&#x3D;@-1$2-@0$2::@3$4..@&gt;$4&#x3D;@-1$2+@0$2 
 In col3 I show the result of subtracting the value in col2 in the current row from the value col2 in the previous row. col4 does the same with adding the rows
 But what if I wanted to have two table. One for the input data (col1, col2) and one for the calculated data (col3, col4)
 I tried it like this
 #+TBLNAME: data | col1 | col2 | | test | 1 | | test2 | 5 | | test3 | 4 | | col3 | col4 | | | | | -4 | 6 | | 1 | 9 | #+TBLFM: @3$1..@&gt;$1&#x3D;remote(data,@-1$2)-remote(data,@0$2)::@3$2..@&gt;$2&#x3D;remote(data,@-1$2+@0$2) 
 But it throws an error that &quot;Row descriptor -1 leads outside table&quot;. Obviously because the relative positions are not based on the second table

                              <span>new to emacs and been configuring around to setup emacs as my new editor. been doing some c an python and syntax highlighting is okay. typescript on another note seems like it&#x27;s lacking some syntax highlighting. when i set treesit-font-lock-level to 4, i get a message query pattern is malformed: &quot;Node type error at&quot;, 2, &quot;(function name: (identifier) @font-lock-function-name-face)... and a whole bunch of elisp which i still dont understand since i havent learned elisp yet. 
 i didnt do any customization in my init.el for treesitter besides adding treesit-auto 
 should there be customization in my config for typescript-ts-mode to use syntax highlighting?

 here is my config file (heavily copied from DistroTube&#x27;s configuring emacs videos) for reference.

 One of the most important topics in IT is surely the security, it&#x27;s so complicated and intriguing that, either you love it or you hate it, but we can&#x27;t help taking care of it. Nowadays, in a society based on computers and applications, crackers attacks are very concrete and dangerous. In my opinion, when we talk about IT security, it is always better to overestimate the risk and have a large margin of tolerance. The (hard) trade-off we have to make is that the solution is usable, has good performance, and is safe.
  
Often, it is not a single solution that makes something safe; it is the sum of several approaches that mitigate the risk.
  
 History
 It has been a while since I had my first idea for a library that would help developers securely manage secret values within their app…</span>

                              <span>This has been getting on my nerves but here&#x27;s the thing that I have seen. Top big tech companies who recruit in the technical round through experienced java devs suck. I don&#x27;t understand their obsession with Java, all their questions would keep revolving around Java collections, Streams, etc.
 ​
 So I had this interview with this big company where the interviewer was quite experienced. As they say a dev with &gt; 15 YOE is someone who must be way too much orgasmic about Java and I have always experienced this. Now the role for which they were hiring was Full Stack Dev, however this dude started with problem solving. 
 He asked me first which language would like to pick, so I told him that I would prefer using JavaScript/C++ and then he responded oh don&#x27;t you know Java? Look I don&#x27;t hate Java …</span>

 Is there a way to mark an org file as archived? I tried to change the file extension to org_archive, but (org-agenda-files nil t) does not include these files, because the same directory does not have a file with the same name but with .org extension

                              <span>I use org-roam and publish my notes online as static HTML. As part of publishing, I export the notes as txt, insert them into an FTS5 SQLite table and I added a small reactive app to an existing server to search and display the results. Everything works well but I recently used docsify at work and thought it was superb so I started thinking about client-side searching. I&#x27;ve thought about the following:
  
modify my export to markdown, generate the appropriate sidebar file and setup docsify in the normal way. My primary objection is the markdown exporter&#x27;s quality is unknown. This would also cut my publish time down significantly and wouldn&#x27;t be too much work.
 index the HTML (Note: getting this only do the relevant piece was difficult the last time I tried as tags and metadata blew up the results) as part of the publishing process and add a Javascript library that gets included in every exported HTML file. We&#x27;ll call this the stork model. While slightly slower than the previous option, this would also reduce publishing time substantially.
  
What other solutions occur to you?
 edit: I ended up doing the first one. It took a couple of hours to convert.

 Are there any emacs packages that include commands for taking the text in the active region and switching between bold, italic, etc using unicode substitutions? 
 ie like these kinds of text generators.
 https://lingojam.com/BoldTextGenerator 
 I realize such a generator can&#x27;t handle every character, but I want it just for highlighting words in comments, etc. 
 Tnx!

                              <span>I have Emacs for Android installed from https://sourceforge.net/projects/android-ports-for-gnu-emacs/ and it&#x27;s setup nicely.
 I&#x27;ve read the manual and it seems Emacs on Adroid (my Android version is 13) doesn&#x27;t have the ability to access the system clipboard - indeed it seems to be that way.
 Is there really no way to copy/paste - share data with other apps? For simple things - like cope a website&#x27;s URL in Firefox and paste it to a document in Emacs?

                              <span>Does the c++-ts-major-mode need the c treesitter language grammar package installed along with the c++ ts language grammar package? I keep getting a warning about it not being able to find the c language grammars when I open .cc files. .cc is an extension that emacs specifically identifies as a c++-major-mode extension. Is there enough language overlap between c and c++ that both grammars are required?

                              <span>The description in the manual says: &quot;On decoding flowed text, lines with soft newline characters are filled together and wrapped after the column decided by fill-flowed-display-column. The default is to wrap after fill-column.&quot;
 But what about lines without soft newline characters? When I open mails in mu4e, all longer lines are nicely wrapped. The lines though that can be shown completely in the buffer stick out and are not wrapped, and this looks ugly and makes reading harder because of the long lines. (See the attached screenshot. The lines at the end are much longer than the wrapped ones above.)

 Has anyone of you found a solution for this?
 (In my system, fill-flowed-display-column is set to fill-column, and fill-column is set to 70.)

                              <span>When I am editing file-a and want to insert file-b and if both files live in different directories (lets say dir-a and dir-b), things become cumbersome: Invoking insert-file gives me the usual dialog starting at dir-a and I then need to navigate to dir-b before I am able to insert file-b. If dir-a and dir-b are far away from each other, this may take a lot of keystrokes.
 This could be made easier, if insert-file would allow me to jump to a bookmarked directory (which might be closer to dir-b). Do you know any such solution ?
 Please note, that in this special use-case (insert-file), the command bookmark-bmenu-list (or similar) does not provide an alternative as far as I can see.
 Thanx

 Is this a limitation of riscv64? Or do I have to pass a flag to the build to get that to be built? There&#x27;s nothing obvious in ./configure, and UserSettings.hs is just plain confusing.

 I&#x27;ll be using it with servant probably if that changes anything.
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Hello,
 I have set up a simple server with scala+cask (I have set the port to 51934 and the host to be &quot;0.0.0.0&quot;). I was getting connection timeouts when I was trying to connect from a different PC in the local network and when I ran netstat -an | grep LISTEN I got the following output:
 ​
 tcp 0 0 127.0.0.53:530.0.0.0:* LISTEN
 tcp 0 0 127.0.0.1:6310.0.0.0:* LISTEN
 tcp 0 0 0.0.0.0:220.0.0.0:* LISTEN
 tcp 0 0 0.0.0.0:54320.0.0.0:* LISTEN
 tcp6 0 0 :::51934 :::* LISTEN
 tcp6 0 0 127.0.0.1:8212:::* LISTEN
 tcp6 0 0 127.0.0.1:45459:::* LISTEN
 tcp6 0 0 127.0.0.1:44569:::* LISTEN
 tcp6 0 0 127.0.0.1:35383:::* LISTEN
 tcp6 0 0 :::22 :::* LISTEN
 tcp6 0 0 :::5432 :::* LISTEN
 tcp6 0 0 ::1:631 :::* LISTEN
 ​
 Now, the third entry on that output is my ssh server which is accessible from everywhere. The first tcp6 entry is the server I am trying to set up now. I see it being listed as tcp6. So I guess I have two questions:
 - Is this an issue (that is my guess)
 - How can I configure the cask server so that it uses tcp instead of tcp6?

                              <span>I love using mindmapping alongside outlining. They both support deconstructing ideas in a tree structure, except that mindmaps offer a spatial way of arranging items, while the outliner does it as a list. I like to mindmap first and then turn it into an outline.
 I figured out a dead simple way of doing it that doesn&#x27;t involve messing around with freeplane plugins that export to Org-mode. (I tried one, it didn&#x27;t work for me.) The One Downside - It only works with the nodes, not it&#x27;s properties like attributes and notes.
 Step 1
  
Open Freeplane, go to Format &gt; Manage Styles &gt; Edit Styles (Or just hit C+f11).
 On the branch called Automatic level styles, select the top level node
 On the right side pane are the controls. Scroll down to Core Text and in the field called Format add this: * %…</span>

                              <span>Hi there!
 I&#x27;m new to programming and am learning Python!
 I decided to go with Emacs, and you might be asking why. Well, I&#x27;ve dabbled a bit with Emacs in the past, and I&#x27;m intrigued by its feature set, which I believe could greatly enhance my programming-fu. I&#x27;m using Termux with an external keyboard because I do not have access to a computer. Is my approach off-base? Is there a significant difference between using emacs vs emacs -nw ? Can I just stick to the vanilla setup for programming in Python?
 Your insights are greatly appreciated.
 Thanks!

                              <span>I downloaded org-superstar from Melpa last evening and immediately emacs prompted me that 7 packages were not being used. Being a newbie, I thought &quot;great, lets clear those out&quot; and I followed the instructions to delete them. On restarting this morning, I realised that the deleted packages were my Modus-themes, Golden-ratio and pdf-tools (with other pdf related files), all of which are loaded every time I start emacs and essential to my newbie workflow.
 Does emacs have a habit of suggesting that you delete files that are actually used and setup in your init.el? ..or more likely, what am I doing wrong that emacs suggested that I delete them?

 I am trying to build an Android Lineage version for a device that is outdated now. 
 I&#x27;m getting errors on the brunch command about some duplicated entries in a file. I know that these entries come from a file called &quot;file_contexts&quot;, and I would like that specific entry in order to remove it from a proper file. But since Android codebase is massive I would like to:
  
Get all the files called &quot;file_contexts&quot; found. For that I could use consult-find, right?
 
Then get all these files as an input for consult-ripgrep somehow.
 
 I have absolutely no idea if this could be a possibility but hey, this is r/emacs!

                              <span>TL;DR - How do I incorporate backlink searches into my org-ql queries?
 ​
 I am re-structuring my notes to adapt to new demands. I really like the non-hierarchical approach where individual notes are org-mode headers (or files) with an ID property that I can simply link to.
 Org-ql is fantastic at querying org-mode headers, keeping dynamic blocks based on those queries, etc. Using org-ql, I can also query for links within a heading. What I am missing is the option to query for backlinks TO the heading. Has anyone solved this problem?
 ​
 Simple example:
 * Drug A :drug: :PROPERTIES: :ID: 12345 :END: This is an inhibitor of [[id:54321][Protein X]]. * Protein X :protein: :PROPERTIES: :ID: 54321 :END: This is a trans-membrane protein that is over-expressed in breast cancer. 
 If I&#x27;m interested in the a subset of inhibitor drugs that are linked to Protein X I can do:
 [[org-ql-search:(and (rifle &quot;inhibitor&quot;) (link &quot;Protein X&quot;))]] 
 But what about finding trans-membrane proteins are associated with (i.e. &quot;backlinked to&quot;) inhibitors?
 ​
 OR - maybe there is a way to use org-ql results as org-ql query inputs? For example: 
  
Query 1: pull out all drugs.
 Query 2: pull out all proteins.
 Query 3: identify all proteins (from Query 2) that have a backlink to drugs (from Query 1).
  
​
 I&#x27;m a bit stuck. Any help or pointers would be appreciated.

                              <span>tldr; Looking for packages for customizing dired listings.
 Howdy. I&#x27;ve recently gotten an &quot;Emacs splinter&quot; about the format of dired directory listings and after playing with dired-listing-switches I&#x27;ve determined there are not enough knobs there to allow me to filter out some of the stuff I want to filter out. I see that I can write some custom filters also which might take me where I want to go but my elisp skills are still somewhat meager and I have quite a lot on my plate already.
 Does anyone have any recommendations for elisp packages already in the ecosystem which might be a quick win here? More so to filter the contents of the listings and not so much, for example, colors (ex:diredfl).
 thx!

 The use-package doc says that is uses the function (bind-key) so something like this should work, but actually doesn&#x27;t:

 Am I just missing some syntactical finesse or is what I want not possible with use-package&#x27;s :bind?

 I would like to dabble in org-brain aside from org-roam. Unfortunately the documentation is pretty thin and there are no instructions what I need to do in order to adapt it to Doom emacs. Org-brain is a flag in the doom config file, but I am pretty sure I need to set it up as well. 
 Can someone aid me in doing it? I am sure some of have done it or at least know what I need to do for adapting packages. I heard you shouldn&#x27;t install as if it was vanilla emacs, but I only starting to understand what that means. 
 Thanks for your help

I have a Keyboard Maestro macro that does it, but it would be nice if I could have something in my saved searches.
(The KM macro: activates The Archive; types command-L (selects Omnibar); types delete keystroke (to clear it); types command-U (to generate a Zettel ID); types delete keystroke four times (to remove the hour and minute ending of the ID).</span>

                              <span>Sorry if this question has been asked before, I want to learn Haskell and I have very little programming experience(only Python &amp; some robotics C) and I&#x27;m conflicted at the moment.
 My roadmap is:
  
HFTVB by John Whitington or the Haskell Wikibook
 Write yourself a Scheme tutorials
 Learn Haskell by Building a Blog Generator by Gilmi.
  
Is it worth buying on HFTVB? Or is the Wikibook good enough? Or more importantly, am I being redundant since all of the above are focused on beginners? As in, would it be better to just jump into LHBG?
 By looking at the options above, you&#x27;ll notice that I have:
  
A preference for text over video courses.
 A phobia from large books which I see recommended on here. I like things succinct where the questions lead me to discover more of the material and where I am left with space to figure things out for myself.
  
I know at this point this is quite a repetitive question, but I&#x27;m really interested in starting as soon as possible and would like not to go through the phase of trying out a 1000 unrelated things until I figure out which is right for me, I know my preferences and prefer sticking to them.
 I also read about LYAH, and while it seems quaint the no exercises disqualifies it immediately from the race. I like my resources jam-packed with exercises.

                              <span>I wrote a short Haskell book several years ago and every 6 months or so I like to update the stack resolver version for the example programs.
 I noticed that a VSCode Haskell plugin expects a GHCup setup. I am thinking of forking my own code and experimenting with just using Cabal and GHCup installed tools, and also get rid of my stack.yml files in each project directory.
 A few years ago it seemed that stack removed many of the pain points I had with Haskell but now I am re-evaluating that belief.
 Any advice will be appreciated!!

 Release notes:
  
After an upgrade from an earlier version of Stack, on first use only, Stack 2.15.1 may warn that it had trouble loading the CompilerPaths cache.
 The hash used as a key for Stack&#x27;s pre-compiled package cache has changed, following the dropping of support for Cabal versions older than 1.24.0.0.
  
Changes since v2.13.1:
 Behavior changes:
  
Stack does not leave *.hi or *.o files in the setup-exe-src directory of the Stack root, and deletes any corresponding to a setup-
.hs or setup-shim-
.hs file, to avoid GHC issue #21250.
 If Stack&#x27;s Nix integration is not enabled, Stack will notify the user if a nix executable is on the PATH. This usually indicates the Nix package manager is available. …</span>
