 This program is independent of Google Summer of Code, but it offers the same opportunities, including mentorship and a stipend, to would-be Haskell contributors.
 You don&#x27;t have to be a student to participate - your eagerness and desire to learn are enough!
 Project proposals are due by April 20, 2023.
 Details, including application instructions and a list of suggested projects and volunteer mentors, can be found at: https://summer.haskell.org
 If your company or organization wants to support new contributors to open source, please write us an email at summerhaskell.org. Funding a stipend or two can have a large positive impact on the Haskell ecosystem!

 Hello everyone! 
 I have a challenge for you :) I&#x27;m new to Haskell and I&#x27;m looking for a solution to this problem...
 I have this given datatype for a QuadTree (trees whose internal nodes have 4 children)
 data QT a &#x3D; C a | Q (QT a) (QT a) (QT a) (QT a) 
 Which is used to represent 2^n x 2^n matrices. 
 For example the matrix:

                              <span>Hi all,
 I was wondering a while ago how Haskell &quot;decides&quot; if a given recursive type definition should be given by the least or greatest fixed point. In particular, for a given type equation there are two canonical solutions given by the least and greatest fixed point respectively. But certain types &quot;feel&quot; more like one than the other. For example, lists or Peano numerals &quot;feel&quot; like least fixed points, whereas streams &quot;feel&quot; like greatest fixed points (and in fact the LFP solution is just the empty type, ignoring bottom). So then how does Haskell decide which form to take if the user never specifies?
 So this got me thinking: are Haskell recursive datatypes always given by greatest fixed points? This does seem to make sense mathematically, as for example gfp X. (1 + X) would give the naturals plus a point at infinity, and this translates in Haskell to
 data Nat &#x3D; Z | S Nat zero &#x3D; Z one &#x3D; S Z two &#x3D; S (S Z) ... inf &#x3D; S inf 
 (i.e. we can implement a term representing an infinite stack of successors)
 So is this actually the case? Does Haskell justify recursive datatypes by greatest fixed points? Or maybe does it not really care about any mathematical justification (i.e. you just get what you get by making a tagged union and putting pointers to the right types)?

 For some reason sometimes when I type this combination my Emacs freezes. If I hit C-g something quits and the backward-kill-word command finishes. I can&#x27;t figure out exactly when it happens because sometimes it just works fine. 
 What is a good approach to debug this? How can I find out what the something is that is freezing my Emacs?

                              <span>For some environments you have no choice to use emacs in a terminal ... 
 1) Can you see breakpoints in terminal mode with realgud:gdb and gdb ? 
 2) Can you evaluate variables in terminal mode ? 
 For me breakpoints are not visibles
 To evaluate with gdb it is answered file is &quot;read only&quot;
 To evaluate with realgud-gdb is there another way that ask in gdb prompt ? 
 How do you do for 1) and 2) ? or you always prefer another tool that emacs ?

 I am using mac os and I have looked online to fixing this dvipng problem but none of those solutions were not able to fix the above issue on my macbook. I am also wondering if this is because my org-roam directory is on onedrive. It seems when I double click the file from the directory in my mac it opens up that file in emacs without error. But when I do C-c n f it gives me the error.

                              <span>I have seen there are quite a few options, hoping someone can suggest one which works well as a coding assistant.
 Think along the lines of asking questions about the selected region, like what does this error mean can you convert this to a different format for me, can you generate some code todo this.
 Been using it to convert sql to honeysql and it can do a pretty good job saving me converting it currently doing it in browser but would like some closer integration.

 THE GOAL:
 launch an emacs web server, in a new session, to serve the files contained within the &quot;public&quot; directory, which is located in same directory my script is called.
 THE APPROACH:
 use a basic shell script (./launch.sh) to run an emacs-lisp build script (./build.el) that uses org-publish to publish my org files to HTML files in the (.public/) directory, mentioned earlier, then serve them in a web server written in emacs-lisp.. amazing.
 THE CODE:
 ./launch.sh
  #!/bin/bash emacs -Q --script build.el &amp; 
 ./build.…</span>

 I tried something like what is below...
 #+name: cor:1 #+begin_corollary This is my corollary. #+end_corollary [[cor:1]] 
 But in the pdf, it shows up as ??. I am not really sure what is going on. TOCs for my documents are no longer appearing as well, so it could be that they are related. Any help is appreciated.

                              <span>Hi all --
 The recentf command gives me listings like this, hiding the useful bit (the actual filename) behind the too-long path listing:
 ~/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/highweirdness/essays/ecstas... -rw------ 17k (etc)
 Ugh! What I want is to see:
 Dropbox/highweirdness/essays/fullfilename.mdown (etc)
 In God&#x27;s name, how do I customize recentf output to collapse e.g. ~/Library/CloudStorage/ ?
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>So I decided to declare emacs bankruptcy and I&#x27;ve decided to take the opportunity to try using a new package manager. I decided on elpaca. I also heard about leaf, which is a (package configurator/loader) alternative to use-package? According to the elpaca documentation, one is supposed to use use-package like this:
 ;; Install use-package support (elpaca elpaca-use-package ;; Enable :elpaca use-package keyword. (elpaca-use-package-mode) ;; Assume :elpaca t unless otherwise specified. (setq elpaca-use-package-by-default t)) ;; Block until current queue processed. (elpaca-wait) ;; Expands to: (elpaca evil (use-package evil :demand t)) (use-package evil :demand t)

 I use the following code to set &#x27;lsp-java-format-settings-url to override the default format config.
 But it doesn&#x27;t work (it&#x27;s still the old behavior when I run #&#x27;lsp-format-buffer).
  (use-package lsp-java :config (add-hook &#x27;java-mode-hook &#x27;lsp)) (setq lsp-java-format-settings-url &quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/styleguide/gh-pages/eclipse-java-google-style.xml&quot;) (setq lsp-java-format-settings-profile &quot;GoogleStyle&quot;) (setq lsp-java-format-settings-trim-whitespace t) 
 Any input is appreciated.

 I wrote very basic introductory series on Cats Effect 3 especially for newbies to effect system. Here is the link https://yadukrishnan.live/series/cats-effect
 Please do let me know if this is helpful for anyone.
 This was not intended for people already familiar with the CE, Monix, ZIO etc, but for people who are trying to get started with CE-3.

I was thinking about breaking this existing file up into many pieces by date into it&#x27;s own subdirectory and naming the files by date. Maybe having a file by day, though I could possibly get away with the files still being small enough by having a file per-month versus per-day.
 As such I need new captures to go to a new file (automatically naming file like YYYY-MM-DD__suffix.org) if it is a new day and then continue to put additional captures to that new file throughout that day. Then it would begin the cycle again for the next day.
 I believe this is beyond the existing functionality of org-capture from my research so maybe there is package out there that works like this or maybe I just have to figure out how to code an e-lisp solution if not?

 Scenario:
 I change the state of a todo item from TODO to WAITING FOR EXPORT. When that happens I want to automatically create a new todo item in my todos.org file, that has the title RUN EXPORT with a scheduled date for tomorrow. 
 This fits my workflow perfectly and is a function that I&#x27;ve always wanted from other todo list apps :)

 #+BEGIN_SRC python :results output print(2) #+END_SRC #+RESULTS: 
 with the following configuration:
 (setq python-python-command &quot;/usr/local/bin/python3&quot;) (setq python-shell-interpreter &quot;/usr/local/bin/python3&quot;) (org-babel-do-load-languages &#x27;org-babel-load-languages &#x27;((emacs-lisp . t) (shell . t) (python . t))) (use-package python-mode :ensure nil :custom (python-shell-interpreter &quot;/usr/local/bin/python3&quot;)) 
 But running the code block by having the cursor inside the block and pressing C-c C-c I get the error/message from the *Org-Babel Error Output* buffer saying:
  
/bin/bash: python: command not found
  
With no output being produced not matter the code I use. I assume my config is still poorly setup since the error is referencing /bin/bash for some reason?

                              <span>Hi all,
 Installing emacs-nox (using yum) on Centos-7 (on an old AMD PC), It is also installing trousers package (tss). Question is why?
 Thanks!
 (my first reddit post!)

                              <span>Po Lu is writing the Android port and closing out issues in prep for landing native Android support into Emacs 30. (The main development branch creates Emacs 30.0.50). 
 This moring &quot;Po says&quot;:
  
Would people please test the latest prebuilts at: 
 https://sourceforge.net/projects/android-ports-for-gnu-emacs/ 
 and verify that they indeed work correctly on all of these newer
 systems? 
  
There is also now an emacs-30 folder on GNU alpha. Only one build (&quot;master&quot; at revision 28a9438169f) is posted, so far, plus initial dependencies and dependency source archives.

                              <span>Someone on the internet thinks that I&#x27;m doing a bad job of advertising my Emacs package Eat (a pure Emacs Lisp terminal emulator).
 So, how should a package author advertise their Emacs package while not overdoing it? Extra points if possible without using proprietary software and unethical platforms.
 [I have asked the same question on Fediverse, and someone sent me here to this subreddit.)

                              <span>What I am about to say is best reproduced with an empty configuration. So if you want to reproduce this issue just back up your ~/.emacs.d and any other init files to a different folder and try this.
  
First I run M-x customize.
 In the search box I search font-lock-comment-face. The default color is shown as Firebrick and the default state is STANDARD.
 Change the color to green.
 Then Apply and Save. The state becomes SAVED and set.
 Check ~/.emacs. It has this code inserted: &#x27;(font-lock-comment-face ((t (:foreground &quot;green&quot;))))
 Now Revert &gt; Erase Customizations. The face is now -- Empty face --. The state becomes EDITED, shown value does not take effect until you set or save it. (This is where I have trouble. Why is the state not STANDARD again? Why is the face not Firebrick again?)
 Then Apply and Save. 
 Check ~/.emacs. It has &#x27;(font-lock-comment-face ((t nil))).
 The comments are now black in my code.
  
Why does &quot;Erase customizations&quot; remove the default value? Why does it not revert the customization to standard state as mentioned in Emacs documentation?

 I&#x27;m a bit able to read and write Japanese and know how inputsystems like IMEI work. I never used Japanese as input or output in Emacs. So I&#x27;m not sure why it is relevant for Emacs.

                              <span>So I was just going through my older journal entries and found the following entry: 
  
I do not think that AI is the right choice for a lot of our things if the underlying problem of freeing humans always remains. It makes more sense to me to be a part of a group where the focus is on freeing our time through removal of shackling of our time than to build AIs that feed the capitalist to extract more wealth from underpaying humans and from keeping them subjugated to 8 hour work days no matter how advanced the AI is. Eventually, the AI is going to be a prime worker for the capitalist than for the betterment of humanity. 
 I refuse to be a part of this process and that is why I am choosing not to get into those domains in any which way. 
 Emacs therefore remains my stronghold that I would like to curate and build my freedom from. If one cannot free themselves from 8 hour senselessness, then they can build stuff to free up time and work from home and do other more productive and happiness, mental peace bringing things. Productive here means that doing what I really want to do and doing it rather than producing as much value for the capitalist who would rather discard me if there was a more productive person or an AI.
  
This reminded me about one of the prime reasons why I wanted to use Emacs - it&#x27;s extensibility that enabled me to build shortcuts and workflows that help me with shaving off sufficient amount of time which I spent on repetitive tasks. The trick however is to not to be vocal about your efficiency to your bosses because the time saved will be used against you to staff you with more work whether you want it or not. 
 Go use the time saved to spend with your loved ones, yourself, exercise, learn something, do nothing or even just calm and rest. It&#x27;s your reclaimed time. 
 Who else does this?

                              <span>I&#x27;m not sure if chatgpt these days is powered by GPT-4 or not, but it&#x27;s showing improvements in some areas compared to where it was a few months ago. Nowadays, if I ask it &quot;Why do sharks eat elephant eggs&quot; it doesn&#x27;t tell me that sharks rarely get a chance to do so cause elephant eggs are so large and on land, but rather that elephants do not lay eggs.
 Today I decided to test it by asking how one would use Scala 3 macros to get the types of the inputs and outputs of a method. It had some decent suggestions to do that for someone that is new to macros, but a lot of its answer was false, suggesting people use something called QuotesContext, not recognizing properly what extension methods are available for the Symbol type, and worst of all, trying to splice Type values into an Expr.
 If they can manage to get chatgpt to actually tell the truth consistently (like saying &quot;I don&#x27;t know how to do that&quot; rather than just lying) I think it will be a nice resource for discovering how to do stuff you don&#x27;t currently know how to do. Sadly, it&#x27;s still got a nasty habit of making stuff up.

                              <span>Is it possible to treat headings with TODO keywords fundamentally different in the LaTeX export? I&#x27;d like to not treat them as headings, in a normal document structure, but rather render them as insertion, interupting the document structure, but i still want to render normal headings as normal headings, which are part of the document structure.
 I&#x27;d prefer to do this using pandoc, but if there is an easy alternative, I&#x27;d happily take it.

                              <span>I often find myself realizing I want to convert a heading tree structure to a plain list, with checkboxes. And I find I have to do that by hand. The closest I have found in the docs to doing what I want is org-toggle-item, but at least the standard behavior doesn&#x27;t preserve the depth of the heading that you convert, and it also doesn&#x27;t work on a whole subtree, but instead just over a single item. 
 Why isn&#x27;t this a common enough use-case to be built-in functionality? How is this not something that everyone else wants all the time too?

                              <span>Hi all,
 I use Haskell as a hobbyist (Go at work) and have been learning it for some time now. After going through books like Get Programming with Haskell and Haskell in Depth and making some projects I want to delve deeper into the more advanced stuff available with the language an become proficient with it (usage of DataKinds, GADTs, HKTs and so on, even linear types).
 However, I&#x27;m finding it difficult to come with use cases for these features and examples where these features can be the most appropriate answer. I struggle to wrap my head around the concepts as they are exposed in Haskell in Depth for example. Of course I don&#x27;t blame the book, but I feel there wasn&#x27;t enough room in it for me to get the clear picture (as obviously there were many more things to cover in around 600 pages)…</span>

                              <span>I was introduced to Haskell by a friend a few years ago (he has a PhD in Automatic Theorem Proving). I tried learning, but got bogged down by the mathematical intricacies.
 Fast forward a few years and I went to a couple sessions about category theory by Bartosz Milewski (in person), but it still seemed way over my head.
 I&#x27;ve been a software engineer for ~6 years now, and have always been interested in the concept of formal verification, &quot;proof-based&quot; correctness, etc, and Haskell always seems to come up. How do I learn Haskell properly this time? The &quot;Learn you a Haskell for Great Good!&quot; didn&#x27;t quite resonate with me, so open to suggestions!

 Progress so far: * CentOS 7 yum install ghc provides 7.6, but ghc 9.0.2 requires ghc 8.8 to build (which requires 8.4, which requires 8.0, which requires 7.8, which can be built with 7.6) * Wasn&#x27;t able to figure out how to cross compile for this platform using this doc: https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/wikis/building/cross-compiling * Ubuntu bionic does provide ghc 8.0 with the same glibc version, which does work when copied into CentOS 7 * Building ghc 8.4 on CentOS 7 is now giving me &quot;C99-compatible compiler needed&quot;

 how is Just (x, f x) equivalent to (a -&gt; Maybe (a, a))?
 ​
 Then using unfoldr :: (b -&gt; Maybe (a,b)) -&gt; b -&gt; [a] unfoldr f b &#x3D; case f b of Nothing -&gt; [] Just (a,b) -&gt; a : unfoldr f b we can recreate iterate &#x3D; unfoldr . g?
 ​
 I want to think of it like unfoldr(g(f, ?), ?) but don&#x27;t understand where the arguments go?

                              <span>This question may be asked may times. Please give an other chance. I started playing around with Haskell for few weeks now. Slowly I am getting more interested towards it. I am programming for more than a decade. Much of my programming is around C#, Java &amp; JavaScript(Currently). I am exploring functional programming for few months now, just out of curiosity. Now am thinking to move my career towards new paradigm and projects.
 1. How big is job market for Haskell and which are the major industries? ( of course location is important, am currently based out of India), But generally.
  
Where Haskell stands against other functional programming languages like Scala, F# &amp; Clojure, in terms of usage in industry and which are those? 
 
Optimal learning path and projects to start with!
 
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Is there any source for haskell best practices? Or haskell tips/useful design patterns ? Although i have grasped the basics like monad transformers, existential types, type families, etc i feel as if i still need more experience and knowledge.
 for instance when should i use state? and when doing so what are the considerations when choosing between IOrefs, MVars , STM or the state monad?
 Besides the libraries in the CLC which are the &quot;default&quot; libraries for a certain topic? For instance for xml there are 3 libraries, i have many questions in this style/topic and feel that many others may as well have them.

                              <span>I&#x27;m working through Bruce Tate&#x27;s &quot;7 Languages in 7 Weeks&quot; and need to establish a GHC 6.12.1 environment, or something pretty similar. I understand this is not the latest Haskell compiler - I intentionally want to match versions and work through specific examples, that are over a decade old. My goal is to work through the exercises as Bruce, the author, intended. 
 Are there any pre-built VMs, or community resources for easy-installations for older versions? I tried asdf and the version of Haskell was just too old to get the right pieces together for compilation.

 agenda/calendar, something compatible with caldav/davx ?
  
What are you guys using ? I&#x27;d love to have something integrated.

Overview: Khoj now exposes a chat interface to your second brain. Uses GPT models by OpenAI.
 Background: I&#x27;d posted about Khoj a few months ago. Since then khoj.el has become available on MELPA, gotten a Chat interface and can automatically set up the backend python package. Thought I&#x27;d provide an update for folks to try it out.
 Chat Features

                              <span>Sometimes I copy or move a file from one directory (&#x60;com/example/foo&#x60;) to another (&#x60;com/example/bar&#x60;). I then end up with a file that should be in the package com.exmaple.bar with the statement package com.example.foo. Is there an lsp-java command to fix the package statement, assuming that the directory is correct? 
 I can write something that searches for the package statement and checks it against the directory, but if the code already exists, I&#x27;d rather just use it. And it&#x27;s probably been checked against some corner cases that I&#x27;m initially going to miss (like if there is no package statement at all).

                              <span>So far I&#x27;ve been using tree-sitter.el with the tree-sitter-hl-mode for syntax highlighting. As far as I understand, Tree Sitter is now built-into Emacs 29 and above as treesit (https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/master/admin/notes/tree-sitter/starter-guide), which makes tree-sitter.el obsolete. There is also this package https://github.com/renzmann/treesit-auto which seems to handle the installation, mapping and activation of the language modes.
 But what I don&#x27;t understand is, how do I activate syntax hightlighing with treesit, without having tree-sitter-hl-mode? Is this done automatically once the major mode for a given language supports Tree Sitter? With the help of treesit-auto?

                              <span>Hi I have created the below script with the intention of allowing me to have certain tasks recur on set days. I am sick of having multiple Task &#x27;A&#x27;s because they need to be executed on Monday, Wednesday, Saturday. However I am having an issue with the final step. When I select the task and hit Enter, it automatically marks it as done but then provides me with a prompt to select the next day to re-occur. 
 Is there a better way to do this?

 I like to run emacs as a daemon. But why is systemd useful for that?

 Sacha Chua has solved this: https://sachachua.com/blog/2021/04/emacs-hydra-allow-completion-when-i-can-t-remember-the-command-name/
 Except, the binding to tab in the hydra-base-map doesn&#x27;t work, I can&#x27;t figure out why. The my/hydra-execute-extended function works great though, if you invoke it after quitting hydra.
 Any ideas how to fix the binding?
 P.S. Huge thanks to Sacha, I learned a lot about emacs through her blog.

 But how can I investigate such crashes?
 I&#x27;m using Emacs29 as daemon in (SSH) terminal. There is not error or debug output. It just disappears.
 What can I do to improve the output?

                              <span>I do use Emacs 27 (Debian 11) on a RaspeberryPi 4 via SSH shell. I do OrgRoam and Python. The lsp-server (eglot) is disabled most of the time because of performance problems.
 It is working but slow in some situations.
 Are there improvements between 27 and 29 that could possible improve the performance of Emacs use?

                              <span>Is there a preferred way to set up multi language/dictionary spell checking on windows?
 Reading up, it seemed ispell using Hunspell is what is mostly used, but also seems on windows you have to use a very old Hunspell version (1.3.x?) or have issues with it not finding dictionaries.
 Just trying to find a way to do spellchecking in English and my native language in Emacs without spending days setting up workarounds to make things work.

                              <span>My use case is that I don&#x27;t want to switch to terminal just for some simple commands (commands that I just need to execute then and leave) like docker-compose -f /very/long/path/to/my/docker-compose.yml up -d, I think I can just make use of the  compile function like:
  compile  docker-compose -f /very/long/path/to/my/docker-compose.yml up -d 
 and it actually works. However I still have many other simple commands, for now I can navigate up/down one-by-one to find the exactly command, but it would be more productive to have the list of history suggestions (just like fzf command history) when I press &quot; compile &quot;
 How can I do that in emacs?
 p/s: I use vertico.

                              <span>The problem with missing &quot;org-assert-version&quot; is known and described a lot. Also the workaround. But I don&#x27;t get it.
 I&#x27;m using Emacs 27 from Debian 11 repo. I removed the whole ~/.emacs.d/elpa folder just to be sure that org is &quot;deinstalled&quot;.
 The I created this el file
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; (require &#x27;package) (add-to-list &#x27;package-archives &#x27;(&quot;elpa&quot; . &quot;https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/&quot;))
 (package-refresh-contents) (package-install &#x27;org) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 And loaded it via emacs -Q -l x.el. But I got the message that org is already installed.
 I don&#x27;t know how to go along.
 Some background info: That Emacs 27 was working very well the last year. But I tried Emacs29, build it myself. But then I removed it (via sudo make uninstall and make distclean). Something must happens since then.

                              <span>I released the first version of the Jinx spell checker on GNU ELPA. Jinx aims to be efficient and unobtrusive, such that you can enable it always. Jinx provides the jinx-correct command to correct the nearest misspelling via completion or all misspellings in the whole buffer if invoked with a prefix argument.
 For performance reasons Jinx directly binds to the libenchant native library and lazily checks only the visible portion of the current buffer. Libenchant provides backends like Hunspell and Nuspell which also power the spell checking in word processors or browsers.
 I am interested in your feedback. The package is still young, so expect some rough edges. See the following links for more details.

                              <span>I know this must be in docs somewhere, but I haven&#x27;t been able to make it cooperate and it&#x27;s been driving me to cocoa puffs. 
 What causes org-roam to jump to the capture even when &#x60;:jump-to-capture nil&#x60; is set on the template it uses? https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam/issues/1292 (seems to be an issue others have run into)
 ​
 Looking through the code it appears a &#x60;:finalize&#x60; template keyword is used to potentially run either &#x60;org-roam-capture--finalize-find-file&#x60; or &#x60;org-roam-capture--finalize-insert-link&#x60; (it seems to be running the former now) 
 Everything I change in the template seems to be irrelevant. 
 At this point I&#x27;m thinking of just removing the entire org-roam-capture--finalize hook from org-capture-after-finalize-hook. And just resyncing the db separately?

                              <span>Hello, I recently started learning how to use Nix Os and I am running it on a LXC container in a Proxmox host. I was wondering whether anyone has a recommened way to set up a remote graphical emacsclient through x2go. I am willing to share my configuration details and other information necessary to get it working. I read through the post here:https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/8t461y/how_to_run_a_graphical_emacsclient_on_a_remote/ which covers the main steps, however, once I run the x2go client, It runs into a blank white screen. If I change the session type to XFCE I am able to see a desktop but I can&#x27;t interact with anything on the screen.

 (mu is an email search engine, and mu4e is the emacs e-mail client on top of that)
 Grab it here: https://github.com/djcb/mu/releases/tag/v1.10.0; For all details, see https://github.com/djcb/mu/blob/release/1.10/NEWS.org (and I&#x27;d recommend reading that before installing), but some highlights are:
 For mu4e:
  
mu4e now keeps track of _updates_ in your mail, compared to some baseline; in the bookmarks list you see e.g. 1(+1)/2 for a bookmark, which means that there was one new message since &#x27;baseline&#x27;. See the manual for details https://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/mu4e/Bookmarks-and-Maildirs.html
 this also feeds in to the much improved mode-line support which shows the same information, also outside mu4e, so you see when there&#x27;s new mail; and in the not…</span>

 I’d played with emacs before then, but I stuck with vim because I liked it’s keybindings more.
 I’m not trying to cause a war here, but do you think that users trying to replicate vim are missing out on anything?

But all the links connecting my notes seem to be broken in org (which makes sense I guess, anyway whenever I click a link I get a messaage with &quot;No match - create this as a new heading? y or n&quot;). Is there a way to convert the md-files to org and at the same time keep the links and connections in my vault intact (I have a lot of notes so editing the links would take a looong time)?

                              <span>I am trying to switch to eshell from vterm+zsh and I find some of the user experience frustrating. For example, while pcomplete opens a new window for completion it does not switch to it automatically and it does not escape the spaces. This means that every time I have to add quotes myself or escape the spaces manually. I would also like pcomplete to be like orderless and vertico and allow me to select entries the same way.
 I am now using corfu with eshell and it is a bit less frustrating but it is still not smooth as much as zsh completion system is. For example, I have to press escape otherwise I cannot stop the corfu autocompletions once it is activated.
 So my questions are:
 ​
  
Is there a way to make pcomplete escape spaces and special characters when completing in eshell? Ideally I should not have to switch to the pcomplete window but it should be done automatically.
 Is there a way to use vertico and orderless, rather than pcomplete, or even in tandem with pcomplete? I would like my eshell experience to be as close to the rest of the Emacs.
 Is there any other suggestion or improvement that makes you life in eshell easier?
  
​
 Thank you very much.

                              <span>Hi,
 Just updated to the newest Emacs 29, with straight.el:  (use-package expand-region :straight (expand-region.el :type git :host github :repo &quot;magnars/expand-region.el&quot;) :bind ((&quot;M-e&quot; . er/expand-region)) ) 
 While this package used to work correctly on an early December 2022 snapshot of Emacs 29, currently it no longer seems to work correctly. As soon as I invoke the command er/expand-region, the entire document is selected instead of (sub)sections of an org document, or paragraphs in a text document.
 Did anyone encounter this issue?
 Bad
 PS: I encountered some other issues with this Emacs 29 version that could be fixed by just re-loading the top elisp file of a package (e.g., yasnippet), but this would not work here.

                              <span>Today I had to painfully go through each commit in a series of 10 that I was interested in re-wording. I marked a region on the Git history I was looking at and tried unsuccessfully to re-word all of them (each at the time), it is the commit under the pointer or nothing.
 The same happens when I want to remove commits. And I also don&#x27;t understand how to cherry-pick commits from one branch to another (I did learned about &quot;donate&quot; commits using Magit, which does what I want with a region of commits)
 How am I supposed to use these features from Magit? What am I doing wrong?

                              <span>A &quot;morgue file&quot; is a collection of notes, articles, and files kept by investigators or journalists for possible future use. Today, I have developed a morgue file that in my zettelkasten that collects items that I think might provide fodder for my fiction writing.
I write speculative fiction and so I track newspaper articles or reports that I think might serve as the germ of a story. Then, as part of my writing process, I&#x27;ll make a new (structure) note and include links to articles or pieces that might inspire pieces of my story (whether character, setting, or plot).
For example, I recently learned about Point Nemo, a &quot;spacecraft cemetery&quot; in the Pacific Ocean that is a &quot;pole of inaccessibility,&quot; the location farthest from any land. This was intriguing enough, so I did some more cursory reading and learned (among other things) that it is also a remarkably lifeless part of the ocean because it is so far from land. Also, in spite of not being officially identified as the &quot;pole of inaccessibility&quot; until 1992, Point Nemo is near where H.P. Lovecraft placed R&#x27;lyeh, the lost city where Cthulhu is imprisoned!
At any rate, I now have a cluster of notes about Point Nemo that is forming the gensis of a story about scavengers trying to salvage material in this remote location. The real-life details are helping me flesh out the skeleton of a plot and raising more questions for me to explore. (For example, I know next to nothing about what might be involved in this salvage operation, so I now have some more reading to do!)
I thought I&#x27;d share in case others are interested in using their zettelkasten to generate ideas for fiction, and to learn from others who might implement a similar practice. Do you have any other tips or advice? Pitfalls to avoid?</span>

But all the links connecting my notes seem to be broken in org (which makes sense I guess, anyway whenever I click a link I get a messaage with &quot;No match - create this as a new heading? y or n&quot;). Is there a way to convert the md-files to org and at the same time keep the links and connections in my vault intact (I have a lot of notes so editing the links would take a looong time)?

                              <span>Hi there,
 today I updated to the latest HEAD of the Emacs 29 branch. It looks like it broke several packages.
 First: yasnippet. When enabled via yas-global-mode it regularly causes errors like this:
 Debugger entered--Lisp error: (wrong-number-of-arguments # 2) vertico-exit(undo 0.5) yas--post-command-handler() 
 The second one is highlight-indent-guides. When enabled it throws errors like this:
 Error during redisplay: (jit-lock-function 1) signaled (wrong-number-of-arguments # 0) Error during redisplay: (jit-lock-function 1501) signaled (wrong-number-of-arguments # 0) Error during redisplay: (jit-lock-function 3001) signaled (wrong-number-of-arguments # 0) Error during redisplay: (jit-lock-function 2488) signaled (wrong-number-of-arguments # 0) Error during redisplay: (jit-lock-function 3988) signaled (void-function nil) 
 I can&#x27;t get a backtrace via toggle-debug-on-error, sorry :(
 It also looks like I can avoid these errors by disabling nativecomp: when setting this in early-init.el:
 (setq native-comp-jit-compilation-deny-list &#x27;(&quot;.*&quot;) native-comp-speed -1) 
 all errors are gone.
 Is this my fault?
 Best regards, CK

                              <span>I made a small package to add some actions to evil-mode using the new built-in tree sitter library. The package only works with Emacs 29 or greater. To activate, just run M-x evil-ts-mode. This was so easy to do, that it hardly merits a package. But perhaps it will be useful to someone. I use it mostly with python, but I&#x27;m guessing it should work OK with other languages.

 Notes:
 - I changed the file-naming convention with this version. Binary sets are now named to include the git revision short code instead of the date of build.
 - My build script seems to work gooder than ever b4 so I&#x27;ll probably start making these snapshots pretty aggressively, as I see commits to the Emacs 29 branch, during the final push to release of Emacs 29.1

                              <span>I&#x27;m having an issue with getting dired to show a folder on a remote server that is running zsh and MacOS. I have the fix in for my .zshrc file that has this line so that at least the login works:
 [[ $TERM &#x3D;&#x3D; &quot;dumb&quot; ]] &amp;&amp; unsetopt zle &amp;&amp; PS1&#x3D;&#x27;$ &#x27; &amp;&amp; return
 ​
 When remoting in, it will list files at the home directory, but when I try to switch into any folder remotely, I don&#x27;t see a directory listing.
 When looking at the Messages buffer, I do see this message: 
 Invalid face reference: dired-directory-face [72 times]. 
 Is it possible this is related, and is there a workaround?

                              <span>I am trying all of this in GUI Emacs (not terminal). I have defined the following key-binding:
 (global-set-key (kbd &quot;C-S-1&quot;) (lambda () (interactive) (message &quot;Hello&quot;))) 
 But if I press C-S-1 I get this error:
 C-! is undefined 
 I know that this works:
 (global-set-key (kbd &quot;C-!&quot;) (lambda () (interactive) (message &quot;Hey&quot;))) 
 Now on pressing C-! I do get the message &quot;Hey&quot;.
 But I want to know why my first key binding C-S-1 does not work?
 Note: I am not trying to solve any specific problem. So I am not looking for suggestions on how to &quot;solve&quot; the problem. There is nothing to solve. I am only trying to understand why C-S-1 does not work. Hopefully understanding this will teach me a thing or two about how Emacs key bindings.

  (setq global-auto-revert-mode 1) (setq auto-revert-use-notify nil) ;; e.g. for dired buffers (setq global-auto-revert-non-file-buffers t) 
 After starting emacs I checked the value of that variables and they are as expected.
 But auto-revert doesn&#x27;t work even in a simple txt file. I open a txt file. Then I also open it with another editor (geany), edit and save it. Nothing happens in emacs. When I try to edit that file in emacs I&#x27;m informed about that this file was modified. But this is to late. I want to make the revert automatic without asking me first.
 Then I disable(!) the global revert mode and enabled it again. Then it works. Modifications I do with Geany are loaded in the emacs buffer automatically.
 First I thought something interfered with my python/eglot/xyz setup. But as I say it also happens with a txt file.

                              <span>So, I&#x27;ve been using org-roam to make notes and what not. And it has been going great. Now, I have an exam, which is an open-book exam, so I think printing out my notes would be very useful, since it can get into details of things. So, I wonder if there is a way to export all the linked notes to HTML/PDF, so I can easily print them? Now, i don&#x27;t want notes to be in some order, it is just that I want if A -&gt; B (A links to B), and if A is getting exported, so should B. (I know there can be cycles, so I will traverse only few depths before I return).
 Does this sound like something which has been accomplished before, or I should try to do it before exams? :)

 I&#x27;d love to hear proponents of either OOP or FP explain why this short is wrong, if that&#x27;s possible. Keep in mind that writing software that can be changed is one of the important design ideas.

                              <span>So let&#x27;s say I have a main where I try to process input arguments, perhaps open a chosen file with specific extension only, read something from the file in an expected format, etc. And I have proc_args, check_extension, proc_file_data, functions. Each of those functions can fail, eg if necessary argument is missing, file with wrong extension has been provided, the file doesn&#x27;t follow the expected format. Based on what I know about haskell, using Maybe type as the return value of the functions seems reasonable to me, Nothing if it fails, Just result if it succeeds. What I&#x27;m having trouble with is how to actually utilize this in main. I do something like this
 let proc_args_result &#x3D; proc_args args if proc_args_result &#x3D;&#x3D; Nothing then die &quot;Invalid arguments&quot; else return() ... -- continue working with processed arguments 
 the problem is that if I want to continue working with the processed arguments, I still have the Maybe value instead of the actual value of the result. Alternative is using
 case proc_args args of { Nothing -&gt; die ... Just value -&gt; ... -- continue here } 
 but that will lead to uncontrollable indentation

 The error is
 Diagnostics: 1. • Couldn&#x27;t match expected type ‘p’ with actual type ‘r -&gt; Int’ ‘p’ is a rigid type variable bound by the inferred type of getter :: Example -&gt; p • In the expression: field In an equation for ‘getter’: getter (Example {field}) &#x3D; field In an equation for ‘fieldL’: fieldL &#x3D; lens getter setter where getter (Example {field}) &#x3D; field setter _ f &#x3D; Example {field &#x3D; f} • Relevant bindings include field :: r -&gt; Int getter :: Example -&gt; p 
 Why can I not create a lens for an existential data type? How can I make lenses for existential data types?
 Update: The real code is
 data RowHdr n e &#x3D; forall r. RowHdr { draw :: ListFocused -&gt; WidthDeficit -&gt; RowHdrCtxt -&gt; r -&gt; Widget n , width :: AvailWidth -&gt; [r] -&gt; RowHdrWidth , toRH :: e -&gt; Index -&gt; r } 
 I just want a lens into this data type.

                              <span>I know this functionality exists, but for the life of me cannot remember how to do so. 
 If I write a quick lisp function to calculate subtraction for example:
 (- 56000 55952)
 How can I evaluate just that line?
 Thank you so much!

                              <span>About 2 months ago, I moved from my 3 year old home baked config to Doom Emacs. Just recently I have noticed a problem with Treemacs. 
 If I use the Evil shortcut &#x60;SPC w h&#x60; on the right buffer, trying to goto the Treemacs window, I get an error saying &#x60;No window left from selected&#x60; . 
 This is certainly not the case as Treemacs is open on the left. If I&#x27;m in Treemacs buffer, I&#x27;m able to go out with &#x60;SPC w l&#x60; but not back in. 
 I feel like I have done something dumb with my config. Do you know how to fix this behaviour ??
 Thanks
 Not able to navigate to Treemacs buffer with &#x60;SPC w h&#x60;

 Is there some way to make an emacs buffer throw out face overrides and go back to the default?

                              <span>Hey there folks,
 pretty much got my emacs-based IDE working like a charm, save for one issue. But I&#x27;m REALLY banging my head against the wall with this one. Maybe someone can try to reproduce? I&#x27;m using lsp-mode with ts-ls. Works great for the most part, can&#x27;t get yasnippet to work with autocompletion no matter what I try, but I just bound inserting a snippet and it&#x27;s enough, so don&#x27;t mind that.
 I&#x27;m getting an error message from lsp-mode if I chuck in the following piece of code and move my cursor over the function name (triggering suggested code actions):
 function somefunc(arg_without_type) { } 
 The error message reads: https://hastebin.com/share/onatikugar.php
 Blurts it into the message and mini-buffer, too, so I can&#x27;t just ignore it, sadly. Looks like an error with the language server and not my config, but you never know. I&#x27;m pasting the mode configs that might have something to do with it below. If it isn&#x27;t my config, can someone recommend me a good alternative? I&#x27;m thinking tide.
 (use-package lsp-mode :after company :commands (lsp lsp-deferred) :init (setq lsp-keymap-prefix &quot;C-c l&quot;) :config (lsp-enable-which-key-integration t)) (use-package lsp-ui :bind ((&quot;C-,&quot; . lsp-ui-peek-find-references) (&quot;C-.&quot; . lsp-ui-peek-find-definitions)) :config (progn (define-key lsp-ui-mode-map [remap xref-find-definitions] #&#x27;lsp-ui-peek-find-definitions) (define-key lsp-ui-mode-map [remap xref-find-references] #&#x27;lsp-ui-peek-find-references))) (use-package flycheck :diminish :init (global-flycheck-mode)) (use-package company :diminish :hook (prog-mode . company-mode) :bind (:map company-active-map (&quot;&quot; . company-complete-selection)) (:map lsp-mode-map (&quot;&quot; . company-indent-or-complete-common)) :custom (company-minimum-prefix-length 1) (company-idle-delay 0.1)) 
 Thanks in advance!

 I tried this:
 :config (set1 company-format-margin-function #&#x27;company-vscode-light-icons-margin) 
 And this:
 :config (setq company-format-margin-function #&#x27;company-vscode-dark-icons-margin) 
 I saw both examples in other init files on github. But I do not get icons:

 I have all-the-icons installed and i have nerd fonts installed.
 Note - id rather use the built in company feature rather than another package.

                              <span>Hello,
 I am kinda posing a question in the form of a package here: basically, what’s the most efficient way to bind keys? It’s one of those questions I had neglected to ask for so long that I’m a little afraid to ask now, cuz keyboard macros are kind of a core feature to Emacs. Anyway, here&#x27;s what I wrote:

 I felt like there was a missing define-keys function, so I tried to provide it in this package. Rather than writing:
  (define-key some-map (kbd &quot;x&quot;) #&#x27;my-func) (define-key some-other-map (kbd &quot;x&quot;) #&#x27;my-func) (define-key some-map (kbd &quot;y&quot;) #&#x27;my-other-func) (define-key some-other-map (kbd &quot;y&quot;) #&#x27;my-other-func) etc...  skey lets you write:  (skey-define-keys &#x27;(some-map some-other-map) &#x27;((&quot;x&quot; my-func) (&quot;y&quot; my-other-func) etc...)) 
 As of this writing, skey is 9 lines of code in one function. Is there already a standard way to do this? Is everyone just using raw define-key, maybe in a loop? general? use-package’s :bind? Reinventing your own key definers? I explain more in the readme some of the ways I bind keys, but I was just curious how other people are doing things.
 Suggestions for additional features to this package are welcome, but I would be just as happy to learn that there’s a simple, standard way to do what this package does. Maybe add lazy loading by default or something? I dunno, this is kind of a weird post lol...

                              <span>I&#x27;m on Ubuntu 18.04. My current emacs version is Emacs 25.2.2.
 I&#x27;m told that the right way to upgrade Emacs is through the same method it was installed. But that&#x27;s hit a bit of a stumbling block.
 I&#x27;ve installed Emacs through Synaptic. According to Synaptic, I&#x27;m on the latest version (Version 47??? What does that number refer to?). So I can&#x27;t update through that.
 I&#x27;d love to be more up-to-date, but I don&#x27;t want to create any problems through installing from another method. What&#x27;s the right way to do this? 
 Do I have to un-install from Synaptic and re-install from the command line? And if I do, what happens to all the packages I&#x27;ve installed, do I have to re-install every single package again?
 While we&#x27;re at it, is Emacs 28.2 the recommended version to update to? Or should I try something a little less bleeding edge, if that&#x27;s still showing any problems?

                              <span>I made a little view for extracting an Elisp public API from a buffer via tree-sitter:
 https://ag91.github.io/blog/2023/03/24/moldable-emacs-what-is-the-public-api-of-this-elisp-buffer/
 I was thinking to extend it with another view that evaluates the API: any chance anybody has a good reference for evaluating APIs? I am thinking things like how many functions should an interface have to remain usable and understandable for instance.
 Anyway hopefully this gives more ideas on how to use tree-sitter apart for major modes ;)

                              <span>Currently, if I want to produce a plot in org mode I do something like the following...
 #+begin_src R :session *plot_examples* :file plot.png :results graphics file :exports both 
 #+end_src 
 I am finding it tedious to type out the this header every time I want to produce a graphic. Additionally, whatever working directory I am in gets cluttered with images. Has anyone found a way a way to automatically name these images and store them in a /images directory under the current working directory? Better would be like what I can get with jupyter-python in emacs, where I don&#x27;t have to call the graphics argument at all. Thanks.

                              <span>Hi everyone, I&#x27;m interested to know about the options for doing 3D graphics programming are, if any. Sorry if this post is all over the place --- in short, I&#x27;m just looking for any kind of information, experience and advice related to 3D graphics in Haskell.
 With one exception (see below), all the info/libraries that I have found are a little dated, and I would like to know how to interpret that fact: have the existing 3D libraries/tools just come to a stable stage where they no longer need updating? Or is Haskell not (/no longer) a serious option for 3D graphics? In particular, is the OpenGL library a viable option today, or is it no longer worth looking into?
 Here&#x27;s some of what I have found so far:
  
The wiki page about Graphics. Unless I am mistaken, the last 3D-related edits on that page are more than 10 years old.
 The OpenGL page on the wiki. Here again the information seems to be a little dated.
  
The exception (to the things I&#x27;ve found being old) is h-raylib, Haskell bindings to the Raylib library. It&#x27;s very nice, but I&#x27;d be interested in knowing about the other options, notably lower-level ones.
 By the way, h-raylib doesn&#x27;t appear on the Haskell wiki page. Should I add it?

                              <span>This is a topic that deserves its own thread. I&#x27;ll launch the first salvo.

  
@Massimo_Curatella said over at Ideas We&#x27;re Grappling With March 23, 2023::
I am thinking about designing a tutorial on how to create your user profile to get the best out of participating to online communities.


Not sure that even a sparkling user profile like mine  is good enough to bolt us into participating or be a tornado hurling others to interact with us. But I could be wrong.

  
I need to set specific boundaries to my exploration and that was the smallest unit of value I could think of.


Concentrating on the user profile is a small gesture but who knows where it could lead? I&#x27;m willing to follow along and help where I can.

  
I started to talk about that idea to friends and, surprisingly, they found it useful.


I have a mildly snarky question, are you talking to us &quot;about the idea as friends&quot; or are we the &quot;real people&quot; you want to experiment on?
This is a superb idea, and I&#x27;ll participate. I think this forum would benefit from anything that would enhance engagement.
To start this off, here is a screenshot of my profile.</span>

 With tree-sitter, I believe this should be relatively trivial to implement but I can&#x27;t find any implementation. If this don&#x27;t exist, I&#x27;ll be happy to hack something out!

 ​
 The alt key looks really hard to reach; the ctrl key also is not too easy to reach. Maybe toggle instead of holding the key may be better? How do you set up your modifier keys?

                              <span>when i enable flycheck-mode on my emacs packages, it almost always (always?) baulks at my &quot;;; Package-Requires:&quot; statement, saying that &quot;Package X is not installable&quot;, even if the package is installed and on the load-path.
 my config looks like this: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; (use-package flycheck-package)
 (use-package flycheck :config (setq flycheck-emacs-lisp-load-path &#x27;inherit) (flycheck-package-setup)) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 setting &#x60;flycheck-emacs-lisp-load-path to inherit is the only solution i have found online for this issue.
 does anyone have any further ideas?
 if it&#x27;s relevant i use straight.el for package managing, and i&#x27;m not tip-top with it. but afaik, straight updates the load-path for packages installed with it.

 a set of rules to avoid incorrect sentence ends, for example &quot;e.g.&quot;, &quot;i.e.&quot;, &quot;Mr.&quot;, &quot;Dr.&quot;, etc., and functions that follow those rules.
 previously discussed as segment.el on here while i was working on it and struggling a little. some on here helped me out (thanks!), after we finally understood each other. (https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/uwqmy8/segmentel_porting_complex_sentence_break_rules/)
 seems to work ok, though there are improvements to be made.
 might be added to melpa or similar soon.
 feedback welcome.

 ​
 The code above is correct, but i could also bind C-c to a keymap which contains &quot;z&quot; and &quot;o&quot; bound to another keymap which respectively binds &quot;p&quot; and &quot;s&quot; to to &#x27;backward-char.
 ​
 The question is: when is it needed to define a new keymap?

 Also, anyone know how to change the width of the treemacs buffer?

 Every time I try to use info in eshell, the emacs built-in info-mode opens, and so, the command I am searching for doesn&#x27;t shows up, how can I solve this?
 Example: &quot;info gh&quot; return the documentation for the ghub package of emacs, not the gh command from the github-cli software
 Thanks in advance and sorry the poor English!

                              <span>Hello,
 You can find Leafy-mode on GitHub here: leafy-mode
 I&#x27;ve developed a new Emacs minor-mode called Leafy-mode, designed to seamlessly integrate ChatGPT within org-mode documents. This allows you to have long-running, tree-structured AI conversations similar to the web UI.
 Here&#x27;s a quick rundown of the features:
  
Intelligent token prioritization: Leafy-mode prioritizes sending sibling branches and ancestor nodes to the OpenAI API when the token context fills up, dropping less relevant content.
 Easy model switching: Switch between GPT models with a simple click on the status bar, upgrading to GPT-4 temporarily if GPT-3.5 gets stuck.
 Document cost tracking: Leafy-mode tracks total costs and tokens per model as properties in your org-mode document.
  
Interestingly, ChatGPT not only played a major role in writing the code for Leafy-mode (using both the web UI and Emacs) but also came up with the name!
 Here&#x27;s how I&#x27;ve been using Leafy-mode:
  
I have a &quot;project documentation&quot; org file open in one window and my code in a separate split window.
 I keep a high-level description of my project and a list of important functions for quick reference.
 I break down tasks into small, manageable pieces, working on each in its own org headline.
 Once a task is complete, I delete unnecessary details or archive them using an :ignore tag to maintain a clean workspace.

                              <span>Hello, folks. I&#x27;m not much of an expert in emacs, so I need some help in debugging freezes when I edit python scripts with elpy-enabled (from MELPA). Here&#x27;s elpy-config:
  Emacs.............: 28.2 Elpy..............: 1.35.0 Virtualenv........: None Interactive Python: python3 3.11.2 (/opt/homebrew/bin/python3) RPC virtualenv....: rpc-venv (/Users/user/.emacs.d/elpy/rpc-venv) Python...........: python3 3.11.2 (/opt/homebrew/bin/python3) Jedi.............: 0.18.2 Autopep8.........: 2.0.2 Yapf.............: 0.32.0 Black............: 23.1.0 Syntax checker....: flake8 (/opt/homebrew/bin/flake8) 
 As for elpy mode everything works fine. I see syntax highlighting, minibuffer help, autocompletion, etc.
 However sometimes when I remove quotation mark like this:
  print(&#x27;Some text&#x27;) -&gt; print(&#x27;Some text)  to edit a line or type backslash like:
  some_var &#x3D; &#x27;&#x27; -&gt; some_var &#x3D; &#x27;\&#x27; 
 emacs hangs. Ctrl-g doesn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;ve managed to get debugger log:
  Debugger entered--entering a function: * #f(compiled-function () #)() syntax-ppss() python-nav-end-of-statement() python-nav-end-of-defun() python-info-current-defun() #f(compiled-function (info) #)(nil) elpy-promise-resolve([*elpy-promise* #f(compiled-function (info) #) elpy-rpc--default-error-callback # nil] nil) elpy-rpc--handle-json(((result) (id . 314))) elpy-rpc--filter(#
 &quot;{\&quot;result\&quot;: null, \&quot;id\&quot;: 314}\n&quot;)  I have no clue what happens and why. My suggestions is it somehow related to highlighting, because removing or escaping quotation mark leads to changing syntax colors of the rest of the file and emacs can&#x27;t handle it.
 I&#x27;ll report the error to corresponding package developers or to gnu/emacs team directly, but first I need to found out what package/command is a problem.
 Any ideas?

 So, update. After a while, I managed to make it work with pyls. I just had to sudo pip install &#x27;python-language-server[all]&#x27;. I don&#x27;t know if this is the right way but.. It works on my machine lol. Thanks everyone for their time!

 The Post installation needs me to invoke 
 export PATH&#x3D;$PATH:$HOME/.emacs.d/doom/bin 
 ******* I have a .doom.d and .emacs.d directories but which file do I need to add this path change to?
 The github mentions that It&#x27;s a good idea to add 
 ~/.config/emacs/bin 
 to your PATH!
 First, set up the PATH variable to detect the “/home/$USER/.emacs.d/doom/bin/” directory. Do this by adding the following line to the “/home/$USER/.profile” file:
 Ive been reviewing different source outside of github but Im not clear on where to add the path to I see conflicting info on a few sites.
 I do not see a profile directory. Im assuming my actual user name needs to go in the path to read as follows 
 “/home/$darren/.emacs.d/doom/bin/”
 ​
 darren@pop-os:~/.emacs.d$ ls -a
 . .dir-locals.el early-init.el .gitignore .local README.md
 .. docs .git LICENSE modules shell.nix
 bin .doomrc .github lisp profiles templates
 ​

 apologies about the formatting but I&#x27;ve been stuck on this for days I want to use orgmode tonight to start studying python to ultimately use python as my Doom as my IDE next week for class.

                              <span>It&#x27;s Thursday, and here we go again. I&#x27;m telling you what I&#x27;m working on to inspire you to tell me what you worked on. Consider the bar set low for participation. Pop in and say hi.
This week I&#x27;ve been distracted by schoolwork. The second paper in my ENGL501 class was due. I feel good about it, but we&#x27;ll see. I spent too much time programming, according to my sweetie. She is probably right, but getting lost in programming problems felt so good.
Thoughts about construal level theory have surfaced again in my ZK, leading me to Robin Hanson, Associate Professor at George Mason University, and his paper on the sacred. We See The Sacred From Afar, To See It The Same. I quickly looked at the paper, and while I don&#x27;t agree with everything, Robin&#x27;s look at the construal-level theory and how it relates to our concept of sacred is fascinating and well-referenced.
A week filled with productive distractions. Next week I&#x27;m afraid other people&#x27;s expectations of me will creep up the priority list.
What&#x27;s happening in your ZK?

                              <span>Hi all,
 two questions.
  
Is Implicit conversion considered evil because of non-total conversions and the fact that it&#x27;s hard to trace where this conversion is happening?
 I&#x27;ve used implicit defs for something like this in the past. Is this also considered a bad practice? Would the same reasoning from point #1 apply ?

                              <span>Complete newbie here.
 Is there any kind of (runtime) instrumentation possible in Haskell similar to Java? I need to add some OpenTelemetry monitoring to existing Haskell software and don&#x27;t know how to approach it. Is the only way forking the source and have custom build of a library (talking about PostgREST / hasql in particular).
 EDIT: I am aware of two OpenTelemetry Haskell libraries. What I am really asking about is if it is possible to inject monitoring logic into existing software without modifying/rebuild it?
 In Java there is instrumentation framework that can be used to do that.

                              <span>A bit about us
 We are a successful multi-strategy hedge fund managing assets in excess of $10bn for our clients. Over the last 12 years we have grown from a single office in London to a current headcount of over 200 people working across London, Glasgow, New York, Hong Kong, Zürich and Dubai. We believe our colleagues are key to the fund’s success and have developed a firm-wide culture we are proud of.
 Role description
 We are seeking to hire a software development intern for a minimum of 3-6 months, to help building a new Haskell codebase and deploy it in a Linux environment.
 You will work with guidance from a portfolio manager who recently joined the team earlier in 2023.
 The role will expose you to many of the technical aspects of running an investment strategy. Experience in financial markets and financial instruments will be helpful but is not a requirement to perform well in this role.
 You will join a collaborative &amp; friendly environment spread across all global offices.
 What we work with
 We are working with Haskell, Nix (package management), Python and Relational databases (Sqlite and SQL Server)
 Essential skills
  
Demonstrable proficiency in Haskell (no professional experience required)
 University degree in a quantitative field
 Experience with Linux
 Experience with relational database systems
  
Preferential skills
  
Experience with Python
 Experience working with Nix
  
Office
 The Zurich office is located at the heart of Zurich located 2 minutes from Lake Zurich – but you can also work in one of our other offices globally or remotely.
 How to apply
 Please send your CV, motivational letter, as well as information regarding your visa situation and when you would want to start to [internships@lmrpartners.com](mailto:internships@lmrpartners.com).

                              <span>Hey there!
 I am thinking of creating a small pet project - a UI for some existing REST-api.
 And the api I am going to connect to already exposes it&#x27;s description as an openapi 3.0 json file. 
 So I am wondering what would be the best way of generating a purescript client. 
 PS as a plan B I&#x27;ve got servant-purescript (since the api&#x27;s running on servant)

 I’ve seen people here following either a single page journal likely yearly one or a multi file journal like daily or weekly. Apart from personal preference and the impact on orgmode agenda, what are the pros and cons of one method over the other in medium to long term.

The problem with scopes
In the example API for pure mutable arrays, the original Linear
Haskell paper (Arxiv
version) featured the function:
newMArray :: Int -&gt; (MArray a %1 -&gt; Ur b) %1 -&gt; Ur b

This function is essential to make the API work: mutable arrays can
only be pure when they are not aliased. By taking a linear function as
an argument, newMArray can make sure that the MArray is, in fact,
not aliased. This is because linear ty…</span>

                              <span>What are the best practices for structuring a public custom mode project? Say I&#x27;m creating a minor mode called slug,
  
Should all the code go in a subdir with the readme in the root?
 If so, should the dir be called slug or something more generic like src?
 Is a README.md expected or does the mode commentary in the source make that redundant? 
 If I&#x27;m going to write additional helper libraries that aren&#x27;t directly connected should they go in a separate dir?
  
What are some projects you consider well structured/organized?

                              <span>Hey there,
 I&#x27;ve been debating workflows recently, and what I would really want is some way to make a rectangle frame within a current code buffer to quickly access dired to switch a file instead of having to split the window, and access Dired that way.
 Is there any way for a rectangle frame to appear ontop of the current one?
 And no, I don&#x27;t want it to popup as a separate Emacs window itself, just need a rectangle centered in the center of the current buffer to show a dired buffer real quick.
 If that above is possible, is it possible to also use a fuzzy finder utility in Emacs the same way as well? Would love to quickly find a file and edit it real quick too.
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hey there,
 I&#x27;ve tried Tab Bar mode and Eyebrowse Mode, and I honestly don&#x27;t like either one of them. The default tab styling and workflow for Tab Bar mode is not ideal for me, and I couldn&#x27;t really get Eyebrowse mode to not freak out keybinding wise no matter what I did.
 With this in mind, going forward and ignoring the two above, I&#x27;m wondering, is there something similar to like &#x27;i3&#x27; window manager, but within Emacs itself?
 Looking for something similar where it has like 5 window options where you can just swap between them on the fly, etc. Plus something that could save those buffers for later use would be great.
 ​
 Not sure if I qualify as someone who should just learn Projectile or something though since I have a few web dev projects I swap out to sometimes. I usually have Treemacs on the left pane with code being edited in Emacs on the right. I also need a separate screen for two split vterm terminals, and a separate screen for an org mode buffer notes pane. If I could manage this all within some kind of in-built window manager within Emacs in a sane way, I would be very very happy.
 ​
 Thanks.

                              <span>Most of us probably heard of Copilot, and how it&#x27;s great, useful and better than rule-based autocomplete (see https://youtu.be/cdiD-9MMpb0?t&#x3D;8690 where Andrej Karpathy praises it for example). 
 Now the GitHub ecosystem is getting better with the inclusion of GPT-4 (which is better than ChatGPT for simple code generation, which is in turn comparable with or better than Codex which is essentially behind Copilot) and some projects built around it: 
 - Copilot X: https://github.com/github-copilot/chat_waitlist_signup/ (basically a chat buffer) 
 - Copilot Voice: https://githubnext.com/projects/copilot-voice/ (voice input) 
 - Copilot Docs: https://githubnext.com/projects/copilot-for-docs/ (ask anything about the docs) 
 - Copilot for PRs: https://githubnext.com/projects/copilot-for-pull-requests/ (helps in writing PRs) 
 - Copilot CLI: https://githubnext.com/projects/copilot-cli/ (helps you with the ffmpeg and ghostscipt cli interfaces 🥴) 
 ​
 With all this AI hype and products shipping at an insane pace, I can&#x27;t stop thinking of how the Emacs ecosystem could answer with an open and better alternative. I think Emacs is very well suited for this new text-based smart-ish assistant tech interface-wise (much more so than VS Code). 
 There are some &quot;open-source&quot; alternatives for the open-AI generative LLMs there, like LLAMA https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp trained and leaked by Meta, and made available in c++ and actually runnable even on a MacBook Air. Sure it&#x27;s not as great as Codex, GPT-4 and such, but it&#x27;s a start (there are also open datasets with lots of code https://huggingface.co/datasets/bigcode/the-stack, so maybe in the future the gap will close). 
 Maybe we should work on something like this? 
 ​
 Very interested in what the community thinks about this in general.

 Is this simply colorschemes not implementing the current faces or is this not as through for some reason?

The idea is that it&#x27;s supposed to feel a bit like when you&#x27;re working at a big tech company and you&#x27;re trying to figure out what some code that you&#x27;ve never seen before is doing.
 I thought folks here might be interested in a video I made last week about one of my favorite programs of all time: Emacs!
 Let&#x27;s read the Emacs source code video
 I spend some time looking at the history of Emacs, but you can also jump directly to the code.

                              <span>I am unsure why this is the case, but pdfs rendered in-app emacs 29 on osx (Ventura 13.2.1) have quite poor legibility font-wise (all the pdfs were embedded within Zotero). The pdfs look fine in other OSX apps such as the system default Preview.app, Zotero itself or even FIrefox.
 Does anyone know how to correct this within emacs? (Ideally, I want to be reading the pdf in one pane and making notes in org-roam in the other.

                              <span>I always wondered why Emacs takes 20+ seconds to launch on Windows compared to Linux where it starts in an instant, googling revealed that a lot of people suffer from this issue but many deal with it with emacs-client, but then, by accident, I started emacs from a folder that I excluded from Windows Defender and all of a sudden it started in 90ms... down from literal 20 sometimes even more seconds.
 ​
 tl;dr If your Emacs on Windows takes long to start, exclude its folder from Windows Defender.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been using Emacs Org mode to create fiction for over a decade, and I&#x27;ve slowly built up a pleasant system for laying out and linking files while I&#x27;m writing. I like linking quickly to relevant notes whenever names or keywords are mentioned in the main text of a story, and being able to manage those notes with the minimum of effort. It&#x27;s always worked really well for me, so I coded up a package to have Emacs make it even easier. And, thus, Org Novelist was born. 
 I also wrote some code to export the stories to a standard manuscript format for submission to publishers. 
 The package takes care of most of the boring stuff for me, and lets me get on with actually writing.
 I realize that the set of people using Emacs for novel writing is likely to be quite small (and I coded this for my personal use rather than for public release), but if you think it could be useful, you can find Org Novelist on GitHub.
 Thanks for reading, and keep on writing!

                              <span>Hello all,
 I have problem with Emacs and Slime. As of writing this post,
 Debian 11 apt keeps Emacs 27.1 and
 Fedora 37 dnf keeps Emacs 28.1
 On Debians Emacs you can instal Slime package
 M-x package-install RET slime RET 
 and it will run with e.g. sbcl without no problems. However on Fedoras 28-Emacs it will not. On start up, Emacs will give warning:
 Package cl is deprecated 
 Such a warning is described in this post for Emacs 27. But for what I understand it does not speak about Slime issue... But I continue, it is &quot;only&quot; a warning. Fedora version of Slime is 2.26.1 and after running
 M-x slime 
 I get
 Wrong number of arguments: (3 . 4), 2 
 and Slime won&#x27;t start.
 What I tried:
  
installed dnf package emacs-slime
 edited and recompiled hyperspec.el in slime library as written here (also tried adding &quot;unknown&quot; as mentioned in comment of the post)
 tried to downgrade to Emacs 27.1 but Fedoras dnf does not maintain older versions than 28
 tried to install Emacs 27.1 from Gnu&#x27;s archive but I get errors in make which might be for other post all together.
  
​
 If anyone encountered and solved these problems with Slime on Emacs 28, please let me know what you did. Also if anyone wants that make error output I can give you that.
 Thank you.

I moved the (setq lsp-keymap-...) line outside (and before) use-package. I also used :config (define-key lsp-load-map...) in my use-package block. But none of them worked.

                              <span>Hi, silly question:
 I&#x27;m hoping to use Doom emacs with agda-mode, but when I do there are some features that just don&#x27;t work. For instance, in vanilla agda-mode, if I wanted to to type unicode symbols such as $$\Sigma$$, I would be able to via by beginning the slash. However this does not work in Doom. However, here i have to type C-x 8 RET GREEK CAPITAL LETTER SIGMA, which is pretty inconvenient. This issue does not go away when turning evil mode off
 Additionally when in evil mode there are some agda-mode keybinds beginning with C-u that I really wish could work. I&#x27;m not sure what they get remapped to, if anything. 
 Thank you for any help in understanding this. I&#x27;m very new to emacs (need to use it because the vscode agda extension is buggy), and I&#x27;m partial to doom. So I really hope I can find a way to make this all work

                              <span>Hello all,
 ​
 I followed the manual (https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Specifying-File-Variables.html#Specifying-File-Variables) and added with M-x add-file-local-variable-prop-line the line:
 ;;; -*- eval: (set-input-method &#x27;latin-1-prefix); -*-
 to the beginning of the file, but when i open it the input method is not latin-1-prefix.
 If i explicitly evaluate the expression, then the input method is changed.
 Does any one know a way to specify the input method for just one file?
 I am using Emacs 30.0.50 with pgtk.

                              <span>So, emacs has officially included eglot, which is a minimalistic LSP client. Great. lsp-mode has always felt way too bloated in my experience. It wants to do a lot, and if you don&#x27;t do things its way, it gets messy.
 Anyway, dap-mode only works with lsp-mode, so I was wondering if there was any plans to implement something similar to eglot, but for DAP.

                              <span>I started eglot a couple of hours ago and emacs is now occupying 10 GB of RAM. I have 32 GB total.
 I have removed every other leaky package, and I know from profiling that 95% of the memory is being consumed by jsonrpc-process-filter.
 I can&#x27;t believe this is something every emacs user just bears. There must be a correct solution for that.
 EDIT: Just found this emacs fork, looks promising.

 https://np.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/j8df0/moderator_guidelines_thems_the_rules/
  
Following some feedback on rule 1, it has been changed to the following:
  
 Top-level posts should be primarily about Haskell. For example a post about OCaml would only be allowed if there was a connection to Haskell. Posts about topics that are adjacent to Haskell, like for example functional programming, are typically allowed.
  
 Hopefully this expresses the intent of the rule more clearly. Obviously this is a Haskell sub-Reddit, so we&#x27;re all here mostly for Haskell content. Here&#x27;s some further clarification: 
  
The rule applies to top-level posts, not comments. 
 Posts should be about Haskell, but they may be about other related topics. 
 You should be able to complete the sentence: &quot;This post is about Haskell because _.&quot;
 Moderators are only likely to take action for egregious violations. In general if a post is well received by the community, the moderators will let it stand. 
  
Thanks to u/adamgundry and u/bss03, among others, for bringing this to my attention. 
 I&#x27;m happy to answer any questions people have about the rules.

                              <span>Are you also bothered by unhelpful error messages by the compiler, and would like to see the quality of error messages in your favourite programming language improve? You can help us by participating in a user study which investigates the quality of type error messages.
 The study will take about 15 to 20 minutes, and your task will be to evaluate the helpfulness of error messages for defective OCaml programs. There will be a short introduction to OCaml if you are not familiar with it.
 While the study uses OCaml Syntax, our results will be equally applicable to Haskell and other functional programming languages :)
 In order to participate in the study, follow the link: https://open-lab.online/invite/UnderstandingTypeErrors/

                              <span>Software failures can lead to significant costs and even human hardship and
danger. We believe that with an appropriate set of tools and techniques it is
possible to improve the reliability of both existing and new software without a
huge upfront investment.
Formal methods do not have to be “too expensive” or “too time consuming”; simple
things can drastically improve the assurance of software, even without complete
verification. Furthermore, academia is constantly generating new ideas. Which of
those translate into suitable tools for a given context? There is a spectrum of
assurance and we believe in combining different techniques to gradually bring
software from zero assurance to fully verified. We aim to identify, use and
improve upon the most suitable tools for the job.
We offer high-assurance services and team augmentation for clients who either
have high-assurance needs or are themselves solution providers in this space. In
particular, we are happy to assist in the following areas:
Specification: help craft and lay specifications, and asses their aptness
to an original goal by proving relevant properties about them
Testing: help create better test suites, and build tools for executing
them over complex domains
Auditing: comprehensively test a system, report and showcase behaviours
that are potentially harmful to system security or safety, assess code quality
Tooling: improve existing tools to suit the testing/verification needs of
a particular project, or write domain-specific tools from scratch
Refactoring: help improve existing code bases through the use of
modularisation, strongly typed code, purity, and other compile-time guarantees
Full-fledged verification: assist in projects aiming to develop a
completely verified piece of software</span>

 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;wyABTfR9UTU time: 00:18:54
 In it he talks about the early efforts at programming and how OOP and FP came to be. He refers a bit to assembler and asynchronous stuff. I think there are two parts to why certain ideas gain traction and Farley leans toward performance while I look a lot at ergonomics. He says he agrees to some extent with Robert Martin&#x27;s idea that language features (like type checking) are intended to constrain us, so we can&#x27;t shoot ourselves in the foot. There are various reasons for adoption of language features.
 He also explains some of the early reasons for OO message-passing, modularity, and consideration of mathematics as a basis for a soun…</span>

                              <span>Here&#x27;s a tiny helper library, which generates html tables from case classes (or Product, generally).
 https://github.com/Quafadas/scautable
 I guess it&#x27;s kind of hard to get excited about html tables, but I felt it might be interesting enough to post, for two reasons; 
 - It seems a practical use of &#x60;Mirror&#x60; - there&#x27;s no &quot;macros&quot; or seriously gnarly meta-programming, and yet it&#x27;s fairly generic! I found it an interesting exercise ... and got some help from this forum earlier - thanks to those people.
 - It&#x27;s entirely scala CLI. 
 The scala-cli part was remarkably quick to get all the of the project boilerplate in place, publish out of CI etc. Even better - it cross compiled (super easily), and it cross platform tests really easily! And has different tests and capabilities for the JVM etc. I think these parts of scala-cli might still be subject to change... but it was amazingly easy / fast to get all of the &quot;project grind&quot; in place. 
 Ultimately, there wasn&#x27;t really a barrier, or a reason _not_ to (cross-)publish it - even something this small - and I think that&#x27;s kind of fun :-).

                              <span>Hi, I am planning to work on a toy project on purescript. With purs frontend, what language and library would you recommend for the backend? I know Haskell but purescript with node express looks cool too. 
 Thanks.

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to achieve Scrivener like functionality, where I have my org headings in the left frame, and the text in the right frame, using org-tree-to-indirect-buffers. Unfortunately, when I type text in the last or second last space before the end of the narrowed buffer, the text appears in the left frame below or next to the org heading. How do I continually hide text in the left, cycled to only headings, pane?

                              <span>When I click a link in some file I have open in my emacs, it used to open my systems web browser. However now, it opens a dialogue (im on opensuse KDE) asking which application to use, what&#x27;s strange is that the list doesnt even contain any of my web browers. This used to work, but something has changed. Clicking links in other text editors works properly, that&#x27;s why I figure its Emacs related rather than linux related.
 What could be the problem?

 I was hoping someone had a flow where they then use org-roam to link up their notes with those Zotero stored pdfs with org-noter, make notes in org-roam (linked to the pdf), and then have the bibtex exported for when it&#x27;s actually time to write those citations into a paper (which looks like zotero will do already_ to a file i could then use from emacs.
 Has anyone got a workflow llike this (with configs)? 
 I&#x27;ve googled most of the day trying to come down on any one person&#x27;s setup for both the bilbio management (and citations) as well as the annotating of those source materials but did not find one that was focused more on the knowle…</span>

 instead of getting 5 in the last cell. 
 How do I solve this?

 For example, there should be completions offered by company-complete after the line kind: in the following yaml file, but I don&#x27;t quite understand how to configure this: yaml apiVersion: v1 kind:

                              <span>Hey all,
 Are there non-GPT LLM integrations for Emacs? I&#x27;m looking for a free software or open source model that can either be run locally or self-hosted and integrated with Emacs. I&#x27;ve seen lots of OpenAI GPT integrations but I really think the Emacs community could get behind an open, free model, even if it&#x27;s less impressive for now. 
 Is anyone working on this? I&#x27;m not a great elisp coder but I&#x27;d love to help.

                              <span>As many of us have noticed, there&#x27;s an awful lot of packages dealing with Large Language Models (LLMs, in short, and right now just Chat GPT but soon probably other alternatives as well). There&#x27;s some interesting in this for sure, but I feel like I haven&#x27;t seen people recognizing that this isn&#x27;t just another interesting trend we can integrate into our favorite editor, this could be a really pivotal moment for emacs, because I contend there isn&#x27;t another application out there that is so well suited to working with LLMs.
 First of all, the primary thing you want when dealing with LLMs is integrate it with your writing environment. Emacs can do that, and already does, via many different packages. And with Emacs, you can use it to write just about anything. Code, documentation, technical paper…</span>

                              <span>Due to the nature of my work, I sometimes have to abandon a project for a few weeks to work on something else before returning to the original project. When coming back to the old project, I often discovered (the hard way!) that I had forgotten some crucial concepts related to that project. I created a simple package to allow me to quickly add notes to any org heading and then surface the notes for a heading (and its parents) when clocking in again after a long time (14 days by default).
 The package can be found at github:durableOne/org-cc
 This is very much a work in progress and I&#x27;m not a programmer by training so any feedback and suggestions for improvement are welcome.

                              <span>New features for PDFs:
  
2-D precise notes
 Support for multi-column formats org-noter-pdf-set-columns
 Integrated highlighting of selected text (customizable toggle org-noter-highlight-selected-text)
 Many bug-fixes
 Some old PRs implemented
  
Other new features:
  
DJVU support (untested by us)
 org-noter-start-from-dired opens file at point or marked files
 Consistent usage of selected text for note title or body
  
The last point requires a bit more explanation. In the previous version of org-noter, the rules for how selected text would be used and for the default title was dependent on the note insertion method -- whether it was a precise-note or a page-note and on the setting of the custom toggle org-noter-insert-note-no-questions.
 Now, for all insertion methods, the primary default title is &quot;short&quot; selected text and the secondary title has the format &quot;Notes for page  [V: % H: %]&quot;. &quot;Short&quot; is defined by the customizable variable org-noter-max-short-selected-text-length (default: 80). See the README for more details.
 If you have un-dealt-with PRs on the author&#x27;s repo, please redirect/resubmit them to https://github.com/org-noter/org-noter.

                              <span>The text-display library offers the Display typeclass for developers to print a textual representation of datatypes (and data) that do not have to abide by the rules of the Show typeclass.
 This release brings two contributions, one pertaining to the laziness of the List instance, the other brings an instance for Void. 
 I also cranked the &quot;Documentation&quot; lever to the max with this release, so here are:
  
Tutorial for new users
 API Reference
 Design of the library
 Comparison with other libraries
  
The book is made with mdBook &amp; LiterateX.
 Questions welcome although I encourage you to read the book beforehand, the answer might be in there ;)

                              <span>I&#x27;m developing a RESTful service which backend uses &#x60;aeson&#x60; to parse request from user&#x27;s post message.
 it works well while the ADT is so complex and deeply nested it&#x27;s would take lots of time to manually maintain a JSON schema to user .
 I&#x27;m wondering if there is a way to generate JSON schema from Haskell&#x27;s&#x27; ADT/records automatically ?
 there is one I found but it seems not longer being updated and deps is out of date https://github.com/yuga/jsonschema-gen/ .

                              <span>Fourmolu is a configurable formatter for Haskell code forked from Ormolu.
 The bulk of this release is merging Ormolu 0.5.2.0 and 0.5.3.0. The one new feature is a new no-space option for the in-style configuration. As is the norm, binaries are available in the GitHub release (linked below), or can be built from source or Hackage.

I am using DWM. Do I need to switch window managers? Is there a way that I can download and get emacs29 to work properly on my system?
 ​
 --update--
 The install info helped me install it properly without switching window managers, but the second error persists. I think it has something to do with me using straight.el. Is there a fix for this, or to I need to go back to package.el?

                              <span>I recently started developing my own emacs config (with a lot of help from the Emacs from Scratch series by System Crafters) after using Doom Emacs for more than 2 years. I&#x27;m mostly done (probably never fully, but oh well) and trying to nail down some features I&#x27;d like.
 The one that&#x27;s got me going at the moment is binding ESC to &#x60;abort-minibuffers&#x60; while in normal mode. I&#x27;ve set the &#x60;evil-want-minibuffers&#x60; custom variable to &#x60;t&#x60; and would like to be able to exit any minibuffer by pressing ESC while in normal mode, which is not the case at the moment.
 (use-package evil
 :init
 :custom
 (evil-want-Y-yank-to-eol t)
 (evil-want-minibuffer t)
 :config
 (evil-mode 1)
 (define-key evil-normal-state-map (kbd &quot;&quot;) &#x27;abort-minibuffers))
 ​
 This is a stripped down version of my evil config at the moment (no further detail needed) along with the best solution I&#x27;ve come up with so far. It works, but I&#x27;m guessing that there&#x27;s a more elegant way to achieve this.
 Bonus Question: The &#x60;evil-want-Y-yank-to-eol&#x60; variable doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing anything even if I turn it on. Haven&#x27;t dug around to find out why yet, but any clues as to why this is happening would be appreciated.

                              <span>Recently started using Emacs and its just aweeesommmee! I&#x27;m using vanilla Emacs, I&#x27;ve gone through the tutorial, and watched the System Crafters&#x27; Emacs From Scratch playlist. I was wondering if I should switch to a &quot;distribution&quot; of Emacs. Would they let me faster navigate text and code, tabs and windows? I actually liked the keybinding of the Emacs more than Vim (Though I use C-jkl; instead of C-bnpf for moving in the text). So I have no problems with Emacs keybindings until now. What additional advantages would Doom or Spacemacs give me over vanilla Emacs? Would it worth the hassle of learning their new keybindings again?

                              <span>Hi all, i&#x27;m trying to write my config from scratch. I&#x27;m wondering what are the best practices to set up keybindings in a clean way. I know about the reserved keys (C-c ?, etc.) but I&#x27;d like to know stuff like when to define bindings in the init file (after loading the packages or before), when to define new maps, how to group bindings together in the init file so that it doesn&#x27;t turn into a mess. 
 ​
 Is there a resource or a config example that can guide me into this?

                              <span>I&#x27;m not quite sure how to phrase this question, as I don&#x27;t entirely understand how the inferior-python-mode works, but I believe it is derived from comint-mode, which from reading Mickey Petersen&#x27;s post and personal experience, is quite cumbersome. For instance, looking at the help documentation for a function, e.g. help(list) produces:
 WARNING: terminal is not fully functional Press RETURN to continue 
 Scrolling through the documentation is then quite awkward, and even though I hit can hit q to quit, it sometimes hangs and there is some funny indentation going on afterwards (&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;).
  
 However, if I run vterm, or even just term, enter my shell (which is zsh) I have no such message, and it works just like a non-Emacs terminal, allowing me to scroll and quit comfortably.
  
 Is there a way to call Python via vterm or term when running a :session in an org-src block, or when doing M-x run-python? Or at least get better scrolling behavior?

 That I&#x27;d like to access from org documents. Currently, I have different setup files that I include inside the individual documents. I am wondering if there is a way instead to just set these in my configuration.org file so that I can have access to these types of shortcuts in all of my org-documents by default.

The currently available packages either don&#x27;t work at all (most of them for some reason), or lag, or are quirky, or all at the same time.
 My goal is to try to make something like vim-smoothie in emacs. I want to make this scroll line by line, instead of by pixel with pixel-scroll-mode because that just makes it laggy, and not smooth at all.
 So, here&#x27;s the basic idea. When you call one of the scroll functions, of which there are four (page up/down and half page up/down) they calculate how many lines you&#x27;ll need to scroll for.

                              <span>Correct, efficient, and reliable builds are critical for developers to
work and collaborate effectively.
The size and complexity to which a project can grow should not be bounded by its
build system, but by what is best to achieve the goal of the project.
Large codebase or small, polyglot or monolingual, enterprise or open source -
no matter which kind of project, the build system should provide correct,
efficient, reliable builds.</span>

                              <span>Ox Zola started as a personal fork of the famous ox-hugo exporter, but, since the number of users is growing, I thought it was time to make it a completely different package; from now on, Ox Zola will run on top of ox-hugo itself. This way, you can install the official ox-hugo package and receive all the updates without being restrained by the progress of Ox Zola.
 Even so, I suggest pinning ox-hugo to the most recent working version to avoid breaking changes after updates.

                              <span>Is it possible to use a java annotation processor in Scala, or wrap it in some way to make it work? From what I have gathered so far, the java annotation processor only works with the java compiler and thus java sources. However, I am wondering if there some way to wrap the java annotation processor code in Scala, so that it can be used with Scala classes/sources.
 The use case is a well established library for generating yaml files based on Java class annotations (simple getter/setter classes). I would like to have these classes in scala if possible

                              <span>In response to a post last week, Stephen Downes reminded me that Ludwig Wittgenstein had a zettelkasten practice. In particular there is a translated and published book Zettel from 1967 which contains 717 zettels from Wittgenstein’s Nachlass, or works left behind following his death in 1951. I’ve had a copy lying around for a bit, but finally spent some time with it. The book cleverly has a parallel text form with the German on one side of the page and the English on the facing page. I’ve also seen translations of the book in both Spanish and Italian for those who might prefer those.
While the individual entries themselves are as fascinating as dipping randomly into some of Henry David Thoreau’s journals or Georg Christoph Lichtenberg’s Waste Books, the brief introductory material by the e…</span>

                              <span>Hi Haskellers! 
 I probably have the wrong idea about Arrows, but at an oversimplified level I had always thought that they were interesting because they &quot;represent functions as data&quot; in some sense, which is interesting in that it would allow for composition and reasoning of that data separated from execution (e.g. a composition of Arrows could be inspected and validated or modified before execution). Anyways - under the above assumption I dived in with a real use-case but hit a few hurdles that probably mean I have a total misunderstanding and would appreciate any guidance!
 Heres a small, and yes very dumb example, but hopefully gets at my core misunderstanding - where I am not sure that I can recover the composition of these Arrows. Say we have these Arrows:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; -- Adds 1 to the input plus1 :: Arrow a &#x3D;&gt; a Int Int plus1 &#x3D; arr $ (+ 1)
 -- Adds 2 to the input plus2 :: Arrow a &#x3D;&gt; a Int Int plus2 &#x3D; arr $ (+ 2)
 -- A program defined through a composition of arrows program :: Arrow a &#x3D;&gt; a Int Int program &#x3D; plus1 &gt;&gt;&gt; plus1 &gt;&gt;&gt; plus1 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 I&#x27;d like to be able to inspect the program, and reason able its structure. For example I may want to find paired compositions of plus1 and replace them with plus2 instead as a sort of optimization, e.g. plus2 &gt;&gt;&gt; plus1.
 Using this very simple example to get a better understanding - is this possible?

                              <span>1) Just confirming... Is the &quot;prelude&quot; basically a synonym for &quot;global imports&quot;? 
 i.e. Stuff that all source code files can access, without needing to be imported.
 
 2) Can I add my own stuff to this?
  
i.e. If I have some functions/types that I wrote myself, that I&#x27;m using in pretty much every file in my project, can I globally import them to all other files in my project? (without needing import lines in every file)
 I&#x27;m predicting that some people will hate this question, and advise against it. But I&#x27;m just wondering if it&#x27;s technical possible or not.
 
Don&#x27;t worry, nobody else ever needs to see/touch my code.
 
  
I&#x27;ve tried figuring this out myself with many web searches in the past, but haven&#x27;t found any answers (or seemingly anyone even asking the same question?).

                              <span>I decided to try and investigate the &quot;Mirror&quot; functionality, and set myself the goal to automagically generate an HTML table from a case class / &#x60;Product&#x60;. 
 By aggressively plagarising this blog post, 
 https://blog.philipp-martini.de/blog/magic-mirror-scala3/
 I got somewhere... and I have a very simple test suite which shows I can do somewhere with this idea. 
 I&#x27;m struggling with &quot;Option&quot; however,
 https://github.com/Quafadas/scautable/blob/6513b39ef3ce3e1ce05ffc30018b55a06a374537/src/main/scala/scautable.scala#L171
 https://github.com/Quafadas/scautable/blob/6513b39ef3ce3e1ce05ffc30018b55a06a374537/src/main/test/scala/test.scala#L51
 and can&#x27;t seem to get an &#x60;Option&#x60; version of this to compile. 
 I guess I&#x27;m now a bit confused about which limitation I&#x27;ve hit. The limitation of having missed something obvious? Or the plagiarised derivation in the blog post is limited, because &quot;Option&quot; is higher kinded ? Or Mirror itself? I guess I&#x27;m a bit lost! 
 Any community hints, would be most welcome :-)! Feel free to discuss whether this notion itself is at all sensible either... should you wish

                              <span>Hi All,
 I started writing blogs for Scala beginners almost a year ago. Here is the link https://yadukrishnan.live
 I would like to get some feedback regarding it to evaluate if it is being useful for readers or not. I mainly intended to write blogs for people coming to Scala from other non-fp languages (like me). 
 I hope I can do something to make more people get started on Scala. 
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Hey,
 I&#x27;ve gotten a little tired of moving my fingers just to press the n key on qwerty keyboards, and I am seriously considering learning an alternative keyboard layout. I often have to switch between Linux and Mac, so my options are relatively limited to Dvorak and Colemak. Out of the box Mac does not even to support ColemakDH.
 Is it worth switching keyboard layouts, and if it is which is better for Emacs? 
 Also, I should note that god-mode and avy are two of my favorite package. I know both these packages are customizable, but have some assumptions that you are using a qwerty keyboard. I find that &quot;g&quot; is used a lot for god mode, but is out of the way on some of the alternative keyboard layouts.

                              <span>I am trying to have consult-ripgrep and helm-do-ag by default ignore backup files, those that end with a ~. I&#x27;ve searched around and played with adding to consult-ripgrep-args various incarnations of -g &#x27;!*~&#x27;; these work when I call rg from the terminal but not when part of consult-ripgrep-args (all files seem to be excluded). Likewise, I&#x27;ve tried setting helm-ag-ignore-patterns to things like &#x27;(&quot;*~&quot; &quot;\\.*~\\&quot;)) or adding arguments to helm-ag-base-command, but this doesn&#x27;t exclude anything (even when --ignore from the terminal works).
 Solutions that involve files with lists of patterns I do not think would work, because I&#x27;d like files ending with ~ to always be ignored, regardless of the directory I am searching (which might, or not, be under version control, or be part of a project, etc).

                              <span>I want to be able to toggle the global line highlight function to a key binding and so I wrote the code below to do it. I thought that Emacs would allow the use of a closure like this but I get the error message &quot;Symbol&#x27;s value as variable is void: hline-val&quot; so I&#x27;ve resorted to using a global variable which works fine. Can anyone tell me why this is happening?
 (let ((hline-val -1)) (global-hl-line-mode hline-val) (defun toggle-hline () &quot;Toggle global line highlight.&quot; (interactive) (setf hline-val (* hline-val -1)) (global-hl-line-mode hline-val))) (global-set-key (kbd &quot;&quot;) #&#x27;toggle-hline)

                              <span>I&#x27;m going nuts, I&#x27;ve been at this like 30 minutes ffs.
 Code:
 (defun scroll-down () (interactive) (dotimes (i 20) (scroll-down-line) (sit-for 0.1))) 
 Goal: literally just testing stuff
 Problem: Calling this function, interactively or not, results in this:
 scroll-down-line: Wrong number of arguments: (lambda nil (interactive) (let ((--dotimes-limit-- 20) (i 0)) (while (&lt; i --dotimes-limit--) (scroll-down-line) (sit-for 0.1) (setq i (1+ i))))), 1 
 I&#x27;m calling it from the scratch buffer like this: (scroll-down). Calling it interactively does the same. I have tried adding an argument to the function, the resulting message is the same, but the 1 at the very end of the error changes to 0. I have tried to change i to _ to indicate it&#x27;s not used. Nothing. I have read the docs for all the functions used. interactive has no required arguments, scroll-down-line doesn&#x27;t either, but adding 1 or nil doesn&#x27;t change anything. sit-for needs 1 argument, which I&#x27;m already providing, and dotimes needs two arguments, the braces containing the variable and the amount of times to loop, and the body, those are being provided.
 Just WHAT THE HELL does this program want me to do? I really don&#x27;t understand it. I even tried using toggle-debug-on-error, wanna know what that did? NOTHING. No debug at all. It&#x27;s not even my config, I tried this with emacs in quiet mode, no config at all, it behaves the same way, not even the debug mode works.
 I&#x27;m at a loss, idk.

                              <span>Hi, I was wondering if anyone can help me with this weird code completion issue I have in TSX. 
 It seems that code completion is not picking up attributes from &quot;base&quot; types ie. from &#x60;HTMLAttributes&#x60; interface that require values like &#x60;class&#x60;, &#x60;style&#x60; etc. It will happily autocomplete stuff that can be used naked like &#x60;contenteditable&#x60;, &#x60;hidden&#x60; etc. It will also autocomplete props defined in React component etc. 
 I&#x27;ve tried this with lsp-mode and eglot but I have the same problem in both. I think my overall setup is fine - everything typecheck correctly and when I put invalid attribute name like &quot;classx&quot; it flags it. I&#x27;ve attached few images to show what I&#x27;m talking about if my text explanation is not clear.
 Notice that &#x27;class&#x27; is missing
 class typechecks correctly
 classx will report error

                              <span>Both Udemy and Rock the JVM offer online classes on Cats, Cats Effect, and FS2. I&#x27;m trying to figure out which ones to purchase. Does anyone have any comparative experience?
 The classes on Udemy have about half as much video (in terms of time) and are about 1/5th the price (e.g., $20 per class), but they also claim to have plenty of exercises, and I&#x27;m big fan of learning by doing, rather than just watching. So I&#x27;m a bit torn.
 If I don&#x27;t have to solve problems myself, I often just zone out and don&#x27;t remember much. This is why I have enjoyed Coursera and edX classes. On the other hand, I&#x27;ve also heard good things about Rock the JVM, in general.
 I watched a bit of the free Rock the JVM class on Scala for beginners, and it had you download the code from GitHub that they were writing in the video, but it didn&#x27;t seem as if they had you do anything other than watch.

                              <span>Default emacs -Q has the useful behaviour that C-S- (and left) extends the selection while C- does not. However, the help fromC-h k C-S- gives this:
 C- (translated from C-S-) runs the command right-word (found in global-map), which is an interactive native-compiled Lisp function in ‘bindings.el’. 
 which seems to say that they are mapped to the same function, which is patently untrue!! It does not document what function C-S- actually points at.
 Another thing, if we explicitly add that to our config like this:
 (global-set-key (kbd &quot;C-S-&quot;) &#x27;right-word) 
 then it operates like the unshifted variant, offering further proof that it was not pointing at the same function before the re-mapping.
 Not a hassle, just a curiosity. Some hidden magic happening?
 Bonus points for explaining the following from the same key help - what is a &#x27;field&#x27; in emacs? A search in the emacs manual &#x60;C-h i&#x60; is not fruitful:
 Value is normally t. If an edge of the buffer or a field boundary is reached, point is left there and the function returns nil. Field boundaries are not noticed if ‘inhibit-field-text-motion’ is non-nil.

                              <span>PDF viewing within Emacs is supposed to work out of the box, correct? I&#x27;ve tried opening a PDF in Emacs and then pressing C-c C-c (I read to do that, somewhere) but nothing changes when I press the hotkeys--I can still only see the raw data/text of the PDF file.
 I&#x27;m on Windows 10, if that matters.

 US Mobile has cheep phone plans
 Switch and send the monthly savings to support Magit!
  
I have both a personal phone and a business phone. Neither sees a lot of heavy use from month to month. 
 I recently discovered and switched to US Mobile and have been very impressed both with their customer service and user experience. 
 They even have a special offer where the first 100 days are free when you transfer your number to them:
 https://www.usmobile.com/
 They use both T-Mobile and Verizon towers (Black Sim and White Sim respectively) so even up here in Alaska I get decent coverage.

 PS. I&#x27;m not affiliated with US Mobile, just a happy customer.

 I want to have a TODO which would happen on several days a week at different times. I know I can have it like this:
 TODO Training   
 But the problem is when I mark the TODO as DONE it moves every instance by 1 week and not only the one for that day. Is there a way I can achieve this functionality?

                              <span>EDIT: I solved it. To have the file local tags shown in the locally customized colors, I need to add this line to the # Local Variables:
 # org-tags-special-faces-re: &quot;:\\(tag1\\|tag2\\|tag3\\):&quot; 
 With tag1, tag2 etc. being the names of the tags I set with #+TAGS: at the beginning of the file.
 --
 I would like to set new tags in orgmode on a per file basis and give them certain colors.
 The #+TAGS: setting on the first line of the file works fine, the new tags are set and I can choose them with pcomplete.
 But when I try to change their faces via # org-tag-faces in the # Local Variables at the end of the file, something strange happens. They change their color only if I have set them globally before via (setq org-tag-faces ...). So they do change their color, but only those of the tags that are explicitly named in the global list through (setq org-tag-faces ...), the other, new tags only defined in the actual file via #+TAGS: are in the color of the heading and do not change their face. How is that?
 Does anyone of you know a solution? Thanks a lot for hints and help!
 I work with Emacs 28.1.91 and Org mode version 9.5.4.

 (add-to-list &#x27;load-path &quot;~/.emacs.d/org-similarity&quot;) (require &#x27;org-similarity) ;; Directory to scan for possibly similar documents. ;; org-roam users might want to change it to &#x60;org-roam-directory&#x27;. (setq org-similarity-directory org-roam-directory) (setq org-similarity-language &quot;english&quot;) ;; How many similar entries to list at the end of the buffer. (setq org-similarity-number-of-documents 10) ;; Whether to prepend the list entries with similarity scores. (setq org-similarity-show-scores t) ;; Whether the resulting list of similar documents will point to ID property or ;; filename. Default it nil. ;; However, I recommend setting it to &#x60;t&#x27; if you use &#x60;org-roam&#x27; v2. (setq org-similarity-use-id-links t) ;; Scan for files inside &#x60;org-similarity-directory&#x27; recursively. (setq org-similarity-recursive-search nil) 
 So I do C-c n f and search for a note called gradient_descent.org. Then I run org-similarity-insert-list and it gives me the following error:
 FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: &#x27;/Users/name/OneDrive/Org/references/notes/.#gradient_descent.org&#x27; 
 I am unsure why it is searching for .#gradient_descent.org when the file name is gradient_descent.org.

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently toyng around with some game ideas in haskell and came accross following &quot;thinking-problem&quot;:
 if you have a &quot;main-loop&quot; and some arbitrary (really big data - for example map data or similar...) the easy aproach would probably be something like this:
 main some_data &#x3D; do [...] -- do the magic main some_data 
 But is it wise to carry this (potential really big data) always through the recursion?Hence I thought about some diferent solutions:
 main &#x3D; do -- the concurent feature/nature of MVar could be also -- beneficial if one have multiple (game)-loops? some_data &lt;- newMVar some_data&#x27; loop where loop &#x3D; do [...] loop 
 Question about approach Nr.2: The Do-Notaion is only &quot;syntactic sugar&quot; therefore: are MVars also just recursive parameters which are carryed along the recursion or do MVars be treated diferently?
 So it comes all down to how haskell implements the parameter of its recursive functions (I guess...)(lazy evaluation and so ?!?)
 Whats your opinion?Are there different/more suitable aproaches out there?

                              <span>A couple of days ago I wanted to try something out using tree-sitter and thought that Cabal would be a nice little language to use for it. Not too big, but not too small either. Only problem was there was no grammar defined for it. Instead of finding another language for my experiment I opted to dive into the rabbit hole, despite having neither experience of tree-sitter nor a good understanding of Cabal&#x27;s syntax.
 Now I have something that could be a good base to build on. Hopefully someone can point out my mistakes... maybe even help me correct them.
 This is the repo for tree-sitter-cabal!
 MRs are welcome, of course.

                              <span>The script itself doesn&#x27;t depend on anything but to build/enter the development shell you need nix + flakes. 
 It generates a flake and a cabal file. Optionally it can generate the test and/or bench section for cabal. 
 After running the script just cd into the directory and run nix develop . And everything will be setup:
 Haskell language server Ghc Formatting Bla bla bla all that stuff. Just check out the flake to see what&#x27;s available.
 Hope this can help people getting started with haskell :) cheers

                              <span>So this is a question that has come up in a project where our unit tests must provide 100% coverage.
 Imagine that you have a library that includes a module like so: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;haskell module MyModule (A(..)) where
 data A &#x3D; A1 Int Bool | A2 String deriving (Eq, Ord, Show) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 For the purpose of this example, assume that there are no other functions in this or other modules that use values of type A.
 If you were writing unit tests for your library, would you consider that A must be tested and, if so, how?
 MyModule defines a number of functions A1 :: Int -&gt; Bool -&gt; A and A2 :: String -&gt; A, as well as some functions like (&#x3D;&#x3D;) :: A -&gt; A -&gt; Bool and compare :: A -&gt; A -&gt; Ordering generated via derivation.
 Can those be safely assumed to be correct? Should they be tested regardless (e.g., because there is no guarantee from the outside that we used deriving to create them, so their implementation may be incorrect)?
 What about if A is defined using GADTs, some other extensions, or contains some constraints? Are there any circumstances under which a datatype definition and instances of standard classes generated via derivation may fail and should be tested?
 Note that I&#x27;m not talking about cases where the type is accompanied by user-written functions. In such cases, yes, the functions may be part of the abstract datatype&#x27;s API and thus must be tested. I&#x27;m talking about the datatype definition itself, the constructors, record fields, and instances generated by GHC.

                              <span>I&#x27;m working on a programming language idea, and part of it is an IDE that has an unusual GUI. Rather than have code laid out in a traditional plain text file, most code would be split up into tables and cells, which connect to each other in various ways. Unreal blueprints is in the direction of what I&#x27;m thinking of.
 The language itself would most likely be implemented in Haskell, and I&#x27;m looking for ideas for how to approach the IDE. I have basic experience with GUI programming in Python using Kivy and Pygame, but I feel my existing experience is not enough for this project.
 I am wondering if Haskell could be a good choice for my situation.
  
If the backend is implemented in Haskell, then I think having the front end be in Haskell would make life easier
 Functional Reactive Programming seems super interesting
 I just like programming in Haskell
  
Some concerns or thoughts I have about the technology/resources I&#x27;m looking for
  
I would really like the GUI framework I learn to be cross platform 
 I would like it to have an emphasis on nice visual design (Maybe visual design is mostly work by the user rather than the framework? I&#x27;m inexperienced and not quite sure)
 I think it would be nice to learn GUI programming/design in a principled way, maybe with a theoretical bent
 I would prefer the framework to have very good tutorials
 If FRP is a good idea, is there any reason to prefer classical/denotative FRP to something like reflex? I&#x27;m really interested in the theoretical stuff, but ultimately I need a technology that is practical
 I&#x27;m not in a hurry to learn, this is mostly to have fun!

                              <span>Hi,
 I want to have a TODO which would happen on several days a week at different times. I know I can have it like this:
 TODO Training   
 But the problem is when I mark the TODO as DONE it moves every instance by 1 week and not only the one for that day. Is there a way I can achieve this functionality?

                              <span>So, I&#x27;ve spent the past few weeks configuring emacs to my liking. It has been real nice, only problem is that you often face with the reality that emacs is single-threaded, and the interface feels sluggish at points because of that.
 I am trying to relieve the huge pain that is autocompletion. As far as functionality goes, it&#x27;s great. I get the completions I want with documentation on the side and everything, but it&#x27;s SLOW.
 You can feel it struggle with every keystroke. Here are the results of the profiler after typing a bit.

 Have I accidentally entered some unusual mode, or is it some kind of glitch that will end on restarting?
 I suspect it will disappear on restart, but I&#x27;m in an EXWM session now and I&#x27;m not ready to restart.

                              <span>I made a function (included below) that combines all the tables in a particular Org subtree and exports them to single TSV file. My function works well enough, but it&#x27;s a bit slow, taking usually about 1.2 seconds. I ran the emacs profiler on my function and found that the majority of the time was spent on calls to org-table-align invoked by org-table-move-column and org-table-export. In my case, those calls to org-table-align are unnecessary. Since neither org-table-move-column nor org-table-export provide an option to not invoke org-table-align, I made my own modified versions of those function that just comment out the calls to org-table-align. By doing this, my function now runs in 0.2 seconds, a 6x speedup!
 While the speedup is nice, I would prefer to not have my own modified version…</span>

                              <span>Hi all,
 I love Edwina mode, but I&#x27;m suspicious that it&#x27;s interferes somehow with the process of opening links to external buffers.
 When I try to open a link to a specific part of an org-file, using org-open-at-point for instance, it opens the file correctly, but then fails to jump to the right header etc. The same happens when, for instance, I open a link contained in a help buffer to view a function; it opens the correct file but fails to jump to the right part of the code.
 The reason I suspect Edwina mode is because when I switch it off everything works fine again. So it seems that somehow Edwina is interfering with this process.
 Has anyone else had this problem? I&#x27;m trying to look into it but I&#x27;m new to elisp and I&#x27;m not sure exactly where ti begin
 Thanks for any ideas,
 Mike

                              <span>Hello, I&#x27;m running Emacs on an HP Probook 4540S laptop. Intel i5 CPU, 8GB RAM, 240GB SSD, Linux Fedora with GNOME.
 I start Emacs with emacs -q to prevent loading any configuration. When I create a new .org file, there is a few seconds delay until the document opens up. Is that normal? It just happens the first time Org loads up. Then creating other .org documents have no delay.
 I tried disabling the garbage collector in early-init.el and it seems to help a bit. Does that mean that I should set back the GC threshold to about 2MB instead of the default 800Kb? I don&#x27;t want to go too far with it as I know it is not good to mess with the default value.

 I&#x27;ve had a quick google but nothing obvious, so before I go deeper, anyone have a quick solution? On both Debian Bookworm and Ubuntu 22:10 it doesnt work. &quot;ripgrep&quot; is installed on both.
 ​
 As I type my grep query I see that the project root is correct . There is an (!) exclamation mark there to the left of the entry field if thats any indicator.
 ​
 It&#x27;s going to be something painfully obvious, isn&#x27;t it?
 ​
  
Problem found : a .gitignore a few directories up. Solved by adding a .gitignore at the top of my projects directory containing &quot;!*&quot;.

Goal: Substantially reduce manual point-and-click trading labor.
  
Is such Haskell software already out there?
 What would be some benefits of doing it in Haskell, as opposed to using a ready-made trading engine made in another language? (If any finance folks here know of such existing engines, esp. compatible with Interactive Brokers, please share.)
 If doing it in Haskell, what do you think about using ReactiveBanana, as this gentleman did? At the end of the day a trading engine is just a loop in the imperative world, so FRP feels like a good idea; but that brings up the question of ReactiveBanana vs. other FRP libraries.
 How would you personally prefer to do it?

                              <span>Hello everybody. Haskell newbie here. Since I’m in software development is more than 30 years, last 7 in Scala, so my questions will be very straightforward and concrete: 1. I’m completely fine with GHCi, I need an IDE where I can “navigate to declaration” to learn quicker. I know VScode has, but unfortunately it doesn’t work for external ones, even Base.hs, IO.hs, etc. IntelliJ idea Haskell plug-in seems buggy, because when I add even one dependency (aeson), it starts complaining about versions and “navigate do declaration” stops working. It seems it somehow tied to lts-18. I tried 8.10.7, but still complains. 2. I’m completely fine with all types of monads, types, and type classes, I learnt about massive compile optimization when I use foldr, main question is how to distinguish tail recursion and non-tail. 3. Where do we store all the libraries. I found Hoogle. Is there only one place, 4. Which libraries we do use for - formatting - linting - other “good things” 5. Do we have kind of “recommended” resources to pass through in order not to ask dumb questions? 6. Do we have kind of stack of libraries which we use in all apps, like in Scala: - cats - cats-effects - fs2 streaming - circe (json) - http4s (http) - postgres, dynamo libraries - etc. 7. Forums, blog posts to follow 8. Other staff I need to know/learn. 9. Is difference between 8 and 9 such big as between Scala 2 and 3. 10. Any complete working repository to start with json/http/postgres Thanks in advance for all responses and help.

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to learn Haskell but I&#x27;m hitting a very frustrating problem.
 I don&#x27;t find typing expressions into GHCI an effective way to learn. I want to create small programs that I can compile and run. So many guides and courses seem to rely to heavily on GHCI in my opinion. I understand many people learn this way, but what is the point if I don&#x27;t know how to actually create a project?
 For instance, I&#x27;m trying to follow along with &quot;Learn You a Haskell&quot;, but quickly got discouraged with all of the GHCI use. I tried to create a Haskell project in VS Code, but I&#x27;m not even sure what should go in main!
 I learned other languages effectively because I was able to create bite-sized projects and experiment. I just feel very limited by the approach that functional programming language guides take.
 So my questions:
  
How did you guys learn to actually create, structure, and execute projects? Am I just doing a bad job at looking for this information? Like I said, I&#x27;m able to create a main.hs file, but am a bit stuck on what goes after &quot;main &#x3D; &quot; lol.
 Is there a reason so many guides stick with REPL? I&#x27;ve seen this from many FP languages. I&#x27;ve been wanting to learn an FP language but I keep bouncing around because I keep running into this problem. How are people learning these languages without knowing how to set up projects? I just don&#x27;t feel like that should be an afterthought!
  
Sorry to rant a bit, just am confused as to why this is the case. Maybe I just learn differently than others, but I find slapping things in the REPL to be a very ineffective way of actually understanding the concepts. I&#x27;d much rather make mini-projects and experiment!

 Fp Complete lists one (1)! project: Stack as newcomer friendly, and the latest stack lssue tagged as such is from 2019, so it doesn&#x27;t seem as if this info is actively maintained.
 Any suggestions? I terms of skill-level i&#x27;ve done (almost) 3 advent of codes in Haskell, and made it to StateT in the Data 61 fp course.

                              <span>It&#x27;s Thursday, and here we go again. I&#x27;m telling you what I&#x27;m working on to inspire you to tell me what you worked on. Seeing a few lurkers surface in the forums has been pan-supreme, and I hope they&#x27;ll continue sharing, questioning, and teaching us.
This week I&#x27;ve been working on my writing skills. I have an essay in the style of an interview due in 20230320. It is well underway. The interview is done, the transcription is done, and the first cleanup is done.  I&#x27;ve relaunched my writing workflow. It worked great for a few days, but then personal and family commitments evaporated writing time. I&#x27;m not giving up, though.

                              <span>If I do (use-package mymode :defer t) and mymode.el has some autoloads in them, will the package get loaded when the autoloaded function gets called? 
 The use-package manual tells that the package loading gets deferred based on some other use-package settings (like :hook) but I don&#x27;t understand if the same applies if there&#x27;s no other use-package settings but only an autoload inside the script.

But if I open a buffer and set it to the same major mode (csharp-mode in this case, but I see the same behavior in python-mode and json-mode) and call editorconfig-apply, the settings aren&#x27;t applied. Is this intended, or am I missing a setting somewhere?

 I don&#x27;t mind having the messages logged, in case I find time to investigate, but these are not pressing issues. (&quot;docstring wider than 80 characters&quot; -- in someone else&#x27;s code? Who cares?) It&#x27;s intensely irritating.

                              <span>I have used Tramp to browse remote servers happily for years. But my sysadmin and I were working on something just now that involved log files, which can grow to gbs in size. He mentioned how he uses a &#x3D;vim -view&#x3D; or something like that for browsing big files, which I know is a different mentality than Tramp. The default Tramp I&#x27;ve used always downloads a copy of the file (at least, I think it does) to generate the buffer -- which seems a problem with the big ones, since I&#x27;m recreating a local large too-large thing to maintain the buffer. Is there a way to tell Tramp that for some files I don&#x27;t want to recreate the thing -- just view/search/highlight in it? Or am I misunderstanding the situation completely?

 Debugger entered--Lisp error: (wrong-type-argument number-or-marker-p nil) eyebrowse-free-slot(nil) eyebrowse-create-window-config() funcall-interactively(eyebrowse-create-window-config) call-interactively(eyebrowse-create-window-config nil nil) command-execute(eyebrowse-create-window-config) 
 Anyone have any idea how to fix this?

 Is this possible to define without appealing to Eq? I imagine that from a lambda calculus perspective, this should be possible by comparing lambda terms directly (supposing x, y have normal forms).

 I have this code in the beginning of my file. Yesterday, it was asking me confirm the use of local variable and then works perfectly . However now there is no confirmation and when i save nothing happens. I used M-: to try function and it worked. It have happened before then i deleted, added, tried many things and it started to work suddenly even it was totally same. Do you had similar issue or do you know how can i debug? 
 p.s. : i&#x27;m noob to emacs and the code is from SO.

                              <span>Lately I&#x27;ve been trying to replicate my LaTeX setup for mathematical writing in org mode. I have been able to get everything working fine when it comes to LaTeX exports, but I would ideally like to also export to HTML.
 In many fields of mathematics it is common for papers to follow number conventions along these lines:
 1. Section one Theorem 1.1.  (1.2) Corollary 1.3 2. Section two Lemma 2.1. 
 In LaTeX I would typically achieve this behaviour by using the amsthm package, putting this in my preamble:
 \usepackage{amsthm} \numberwithin{equation}{section} \newtheorem{theorem}[equation]{Theorem} \newtheorem{corollary}[equation]{Corollary} \newtheorem{lemma}[equation]{Lemma} 
 Then LaTeX to produce the outline at the start of this post would look something like this:
 \section{Section one} \begin{theorem}  \end{theorem} \begin{equation}  \end{equation} \begin{corollary}  \end{corollary} \section{Section two} \begin{lemma}  \end{lemma} 
 This means that in org mode I can just add a few lines to my LaTeX preamble with header options and then just write:
 * Section one #+begin_theorem  #+end_theorem #+begin_equation  #+end_equation #+begin_corollary  #+end_corollary * Section two #+begin_lemma  #+end_lemma 
 However, I&#x27;ve been struggling to figure out how to replicate any of this functionality for the html export. I&#x27;ve been trying to read the code that exports to html to see if there&#x27;s a good place to hook in so I can add numbers, but I&#x27;ve been struggling to understand how any of it works.

                              <span>By default, the right abstraction is a bit of type safety around raw SQLite.
 That is sqlite-simple.
 By design, it will last at least a few decades without much of maintenance by the upstream developers due to not having much of anything on top of SQite. But, it has some type safety for marshalling data types. It also has a quosi quoter for long SQL queries.
 It exposes the full expressive power of SQLite. So, you won&#x27;t need to wait for the upstream developers.
 If you want to re-use composable query functions or your application needs to run on different kinds of databases, then you should at least have a look at libraries with higher abstractions, such as beam, squeal, persistent + esqueleto, and selda.
 beam is a bit more complex, but it exposes more SQL features than other higher abst…</span>

                              <span>I could swear I saw a package a while back for working with non-IO environment types interactively in ghci a while back. Something to run actions in a separate thread and pass the results back to the caller, so that it can maintain a persistent environment yet still be easy to user interactively in ghci.
 I couldn&#x27;t find anything like that with a quick search, so I started writing my own. It was very simple at first, but as I started addressing more and more edge cases where things could go wrong, I ended up with a lot of subtle things going on. It reached a point where I started wondering if I&#x27;m duplicating work, or if it would add value to put what I&#x27;ve done on hackage. So does anyone know if something is out there already?
 For the curious, my work is available at https://github.com/chowells79/shuttle/blob/main/src/Control/Shuttle.hs . I haven&#x27;t got it to release quality yet, as I&#x27;m not sure there is a need to. But I have addressed all the technical edge cases I could think of, which at least is interesting for the curious. (The naming is also not great at the moment, but that&#x27;s another separate issue.)

                              <span>TeXmacs is a scientific text editor with a high-quality typesetting engine, of course inspired by LaTeX and able to import/export it (with some limitations) and produce HTML, PS and PDF.

 After using it for a while, it became necessary for me to add quick coding experiments to certain documents. This plugin allows us to run GHCi sessions right inside the editor, which divides interactions into separate cells. This gives us extra capabilities such as re-writing and re-evaluating one or all prompts, deleting interactions, etc. Correct and re-run as many times as needed.

                              <span>Hey there,
 I don&#x27;t know about you, but trying to figure out how to actually configure Emacs for modern web development is a nightmare most of the time since nothing gets properly indented for React projects and the like without a ton of work involved (which absolutely should not be the case in the year of our Lord, 2023 --&gt; Hoping for the day that there&#x27;s like an &#x27;IDE Emacs&#x27; or some bs that just does this for you).
 That being noted, I found this small snippet to be amazing for anyone who configures React projects with using &#x27;.js&#x27; files like I do.
 Just wanted to share the source of the snippet, and the snippet itself, aka include this in your &#x27;web-mode&#x27; config and this should fix any indentation issues for the HTML type segments in the JSX &#x27;return&#x27; statement of any React based &#x27;.js&#x27; files in a React project.
 Related source link aka flooose&#x27;s answer:
 - https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/20016/no-html-jsx-indentation-in-jsx-mode/20055#20055
 ​
 Related snippet I borrowed for my own config:
 (add-hook &#x27;web-mode-hook (lambda () ;; short circuit js mode and just do everything in jsx-mode (if (equal web-mode-content-type &quot;javascript&quot;) (web-mode-set-content-type &quot;jsx&quot;) (message &quot;now set to: %s&quot; web-mode-content-type)))) 
 Hope this helps, thank God for StackOverflow.

                              <span>Available here: https://github.com/rkallio/ol-straight. ol-straight provides a way of constructing an org link that references a straight package. Use org-insert-link to insert a straight type link in to an org document. Opening said link will take you straight to the package&#x27;s homepage URL.
 When exporting a document with straight type links, the links will be exported using the https:// protocol. 
 This package is mostly useful for writing a literate Emacs configuration, where a reference to a package may take you to the package&#x27;s homepage.

                              <span>Hi All,
 I was able to created 3 more episodes of Discovering Emacs the past month and wanted to share them here, and hope some of you find it helpful. Here&#x27;s a brief overview of what was covered in last few episodes.
 Using Whitespace Mode (EP 4):
 Takes a look at Emacs&#x27;s whitespace mode and discusses how we can simplify its configuration to make it more applicable for most use cases.
 Making Incremental Search Work for You (EP 3):
 Shares some of the ways I utilize Emacs&#x27;s incremental search. In addition it makes some configuration recommendations that you might also find useful.
 Efficiency With The Mark Ring (EP 2):
 Discusses the differences between global and local marks. It also explains when and how marks are added to these mark rings. In addition, it also shares some configuration recommendations.
 As suggested by some members of the community, I also created an accompanied YouTube video for each episode of the podcast. YouTube Channel | Podcast Episodes 
 If anyone has topic recommendations, please feel free to share them here. I will definitely add them to my todo list, thanks!

                              <span>I&#x27;m new to emacs, and I&#x27;ve learned the basics, installed some packages, and configured it to my liking the last 2 weeks or so. I&#x27;m using the basic emacs keybindings (no evil).
 One thing that has repeatedly caused me some headaches, is custom keybindings, either for functionality of packages that don&#x27;t provide their own keybindings, or for custom functions. For instance,
  
I want to configure a binding for consult-line (searches for occurrences, lists them in consult, allows to jump to match), something I&#x27;m probably going to use frequently. So I go for &#x60;C-c slash&#x60; , vaguely inspired by vim, which I&#x27;ve used for a while in the past.
 I try it in my config file and it works.
 I want to use it in org mode and realize it&#x27;s already bound to something else there. Shit.
  
How to best avoid this &quot;in advance&quot;, such that it&#x27;s unlikely to happen in the future, even if I install more packages or use more modes? I guess letting my own commands start with &#x60;C-c&#x60; is a bad idea.
 I thought about starting all custom commands with something else, like &#x60;C-some_key...&#x60; where &#x60;C-some_key&#x60; kind of works as something like a personal leader key. But when I use the same leader/prefix key for all personal keybindings, no matter what they do, I feel this breaks the logic of the seperation that we have with &#x60;C-x&#x60; vs &#x60;C-c&#x60; for instance. Whereas using multiple such preface keys seems to escalate keybindings and memorization efforts.
 Also using C might be difficult, as C-something is already bound to a bunch of stuff (eg &#x60;C-v&#x60; for scrolling). What else would be a good option? How are experienced people handling their personal keybindings?
 EDIT made: clarified that the binding I was trying to use was C-c slash-key, somehow it only displayed C-c, which made it confusing

                              <span>Hi, I would like to build an Emacs configuration from scratch. I know there are some alternatives out there such as Prelude, Purcell&#x27;s Emacs.d, and Crafted Emacs but I would like to build my own.
 By modular configuration I mean a configuration in which things are split up in separate files. For example:
 ;; in the main init file: (require &#x27;php) (require &#x27;javascript) (require &#x27;dired) 
 If I don&#x27;t want to use Emacs to code in a certain language I can just comment out the require statement.
 I&#x27;ve noticed that people who built modular configurations did not rely on use-package and they just used the built-in features.
 I was wondering if it&#x27;s possible to build a modular configuration using use-package? I guess use-package is just a macro and what it does it groups things together. Right?
 I think what I need to do is to just put all those use-package chunks into separate files? For example, all dired related stuff into a dired.el file:
 (use-package dired :ensure nil :after all-the-icons-dired :bind (&quot;C-x C-j&quot; . dired-jump) :hook (dired-mode . all-the-icons-dired-mode) :custom (dired-auto-revert-buffer t) (dired-listing-switches &quot;-agho --group-directories-first&quot;)) (use-package dired-narrow :after dired :bind (:map dired-mode-map (&quot;/&quot; . dired-narrow))) (use-package dired-subtree :after dired :bind (:map dired-mode-map (&quot;&quot; . dired-subtree-cycle) (&quot;&quot; . dired-subtree-toggle))) (use-package all-the-icons-dired :after all-the-icons) 
 and PHP related stuff in php.el, so on.. even if the use-package stuff is just 3 lines of code in that file (I may add more stuff in that file in the future).
 I can go with a programming.el that contains all languages but I think having a separate file for each language is better because I can disable and enable the languages I want easier in main.el.
 Please share your thought about this. I would be grateful for any suggestion.

                              <span>New job, embedded software. They have a Linux build server with some homegrown toolchain based on llvm with a mix of makefiles, scons and custom scripts. Huge codebase.
 Development happens on Windows 10 per company policy. I think I can survive the hostile OS with some mix of git bash/msys2/wsl2. Most devs are apparently happy to use some proprietary commercial ide, some vscode, some qtcreator, some vim on the build server.
 I&#x27;d like to give emacs at least a try but I&#x27;ve grown accustomed to use either lsp-mode or more recently eglot with clangd backend. It usually works flawlessly with locally buildable smallish projects and sane build systems (be it autotools, cmake, meson, never really had an issue). 
 Problems I foresee:
  
generate compile_commands.json: hope I&#x27;ll be able to install bear on the build server and that bear will actually work
 separate dev environment and build server: could I maybe generate compile_commands.json in the linux build server and copy it and have it working on the windows dev machine? 
 emacs on windows, native or wsl2? in the latter case cmdline or with some xserver, which one? I just need a few packages, vertico, consult, marginalia, etc. Org-mode would be nice. I think I could live without magit, but that would be sad.
  
Do I have any chance to keep my usual workflow? should I give vscode a try and live happy(ish)?
 Is there maybe a dumber setup for code completions and symbol look up that doesn&#x27;t rely on clangd?

                              <span>Hi, newbie here. I am using Emacs and in particular Org mode for almost a month now. 
 I have some tex document that I want to copy-paste to canvas, but it is a bit of a pain because I need to change say $\tan (x)$ to \(\tan (x) \) and what I do is a bit silly and tedious doing it one by one, and that might be the only way to do it, but I was wondering if there was a quicker way to do it? 
 Thanks!

                              <span>I have a keyboard shortcut for inserting a new heading with the current date in org-mode:
 (defun heading-date () (interactive) (org-insert-heading) (insert (format-time-string &quot;[%Y-%m-%d %a]&quot;)) ) (global-set-key (kbd &quot;&quot;) &#x27;heading-date) 
 I&#x27;d prefer that it always use a top-level heading, not the current heading level. I&#x27;ve read the fine docs but I can not figure out how to set a top-level (single *) heading.
 I know that I can just enter a literal * character. But is there a &quot;correct way&quot; to insert a specific-depth level heading in org-mode?
 Thank you.

 Symbol&#x27;s value as variable is void: package-archives
 Even though I have this code in the init.el:
 (add-to-list &#x27;package-archives &#x27;(&quot;melpa&quot; . &quot;https://melpa.org/packages/&quot;)) (setq package-archive-priorities &#x27;((&quot;melpa&quot; . 100) (&quot;gnu&quot; . 50) (&quot;nongnu&quot; . 25))) 
 I checked to see if anything evaluates at all in init.el so I added this code:
 (message &quot;It works.&quot;) 
 and I see the message &quot;It works.&quot; in the messages buffer. I have my HOME environmental variable set in Windows. Any idea what may cause that package archive error?

                              <span>This is how I usually grep -r &quot;some_text&quot; ./**/*.py
 Emacs requires specific output, so: grep --color&#x3D;auto -nH --null -re &quot;t&quot; ./**/*.js . However, emacs outputs ./**/*.js is not a file or directory.
 Edit: This has been explained in the comments (the shell expands GLOBs/*, emacs doesn&#x27;t)
 rgrep failed also!!, in the second prompt &quot;search for &quot;xxxx&quot; matching the wildcard:&quot; I can&#x27;t put *.js or *.py!!!! it&#x27;s limited to a few choices!
 I must be missing something stupid here!
 Edit: Yes, I&#x27;m missing something dumb. rgrep second prompt gives you possible choices for the wildcard. To write your own wildcard you need to actually choose what you wrote by going up with the arrow key! I&#x27;m on emacs 29 with doom. I hope this is just a bug, not a feature!

                              <span>Most tasks require you to have multiple buffers open at the same time. These could be multiple files, or other secondary buffers like magit or speedbar. If you need to have multiple files open at the same time, where do you like to have your main file?
 Note: 
  
if you have multiple monitors, I&#x27;m assuming emacs is in your main screen if you&#x27;re doing some heavy editing
 the poll has no options for multiple buffers stacked vertically (i.e., upper and bottom), but feel free to vote anyway and leave a comment

 emacs: writing to child signal FD: Bad file descriptor 
 I use the form above in a function to open a terminal on the current directory. Am I doing it wrong?
 start-process-shell-command doesn&#x27;t raise the error (but I don&#x27;t use it because on quitting Emacs kills the processes launched with start-process-shell-command).
 My OS is Emacs 28.2 running Fedora 37.
  
Update Maybe I&#x27;ve run into https://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug&#x3D;58960 as suggested on https://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/help-gnu-emacs/2022-11/msg00260.html. If I run M-x shell before evaluating call-process-shell-command no error is shown, indeed.

                              <span>I tried to find an inbuild function for searching for values inside list-variables but did not find one. Then I wrote one recursively, but as I expected it bloats to quickly to be used on longer lists.
 I also looked a bit into loading the list into a buffer and then searching for a regexp but I don&#x27;t want to load a buffer (maybe there is a virtual buffer, which is not visible or active in a sense? Or a temporary file to be searched?).
 So what is the best way to search a long list of symbols for a symbol in a program?
 ​
 Here is my humble attempt:
 (defun arg-is-in-car (arg cons-arg) (eq arg (car cons-arg))) (defun list-is-empty (list-arg) (not list-arg)) (defun arg-is-in-list (arg list-arg) (if (arg-is-in-car arg list-arg) t (progn (if (list-is-empty list-arg) nil (arg-is-in-list arg (cdr list-arg))))))

                              <span>Greetings to all. 
 It just so happened that my Intellij license ran out. Well, I decided to look towards the exotic, and so far I have stopped at emacs.
 There were several questions(In Emacs I&#x27;m a complete noob). If there are java developers who write in Emacs, I hope for their help (and configs :)).
 Actual questions:
 1) Which is better: build emacs from scratch or use doomEmacs as a starting point?
 2) Which lsp servers are better to install for Java (sometimes I also write in Scala)?
 3) Which plugins to install for Maven and Gradle? Will there be auto-completion? 
 4) Will it be possible to create and run projects directly from Emacs? (Not so important, but still)
 5) How is Spring? Is there a plugin that is analogous to Spring Tools?
 6) Which plugins should I use to integrate git, sql, markdown, xml?
 7) Which plugins should I use for database integration? Is there such a possibility at all? Interested in redis, postgresql.
 What I plan to use it for:
 1) Development of the backend part
 2) JavaFX development of home projects.
 3) Minecraft modding. Purely on the fan.
 Thank you in advance for your help.

                              <span>Hello, I am trying to develop a mode for a custom language of mine. The language deals with a lot of logical operators such as &quot;∧&quot;, &quot;∨&quot; and &quot;∀&quot; etc. What I am trying to implement is a feature so that I can write &quot;\and&quot; to get the &quot;∧&quot; symbol (kinda like they do in the agda-mode).
 Currently I am using the prettify-package, however I realised that this package does not actually replace the text with the symbols in the file. It simply replaces it visually in my mode, but the source-text still remains in the file.
 I could rewrite the parser of the language to also parse &quot;\and&quot;, but I prefer to avoid this and get Emacs to replace the actual string with the Unicode-symbol it refers to.
 Does anyone know about any similar package to prettify-package which also replaces the actual strings with the symbols? 
 Thanks in advance 
 PS. I am not sure how standard the prettify package is within the Emacs community. But here is a link to the code I am using: https://github.com/Ilazki/prettify-utils.el/blob/master/prettify-utils.el

                              <span>Please recommend resources (of any kind such as book, blog, youtube channel) to me to learn haskell. I am a CS student and do code in several different languages, as part of learning, haven&#x27;t done any project or industry work and I have very very weak grasp at maths (fine with relation and functions in maths now). I just started reading learn you a haskell for great good since yesterday. I don&#x27;t get what 5 /&#x3D; 5 means, 5/5 :&#x3D; 1 then why its says False? Haskell has module but not classes at all, right? Some important concepts to make a solid grasp on? I&#x27;m just curious about haskell and because it&#x27;s so different and bla bla bla. But where are actually its applications because I&#x27;m desiring to become a future haskell dev these days, please give me big solid reasons to stick to it. 
 Please be kind. Thank you so much.

                              <span>I just released brick-tabular-list-2.0.1.0 on hackage.
 Everything that bugged me in API and implementation has been corrected. Before 1.0.0.0, the API was convoluted. Before 2.0.0.0, the API and the implementation were a bit difficult to understand.
 Now, the API and the implementation are simple and easy to understand.
 It seems there will not be breaking changes for the next few decades.
 If you want a tabular list in terminal emulators, look no further. You have found it.

                              <span>Hi, guys! I apologize for asking a silly question.
 I set up a quick repo to play around and build minesweeper in Haskell for practice. I decided to use Cabal over stack, because I&#x27;ve seen other people use it to good end.
 ​
 So, my first step was to set up the structure of the project and try to see how the imports worked.
 So, I ran cabal init -n followed by creating a src/myfancypkg directory with myfancypkg.hs file, containing a single function. So, the structure of the project is:
 minesweeper |app -main.sh |src |myfancypkg -myfancypkg.hs -minesweeper.cabal 
 dist-newstyle folder appeared after running cabal init
 Coming from Go, I got spoiled with the local imports discovery that happens auto-magically. When I try to use my new package in main, I get this error:
 app/Main.hs:3:8: error: parse error on input ‘myfancypkg’ | 3 | import myfancypkg (myhello) | 
 I tried figuring out how to fix it, but after two hours of searching and trying I finally resorted to asking the mature crowd. I apologize for asking such a dumb question too.
 Thank you SO much for taking time!
 Here&#x27;s the repo for you to examine: https://github.com/rkuprov/minesweeper

 I have been getting some errors and I think it’s because the latest version of ghc supported on Hasktorch A and the oldest version of ghc supported on macos M1/2 B are incompatible. That is to say that B &gt; A (we want A &gt;&#x3D; B). 
 Are there work arounds or are there good alternatives to Hasktorch?

                              <span>It is a truth universally acknowledged that the Python packaging ecosystem is in need of a good dependency checker.
In the least, it’s our hope to convince you that Tweag’s new dependency checker, FawltyDeps, can help you maintain an environment that is minimal and reproducible for your Python project, by ensuring that required dependencies are explicitly declared and detecting unused dependencies.
If you work with Python, and care about keeping your projects lean and repeatable, then this is for you.

Why do we need a dependency checker?
Say you’re working on a new project that uses Python, and you want to
leverage Python’s ecosystem of 3rd-party libraries.
So you decide to import something.
For that something to work, you must first install it into your development environment

                              <span>I have almost structured textual log files and want investigate the content with tool assistance.
 I managed to parse my logs with https://github.com/otros-systems/otroslogviewer but GUI somewhat inconvenient...
 Is there anything for Emacs which
  
understands structure of logs (time/host/ip/logger/category/etc could be parsed and I don&#x27;t want to write ugly kilometer long regexes),
 and allows hiding parts based on structured patterns? Like I want to hide all errors from &quot;main&quot; thread or requests from ip&#x3D;localhost.
 handles 100MB files
  
My current log format is not one line but multiline so no M-x flush-lines.
 PS I wonder if I can repurpose Wireshark to parse logs so later I can filter out / highlight / search.

                              <span>I have this line in the early-init.el file:
 (setq package-enable-at-startup nil) 
 and these lines in the init.el file:
 (require &#x27;package) (add-to-list &#x27;package-archives &#x27;(&quot;melpa&quot; . &quot;https://melpa.org/packages/&quot;)) (setq package-archive-priorities &#x27;((&quot;melpa&quot; . 100) (&quot;gnu&quot; . 50) (&quot;nongnu&quot; . 25))) (package-initialize) &lt;---- here it is (unless (package-installed-p &#x27;use-package) (package-refresh-contents) (package-install &#x27;use-package)) (use-package use-package :init (setq use-package-always-ensure t) (use-package use-package-ensure-system-package :ensure t)) 
 I&#x27;m not sure if I understood correctly because I&#x27;m not a native English speaker but from what I read online it seemed to me that the (package-initialize) is not needed anymore in the init file since Emacs 27. However I&#x27;m not sure about it. Is that true?
 I&#x27;m using Emacs 28.1. So, in my case should l get rid of the (package-initialize) line and set the package-enable-at-startup variable to t in early-init.el instead of nil? I&#x27;m not planning to use anything lower than Emacs 28 in the future.

                              <span>Hello guys. Just saw a lot of people is switching to emacs because org mode. Saw it on the internet and is just to write notes with a cool format. I don&#x27;t write a lot of notes at all, and if i do it i feel comfortable with raw text. If i need to do something looking nicer better use HTML.
 So please tell me why is so amazing org mode? Thanks

                              <span>I saw this package one time that changes the way syntax highlighting works by coloring things based on their indentation level in a file. It would be very useful for certain filetypes like xml, where the indentation (ideally) reflects the semantics of the file structure. Think of it like rainbow-delimiters except for entire levels of indentation.
 I meant to set it up but never wrote down what it was called and now I can&#x27;t find it anymore. I&#x27;m not talking about this: https://github.com/DarthFennec/highlight-indent-guides and results for this (and the 5+ other packages that do this same thing) is all I can find when googling different variations of &quot;emacs syntax coloring by indentation level&quot; etc.
 Anyone know what this package is called?

                              <span>I am not sure if this is a new issue, or if it&#x27;s something I just noticed, but rather than &#x60;org-cycle&#x60; cycling through the visibility of a sub-tree, it only folds the subtree.
 subsequent TAB key presses do not reveal the tree, and the only way to view the contents is to close and reopen the file.
 In &#x60;insert&#x60; mode, the TAB key promotes and demotes the subtree just fine. 
 There is no way to unfold the subtree.
 I have seen a few issues that are close to this one, but I haven&#x27;t seen this issue.
 Ideas? Thanks!

                              <span>Hi, I have been lurking around for a while now, really enjoying the discussions, so I thought it might be time to introduce myself.
I am a originally from Slovakia, but have been living in Norway for a decade now. I’m a researcher in data analysis, working with a lot of machine learning, and like to learn about a variety of things in my free time too. My interests range from the biophysics of movement through diet, pregnancy and childbirth, to neurodiversity, gardening, parenting, knowledge work and whatever else that catches my interest.
I have first heard about the Zettelkasten method about two months ago and it was a love at first sight. I always struggled with organising my notes and the organically organised chaos of Zettelkasten just makes perfect sense to me.
I started out using Obsidian. That is actually how I ran into the Zettelkasten, as I was originally only looking for a simple markdown editor. After a month and a hundred notes I could feel this was becoming very important to me and decided to move to an open source software instead - namely org-roam in Emacs. I’m new to Emacs, but fairly stubborn, so I have been steadily climbing its famously steep learning curve and I think I’m quite happy with my choice. The time when my Zettelkasten was hanging between the two systems, so to speak, was quite uncomfortable though.
I haven’t quite landed with my note-taking routines yet, but I have the most important bits in place. I use my trusted Bullet Journal for planning, journaling, tracking and fleeting notes, while any “knowledge” goes into the Zettelkasten with Zotero keeping track of the references.
I am very excited to see how things will evolve and looking forward to the interesting discussions here on the forum.</span>

Is there any module tied to compile mode which would, when stepping through errors, parse these messages, and ask if you wanted to apply the suggestion, and if you said yes, would modify the source code in emacs?

                              <span>Hey,
 I&#x27;ve been playing around with a few different modal editors (particularly Meow and God mode) and saw the recent post on Holymotion. I&#x27;ve been trying to incorporate avy more into my workflow, but often find that I run a command then realize I should have run an avy command instead. I&#x27;ve written this very basic function, which takes the last repeatable command and runs a set avy command based on that. I&#x27;m sharing it here for mostly since I&#x27;m very new to actually writing my own elisp functions and would really appreciate any input on how to improve it.
 ​
 (defun avy-extend-command (repeat-arg) &quot;Runs a specific avy command based on what the last-repeatable-command was&quot; (interactive &quot;P&quot;) (cond ((eq &#x27;next-line last-repeatable-command) (avy-goto-line-below)) ((eq &#x27;previous-line last-repeatable-command) (avy-goto-line-above)) ((or (eq &#x27;forward-word last-repeatable-command) (eq &#x27;forward-char last-repeatable-command)) (avy-goto-word-0-below-in-line)) ((or (eq &#x27;backward-word last-repeatable-command) (eq &#x27;backward-char last-repeatable-command)) (avy-goto-word-0-above-in-line)) (t (message &quot;%s does not have a related avy-extend-command&quot; last-repeatable-command)))) (global-set-key (kbd &quot;H-j&quot;) #&#x27;avy-extend-command)

                              <span>Emacs is notorious for including all kinds of functionality including a web browser, a calculator, and tetris.
 However, it doesn’t seem to include language support for many popular languages including go and lua. Out of curiosity, what’s the reasoning for this?

                              <span>Hello Emacser.
 a year ago started to create my personal website using emacs and org-mode. I figured out an org file could also be an weblog using ox-rss. It exports the org file as RSS file. But I wanted more than one weblog, and I wanted to have an subscribe link to the corresponding xml file added to the html-postamble string. For instance: general.html -&gt; general.xml etc.
 I figured out there is an property list called &quot;info&quot; generated as the export process is running. This property list includes all properties from the org-export-options-alist and the export backend specific options alist. (i.e.: org-export-define-backend &#x27;html)
 The property :html-postamble can be a function name which is called during the export process. Its only argument is info, which is the property list. So far …</span>

                              <span>I was thinking about a mildly annoying issue with emacs--I&#x27;ll semi-frequently litter a file with a misedited key chord (mistyped ctrl-a or ctrl-e leave an [ae] or ctrl-T swaps something). How much would switching to a modal mode help this?
 I&#x27;ve never tried evil but I have tried viper (I use vi for quick edits and emacs when I&#x27;ll be there awhile) and found the usability of almost vi strange. If I was going to move to a modal mode, I would have three requirements:
  
ability to have the mode on for some file types or buffers and not others. Viper-mode appears to open every new file in the modal editing mode which isn&#x27;t what I want. Ideally, file-local variables would be supported.
 ability to easily switch back and forth (e.g. viper&#x27;s ctrl-z) between the modal mode and normal emacs.
 limited performance degradation.
  
 How much would switching to a modal mode help this?
  
As a semi-frequent vi user, I&#x27;d guess that it&#x27;ll make it go away.

                              <span>Usually, i use emacs for writing (org) and Common Lisp programming. It&#x27;s perfect for this.
 Recently, I setup my emacs for Typescript/NextJS development. It works well. But a few times, flycheck was telling me I had an issue... after 30 mins of debugging, I reverted buffer and it went away. There was no error.
 Another time (and a few times after that), the app crashed. No errors. Nothing. I opened the same project in vsCode and i had lots of errors. These did not come up in emacs. 
 The challenge now is that I cannot rely on the emacs messages to be accurate. 
 Im not sure what the issue is either.
 Any thoughts/similar experiences?

                              <span>My package perject is now available on MELPA. It allows grouping frames, buffers and window configurations per (user-defined) project. It makes use of the built-in packages desktop.el and tab-bar.el.
 The main difference to something like the built-in project.el is what is considered a &quot;project&quot;. In project.el, every project has a &quot;root directory&quot; in which the files belonging to the project are supposed to live. In contrast, there is no such assumption in perject. Projects are completely user-defined and it does not matter where a file is actually located on the file system. One can use project.el alongside perject.
 You can find more information and some video demos on the website: https://github.com/overideal/perject

                              <span>Emacs has C-M-h as &quot;mark function&quot; command. It calls different functions in different modes (for example, C++ calls c-mark-function, python calls python-mark-defun). I&#x27;d like to have this functionality in a different binding (C-M-f, it&#x27;s a little bit easier to reach). How can I achieve this? I tried
 (define-key (current-local-map) (kbd &quot;C-M-f&quot;) (lookup-key (current-local-map) (kbd &quot;C-M-h&quot;)))
 This works with C++, but not with python. But it seems that both modes puts the C-M-h binding in their major mode&#x27;s keymap, so I don&#x27;t know why it works with C++, but not with python. Any ideas?

                              <span>Hi, I have two questions and would appreciate any help!
  
How can I change the behavior of the shift key + arrowkeys to behave like in other text-editors? I&#x27;ve recently started using Emacs with Evil Mode. Having used VScode and IntelliJ IDEs in the past. Afaik if you use the VIM keybidings &quot;properly&quot; there is no need to select text with the arrows, but I am currently somewhat short on time so I haven&#x27;t had much chance to learn them properly. So for now I am using the arrows keys. But when I use them in the insert state shift + arrow is always jumping whole words. And Ctrl + shift + arrow selects whole words. I would like it to behave like I am used to with shift starting the selection, arrows moving one char at a time, and ctrl + arrow to be used to jump whole words? Is that somehow possible? Which brings me to my next question 
 
Why is which key not showing the bindings for Ctrl + Arrow / Shift+Arrow etc. ? In regards to my previous questions, I was trying to find out how I can achieve it. Online I heard which key (C h + the key you want described) often, but there&#x27;s no way for it to describe Ctrl/shift + arrow for me. If I press C-h k shift-arrow it only describes the behavior the arrow key. Is it because Ctrl/shift are some sort of modifiers and not keys? If yes, is there any way how to describe behavior of such key combinations?
 
 I hope my questions make sense, english is not my native language and I have a hard time to describe what I mean. I apologize if I am unclear.

 Doing &#x60;M-x flypsell-german()&#x60; and &#x60;M-x flyspell-english()&#x60; does work.
 But what I would like is to have the English dict the default when starting a python buffer. The &#x60;:config&#x60; section using &#x60;(flyspell-english)&#x60; doesn&#x27;t seems to work. It is always German (my OS default language/locale) not English.

                              <span>As a happy, long time user of Ivy+Swiper+Counsel, I&#x27;ve had a years-long absence from tweaking my reasonably stable Emacs config. I&#x27;ve come back recently and found that Vertico+Consult+Orderless+Embark+Marginalia+Corfu are all the rage.
 I found this post pretty convincing in its description of the advantages of the new Vertico+Consult+Orderless+Embark+Marginalia+Corfu way, and want to give these new packages a try, but overhauling my config (which is pretty tightly integrated with Ivy+Swiper+Counsel) is going to be no small feat.
 In particular, I need help finding equivalents for the following:
  
ivy-read (this is a big one, as I heavily use its integrated prompting and collection-gathering functionality)
 counsel-hydra-heads (used in all my hydras)
 counsel-yank-pop
 amx integration in to counsel-M-x
 counsel-grep-or-swiper
 counsel-grep-or-swiper-backward
 ivy-explorer
  
Also, is there a guide somewhere that shows how to get Vertico+Consult+Orderless+Embark+Marginalia+Corfu to work well with each other?

                              <span>I always thought that head is not strict, because:
 head [x,undefined] &#x3D;&#x3D; x
 head (cycle[x]) &#x3D;&#x3D; x
 or am I wrong? is head actually strict? What I know is that lists are in weak head normal form because lists are evaluated to the outermost data constructor. And when working with weak head normal form then the function is definitely non-strict; Or did I understand something wrong?

 I can load it successfully into GHCi, using :l Test.hs. I can run the code successfully with main.

 Why is it underlining System.Random? Hovering over the underlined text, it says cannot find System.Random...

 Update: I guess I will just use coerce to save computations.

                              <span>Hi!
 I was looking into Haskell and I kept seeing the word &quot;monad&quot; pop up and I tried googling what it meant and just got more confused (idk what an endofunctor is either...). Can anyone explain what it is in an easier to understand way? 
 Thank you in advance!

 Thought I was going crazy, but upon closer inspection, some of the vertical lines of my tables are not aligned properly? It&#x27;s off by like 1px? Why is this happening? How do I fix it? I&#x27;ve &#x27;tabbed&#x27; the crap out of it, but nothing.

                              <span>I have couple of blogs on Wordpress and Tumblr. I want to convert them to static site with Hugo+Github. 
 I have started using emacs recently so I want to use emacs and org syntax to create and edit the files. 
 As part of this I want to export my posts from wordpress and tumblr to org format. Tumblr native export feature exports the posts in HTML format. 
 Are there any plugins which can export my posts from wordpress and tumblr into org format?

 - https://com-lihaoyi.github.io/fastparse/#3.0.0
 - https://com-lihaoyi.github.io/upickle/#3.0.0
 &quot;Doesn&#x27;t support Scala 3&quot; has been a big complaint for these libraries for a while, so now that that&#x27;s fixed I thought I&#x27;d publicize it a bit.

Lambda Calculus
 
Type Theory
 
Abstract Algebra
 
Category Theory
 
 If someone is a wanting to do functional programming for average use cases like websites, app development, data science, etc... and not for deep under the hood work of compilers, creating new programming languages from scratch etc... which of these topics hold applied value beyond intellectual appreciation of historical concepts related to functional programming?
 An example might be, has knowing lambda calculus or category theory ever helped you write out a plan for how you would compose your functions?
 Has knowing type theory helped anyone with using a type system for domain modeling?

                              <span>Hey r/haskell,
 I have an idea for an interesting hobby project and am scoping out writing it in Haskell. The architecture is not too complicated, it will be the backend for a mobile application. To start not needing more than Redis/server/lambda/postgres. It does not need to serve up html.
 As the title mentioned, I&#x27;m looking for a guide to Haskell backend engineering in the same vein as zero2production is to Rust.
 For those who haven&#x27;t had the pleasure of reading it, it achieves all of these in a pretty small span of time

 Informed and justified selection of key packages (BE web framework, [de]serialization, Postgres communication, redis communication, auth, session management, testing unit/integration, logging/tracing, validation, etc.)
 project structure
 development cycle
 build and deployment considerations (the deployment is less Rust specific)
  
To give you some idea of where I&#x27;m at technically, I&#x27;ve been a professional SWE for a few years now, and spent a semester in Haskell in graduate school, so I&#x27;m familiar, but not fluent with the language.
 My understanding is that in the last few years Haskell has seen a lot of development in practical engineering considerations. So I&#x27;m hoping you guys can share your industry wisdom or point me towards a book/guide you view highly.

                              <span>I have an upcoming interview, but I haven’t coded in Haskell in a while so my skills are a bit rusty. I was wondering if there was a resource or site where I could do structured practice to quickly refresh on pre-monad Haskell. I still remember the concepts generally, just need to write some code for it to come back to me.

 (after! evil-mode (unbind-key &quot;C-t&quot;)

 but no luck. It seems C-t is always binding to +workspace/new .

                              <span>Has anyone managed to integrate the vi shell editing mode (&quot;set -o vi&quot;) tightly with eat?
 I&#x27;ve just started to use eat myself, and while I love how fast it is, and how well it handles even &quot;graphical&quot; terminal applications like top, I can&#x27;t figure out how to get it to play nice with &quot;set -o vi&quot;
 In an ordinary terminal I can usually type ESC to get to normal mode, then k or j to bring the previous/next command from my shell command history to my shell prompt for editing, but that doesn&#x27;t work from evil&#x27;s insert mode in eat.
 The control-r keystroke that I usually use to search through command history in my shell in an ordinary terminal doesn&#x27;t work in eat either.
 Has anyone figured these out, or have any other tips for integrating evil and vi editing mode in a shell in eat?

                              <span>Hello all,
 First I wanted to say what a great community I think this is. Very knowledgeable and friendly. So excited to have dived into emacs and the reddit channel.
 I have a failry simple question but I couldn&#x27;t find the answer on the internet. I mainly program with python and now use company and flymake (thank you for suggestion via previous post). I think that very wisely emacs has them disabled at startup. If I wanted to write a letter I would have found it very annoying to have random exlcamation marks about indentation :-p
 So I want to assign just one key to enable both of them at the same time. I found how to assign them seperately with this:
 (global-set-key [f8] &#x27;company-mode)
 (global-set-key [f9] &#x27;flymake-mode)
 ​
 So I was wondering if there&#x27;s something like
 (global-set-key [f8] &#x27;company-mode &#x27; flymake-mode)
 ​
 Thank you all for your time

                              <span>Hi folks, first time poster. Nice to meet you!
 I&#x27;m at a bit of a loss here. I&#x27;ve configured company-mode via use-package as per the following:
 (use-package company
 :after lsp-mode
 :diminish
 :hook (prog-mode . company-mode)
 :bind
 (:map company-active-map
 (&quot;&quot; . company-complete-selection))
 (:map lsp-mode-map
 &#x60;(&quot;&quot; . company-indent-or-complete-common))&#x60; 
 :custom
 (company-minimum-prefix-length 1)
 (company-idle-delay 0.1))
 Comment: I had prog-mode in the hook as well. But for debugging purposes, I removed it.
 company-mode won&#x27;t kick in automatically in emacs-lisp-mode buffers. Activating it manually works like a charm though. By order of elimination I&#x27;ve identified lsp-mode interaction (mapping and load order) as the culprit. Without it, everything works as intended. I have a few guesses which I won&#x27;t utter because they&#x27;d probably make me sound like an idiot.
 This is my first time hand crafting an .emacs.d. I&#x27;m enjoying the experience very much so far and I can&#x27;t wait to continue, but I&#x27;d like to get rid of this issue first. I&#x27;ll also accept a &quot;you don&#x27;t really need the integration&quot; if applicable. Thanks in advance!

 Any ideas?

 By design, the navigation keys are on the home row, more balanced with both hands. At the mean time, the left thumb is naturally fallen on the alt position, which makes it convenient for forward and backward word. Some main prefix keys are maintained. And the layout is suggested with the letter frequency, allowing attention put on the home row regions without moving hands around. Anyway, this is just an experimental remapping, which I found is superior and more efficient than QWERT and Colemak for standard keybindings.
 See necessary stuffs if you wanna try out. Any suggestions are welcome!

                              <span>I am using doom emacs and I have multiple projects for projectile defined. Is there any way to have two projects side by side? I mean I want to split a frame and on the left window I have my one project and on the right window I want to have another project open. For example to copy code from parts of files of project 2 into files from project 1. 
 Is there any way to do that? When I open a project it always opens up a new workspace. And even though I can easily switch there it would be nicer if I could look at both at once. 
 Or is the only chance that I use two frames? And do the „split view“ with my window manager?

                              <span>Hey there! Guess what? I&#x27;m back on Emacs after 10 long years! :) I&#x27;m using the basic GNU Emacs distribution for Windows 64 and it&#x27;s pretty cool. But hey, I need some customization tips to make my work flow better. You know, some basic tips everyone who&#x27;s new to Emacs would want to do. So far, I managed to change fonts, window size, foreground and background colors by adding a few commands to &quot;init.el&quot; file. Yeah, it&#x27;s looking better now. 
 But you know what would be even nicer? Using the mouse for basic cut and paste from the clipboard. Is there any way to do that, by the way? Also, can we get a command history by using the up-arrow key, especially when we are in the command line? Hmm...I wonder! Anyway, do you guys have a list of top &quot;5&quot; things which I could do to make Emacs more fun and easy to use? Would love it if you could share some tips and tricks with me!

 Thank you for your time. Any help will be genuinely appreciated..

                              <span>The idea of having and maintaining a Zettelkasten has become increasingly popular since the »Zettelkästen. Maschinen der Phantasie« exhibition at Marbach in March 2013 and the appearance of the website zettelkasten.de in late 2013 and has grown significantly with the Cambrian explosion of a variety of digital note taking tools since 2018.
But here’s a fun little historical linguistic puzzle:
What was the first use of the word Zettelkasten in a predominantly English language setting?
In my own notes/research the first occurrence I’ve been able to identify in an English language setting is on Manfred Kuehn’s blog in Taking note: Luhmann’s Zettelkasten on 2007-12-16. He’d just started his blog earlier that month.
Has anyone seen an earlier usage? Can you find one? Can you beat this December 2007 date or something close by a different author?
Google’s nGram Viewer doesn’t indicate any instances of it from 1800-2019 in its English search, though does provide a graph for German with peaks in the 1850s, 1892 (just after Ernst Bernheim’s Lehrbuch der Historischen Methode in 1889), 1912, 1925, and again in 1991.
Twitter search from 2006-2007 finds nothing and there are only two results in German both mentioning Luhmann.
My best guess for earlier versions of the appearance zettelkasten in English might stem from the work/publications of S. D. Goitein or Gotthard Deutsch, but I’ve yet to see anything there. 
For those who speak German, what might you posit as a motivating source for the rise of the word in the 1850s or any of the other later peaks?

                              <span>Hi everyone. I&#x27;m just a beginner and I know nobody would recommend me this, cause I&#x27;m just a student and although I code a lot (follow tutorials, books and tinker what&#x27;s taught, CC/CP), I don&#x27;t have any experience in programming (projects or work with some org or company), but its my 4th sem in college and I found an app idea (won&#x27;t share cause you guys will hate me for such a common sh*t, hehe jk) and at first and still, I&#x27;m following tutorials on flutter and side-by-side java for building mobile applications. I wonder if I could develop an application in Scala. What framework or library I would require, what should be the roadmap for a guy like me and literally any kinda tip, trick, help, advice would be very beneficiary. I personally love Scala (actually learning enough java for scala) and Dart (cause its too similar to scala (Supports OO and FP) but is very optimized for FE (its framework, flutter)) AFAIK. Please feel free to correct me where you get the opportunity, links to resources, articles or whatnot will also be very helpful. 
 TLDR; I need proper guidance in developing mobile application using Scala, consider me an overall beginner (never done a project, but code a lot) but a Scala lover. Please take time to write long answer cuase sometimes I&#x27;m dumb and I need longer explanations. 
 Thank you so much for helping.

                              <span>Is there anything wrong in using a YYMMDDTMMHHSS timestamp as an ID for an org heading? I go with the presumption that I do not create two headings at the same second, so the IDs will be unique.
 As you probably already know the default ID generated by org-id-get-create is a longer UUID but I would like something shorter and human readable.
 Also, having an ID for each main heading can cause performance issues in an Org file?
 I do not use the IDs for now but I will probably use them in the name of image files on the filesystem so I know which image belongs to which note. I want the IDs because I consider adding them a good practice. Even paper and digital databases have an ID for each of their records. I would add IDs to each separate bookmark or contact I capture and store in an Org file. Like so:

 This little package grew from a discussion here several days ago. It turns the builtin rectangle-mark-mode (C-x SPC, by default) into a convenient modal interface for all the usual C-x r * rectangle commands. It also binds useful builtin functionality that wasn&#x27;t exposed before, like whitespace deletion, and adds some new things, like shifting the selection rectangle left/right, and restoring the position of the last used rectangle.
 But the coolest feature is enabled by something I didn&#x27;t even know about before (thanks u/oantolin): calc (the emacs calculator) can operate on matrices. With a little translation help from SpeedRect, you can grab one or more columns of numerical data into calc, do all kinds of operations on it there (pretty much anything), and then, once you are happy, yank it back into the buffer, over the top of the rectangle selection.

 Captee in the macOS Share menu 
 This past February, I started building a macOS app to help me work with Org mode for Emacs. It lets you share links and content from another app (typically Safari) via the macOS Share menu and format it in Org markup. It can also support Markdown links so you can work with other editors too. The app is called Captee and the video link below demonstrates it at work.
 Captee alpha demo
 Note that Captee is very much in an alpha/proof-of-concept/bleeding-edge state of polish right now. You’ll get the best results for Captee if you use the macOS Yamamoto Mitsuharu port of Emacs. It supports Org Protocol out of the box, otherwise you will have to use the system clipboard to share content.
 To capture selected text via org-protocol you’ll need to define a capture template on the Emacs side first before you use Captee. Here’s an example capture template that uses the placeholders described in the Org capture protocol.
 (setq org-capture-templates &#x27;( (&quot;a&quot; &quot;Captee Capture&quot; entry (file+headline &quot;~/org/captee.org&quot; &quot;Captee Captures&quot;) &quot;* %:description\n%:annotation\n%i\n%?&quot; :empty-lines 1) )) 
 Okay with all that said, I’m looking for testers. If you’re interested, you can get an alpha build of Captee via this TestFlight link. Please provide feedback via the TestFlight app. Also, I highly recommend you do a deep-read of the release notes before installing or using Captee.

 I am a noob to emacs and a long-time Ach user(btw)!
 I mainly programme in python and need to get my head around how to have on the fly comments for errors in my code. Some of the info on the net seems old, like the need to install Melpa... Also, can&#x27;t seem to be able to install or maybe need flycheck (as flymake seems to do a fine job but not on the go)...
 Any advice?
 Thanks very much 😊

                              <span>The alpha FTP site has a second set of pre-test binaries for Emacs 29. 
 https://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/pretest/windows/emacs-29/?C&#x3D;M;O&#x3D;D
 The new (emacs-29.0.60_2) files install/contain/are for 29.0.60, which will become 29.1 once released. (At some point in-between we&#x27;ll most likey get get at 29.0.90, signaling that we&#x27;re getting pretty close to official release of the first Emacs 29 as stable.)
 Anyway, please note there&#x27;s a new deps (and deps-src) archive as the set of DLLs provided now includes libtree-sitter.dll and libsqlite3.dll. This version is also (the first) built with --with-tree-sitter. Here are more complete configure and make recipes:
 ./autogen.sh &amp;&amp; ./configure --with-modules \ --without-dbus \ --with-native-compilation \ --without-compress-install \ --with-tree-sitter \ CFLAGS&#x3D;-O2 \ &amp;&amp; make install -j 20 NATIVE_FULL_AOT&#x3D;1

                              <span>Is there a possible way to disable input temporarily from keyboard in Emacs, to prevent what that I most of the time mistype unintendedly from keyboard?
 In Zim, I bound the action &quot;toggle_editable&quot; to &quot;Ctrl+&#x60;&quot;, so each time before I switch to doing other stuff or other worskpaces, I press this keybinding to turn off edition in Zim, and when I come back, I press it again to turn it back. It prevents me from mistyping in Zim, and lately using Ctrl+z to revert the changes can be prevented, it&#x27;s quite annoying.

                              <span>Hi guys! Trying to use magit to create a single patch file from a range of commits --the contents of my feature branch. 
 I did this yesterday! So i know its possible, &amp; not rocket science. Yesterday I made a patch file like this, with a nice auto-generated file name.
 0001-Add-fubar-to-whizbang.patch
 When I try and use Magit today to do the same with a different range, I end up with either a) multiple patch files, or b) a prompt for a filename for the patch file to be produced. Which is a sign I&#x27;m on the wrong track, because I did NOT choose the above filename yesterday.
 Can you advise?
 Thank you!

                              <span>This may be obvious to some of you, but I came across this just today, so wanted to lay this out clearly in case it helps others.
 git log has a mechanism to trace evolution of lines across commits - think of this as an even more fine grained version of seeing log for a single file. This &quot;-L&quot; arg in git takes the form of -L,: to restrict to certain line numbers or -L:: to restrict to a particular function. Magit has the &quot;-L&quot; infix argument to use this directly - but this interface makes you do the manual work of feeding in the input.
 Instead, you can use the direct options available in magit-file-dispatch bound to C-c M-g by default. To trace functions, use the t command (trace) to trace the function under cursor. To trace particular lines - mark region and then call C-c M-g l to see the commit history only for those lines.
 This last command is basically (magit-log-buffer-file) which you can bind directly to something more easy to use. If you use evil, something like the following will make this much easier to use:
 (define-key evil-visual-state-map (kbd &quot;;gl&quot;) &#x27;magit-log-buffer-file)

                              <span>Hello! I just started using emacs 29 with treesitter. 
 I wanted to write a function that I could use to highlight keywords like TODO, FIXME etc. in code comments using treesitter. 
 I know there is a package &#x60;hl-todo&#x60; that I can just import. But the package contains a lot more than I actually need. 
 I also wanted to get familiar with emacs font-lock, font-faces and treesitter. But the documentation for the treesitter used by emacs seems a bit spotty. I&#x27;d be grateful if someone could point me in the right direction here. I would also be grateful if anyone could tell me if treesitter is actually a good fit for this or not.
 The high-level plan was to make a query to treesitter to get all &#x60;comment&#x60; nodes and then search the text in the nodes to see if there are any keywords that need to be highlighted (it would be great if there is a query that could just return those keywords, but I couldn&#x27;t find such a query). But I&#x27;m not quite sure how to proceed from there. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!

 This is probably a question that&#x27;s been asked before, but i thought i&#x27;d get some fresh opinions.
 ​
 If you were to build a new emacs-type repl/editor, what would you differently?
 ​
 For example, I wouldn&#x27;t mind a more feature rich approach to what can be displayed. Treating everything as text in buffers is great, but I would love to write and quickly pull out my pen to draw a graph. (This was inspired by the recent post on editor engines)
 ​
 Subtle improvements are cool, but i want to know what you would do to radically alter the paradigm of how you interact with emacs.
 ​
 Best,
 Skye

 If you are familiar with org-modern, this package approximates the block &quot;bracket&quot; style of that mode, but it works with org-indent. It can be used with or without org-modern.
 This new version is a complete rewrite, and uses font-locking instead of deep hacking of org-indent itself. This enables styling of &quot;bulk-indented&quot; blocks with extra indentation, e.g. inside nested lists, and works well with org-src-block-faces.

                              <span>Hi, I am trying to write a function which I plan to use for keybinding. I want to call project-other-window-command with the option D. &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; (defun project-dired-ow (sel) &quot;Do SEL in other window.&quot; (interactive &quot;C&quot;)
 (project-other-window-command sel)) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Then the keybinding will be (in general.el speak), something like:  &quot;D&quot; &#x27;(project-dired-ow :wk &quot;dired ow&quot;) 
 This, however, fails miserably :( I&#x27;ve tried lambda-based variations as well, but nothing seems to work. Been trying for almost an hour, and no dice. Any tips would be awesome, thank you !

                              <span>Hi folks, I&#x27;m starting to integrate more org-capture into my life as a Site Reliability Engineer. I&#x27;ve really struggled with creating a template that helps me with work during my on-call shifts and I was hoping anyone might have some examples they&#x27;d be willing to share with me.
 I&#x27;ve recently started using the org-clock feature and adding notes to the currently clocked task. That&#x27;s been a huge help for me in capturing my thoughts and notes when I&#x27;m trying to investigate an issue with my brain at half-capacity after being woken up at 3 in the morning from a page (smh at you mongodb...). However, I am still having trouble getting everything started and then at the end of my shift (they last a full week, or 7 days) I have a large list of items (rather than headings) that I need to basically r…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m rebuilding my doom/custom agenda, and I&#x27;ve discovered: agenda* works much better than agenda for me.
 But when I try to built it into a block agenda, it stops work.
  (setq org-agenda-custom-commands &#x27;((&quot;A&quot; &quot;Appointments&quot; agenda* &quot;&quot;) (&quot;B&quot; &quot;Appointments + todo&quot; ((agenda* &quot;&quot;) (alltodo &quot;&quot;))) (&quot;C&quot; &quot;Agenda + todo&quot; ((agenda &quot;&quot;) (alltodo &quot;&quot;))) )) 
 “A” and “C” works perfect, but “B” one produces
  Wrong type argument: number-or-marker-p, nil Debugger entered--Lisp error: (wrong-type-argument number-or-marker-p nil) org-agenda-list(nil nil t) #f(compiled-function () #)() funcall(#f(compiled-function () #)) (let nil (funcall &#x27;#f(compiled-function () #))) eval((let nil (funcall &#x27;#f(compiled-function () #)))) org-agenda-run-series(&quot;Appointments + todo&quot; (((agenda* &quot;&quot;) (alltodo &quot;&quot;)))) org-agenda(nil) funcall-interactively(org-agenda nil) call-interactively(org-agenda nil nil) command-execute(org-agenda) 
 I could emulate agenda* with the simple agenda and a couple of filters but why?

                              <span>According to the documentation, you can make the exported HTML foldable.
 However, when I tried adding 
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 +INFOJS_OPT: view:info toc:nil
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 I found that although the document exported indeed simulates info files, when I toggled views, I can&#x27;t fold headlines. However, folding is indeed possible in the documentation of org-info.
 In the org-info-src.js file, the portion intended to locate the content under a headline is
  var folder &#x3D; document.getElementById(&quot;text-&quot;+t.BASE_ID); 
 where t.BASE_ID is the id attribute of the exported HTML file, e.g. org16a9dc9.
 However, there is no element with the id text-org16a9dc9 - possibly due to some change in Org Mode exporting schemes since 2010, when the script was supposedly last updated.
 Therefore, a small modification is required to make folding possible.
 I fixed folding by changing the above line to: (pardon my poor JavaScript skills)
  var folder &#x3D; t.BASE_ID ? document.getElementById(&quot;outline-container-&quot; + t.BASE_ID).querySelector(&quot;div:nth-child(2)&quot;) : null;

                              <span>A fascinating combination of office furniture types in 1906! 

The Adjustable Table Company of Grand Rapids, Michigan manufactured a combination table for both telephones and index cards. It was designed as an accessory to be stood next to one&#x27;s desk to accommodate a telephone at the beginning of the telephone era and also served as storage for one&#x27;s card index.
Given the broad business-based use of the card index at the time and the newness of the telephone, this piece of furniture likely was not designed as an early proto-rolodex, though it certainly could have been (and very well may have likely been) used as such in practice.
I totally want one of these as a side table for my couch/reading chair for both storing index cards and as a writing surface while reading! Bonus points for wheels that allow it to travel around the house.

 When installing it Emacs returns me some errors regarding the native compiler.
 How can i solve the problems?

                              <span>I&#x27;m using emacs 28.1 on Ubuntu. 
 After a recent reboot, I can continue to launch emacs in daemon mode. But I can&#x27;t connect with the client. 
  
When I do &#x27;emacsclient -c file.txt&#x27;, I get this back: 
 emacsclient: can&#x27;t connect to /run/user/1000/emacs/server: Permission denied 
 emacsclient: No socket or alternate editor. Please use: 
 --socket-name 
 --server-file (or environment variable EMACS_SERVER_FILE) 
 --alternate-editor (or environment variable ALTERNATE_EDITOR)
  
I&#x27;ve also noticed that the response to the command &#x27;emacs --daemon&#x27; is different as well. 
 Before my reboot, entering that command would result in some output and then the prompt returning. At the moment the prompt does not return. 
 But emacs is definitely running. If I do &#x27;ps auxw | grep emacs&#x27; then I can see an emacs process. 
 What could be happening here? How do I get my emacs client/server back?

                              <span>I&#x27;m new to Emacs and Org Mode and I just feel I&#x27;m doing something wrong. I take notes in bullet form exclusively, as a stream of consciousness. Some bullets I want to mark as TODOs. But only headlines can be TODOs, so I switched from everything-bullets to everything-headlines.
 But it seems the Emacs defaults don&#x27;t expect me to have dozens of levels of headlines deep; I need to adjust things like &#x60;org-refile-targets&#x60; to look deeper than 9 levels, and exporting to HTML gives me a bunch of ugly headings instead of bulleted lists.
 It really feels like I&#x27;m supposed to be using bullets or paragraphs, but I can&#x27;t see how I can easily throw a TODO here or there in either of those formats.
 What am I doing wrong?

                              <span>From my point of view, both Doom and Lunarvim are really good. Now, there are really two major differences because I need to debug remotely.
 For Doom
 I launch in emacsclient through mobaXterm with server X. It is really good to have the GUI and to do copy/paste easily on Windows system. But debugging is difficult. I tried Dap mode with vscode-cpptool, gdb, also realgud-gdb. But it is painful with slowness. I don&#x27;t know if using another tool that mobaXterm as for example Kitty could solve this slowness debbuging issue. I could use emacs in terminal but I would have the same that follow with Lunarvim.
 For Lunarvim
 I can launch it directly with mobaXterm. It is fast and debugging is good and fast too(dap or termdug). But all copy/paste is painfull because it is needed to use particular shortcut of maboXterm and it is not window related.

 Now, if i do &#x60;C-h .&#x60; to get documentation at point, i get a blank minibuffer -- no actual documentation. has anybody seen this issue before? am i doing something wrong?

                              <span>My config is large and it pulls in, quite a few packages. With some packages, I wonder what parts of my config require those packages. So for debugging purposes, I figured, it would be useful to get dropped into the elisp debugger, when a certain package is loaded, required, etc..
 Question: Is there an (preferably easy) way to achieve that?
 An naive approach, early in my init.el, like:
  (defun my-drop-into-dbg-onto-require (feature &amp;optional filename noerror) (when (string-search (symbol-name &#x27;vimish-fold) (symbol-name feature)) (debug))) (advice-add &#x27;require :before #&#x27;my-drop-into-dbg-onto-require) (defun my-drop-into-dbg-onto-load (file &amp;optional noerror nomessage nosuffix must-suffix) (when (string-search &quot;vimish-fold&quot; file) (debug))) (advice-add &#x27;load :before #&#x27;my-drop-into-dbg-onto-load) 
 did not work out. 
 Notes: &quot;vimish-fold&quot; used in above code is just an example, I could have used another package name for this example. Also: bisecting my config can only be the very last resort.

                              <span>Hi! Hope you guys are fine.
 I am using neovim nowadays and want to try out Emacs. I tried Doom Emacs few months ago but I want vanilla experience and wants to build my own config. Would be grateful if you guys can share beginner friendly Emacs config as I learn by watching other people&#x27;s code and can&#x27;t focus on videos.

                              <span>Hello,
 I&#x27;m begin to using vterm for my daily work, but i have some questions about his behavior.
 When i want to copy some text, i&#x27;m ok to enter vterm-copy-mode , select , copy.
 But when i want to use the mouse to select, I don&#x27;t want to enter vterm-copy-mode with the keyboard before selecting with the mouse.
 ​
 Have you some ideas ? like maybe enter directly in copy-mode when i click for begin the selection ?
 Someone have some tips for configuration vterm to behave more like a normal terminal, or tmux behavior ?
 ​
 Thank you !

                              <span>Hey everyone, I&#x27;m wondering how to reimplement one of my yasnippet snippets in TempEL, but struggling with the following scenario (I didn&#x27;t find an issue, but don&#x27;t want to ping minad if I might just have overlooked or misunderstood it in the readme):
 In Haskell, I often write things of the form
 haskell newtype FooBar &#x3D; FooBar { unFooBar :: String } 
 In a snippet, I&#x27;d like to enter the FooBar once right after newtype and have it be the default value for the subsequent places. But I also want the 2nd and 3rd FooBar to be a &quot;stop&quot; where I can enter a different value.
 When using (s name) for the first, and name for the others, they get skipped. When using (s name) for the others as well, all three change simultaneously. So I tried using the form variants of (p ...), but to no avail.
 Here&#x27;s what I currently use, but it lacks the possibility to change locally:
 lisp (nt &quot;newtype &quot; (s name) &quot; &#x3D; &quot; name &quot; { un&quot; name &quot; :: &quot; p &quot; }&quot;) 
 Can you help me? [Ideally, I&#x27;d like to actually change the whole unFooBar in the third place, but that&#x27;s probably the same problem in disguise, just that the default value is calculated by a form.]

                              <span>Hey there,
 Does anyone know how to configure eyebrowse so that when a project is opened, the first &quot;window&quot; would be treemacz with a code buffer, while the next window layout would be two vterm frames split horizontally?
 ​
 An even better thing would be for the one vterm window to run &quot;rails s&quot; and the othe one to run &quot;npm start --prefix client&quot;
 ​
 I do this a ton for React and Rails projects so I figured I might make my life easier with this. Any help would be awesome.
 ​
 Thanks!

 Can anyone tell me how I can adjust a theme I am creating so that the grey face on line 27 in the mini-buffer, aka that grey background highlight color?
 Also, how do I adjust the related match colors within the mini buffer as well?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hello, Is it okay to add an ID attribute to all headlines such as contacts, notes, and bookmarks?
 contacts.org
 * Contact Name :PROPERTIES: :ID: 20230310T141204 :PHONE: :ADDRESS: etc.. :END: * Contact Name :PROPERTIES: :ID: 20230310T141506 :PHONE: :ADDRESS: etc.. :END: 
 bookmarks.org
 * [[http://a-link.com][Bookmark1]] :PROPERTIES: :ID: 20230310T231302 etc.. :END: 
 Also, notice that I am using a YYMMDDTHHMMSS timestamp for IDs, similar to what the Denote package uses in its file naming scheme. Is that OK for an ID? I know there is an org function to generate a random hash but I think a timestamp is more readable.

                              <span>I have been looking for a good way to get hand drawn images into my org notes. I use mermaid for generating some flowcharts/images, but sometimes there is no replacement for a physical drawing. The last thread I saw on this was from 2 years ago, and org-mark and org-krita were mentioned, and look good but both have limitations. I was wondering if anyone has made/found other packages to get a hand-drawn image work flow with org?

It has many features, including shuffling and playing categories of music; setting timers I can control; setting goals I can meet or fail on stream; controls via a one-handed keyboard I use like a Stream Deck (referred to in code as the &quot;MacroBoard&quot;, which is probably inaccurate); playing sounds and overlays when certain rewards are redeemed by viewers; and a lot more. https://bitbucket.org/Variadicism/variadassist-web-player
 But, this Haskell program commits what I know is a cardinal sin of Haskell: It has a bunch of mutable global state.
 I didn&#x27;t make that design decision lightly; I know that global mutable variables are revile…</span>

                              <span>Hi,
 I will write a small web application and I thought to learn a new thing is good :)
 So what is you advice for a web ui framework. Purescript-halogen/reflex/miso/ ?
 I have big experience with typescript + angular.
 The purescript-halogen seemed the best for me because I don&#x27;t want to struggle with the &#x27;nix, ghcjs&#x27; build/environment.
 What do you think ?

                              <span>When great speakers are banned from conferences just because they are uncomfortable it’s not good. People have different opinions about the future direction of Scala but it’s so infected. It’s better to be inclusive and allow people with different opinions. But I guess today’s cancel culture has won. But it hurts the Scala community especially when it really needs to show a good light. Java is becoming much better and heaps of developers are adopting Kotlin and TypeScript.
 Scala 3 is such a great language and it’s such a shame that things like this destroys the image of the Scala community.
 I work as a software architect and have great influence over technical choices. I take lots of factors in to consideration when technologies are chosen. Community is one of them. 
 Let people have different opinions and don’t cancel people just because you don’t agree with them. Try to set the bar high and don’t let feelings control you or your organisation.

 override val F: Functor[E &#x3D;&gt; *] &#x3D; EF 
 I can&#x27;t find any information online on what [E &#x3D;&gt; *] might mean, and how [E &#x3D;&gt; *] is valid for [F[_]]. It won&#x27;t compile when I try to do it myself.
 Anyone here happen to know?

                              <span>It&#x27;s Thursday, and here we go again. I&#x27;m telling you what I&#x27;m working on to inspire you to tell me what you worked on.
This week I practiced my onboarding of an idea spark into my ZK. For 6 of the ten new notes this week, I used the following workflow to get ideas for the stages they are at. Practice exposed a few gaps in my workflow, and I was able to correct them and practice more. The formatting and some of the housekeeping became automated and easy to complete making time for the fun of considering the idea&#x27;s connection.
This is not the only workflow I use, but the one I used several times this week. Books, PDFs, lectures, and YouTube videos are treated differently. Web articles sparked all six of these notes I&#x27;m describing.

                              <span>Topiary aims to be a universal formatter engine within the
Tree-sitter ecosystem. Named after the art of clipping or trimming
trees into fantastic shapes, it is designed for formatter authors and
formatter users:
Authors can create a formatter for a language without having to write
their own formatting engine, or even their own parser.
Users benefit from uniform, comparable code style, across multiple
languages, with the convenience of a single formatter
tool.
The core of Topiary is written in Rust, with declarative formatting
rules for bundled languages written in the Tree-sitter query
language. In this first release, we have
concentrated on formatting OCaml code, capitalising on the OCaml
expertise within the Topiary Team and our colleague, Nicolas Jeannerod.

 Hello guys I made a devicons theme for treemacs. This is inspired by nvim-web-devicons and vim-devicons. Here are some screenshots:
 treemacs-devicons in GUI
 treemacs-devicons in terminal
 Motivation: I have been using Emacs for years but I never really sit down and wrote any serious elisp code myself. This time things changed because I saw the nvim-web-devicons. I like trying various kinds of editors, and then I found this devicons from vim editor. I really like it especially because it works in the terminal. People always say Emacs is best within GUI but there are times when you have to edit something in a terminal and maybe some like me just like terminal aesthetics. I mean I really like this devicons theme from vim but I never really liked vim keybindings. I want it to be part of Emacs so bad so I finally decided to learn some elisp and make it happen.
 This is my first emacs package so please give it a try and provide some feedbacks!

 I want to change my LaTeX demarcation symbols from $$ $$ to [$$] [/$$]. This is to make my TeX cross-compatible with Anki.
 How can I do this?

 I use exwm and I&#x27;m able to switch between emacs specific buffers (emacs&#x27;s shell, text editing buffer, scratch buffer) using the keys in the photo, but once I switch to a firefox or a another non emacs application these specific keys lose that ability to switch buffer and instead manipulate the firefox application is my best guess.
 My question is how to I make it that these keys retain the functionality they have when focusing on emacs specific buffers so when I&#x27;m in a fire fox buffer I&#x27;m able to switch to another using these keys.
 ​
 Thanks!

                              <span>Dear community,
 who is willing to share their LaTeX setup with the rest of us so that we may get inspired?
 I am in the process of migrating to emacs but still cannot wrap my head around the correct setup for my LaTeX documents. I have been using LaTeX for years and would like to have full control over it while on the other hand profiting from the power of org-mode.
 So I decided to go with org-files for organising my projects (articles, books, worksheets, ...) and use blocks of LaTeX source code inside these documents that I then tangle to a TeX file and run luaLaTeX from the terminal on. While reading that, an emacs power user will probably turn pale, but that&#x27;s the way I do it for now since I am lacking a better alternative. So I am looking forward to your setups!
 As a beginner I resorted to (the for me very likable) DOOM Emacs with latex option (should include auctex and a sane company setup).

                              <span>Hi
 I am struggling with exporting org-mode file to LaTeX. Org-mode exporter is adding this line to the TeX file:
  \usepackage[notquote]{hanging} 
 resulting in the error:
 &#x60;&#x60; ! LaTeX Error: Filehanging.sty&#x27; not found.
 Type X to quit or  to proceed, or enter new name. (Default extension: sty)
 Enter file name: ! Emergency stop.  
 l.29 \begin {document}M No pages of output. Transcript written on ./inspecciones.log. Latexmk: Missing input file: &#x27;hanging.sty&#x27; from line &#x27;! LaTeX Error: File hanging.sty&#x27; not found.&#x27; Latexmk: Log file says no output from latex Latexmk: For rule &#x27;xelatex&#x27;, no output was made &#x60;&#x60;
 Any idea how to remove that line?
 I already try to redefine a class using: 
  [NO-DEFAULT-PACKAGES] [NO-PACKAGES] [NO-EXTRA] 
 But is not working. Any ideas?

                              <span>I have a sufficiently idiosyncratic use-case that I think it is not worth annoying the various maintainers, so I thought I would ask here:
 I primarily use rmarkdown/polymode for school; but increasingly find myself using it for bash/python/ielm/etc in a fashion I imagine advanced org-ob users would find quaint.
 In order to keep the various modes consistent, I bound shift-ret to all of the various shell-send variants, including &#x27;elpy-shell-send-statement-and-step for python blocks. Most of the time this works perfectly, but on a significant number of occasions the statement sent to the REPL breaks out and includes a significant portion of my markdown ramblings, other blocks, etc. This of course leads the python interpreter to question my sanity.
 My question: I assume the problem lies in one of the various regexps used to define a statement/codecell/line; but I have not figured how to trace what is happening and where it is going wrong. Does anyone here have suggestions for how I might best play with these interactions?

                              <span>I use the orderless style with consult/corfu mainly, but I get the feeling I have some suboptimal patterns habitualized.
 I thought it might be interesting to:
  
see the completion styles others find most effective and/or nicest to use
 see how other consult/orderless users may do completions differently
  
For instance, say you need to type provide. Three are a few options that immediately come to mind assuming orderless completion:
  
Just type it
 prov M-i RET
 ( p M-i r v RET
  
I guess you could say I&#x27;m curious to see what patterns others default to and where they just type something versus completing it.
 If I want to type propertized-buffer-identification for instance, I&#x27;d almost certainly use autocomplete with one of:
  
( p M-i buf i RET
 ( p M-i iden RET
  
Then I think and wonder &quot;wouldn&#x27;t flex be more convenient for this? So I switch to it and my first attempt is:
  
( pbident M-i RET
  
I guess most efficiency is dominated here not by selecting optimal strategies, but muscle memory and aligning your and your completion systems intuition... but I&#x27;m curious to see others examples and opinions!

The format is:  package-name  Version  I want to change to  sudo pacman -Sw package-name --noconfirm  I tried as stage one - multiple cursors and iy-go-to-char (to position the cursor in the space) and then C-k to delete to end of line, but it chokes and crashes emacs.
 Is there a better way?

                              <span>Hi All, I&#x27;m a long time user of the org-ref package for writing academic documents in org and exporting to PDF via LaTeX.
 I recently decided to try switching to more built-in options such as the new built-in org-cite syntax. I am using the package citar for this (yes, I know org-ref can also be changed to use the new built-in syntax). 
 But how do I handle cross-reference suggestions? i.e. referencing a Table or a Figure using \ref{} in LaTeX. Org Mode has support for linking to these but I would like a package that suggests items in the document I can link to using the Org link syntax.
 Org ref supports linking but using its own syntax and not the org-mode one. 
 I found the package oxr from the author of citar which does this but it does not seem to have active development.
 ​
 Any suggestions welcome!

                              <span>Hello there,
 Ive recently gone back to emacs and tried to actually learn it. At first i was using doom emacs, i made a config for it, alls good. Then i tried to open up a project and start coding and i ran into all kinds of issues ranging from lsp not initializing to tab indentation being 2 spaces insted of 4 in half of the modes and completions not heaving any relevant suggestions. So then i switched to spacemacs because i thaught that it had better support for rust and was better integrated. Turns out it was a similar story, completions sucked lsp half of the time didnt initialize and i had to explicitly enable it with M-x lsp every time i opened a project. 
 Its now the third day that im just tinkering with emacs and i didn&#x27;t solve any of the issues listed above.
 Is emacs just bad developer experiance? Am i missing something? Am i just dumb and its a simple solution?
 I want to love emacs, but its making it real hard to do it.
 note: the lsp issue i could maybe live with, but the completions and indentation issues are really bad. A specific case when the completions are the worst at is for example somstructvar. or when importing (rust example use somemod::), the indentation is bad mainly in js/ts (rjsx) and json

 ​
 In the settings of mc I could not find anything related to that. Can someone help?

                              <span>I&#x27;m a beginner with the whole hover/auto-complete while writing code. Let&#x27;s say I want both the hover listing possible auto-complete and the information about the function to appear for elisp, both in, e.g., *scratch* and especially in org-mode babel elisp code blocks. I&#x27;ve found various init setups (like this one) and I think I have it working in just a scratch buffer, but how can I get it to work in an org babel code block of elisp code?

                              <span>[RESOLVED]
 Finally switched to vanilla from doom-emacs, in order to try out meow.
 Most of my immediate needs are sorted out, but still working on it. I am trying to get away from needing a project source-tree sidebar, but there are some scenarios where I am really missing it.
 I tried installing treemacs, but it doesn&#x27;t show up in my &#x27;package-install&#x27; list. Am I making some kind of trivial mistake, or is this a case where I would have to manually install the script?
 EDIT: resolved by ensuring that the melpa repo was added.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been using Org-Mode for 10 years. The more time passes, the more Org-Mode takes an important place in my digital world.
 Now I would like to start using zettelkasten to manage a subset of my org files, a subset related to knowledge self-acquisition.
 The issue that I have is that there are many options to do that, and I wasn&#x27;t able to find a benchmark.
 What would be your opinion on these options?
 Here is a first draft of a benchmark (to be updated):
 - DBI : Database indexation
 - SD : Availability of sub directories
 - NSO : Notes stored as org files
 - Speed when searching for notes : from @ (slowest) to @@@@@ (fastest)
 ​
  
 Package name DBI ASD SAO speed 
  
 denote no yes yes @@@@@ 
  org-roam yes    
  zk no    
  ekg yes  no  
  org-zettelkasten no

                              <span>I just watched a terrific video on FP in Scala and why it&#x27;s important. It echoes exactly what I was seeing in languages like ML, OCaML, and Haskell in the 1990s, what I hoped for procedural languages, and what Scala has become on the FP side.
 What did Functional Programming ever do for us software engineers? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;glDudJ3fqLk time: 00:52:26
 I think this video helps explain significant differences between some of the popular languages and why there has been a trend toward FP-type language capabilities and it distinguishes very well between those a typical programmer might want to use and where to leave off from those a library writer might need.
 He uses Scala for examples throughout, so it&#x27;s very familiar. My only complaint is that the sound volume is too low. For anyone wondering why we need FP features or what key language features allow us to do, this is a great introduction.

                              <span>Is there any way I can get (at runtime) a type tree (fields names and singatures) of defined (and possibly nested) entities like classes, traits, enums etc? The important part is that I want to establish the tree based on a definition of the type, not its concrete objects.

                              <span>I am not new to Haskell, but I found myself today torn between putting &#x60;get&#x60; in front of a function vs not doing it, and was hoping for some advice.
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; defaultDbUser :: String defaultDbUser &#x3D; &quot;defUser&quot;
 getDbName :: String -&gt; String getDbName appName &#x3D; appName  &quot;-db&quot; &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Here I didn&#x27;t put get in front of defaultDbUser, because it is not a function but a value, and that feels ok.
 For the second function, getDbName, I put get in front because it takes some inputs and then returns &quot;db name&quot;.
 This is where I am not sure if this is correct move. I am tempted to call it just dbName :: String -&gt; String, because get feels Java-ish. But, from experience, if I go with just dbName, I later get into trouble, for example when I want to call the function and store its value, something like let dbName &#x3D; getDbName appName, I would have a very hard time figuring out a name for that binding if I called the function dbName and not getDbName.
 So it feels like getDbName is reasonable, but then again, I can&#x27;t say I am fond of it very much -&gt; I don&#x27;t have a better idea though.
 What would you do in this case? Would you use dbName or getDbName? If not, why not? Would you maybe put something else?
 Btw, I do put verbs in general, but with most of the other verbs it is clear they should go there, beacuse you are doing some parsing, calculating, migrating, ... . But with get it somehow feels a bit tedious.
 Thanks!

                              <span>I&#x27;m learning Haskell, coming from the APL family. I&#x27;m familiar with point-free style and function composition and wanted to learn Haskell for a more pure functional experience.
 To get some practice i figured I&#x27;d write up the dot product and vector product functions. I haven&#x27;t begun looking at the vector product, but for dot product I quickly came to
 dot a b &#x3D; sum $ zipWith (*) a b 
 After toying around with composition (the B-combinator .), I couldn&#x27;t get it to work. I looked up the tacit solution in pointfree.io, and it gave me the short and sweet
 dot &#x3D; (sum .) . zipWith (*) 
 Now here&#x27;s my question: how is (sum .) supposed to work? I don&#x27;t get where the arguments implicitly go or how this makes syntactically sense. What is the order of operations?

 Huge thanks to u/angerman for making it possible!
 You can download the APK here: https://github.com/simplex-chat/simplex-chat/releases/tag/v4.5.3 (simplex_armv7a_experimental.apk)
 It should support Android 8+/API 26+ (the currently released version supports Android 10+/API 29+), but we only tested on 9 so far - so please let us know if you try it on 8, and also about any issues you experience.
 We did fix several limitations of lower android versions we could find, and we could not find any 32bit CPU-specific issues.
 It&#x27;s reasonable to expect bugs, but unless we hit some roadblocks it should be fully available in the next release this month!

 I like frameworks like nest.js in node.js where engineers are used to the framework.
 Is there a modern framework in Scala that is as binding as nest?
 And which is the most modern framework to begin with?

                              <span>Hello there,
 Another maybe rookie question but I am looking for having error from lsp positionned in the current buffer.
 I am using again whatever emacs + lsp + rust-analyzer, and it seems that the error decoration is not as verbose as it is in VSCode.
 I uploaded 3 images with context that should explain more what I am expected to get. Example are really simple but I face similar things elsewhere ...
 Expected behavior (VSCode)
 Not enough dude! Please tell me more (Emacs)
 Working behavior on some error (Emacs)
 Thanks again people!

                              <span>Is there some emacs function out there already that will bring me to the line a variable is declared on? For example: 
  void fooFunc(void) { int foo; ... ... x &#x3D; foo+1; // with cursor over foo, I would like to go to the previous int foo; line. } 
 I&#x27;m interested in using this for c code. I&#x27;m currently using GNU global which lets me do a symbol search, but, that&#x27;s not quite good enough.

                              <span>I&#x27;m new to emacs so please be kind. When I&#x27;m editing a file (for example a cpp file) and I want to access to a terminal, I enable eshell-mode but the problem is that is opens eshell in the current buffer, mixes the shell output with my file and makes the buffer unusable. So if I want to edit the file again, I have to close the buffer, then find the file again. And when I execute eshell-mode again to disable it, it has no effect as it looks like it opens another shell in the eshell. Also when I press C-d, it terminates the shell but it doesn&#x27;t return to my file. Js there a way to disable eshell mode so I don&#x27;t have to kill my buffer and open the file again? And how can I open eshell in a new buffer by default?

Philosophy papers often include a lot of specialise language and long, difficult-to-spell terms, which have to be typed out a lot. It would be great if I could add abbrevs for these terms, but such that they would only take effect in buffers visiting files relative to each paper -- so I want to setup file-local or dir-local abbrevs.
 I can&#x27;t find a way to do this though. Any ideas?

 Hello, everyone!
 Been new to emacs, have struggled to initially use it, one thing I missed alot from vim editors is hopping/jumping support. Options like avy &amp; ace-jump-mode didn&#x27;t seem very appealing due to various reasons written in the project readme itself. Hence I started writing my own plugin taking inspiration from hop.nvim and avy.el. And here we are!
 Note that there are still a few nitpicks mentioned at the bottom of the readme. Therefore, if anyone wishes to make improvements, including addressing those nitpicks or elsewhere (I&#x27;m new to elisp, so may not have written the most optimal script), they are more than welcome to do so.
 Thank you!

 I want to start from scratch and can&#x27;t find the command associated with C-x, it is a keymap? I know how to create a sparse keymap but how can I keybind it?
 I&#x27;d like to write my own elisp code for stuff I need starting with the bare minimum.

                              <span>So i&#x27;ve been using LunarVim for a few months now and the experience has been pretty good so far, but someone suggested trying emacs. Some features are pretty interesting but what really caught my eye was the org mode. So, do you think it&#x27;s worth a try or should i just search for a simular plugin in neovim?

                              <span>Hey there,
 I am adding kanban style notes to a web dev project I am working on, but am wondering if the following is possible:
  
Is it possible to somehow generate an Org mode table that lists all of the tasks in a given subheading with their task state as the column header for a given Kanban board swim lane?
  
Ex:
  
I have the following Org Mode headings present 
 Backlog
 In Progress
 In Review
 Completed
 
 With this in mind, I want to be able to do that when I move tasks between these 4 headings, they would show up under a related ASCII table hyperlinked to the task itself so that it looks in a similar fashion to how Jira tickets on a Kanban board would look like
  
Thanks!

                              <span>Hello there,
 Does anyone have an Emacs config that they could share that allows for IDE-like indentation on the fly, kind of like how VS Code handles projects with the following formats:
  
JSX
 Typescript
 React
 Angular
 Vanilla JS
  
​
 I don&#x27;t want to have to save the file every time I want this (aka I do NOT want to use Prettier). 
 I want this to just happen like it does in VS Code where indentation of code happens on the fly and correctly marks just a few spots for syntax errors.
 In the past, every time I have tried to configure Emacs for indentation, it messes up the whole file to cause a jenky mess of badly indented web dev type code, when it should only really be concerned with the current block you&#x27;re editing etc.
 Thanks!

                              <span>haskell-scope-highlighting.nvim is a Neovim plugin that does syntax highlighting for Haskell, which provides useful information about the variable scope.
 The original idea is from prof. Douglas Crockford, that he wants syntax highlighting to provide contextual information in functional programming. This idea has been expanded to provide dynamic highlighting under the cursor&#x27;s scope in Haskell.

                              <span>For the past months, I&#x27;ve been chasing down mysterious memory leaks in some of our services. But the graphs have baffled me a little bit (https://i.imgur.com/YguM1GA.png). And I have a few questions. 
 This particular service is compiled with GHC 8.6.5 (old, I know, but we have a large codebase we need to upgrade). It is an API service that deals with Postgres (using Opaleye), Redis (using Hedis) and serves data on a Servant based Wai/Warp HTTP server. The service is quite busy, serving in the range thousands of requests per minute (conservative). 
 The pattern of memory use looks very odd to me: it hovers around 10-20% for several days, and then it jumps to 60%+ percent. The service still doesn&#x27;t completely crash, but it seems to me that the memory use spikes out of nowhere and fails to fall. There are sudden falls, but that is due to AWS starting multiple instances of the service (auto-scaling). 
 The memory spikes also seem to occur on identical traffic patterns. 
 My questions here are:
  
Does this look like a memory leak? I&#x27;ve read previously that GC is not very &quot;eager&quot; unless tuned.
 If it does, what are the best ways to catch these early? These are quite problemmatic, obviously, and I&#x27;ve been hunting around for weeks without any success. 
 I have tried profiling to investigate leaks earlier, but in this case, I&#x27;ve been unable to reproduce the issue locally or on our staging environment.

 I believe it would be nice to have that coloring, that it would make it easier to read docs -&gt; any suggestions on where to look in order to add this? I am guessing some kind of contribution is needed somewhere to get that working? Is this something that could be done relatively easily, or is there a technical reason why it is difficult?
 EDIT: I think I was a bit quick to ask, as I think I have found a relevant issue on Haddock, I am guessing this is at the core of it: https://github.com/haskell/haddock/issues/742 , so I ended up asking a question there. I will leave this thread open though in case there might be some interesting discussion.

                              <span>Dear all,
 I&#x27;m happy to announce the release of Dunai 0.10.1 and Bearriver 0.14.1!
 Dunai is a reactive programming library structured around a notion of Monadic Stream Functions. Dunai can be used to implement other reactive and FRP frameworks on top, including Classic FRP and Arrowized FRP variants.
 Dunai comes with:
  
bearriver: API-compatible implementation of Yampa. (The Bear River is a tributary to the Yampa river.)
 dunai-test: QuickCheck-based temporal testing library that can be connected with the testing system haskell-titan.
  
See https://github.com/ivanperez-keera/dunai#features for details on Dunai&#x27;s features.
 This new release introduces a breaking change in Monadic Stream Functions&#x27; instance of VectorSpaces. Most code using that instance should work without changes but, i…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;ve noticed that many packages and libraries developed for emacs ar stored entirely in one huge file. For example I was just checking out the mpc source code and found out that it is a 2000+ lines file.
 Is this a normal and accepted practice? I&#x27;ve never coded professionally in lisp based languages, but from my experience I always try to make my files no more than 100 or 200 lines long at most. Otheriwise it gets hard to navigate the code in my opinion.
 Maybe in elisp this isn&#x27;t as bad of a practice? Are there ways in emacs that can help work with long files that I&#x27;m not aware of?

                              <span>Hello there,
 Back again to use Emacs to do some Rust with LSP and I find myself not enjoying at all some part.
 One thing I so much dislike is the way completion is working.
 I am using spacemacs: vim mode, evil blabla, auto-complete &amp; LSP
 And yes you have completion if you add some letters but I cannot see a way to trigger the famous popup of completion listing all possible function without typing a letter ... so unfortunately on complicated code I have to delete letter and add other.
 What a mess! In VSCode I would do Ctrl+Spc for triggering the popup. But here I really do not know how to achieve that, mostly also that I am at this stage in Edit mode.
 I am not expecting this to be rocket science but reading the doc I do not see how to achieve such feature.

                              <span>Hi all, with all the talk about tree-sitter in Emacs 29, I decided to give it a try. With everything set up, I can confirm that I&#x27;m running c++-ts-mode when I open a cc file. However, my previous indentations like c-basic-offset set via c-mode-common-hook are not being honored. How do I control the indentation when c++-ts-mode is enabled? Thanks.

                              <span>Inspired by the recent repeat-map discussions (thanks u/karthink), I immediately noticed that rectangle-mark-mode (C-x SPC) was the perfect target for single-key quick bindings. Why? Any time I explicitly activate rectangle-mark-mode, I do so only to call one of the various *-rectangle-* commands next. So why should I remember/type their prefixes? And what&#x27;s more, I can see that I have this mode active by the region shape &amp; left border.
 Repeat wasn&#x27;t the right approach, but it was simple to activate a transient map in rectangle-mark-mode-hook. Check this tiny gist. So C-x SPC, highlight your desired rectangle, then [k]ill [d]elete del-[] [c]lear [o]pen s[t]ring [w]-copy [y]ank [N]umber. I didn&#x27;t even know about the (unbound) command delete-whitespace-rectangle, but will use it often now that I don&#x27;t have to bind/remember it.
 The only thing I wish for is the ability to recall the region of the last marked rectangle (line+col; from, to), for when you&#x27;d like to do a series of rect operations in a row on the same columns.

                              <span>Hey y&#x27;all. Overnight my header spacing in org-mode changed. It used to look single-spaced, but now it&#x27;s got extra space between headings. My setq-default line-spacing has been set to 2 for a while now. Changing it doesn&#x27;t seem to affect this new behavior. On a new M1 Macbook Pro.

                              <span>Hi! In my dev work I have need to regularly create a handful of named shells, and then within each shell-buffer, I need to run a bash script.
 For example one of my shells has the buffer name of *myco-back-end-server*. In this shell I always run a script to start the server.
 How can I get the shell in *myco-back-end-server* buffer to run the bash script to start the server automatically? I mean, I want to write an interactive elisp function that looks something like this
 (defun my/start-development-session ()
 ( interactive )
 ( shell *myco-back-end-server* )
 ( ;; run bash script here to start the back-end server )
 ( shell *myco-front-end* )
 ( ;; run bash script to start front end )
 ( .. )
 ( etc )
 ​
 )
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hi all, is if there is some transcription of the Haskell docs into the Emacs Info format, so I can look at the them offline and within Emacs? Or honestly, any tips and resources on taking on the process of converting them myself if they exist in some other format, as I&#x27;d be happy to put in some work to that conversion and make the docs available via GitHub for others.

                              <span>I am on NixOS, and here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve been using for my vanity Haskell projects:
 $ cat default.nix { nixpkgs ? import  {}, compiler ? &quot;ghc924&quot; }: nixpkgs.pkgs.haskell.packages.${compiler}.callCabal2nix &quot;advent&quot; (./.) {} $ cat shell.nix { nixpkgs ? import  {} }: (import ./default.nix { inherit nixpkgs; }).env $ nix-shell $ cabal build ... etc ... 
 Note that ghc924 and the advent package name are wired in. Is there a better way?
 Also note that I am not a NixOS guru, I just enjoy the feeling that I understand the state of my system via /etc/nix/configuration.nix.

                              <span>Dear Haskell community:
 I wrote a blogpost about Monads to help Elm developers understand Haskell a little better and hopefully increase their desire to learn more Haskell.
 https://flaviocorpa.com/haskell-for-elm-developers-giving-names-to-stuff-part-3-monads.html
 Please, constructive feedback is always welcome, but have in mind that the goal is to drive more Elm developers into the warm hug of the Haskell language!

                              <span>Im currently looking for a job, and got pretty far along eith a company that uses purely Scala for their backend (even though I&#x27;m not experienced with it at all). Im seeing that Scala is loosing popularity and my question is - is it a good idea to work there, with the option of becoming a niche developer that is experienced with an unpopular lang, or should i progress with other companies that use more familiar languages such as node, python etc...?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hey all,
 When I kill buffers, I often get the message from the title. But when I diff-buffer-with-file, I often get Diff finished (no differences).
 What gives? This is super annoying if I&#x27;m closing a long-running session with numerous unsaved buffers. 
 I don&#x27;t want to just save everything without prompting, because sometimes I type accidental changes into a buffer or two. But manually checking these false positives is a pain in the ass. 
 Has anyone else dealt with/solved this? If the current buffer contents at the time of closing matches the file on disk, I don&#x27;t want to be prompted.

 when I copy a text from a ui application and paste to the emacs&#x27;s scratch I got the &#x27;UnicodeText&#x27; instead of the copied text ...
 Do you know why it is ? How I can set it up the emacs to solve this problem ?
 thanks in advance :)

 When I use multiple-cursors, the &quot;fake&quot; cursors are shifting the text to the right:

 Has anybody figure out how to tell multiple-cursors to use the same cursor style as the default?

                              <span>For a fiction project I am working on I have been reading into parapsychology and branches of what I would consider pseudoscience. In digging into this work, I&#x27;ve found read some fascinating stuff from people who strongly believe in and/or participate in this kind of research. Their first-hand testimony is going to be valuable for some of the world-building and plot development I want to do in my speculative fiction.
Now, I want to track this information in my zettelkasten. But I also feel some small anxiety that I&#x27;ll be &quot;polluting&quot; my notes with some of this stuff. I&#x27;m curious about how others who do this kind of research handle materials that would not be the kind of thing you&#x27;d espouse yourself, but something you want to keep a record of for some other purpose.
Second: do you keep biographical information in your zettelkasten? In this same case, I&#x27;ve encountered a few recurring names that I would like to track. While my novel&#x27;s not going to be based whole cloth on any of these figures, I am drawing some inspiration from real life programs and work and events. My initial thought is to create a structure note related to the individual that I might put a smattering of biographical information in that can then spin off into some specifics about their life and work that matters to me. But again, curious about how others have handled this.</span>

                              <span>My journey to eMacs and orgmode started from Notion and Obsidian, so pardon my analogies.

 My requirement: I journal every day and note down my interactions with people and entities in my journal. I also maintain a ‘people.org’ file for all my contacts. I want the note about a person, John Doe, that I wrote in my journal to also appear in people.org under John Doe.

                              <span>Hi,
 Would you pay for a yearly license for an Emacs distro preloaded with things such as Magit, lsp-mode, etc? Basically, a good out of the box IDE experience. The majority (80%?) of the proceeds could be donated to the devs of the packages. Basically, a nice value add that also benefits our package devs.

                              <span>I have trying out writing in org mode and exporting it as latex following this guide.
 I wrote the following org file to test it out and exported it to latex:
 ITLE: Org Latex Test #+SUBTITLE: /Straightforward Emacs/ #+AUTHOR: Jack #+SETUPFILE: ~/.emacs.d/jake-latex-standard.org * First Heading :noexport: Hello this is a test sample * Second headings This is another header with code block #+begin_src python print(&quot;hello world&quot;) print(&quot;This is a code block&quot;) #+end_src #+CAPTION: This is a Table | Name | id | Age | | Peter | 1234 | 50 | | Sue | 4321 | 54 | | | | | * Third Headings 
 But the code block in the pdf looks messy and I was wondering how I can properly format the code block in org mode so that when it gets exported to latex it looks professional?

                              <span>I know emacs has much better autocomplete (e.g. yasnippets) than Overleaf. However, I&#x27;ve found that simply defining new commands in overleaf goes a long way and provides similar benefits to using snippets. Also, org mode has the option to render LaTeX directly inside the editor instead of having one screen for the editor and another for the rendered output. I guess the bullet point features of org mode are also pretty cool. However, despite all of these cool features, I find when I use emacs I end up wasting a lot of time researching how to do stuff. In practice I find simply writing things up in Overleaf to be a lot faster. Does emacs eventually get faster if you&#x27;re good enough at it?

I was editing a tex document and when I pressed &#x27; followed by M-1 (because I wanted to wrap the previous word in a \mathrm{}), i got that error. I had not made any changes to any .el files, I was just editing my tex document as usual. My fingers may have spazzed out like they sometimes do when trying to input a complicated keychord, but it is weird that all of a sudden this is not working. Does anyone have any idea what to do? I restarted emacs but that does not solve the problem, and neither does re-evaluating the cdlatex.el file.

                              <span>Hi all, I&#x27;ve released ekg version 0.2. Why it feels like just yesterday I was release ekg version 0.1, and in fact it wasn&#x27;t that long ago.
 ekg is a note taking application for emacs that stores all data in sqlite, is very tag-oriented, and designed to be easy to extend.
 The changes for version 0.2 are:
  
Added hooks ekg-add-schema-hook, ekg-note-pre-save-hook, ekg-note-save-hook, ekg-note-delete-hook, and ekg-note-add-tag-hook to enable customization.
 New commands ekg-show-notes-latest-captured, &#x3D;kg-show-notes-latest-modified, for showing notes created or modified recently.
 Introduced variable ekg-notes-size to control the default page size for limited views such as ekg-show-notes-latest-captured.
 Added templating.
 Added embedding as an optional add-on, to enable note similarity and note search; requires an account at OpenAI or similar embedding provider.
 Added new function ekg-active-notes to easily get all non-trashed notes.
 Improved ability to have note list buffers that have flexible titles and operation, notably improving the ekg-show-notes-in-trash command.
 Standardized buffer names for ekg-notes-mode buffers, which all are prepended with &quot;ekg&quot; and surrounded by asterisks, to denote that they are non-file-based.
 Added documentation in texinfo, viewable via M-x info.
 Fixed bug interfering with completion at the beginning of the tag property line.
  
For details, watch the demo of 0.2 changes. I think the templating is done via a unique way that shows off the power of ekg, and embedding stuff is advanced, super useful, and virtually no other note app in any system has it. On the other hand, the embeddings costs a very small amount of money and has unfortunate privacy implications. I think it&#x27;s well worth it, and I hope that you enjoy this update.

                              <span>Hear me out here. Before you downvote me, I&#x27;m not advocating that any functional changes be made to Emacs regarding car and cdr. I&#x27;ve looked up a brief history of the terms and their origins. They have their uses and should be neither removed nor renamed.
 However, as someone who&#x27;s only recently learned about these terms, Emacs&#x27; self-documentation for these terms was not helpful at all to me. I saw the function being used in existing Elisp and thought, &quot;What&#x27;s car and cdr?&quot; So I looked it up inside Emacs, and it told me that car returned the car of LIST. Wow... super helpful...
 I&#x27;d offer to submit a pull request to update the documentation if the source code wasn&#x27;t managed via email, but it is. So, I&#x27;m just putting my opinion out here where someone else who contributes might read this. &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; car is a function defined in C source code.
 Signature (car LIST)
 Documentation Return the car of LIST. If LIST is nil, return nil.
 Error if LIST is not nil and not a cons cell. See also car-safe.
 See Info node (elisp)Cons Cells for a discussion of related basic Lisp concepts such as car, cdr, cons cell and list.
 Other relevant functions are documented in the list group.   cdr is a function defined in C source code.
 Signature (cdr LIST)
 Documentation Return the cdr of LIST. If LIST is nil, return nil.
 Error if LIST is not nil and not a cons cell. See also cdr-safe.
 See Info node (elisp)Cons Cells for a discussion of related basic Lisp concepts such as cdr, car, cons cell and list.

                              <span>Looking for advice anyone might have. In my day-to-day, I work with the VueJS framework. For those who aren&#x27;t familiar, a VueJS single-file-component looks, for all intents and purposes, like an HTML file. You can view an example of what a Vue SFC file looks like here.. A  tag for the JS or TS code, a  tag for any component-specific styles, and a  tag wrapping the actual markup. Aside from some additional syntax in the  itself, Vue files are very similar to HTML files. However, getting good indentation, syntax highlighting, and LSP behavior can be...trying.
 In the past, I&#x27;ve used web-mode for highlighting and indentation and been mostly happy, although it can sometimes be hard to properly configure indentation, auto-closing tag conflicts, etc. Ther…</span>

                              <span>MacOS provides a native progress bar in Applescripts, which is extremely useful for displaying the progress of long-running processes. I can see the benefit of incorporating this feature into longer Elisp processes as well. However, controlling the progress bar natively requires the use of Applescripts, which can be difficult without the official IDE. As Emacs users, we naturally desire an Emacs Lisp binding. 
 I would greatly appreciate any guidance on how to create bindings for the described functionality (elisp  shell  applescript). Thank you very much!

                              <span>What are the secrets to high performance Haskell? I&#x27;ve met people who claim that Haskell code should perform around 5-10x slower than C, Tikhon Jelvis says that mildly optimized Haskell can perform around 3x C in time, kuribas claims that Haskell should perform at least at 50% of C, an acquaintance can get Haskell to half of Rust&#x27;s performance, and there&#x27;s libraries like Attoparsec and Streamly that claim 80-90% of C performance. And of course, there&#x27;s Don Stewart.
 ​
 What&#x27;s the secret to getting high performance Haskell? Are the ultra-fast libraries concurrency scams (i.e, C is single-threaded, Haskell is parallel)? Or are the ultra-fast libraries actually as fast as they claim, and that it&#x27;s possible to get Haskell to near-C speeds? 
 Because I love Haskell as a fun toying-around language, given how concise the language (and functional style) can be. Especially when you have defections to the Rust camp, keeping Haskell performant is a worthy goal, and I guess high-performance Haskell is joked about as &quot;only if you&#x27;re Don Stewart&quot; or &quot;dark magic, summoned by sacrificing puppies and kittens&quot;.
 ​
 Any tips, links, advice to get ultra-high-performance Haskell, other than, perhaps, inline-C? ;)

                              <span>Managing of todo lists has always been a pain in the ass for me.
 I tried evernote, but it depends on an account, it&#x27;s centralized and proprietary
 I tried discord, but besides other points, it doesn&#x27;t have UI needed for proper task management
 I heard about orgmode. I hang out in r/emacs and whenever someone asks &quot;why not vim/vscode/etc.&quot;, besides other points it&#x27;s orgmode. So I&#x27;ve been tempted to try it out. And I don&#x27;t regret
 My setup is neovim with orgmode plugin on laptop, orgzly on phone, syncthing to sync and git to back up.
 Works well so far!

                              <span>Ever since I started using emacs I have always had a problem with figuring out how to determine the cause of error. When I am programming in python or c++, the debug message is helpful as it points out what line the issue is on and why it occurred. However with emacs, when there is something wrong with my init.el file, I have run emacs with debug-init and the error message looks messy and difficult to interpret. What is the best practice or steps or tutorials on how to debug large files of elisp code or emacs errors?

                              <span>So I can’t seem to find an answer for this. Does anyone know if there’s something out there for string-rectangle (C-x r t), but for yanking text with the same number of lines without moving other lines? That probably didn’t make much sense. Say I have:
 a c e g i 
 And I have:
 b d f 
 I want to be able to use one copy and one paste to achieve this:
 a b c d e f g i 
 Basically if I have 5 lines of text in my kill ring, I want to use string-rectangle at the end of a different set of 5 lines and paste the 5 lines from my kill ring directly alongside without moving any of the other lines around. I hope this mess makes sense to somebody.

                              <span>Recently switch to Vertico, consult and friends, and as I have spotify in the background all day, I could use a way to control it from emacs. I&#x27;ve seen consult-spotify on MELPA, however no specific instructions are provided. I&#x27;ve set the client ID and Secret for the account, but running consult-spotify-find-track returns 0 candidates. It doesn&#x27;t work. Has anyone got this package working?
 ​
 Also espotify.el complains of nonexisting dbus service file for spotify, while Spotify DBus is clearly functional and I can use it from the command line. 
 It would be nice to have Spotify controls with vertico fuzzy search.

                              <span>I’ve been using emacs for 40 years, no kidding, and my .emacs has developed a lot of entropy. I’ve been using vscode but my fingers cry out for their old familiar chords. I’d like to declare .emacs bankruptcy and redo it, but I want to get the new stuff like completion without also getting vi-like behavior.
 Can anyone recommend a starting point for a new .emacs ?

 I want to install EIN package in spacemacs, I install normally from package-install, but whenever I close the program spacemacs doesn&#x27;t recognize it when using (require &#x27;ein) , is there any configurations I must use to download a package that is not associated with a layer ?

 Sadly, it seems it has been build without tree-sitter support: ‘ ■ Warning (treesit): Cannot activate tree-sitter, because tree-sitter library is not compiled with EMacs’

 I understand that Emacs has TRAMP which allows working on a remote host via SSH. However, other editors are now offering better support for working with Cloud Development Environments, and there hasn&#x27;t been much discussion about this in the Emacs community. So, I&#x27;m curious if anyone has used Emacs with Gitpod or GitHub codespaces and how they set it up.
 Thanks.

                              <span>Hello everyone, I want to share a new package keepass-cli-rs I wrote recently (well actually, it&#x27;s last December).
 The URL for the repo is https://github.com/fuyu0425/keepass-cli-rs
 I am aware of previous keepass packages like the following, but that does not fit my need.
  
keepass-mode
 keepass.el
  
Some highlight for this new package:
  
based on hydra, so you can quickly switch entries
 use completing-read purely, so you can use your current completion engine.
 ICON!!! which is very important to me to find the entry I want.
 You can find some screenshots in the repo.
  
Some restriction:
  
It&#x27;s read-only (you cannot edit the database) and only tested by me now.
  
You can only build from source now (it&#x27;s not on crate.io and Melpa now) because I want some initial feedback!

 My thought would be emacs21. basic is also fast but seems to me that it might be slower. flex seems the slowest to me out of all the default ones.

                              <span>FYI I do have several learning disability and memory deficits so I know the road will be a challenging one especially with these key bindings.
 How do I save the configuration in order for it to take effect at startup because I thought everything was supposed to save into the .emacs,d folder. but its all just going to the home directory. I &#x27;d like to use org mode for taking notes for all my classes, is it preferred to just keep the notes under one file or is it a best practice to create different files for each subject?
 Is there a way to automatically save .org or config files in the same folder? I&#x27;m new to CS and we&#x27;ll be starting on python but I have no prior programming experience and I&#x27;ve gone over the navigation and watched several tutorials such as Systems Crafters and a few others, read Emacs Wiki, Org website Emacs reference and all the references under getting started for the last two weeks. Is it best to start out vanilla or should I go spacemacs or take copy a different theme. The default white background is blinding me.

 It&#x27;s excellent for understanding the roots and means by which certain languages came into the world and why they are imperative or OOP and/or FP.
 I think we identify an underlying theory of programming when someone starts to build the tool to do that kind of programming. Naturally there will be a lot of overlap with other languages which are also tackling similar tasks. Richard Feldman, in the video, describes a lot of that in a very clear and entertaining way.
 Scala&#x27;s place in this lineage and facing those issues
 The Scala community has to tackle those same issues. For example, what is the programing paradigm, what is the name of it, and what are the techniques &amp; parts…</span>

 I have been interested in learning Scala for a long time, so this might be a good opportunity to do that. With that being said, I would like to ask your opinion about whether or not Scala would be viable programming language to build a BFF?

                              <span>I&#x27;d like to announce Codd. 
 Codd is a tool that applies plain postgres SQL migrations atomically (when postgres allows it) and enforces schema consistency checks to ensure different environments have the same schema. It also helps by providing meaningful merge conflicts for when e.g. different developers modify the same DB objects, among other interesting features. Please check its GitHub for what it can do! 
 We&#x27;ve been using codd at PRODA for some months (though we&#x27;ve been using parts of it for far longer in a transition and test period) to apply our migrations, run schema consistency checks and manage our multiple environments&#x27; databases, from dev to staging, production and tests. I&#x27;d like to thank my friends at PRODA for their support and feedback all this time: it has been invaluable. 
 Now I find it&#x27;s time to release codd to a broader audience, and thought of this community because it&#x27;s written in Haskell. 
 I hope the documentation on GitHub explains reasonably how codd works and its nuances. I&#x27;m open to questions and feedback of all kinds here as well!

                              <span>I&#x27;m doing my masters in CS, and it won&#x27;t be long until I finish. It&#x27;s right now shy to 3 a.m. and I&#x27;ve been losing sleep recently about what I&#x27;ll do after graduating. To put it mildly, Haskell was everything that I used in the past 4 years. I&#x27;d say I&#x27;m in an intermediate level in utilizing Haskell. I did my bachelor thesis using Haskell, and doing my master thesis using Haskell again. I also had student jobs in which I taught and programmed using Haskell and Scala.
 I&#x27;m starting to ask myself what I&#x27;ll do after graduating. Do I look for a Haskell job? (I&#x27;m based in Germany, and everything I&#x27;m finding is requiring to already have many years of experiences in the field which I don&#x27;t have, and I also found other jobs in cyber security which are related to Functional programming but I have no expertise in that and they always ask for people with experience). This means I can&#x27;t help but to wonder what I will be doing for living.
 Do I ignore Haskell and fp in general for now? Which other it-jobs could be suitable for someone with my modest expertise? Which other languages should I concentrate at instead? Which IT-jobs should I keep an eye on if Haskell jobs are not within reach? Should I try to find a job in cyber security since many cyber security jobs ask for Haskell developers? Does anyone have a personal experience with my dilemma or any advice on what I must do next? Are there some special platforms for fp programmers who are looking for jobs? I feel right now like a child in the body of a grown-up.

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently trying out org-cite with a BibTeX bibliography, but I&#x27;m having trouble figuring out how to have URLs in my citations. I&#x27;ve tried both the url (which apparently is non-standard?) and note parameters in my BibTeX citation, but neither do anything. I&#x27;ve been referring to these two blog posts. I&#x27;ve never used BibTeX before and I&#x27;m quite new to Org mode and Emacs, so I might be missing something.
 Also, is it possible to have numbered citations?
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I am terribly sorry I am writing a second post today, but org mode changed my life since i am doing my GTD.
 In the years there was a lot of interest to move mindmap format to org mode and the other way around, i have an idea that could represent a solution to that. 
 Although I do not have LISP knowledge at the moment and for this idea is necessary an advanced knowledge because is about to KNOW the org code flow directly( not creating a third part project), so I would like to share the idea as a feature to consider for the most advanced devs. 
 Actually the good news would be that would be a really gradual work, with every minimal improvement bringing a lot of satisfaction to the org users, from day 1, without all the cons of the dedicated projects that already exist.
 In fact I know ther…</span>

                              <span>I am using tags as links so that i can navigate in a row of a file that i need really fast.
 The problem is that if i use it like that:
 ​
  
** my head :myTag: 
 *** subHead1 
 **** subsubhead1 
 **** subsubhead2 
 //(a lot of sub heads 
 **** subsubhead1000 
 *** subHead2 
 *** subHead3 
 then when will run a myTag research I will have all the 1000 subsubhead items, this is not good I guess 
 Is this the &quot;right&quot; approach one should follow? Basically i could mark some sub tags in the children and then refine my research? 
 It would be possible to custom in the headers #+ of the file on top the level of nested tags that have to consider? In this way I would have a tag for the subHead but not for the subsubHead(the children of a subHead)

 If I had a little visual indicator in the margin, to remind me what the thing was I&#x27;m looking at, it would help a lot.
 Is there a way to make such an indicator and move it around easily? I&#x27;m not terribly interested in learning elisp just now. Maybe when the kids are grown up...
 [EDIT] Actually, it might not be critical for it to be visible. I might be able to use setting and swapping mark and point, except that that creates a region - which is an unwanted side effect for what I am trying to do.
 [EDIT] replaced mark with indicator to avoid confusion.

Do you have ideas for tags? I currently have #team #antipattern #work #leadership
Is &quot;open-ended question&quot; what I hope it is? &quot;Closed question&quot; would be sth. that you can answer with yes, no, 100; an &quot;open-ended question&quot; would be sth to just talk about. Fits the Wikipedia definition, but is it really without end?
Early on, there&#x27;s this paragraph:

  
What remains is that you are not taking up the ball yourself. Someone else is supposed to pick it up, then add something to &quot;the discussion&quot; (or rather: start it), and then throw the ball back.

                              <span>For Mac, we usually recommend BibDesk here. It&#x27;s free, open source, and works really well overall.  It even comes with library research tools with templates for e.g. PubMed, but which also worked with our local university library. Also supports export templates to quickly copy and paste in your favorite Markdown flavor.
For (some) Linux systems, there&#x27;s an open source app targeting GTK/GNOME that was shared in my interweb circles recently:

https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/citations/
It looks very minimalistic. Some scripting/automation features would be useful to more quickly generate (Markdown-compatible) citations.

https://github.com/microsoft/wslg/issues/614

 That being noted, seeing Tux for every Linux application installed via WSL2 sucks.

 Here&#x27;s the workaround I used, posting here for anyone else for future reference:

 Related Workflow Notes:
  
I found the related icon here: 
 https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:EmacsIcon.svg
 
 More specifically, I used the &#x27;48x48 pixel&#x27; version here: 
 https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/EmacsIcon.svg/48px-EmacsIcon.svg.png
 
 I then downloaded it via just using Firefox in Windows as &#x27;EmacsIcon.png&#x27;.
 I then copied and pasted it to the &#x27;Linux &gt; Ubuntu-22.04 &gt; usr &gt; share &gt; icons&#x27; folder (This directory is &#x27;\wsl.localhost\Ubuntu-22.04\usr\share\icons&#x27; in File Explorer on Windows 10)
 The resulting file with path was the following 
 &#x27;/usr/share/icons/EmacsIcon.png&#x27;
 
 I then edited the &#x27;/usr/local/share/applications/emacs.desktop&#x27; file to include the following changes:

I have not seen any other configs that handle spelling and grammar like doom does.
 Most of the rest of the config I want to be more wholly my own.

 Is there a way to configure ox-beamer to render the easydraw images when generating the pdf?

 I am trying to do a (long) series of similar (not identical) text replacements over multiple files. 
 I will explain to you my specific issue because I think it will be more efficient than trying to generalize it from the start. Hopefully it will create a picture that can then be easily generalized, with a possibile solution ending up being useful for many different people. 
 I made some university (engineering) notes in .org format, in which I include a latex header using this:

When pressing c -S (my gpg key) c I get the following error which seems that I have well...the wrong keymap. This is confusing as my config is essentially barebone. I am at my wits ends on this issue.
  1 git --no-pager --literal-pathspecs -c core.preloadindex\&#x3D;true -c log.showSignature\&#x3D;false -c color.ui\&#x3D;false -c color.diff\&#x3D;false commit -- hint: Waiting for your editor to close the file... Waiting for Emacs... *ERROR*: Wrong type argument: keymapp, nil
 I can create a commit in the shell no problem and it will ask for my passphrase. I can push no problem with magit, just can&#x27;t commit and I believe its due to gpg.
 My gpg-agent.conf:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 #Do not ask me about entered passwords for 24h (during the same session)
 default-cache-ttl 86400 max-cache-ttl 86400
 pinentry-program /usr/bin/pinentry-tty allow-loopback-entry
 #Allow pinentry in Emacs minibuffer (combined with epg-pinentry-mode)
 allow-loopback-pinentry allow-emacs-pinentry&#x60;&#x60;&#x60; 
 Thanks for any help.

                              <span>Hi all!
 I often find myself in writing Elisp with a &quot;data-flow&quot; mindset, meaning &quot;this data should be processed like this, then like this, then like this&quot;. I could use some piping techniques, but what if I then need to reuse a partial result? Should I recompute everything? Of course not, let* to the rescue!
 Except that let* syntax is a bit too verbose, I&#x27;d like to have something similar to Rust&#x27;s let. Well, here&#x27;s my attempt, help yourselves:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; (defmacro rust-let (&amp;rest body) &quot;Allow to have a let Rust-like syntax in BODY.&quot;
 (cond ((not body) &#x27;()) ((atom body) body) ((listp body) (let ((current-form (car body))) (cond ((not current-form) current-form) ((atom current-form) current-form) ((listp current-form) (if (eq (car current-form) &#x27;rlet) (let ((,(cadr current-form) ,(caddr current-form))) (rust-let ,@(cdr body))) (progn ,current-form (rust-let ,@(cdr body))))) )))))  This allows to turn  (rust-let (rlet a-partial-result (some-func some-data)) (rlet another-partial-result (another-func a-partial-result)) (process-func another-partial-result) ;; but I want to return a-partial-result)  into  (let ((a-partial-result (some-func some-data))) (let ((another-partial-result (another-func a-partial-result))) (progn (process-func another-partial-result) a-partial-result))) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; Any suggestion is greatly appreciated!

My query is this one: is it possible to see the changes I have done to my document from a particular day and time, irrespective of saving / closing the file? It would be something like a highlight-changes-mode but lasting more than one session. Thank you!

                              <span>I can’t be the only developer who gets annoyed when emacs kills past &#x3D;, + or even new lines. However I was unable to find a package that does that.
 Also another very common task is to change part of a name written in camel or snake case. Both killing and navigating fast to the point where I want to kill would be great!
 However similar questions in stack overflow and the net often get shot down with “just code it yourself”. I probably will, but was just wondering if other people would like that itch scratched or know a canonical solution that’s already available (package)?

                              <span>How do I get out of text-mode? I was in eshell and wanted to scroll up (I don&#x27;t use a GUI, only emacs via terminal) and copy some text to paste elsewhere. I did M-x text-mode and it let me scroll up and copy text.
 ​
 However, i have no idea how to get back to the other mode (what&#x27;s the other mode even called)? I&#x27;ve looked at the entire eshell documentation and found not a single thing.
 ​
 https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/eshell.html#:~:text&#x3D;Eshell%20is%20a%20shell%2Dlike,those%20requested%20by%20the%20user.
 ​
 Further, I&#x27;d like to bind these mode to keys, but I first need to know what they&#x27;re even called...

                              <span>Something is odd in my settings because my emacs is now adding 4 spaces when ever I start a new line. This happens in most modes: text, fundamental, markdown, java, etc. I cannot find a variable which seems to control this. I&#x27;ve restarted several times so it is somewhere in my .emacs file (I think).
 I&#x27;m using emacs 28.2 (9.0) on an M1 Mac running Ventura 13.2. 
 What should I look for? This started happening about 1 to 2 weeks ago.

                              <span>Dear Zettelnauts,
I started a new book Weinberg On Writing: The Fieldstone Method and it is terrific. Funny, and it contains many insights. Weinberg&#x27;s &#x27;fieldstone method dovetails nicely with the zettelkasten method.&#x27; Before my time here on the forums, @ctietze mentioned Weinberg back in Feb of 2018 - Writing with the Zettelkasten is like building a fieldstone wall and Gerald Weinberg was brought up again by @chrisaldrich back in October - Review of “On Intellectual Craftsmanship” (1952) by C. Wright Mills, I&#x27;m slow on the uptake. Still, if you keep pounding away, I&#x27;ll finally get it.
Please tell me about your past week and what you are working on.

                              <span>Hello! I’ve started making an openBSD library for haskell. The idea was to add pledge and unveil, maybe also a single function for privilege dropping.
 But I’m very new to openBSD and haven’t actually written any software for it yet…
 So, for anyone who does, what would you like to see in the library?

                              <span>I would like to introduce the second release of Iris — a Haskell CLI framework that supports CLI Guidelines.
  
https://github.com/chshersh/iris
  
There were lots of changes since the initial release last year, so now would be a perfect time to try Iris!
 The most significant improvements are:
  
A complete tutorial about writing CLI apps in Haskell with Iris
 Lots of Haddock improvements
 Automatic detection of terminal colouring support
  
 See CHANGELOG for more details.
  
​
 I created Iris with the initial goal to provide mentorship to beginners in Haskell, FP, and Open-Source. And, as you can notice, most of the improvements were made by outside contributors. If you would like to contribute something to Iris, check out beginner-friendly issues!
 It takes a lot of effort and patience to help others, but in the end, I hope my guidance was helpful to them 🤗
 P.S. To add a few more positive news, today is also my 29th birthday 🥳🎂 Your best gift to me would be to support my Haskell Open-Source work via GitHub Sponsorship. Or you can just star Iris on GitHub, and this would encourage me to continue doing more Haskell OSS!

 I just recently found out that one can&#x27;t have something like this in servant:
 UVerb &#x27;PATCH &#x27;[JSON] &#x27;[ WithStatus 200 Foo, WithStatus 500 ErrorA, WithStatus 500 ErrorB] 
 Which confused me at first because the docs mentions this:
  
A variant of Verb that can have any of a number of response values and status codes.
  
This led me to believe that this was possible, but it seems to be limited to one per status code. Since eventually, all servant seems to care about is the status code, not exactly including the response body itself. The above becomes
 &#x27;[200, 500, 500] 
 Which GHC tells me about because genericServeT expects this list to be unique; any duplicate status code will fail regardless of the varying response bodies. 
 While I do understand that doesn&#x27;t make much s…</span>

                              <span>Hi all, I&#x27;m very happy to announce &quot;FP Web Conf&quot; - a series of talks and in person events covering topics related to Functional Programming and Web Development (both frontend and backend). The event is being organised by HasGeek, JSFoo, and Functional Programming India. Attendance is completely free for both remote and in-person events.
 The first talk will have George James talk about how Juspay used PureScript to implement a cross platform UI framework - https://hasgeek.com/jsfoo/fp-webconf/sub/use-purescript-and-build-your-own-ui-framework-TjroLrqjuZG8LCHk9XWo5U. Please register on the page to receive the meeting invite.
 We are also accepting proposals for talks and case studies! If you or your company has evaluated or adopted Haskell or any other functional programming technology in production, please consider submitting a talk proposal, and share your insights with the community. Tales of adventure with introducing Haskell into an existing codebase, or building Haskell capabilities within teams are especially welcome!

                              <span>I&#x27;m not even a beginner in Scala but recently it came to my attention the possibility to apply formal methods (preconditions and postconditions) in Scala. Do you guys use the Design by contract very often? Is this something useful on a production environment? If yes, what tips or references would give me?
 This is just an example I&#x27;ve written testing the preconditions and postconditions feature. Still, all these checks may throw an exception and it&#x27;s necessary to wrap then on a try-catch block wich would make the code less elegant, are there any solution to this? *If this feature is really useful.
 @main def run() &#x3D; print(decryptedToken(&quot;hsjj&quot;)) case class Token(userName: String, userEmail: String, userPermission: userPermission) type userPermission &#x3D; String def decryptedToken(token: String): Token &#x3D; require(decryptToken(token) !&#x3D; null) require(checkPermission(decryptToken(token).userPermission)) Token(decryptToken(token).userName, decryptToken(token).userEmail, decryptToken(token).userPermission) .ensuring(_.userEmail &#x3D;&#x3D; &quot;Email&quot;) def decryptToken(token: String): Token &#x3D; // Will decrypt token Token(&quot;Name&quot;, &quot;Email&quot;, &quot;Permission&quot;) def checkPermission(permission: userPermission): Boolean &#x3D; if permission &#x3D;&#x3D; &quot;Permission&quot; then return true return false

                              <span>I hired a company called Softobiz (through UpWork) to work on my website, and they were going fine until the hit my backend, which is written in Scala.
 They wrote to me today: 
  
Sorry for the delay, Team has a less experience in Scala tech. We are trying to setup and make it work and also we have aligned the recruitment team to hire the resource with the same expertise.
  
Which basically translated to - they need to hire a Scala dev before they can continue working on my website.
 If anyone is interested, then you can help me by working for them....
 Their Upwork profile is: https://www.upwork.com/agencies/~01edb0e09d72122edd/
 And their website is: https://softobiz.com/
 Personally, there may be a possibility for me to hire a Scala dev directly, but it&#x27;s not that straightforward since I am not very proficient in code, and my original dev who wrote the backend in Scala has flaked off (for the most part), leaving me trying to figure out how to proceed. That&#x27;s why I went to an agency rather than hiring directly. The original dev is still around per se, but it takes a week to extract any information from him. Albeit 50% of the info needed is document on Confluence.
 Nevertheless, thought I&#x27;d post if anyone was interested.
 Thanks.

                              <span>Hello,
 In the online tutorials I see examples of people scheduling tasks for particular days, and then the agenda view gives a great overview of tasks for the week.
 The question: What do you do if the day arrives and you are not able to complete many of the items? For me, this is _usually_ the case: either I am hit with an unexpected task at work, or I over-estimate how much I can do in a day.
 Specifically, do you delete the items and create new ones on the next day? Or change their date somehow? It seems like a lot of work to have to re-schedule tasks each day.
 ​
 ​
 Recently I asked this question about setting up an org/todo workflow that does _not_ use dates.
 https://www.reddit.com/r/orgmode/comments/1163k17/first_time_org_todo_user_fit_it_to_me_or_vice/
 The answer provided worked, but it would need some work to setup an agenda view, and I am wondering if I am just missing the right way to think about org.

                              <span>I&#x27;d like for org-agenda&#x27;s log view to show tasks that have been either clocked or closed. In the case that a task has been both clocked and closed, I&#x27;d like to only see the clock entry. Does anyone know how to achieve that?
 Currently
 I have the log view in my agenda set up to show both closed and clocked tasks by way of (setq org-agenda-log-mode-items &#x27;(closed clock state)). When a task is both clocked and closed, I&#x27;ll see something like this:
 13:30-14:38 Clocked: (1:08) DONE Read a book 14:00...... ---------------- 14:38...... Closed: DONE Read a book 
 I want to suppress the second entry.
 Fumblings
 I think I want something that behaves like org-agenda-skip-deadline-if-done, i.e. org-agenda-skip-done-if-clocked, but that doesn&#x27;t exist.
 I&#x27;m not sure how to do it with a custom org-agenda-skip-function either, because whether I want to skip it depends on whether it&#x27;s been shown already, and I don&#x27;t think that information is available.
 I thought about using org-agenda-finalize-hook but that seems like it would be hard and probably the wrong way to do it.

 ​
 I&#x27;ve seen both Krita-mode and Xournalpp-mode but both seem overkill for what i want to achieve: in particular, I dislike the fact that in Krita you have to specify width and height for the picture you want to create. Xournalpp, on the other hand, is more suited to make complete notes in A4 format, rather than quick sketches. 
 ​
 I&#x27;d like something that is more like a Whiteboard and is possible to embed in emacs with no issue, in whatever size it takes to occupy my sketches. Does anyone here uses something similar?

 I used both alternatively because I think it is become better on the other side.
 There is always the easy vscode but not with full vim keybinding.
 I decided to share my personal comparaison. 
 Here, I share my point of view. 
 Why I prefer DOOM
  
 LSP (clangd, there the % progression of DB, I know that it is ongoing)
  GUI mode
  Call tree (available natively for C++)
  copy/paste (more easy because of the GUI)
  grep (ripgrep is better integrated for me, no plugin to add)
  find file (the same with fd)
  server mode (emacsclient)
  git (magit)
  Docker (included by default)
  Bookmark (easy to use by default)
  Org mode
  Fold (evil is working well by default)
  installation on windows
  
why I prefer Lunarvim
  
 Comment (simple  shortcut)
  Treesitter (by default first)
  DAP debug (better integrated even in terminal)
  Terminal mode (expected for…)
  C-i/C-o navigation
  Explorateur (nvimtree)
  project (more easy to mksession)

  git lens
  search &amp; replace(inccommand&#x3D;split)
  undo (as I want by default)
  configuration (more easy with lua)
  escape key (I can use ’ù’)

Do you have a similar behavior from one to another ? why ?

 ​
 ​
 (custom-set-variables &#x27;(eldoc-documentation-strategy &#x27;ignore) &#x27;(eldoc-idle-delay 0.1) &#x27;(eldoc-minor-mode-string &quot; nil&quot;) &#x27;(global-eldoc-mode nil) )

 but that doesnt help. Any other ideas? Ideally, I would only like to have errors displayed there upon point over a red squiggly line

                              <span>By default, when I add a tag with C-x C-q to an item, the tag is added to the end of heading/item:
 C-x C-q tag
 * Item :tag: 
 I want it to show at the beginning, like this:
 * :tag: Item 
 Because sometimes I have long headings, and the tags get misaligned or in a different line of the item (if visual-line-mode is on). So, I thought that having the tags at the beginning of the item would make the document more organized, since my tags are usually shorter and about the same size.
 Is there a way I could do that? Suggestions are welcome.

This has lifted my spirits quite a bit. I was starting to think that it might not be feasible anymore to continue on my current path. It was also a bit overwhelming, thus my late response.
 It all began on Sunday, when I realized I was likely to loose many sponsors, due to GitHub&#x27;s decision to stop accepting donations made through PayPal. I quickly send an update to existing sponsors urging them to update their payment method, which got &quot;leaked&quot; in parts.
 My post contained an appeal to also encourage other users to contribute, so the leak is perfectly okay with me. I wasn&#x27;t really expecting it to be posted verbatim, but had I wanted to prevent…</span>

                              <span>on my keyboard it is easy to make the mistake of hitting M-[0-9] instead of s-[0-9] when trying to invoke winum-select-window-[0-9] which, if called with a numeric argument from hitting m- instead of s-, results in closing the frame – a very unproductive anti-result.
 I would like to highlight the status area (this is the same area that displays C-u 135 when entering numerical args to anything) when entering numeric arguments so that it is more obvious that is what I am doing. Can this highlighting be easily done? It&#x27;s hard to investigate the face settings of the status bar.

                              <span>Today I wanted to calculate some costs in an org buffer. I heard that calc was powerful and convenient but found it unintuitive when I tried it the last time.
 I gave it a second chance today and had fun using it, entering formulas in the org-mode buffer then marking them with a region and letting calc evaluate the formulas and pasting it back into the buffer. But I needed too many key presses to do this really comfortably, so I made something for the next time, which should be more fun:
 ​
 (global-set-key (kbd &quot;C-c c&quot;) &#x27;calc-insert-result-with-equal-sign) (defun calc-insert-result-with-equal-sign (this-prefix-arg) &quot;Evaluate the expression in the active region using &#x60;calc&#x60;, insert an equal sign and the result.&quot; (interactive &quot;p&quot;) (calc-fix-notation 2) (if current-prefix-arg (calc-fix-notation this-prefix-arg)) (let ((expression (buffer-substring-no-properties (region-beginning) (region-end)))) (if (string-empty-p (string-trim expression)) (message &quot;Region is empty.&quot;) (let ((result (calc-eval expression))) (goto-char (max (region-beginning) (region-end))) (insert &quot; &#x3D; &quot;) (insert result) (deactivate-mark))))) 
 ​
 Mark a formula in any buffer, press C-c c to insert &quot; &#x3D; result&quot; to the right of the region. This will insert the result with 2 digits after the decimal-point. If called with C-u number C-c c it will insert the result with the specified Number of digits after the decimal point.

                              <span>A common task I have when refactoring some code is to search for an occurrence of some text in the codebase and then look at or update the code at that point. For example, I might want to check every use of a certain library is being used in a thread-safe manner.
 So I search for this string - e.g. using consult-git-grep - and I get a list of results. I go to the first result, then do my thing. Now I want to go to the second item in the search and I have to search again.
 Emacs of course makes this as painless as possible since I can do M-p to yoink the previous search term, but it&#x27;s still a bit inconvenient to have to search again multiple times. I also lose my place in the search list.
 I was wondering if there was a better way of doing this. E.g. is there a way of telling the minibuffer to stay open, so if I search for something I can go through the list methodically?
 Or maybe there&#x27;s a package that handles this nicely, or is there a better way of using the tools?

                              <span>Hello guys :) 
 I&#x27;m trying to make dev env for programming with typescript
 I used &#x60;tide&#x60; and &#x60;flycheck&#x60;.
 To get popup window when my cursor hovers error part, I also installed &#x60; flycheck-pos-tip&#x60;.
 I was able to get popup window; however, I am only able to config its background, foreground color.
 ​
 popup with error message
 Even if I enlarge text in buffer by using &#x60;cmd-+&#x60; only text in buffer gets larger but text in popup stays in same size.
 Which config should I touch to get bigger error message?
 Thanks for reading

 Is this possible to achieve this somehow?

                              <span>I am trying to build an AST using tree-sitter and I found related nodes which seemingly has what I need. 
 Edit: I am basically redoing this since I made some progress but am getting unexpected results.
 Here is a function that I believe should be getting the parent type, starting/ending position and the parent node. That being said, my output isn&#x27;t actually giving me the parent node. My output is 
 Parent node:#, type: modifiers, start: 46, end: 59
  (defun testing/AST-parent () &quot;Return parent node of the tree-sitter node at point.&quot; (interactive) (setq get-parent (tsc-get-parent (tree-sitter-node-at-pos (thing-at-point &#x27;symbol)))) (if get-parent (progn (setq parent-type (tsc-node-type get-parent)) (setq parent-start (tsc-node-start-position get-parent)) (setq parent-end (tsc-node-end-position get-parent)) (message &quot;Parent node:%s, type: %s, start: %s, end: %s&quot; get-parent parent-type parent-start parent-end)) (message &quot;No parent node&quot;))) 
 Edit 2: Solved it! Below is the code that will get the parent node of the node under the cursor. If anyone more knowledgeable on tree-sitter has a better idea to solve this then I&#x27;m all ears, but for now this is what I got: 
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; (defun testing/AST-parent () &quot;Return parent node of the tree-sitter node at point.&quot; (interactive) (let ((node (tree-sitter-node-at-pos))) (if node (message &quot;%s&quot; (tsc-node-type (tsc-get-parent (tsc-get-parent node)))) (message &quot;No parent node at point&quot;))))

                              <span>XFTP is a new file transfer protocol focussed on meta-data protection - it is based on the same principles as SimpleX Messaging Protocol used in SimpleX Chat messenger:
  
asynchronous file delivery - the sender does not need to be online for file to be received, it is stored on XFTP relays for a limited time (currently, it is 48 hours) or until deleted by the sender.
 padded e2e encryption of file content.
 content padding and fixed size chunks sent via different XFTP relays, assembled back into the original file by the receiving client.
 efficient sending to multiple recipients (the file needs to be uploaded only once).
 no identifiers or ciphertext in common between sent and received relay traffic, same as for messages delivered by SMP relays.
 protection of sender IP address from the recipients.
  
You can download XFTP CLI (Linux) to send files via the command line here - you need the file named xftp-ubuntu-20_04-x86-64, rename it to xftp.
 Send the file in 3 steps:
  
to send: xftp send filename.ext
 to share: pass the generated file description(s) to the recipient(s) via any secure channel, e.g. via SimpleX Chat.
 to receive: xftp recv rcvN.xftp
  
Please let us know what you think, what downsides you see to this approach, and any ideas you have about how it can be improved.
 We are currently integrating the support of XFTP protocol into SimpleX Chat that will allow sending videos and large files seamlessly and without the sender being online - it is coming soon!

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently rereading the book &quot;Get Programming with Haskell&quot; and in chapter 4.2 on page 40-42 is an example use case for first class functions: 
 sfOffice name &#x3D; if lastName  nyOffice &quot;sf&quot; -&gt; sfOffice &quot;reno&quot; -&gt; renoOffice _ -&gt; (\name -&gt; (fst name) ++ &quot; &quot; ++ (snd name)) addressLetter name location &#x3D; locationFunction name where locationFunction &#x3D; getLocationFunction location &gt;&gt; addressLetter (&quot;Bob&quot;,&quot;Smith&quot;) &quot;ny&quot; &quot;Bob Smith: PO Box 789 - New York, NY, 10013&quot; 
 The author then writes the following:
  
Now that you’ve separated each function needed for generating addresses, you can easily add new rules as they come in from each office.
  
While I&#x27;m understanding the code itself, I have problems to apply what the author has written.
 Where would you add new rules? Would you write a new rule function and pass it down to the nyOffice for example? This approach doesn&#x27;t seem to scale well if you add several rules.

                              <span>https://hackage.haskell.org/package/sorting-network repo: https://github.com/Javran/sorting-network (PRs are welcome!)
 I have this idea of using TH to turn sorting network into partial sort functions for small lists (2 - 16 elements) for a while. Not many resources turn up with I searched Haskell topics on this so I got my hands dirty. I&#x27;m happy with the performance (see some benchmark output below) with my proof-of-concept code, so I decided to turn this into a package (apologies that I didn&#x27;t spend much work on documenting, in my defense I&#x27;m quite excited to share it - expect quality to improve in future releases).
 To use this, import Data.SortingNetwork to bring into scope functions like sortList4By :: (a -&gt; a -&gt; Ordering) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [a] (partial function) and sortTup4By :: (a -&gt; a -&gt; Ordering) -&gt; (a, a, a, a) -&gt; (a, a, a, a) (supporting list / tuple of 2 - 16 elements, but TH module is exported so you can generate more).
 To explain how it works, the implementation took some inspiration from https://doisinkidney.com/posts/2018-05-06-sorting-small.html. For a input size 3, a sorting network (more specifically, my package uses https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batcher_odd%E2%80%93even_mergesort - I&#x27;ll try to try to have optimal network and other varieties in future releases) would compare and conditionally swap a-b, a-c, b-c in that order (I&#x27;m kinda relying on optimization to figure out data dependencies and take advantage of parallelism). And the TH generates function like below (name shadowing is intentional for demostration, although in code I do ensure that all new variables are fresh):
 sortTup3By &#x3D; \cmp (a, b, c) -&gt; let sw &#x3D; \u v f -&gt; if cmp u v &#x3D;&#x3D; GT then f v u else f u v in sw a b \a b -&gt; sw a c \a c -&gt; sw b c \b c -&gt; (a, b, c) 
 Unit tests are complete coverage based on 0-1 principle.
 Benchmark output is available: https://gist.github.com/Javran/95cf757866668e43fe188d70f25c1c05 (comparing with Data.List.sort)

                              <span>Hi all,
 Over the past weeks I&#x27;ve posted about state machines in the context of testing, supervision, hot-code swapping and async I/O.
 Today I&#x27;d like to share an experiment in how we can combine state machines into parallel pipelines in a declarative way:
 https://github.com/stevana/pipelined-state-machines#pipelined-state-machines
 I&#x27;ve tried to structure the readme as a self-contained blog post, with motivation, commented code, suggestions for possible extensions and questions that I don&#x27;t know the answer to yet.
 I hope you find it interesting and I&#x27;m looking forward to hearing your feedback!

 Since it only uses high school algebra and basic arithmetic, certain liberties have been taken. Some things have been handwaved. This is intentional. 
 If you have suggestions on how to improve this, please keep in mind the high school algebra limitation. It should either be things that remove unnecessary parts so there&#x27;s less to remember or things that explain it in even plainer language. The people who didn&#x27;t get it were having trouble with the functor section, so I know that needs to be reworked. Please don&#x27;t say I need to add natural transformations. That …</span>

 There&#x27;s often some jiffy about a build something or other, or it just says &#x27;internal error&#x27;.
 I have metals installed and do open a new scala project on that tab, and import the build it suggests in the pop-up, but I simply cannot work out how to open a worksheet and just write the language and get it to run. I feel seriously stupid xD
 Any help would be very much appreciated indeed.

                              <span>The current version of Veautiful and Doctacular have been tagged as 0.3.0 and released to maven central. (Substantially the same as 0.3-M6, but with a non-milestone release version number)
 com.wbillingsley %%% veautiful % 0.3.0
 com.wbillingsley %%% doctacular % 0.3.0
 Docs here: https://www.wbillingsley.com/veautiful/
 API here: https://javadoc.io/doc/com.wbillingsley/veautiful_sjs1_3
 https://javadoc.io/doc/com.wbillingsley/doctacular_sjs1_3 
 Veautiful is a &quot;low level control, high level ease of use&quot; front-end library
 Doctacular is a set of components/classes for it that are particularly useful for building teaching materials (e.g. interactive slide decks and tutorials, teaching sites driven by a table of contents)
 They are substantially the same as 0.3-M6.
 Our (southern) autumn teaching trimester has just started, so my focus switches a little from updating the library to the sites that are built using it. i.e. the next release might not be for a few months, as the current one has enough for what I&#x27;m teaching at the moment.

                              <span>I just started using org mode for a way to structure my thoughts and plan programming features (for writing design docs / RFCs).
 When doing that, I often end up realising I need to pop a TODO in the middle of a thought / text. Now, I do understand that I can make a header be a TODO -&gt; but in this case I will often be in the middle of the bullet point list, or middle of paragraph, and I Just want to pop a TODO there to work more on that piece or to reconsider something later. Kind of like leaving breadcrumbs for later, since I usually do many passes through this document until I completely refine it.
 Of course, I can just write TODO, but then it is not recognized as a TODO by org, and I would like to be able to get a list of all TODOs, mark them as done, move from one to the other, have them nicely syntax highlighted, ... .
 Any advice how to go about this? Should I be doing this in Org in some other way?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Curious as to how I can do this better.
 I&#x27;m using a Windows client to access various headless, Linux-based development servers. In many cases I want to edit a file on the remote server, using Emacs.
 Currently, I have just been using SSH (PuTTY) with X11 forwarding enabled. I simply SSH to my target, open the file, and voila Emacs is drawn on my local/Windows client. When I&#x27;m on the same local network as the development servers, this works fine.
 When I&#x27;m connecting remotely (VPN), oftentimes a much slower connection, this can get a little ugly. It works, yes, but can be painfully slow. For example, hitting page up inside Emacs may take a couple of seconds to draw. This creates the need for some very delicate typing/selecting of text.
 How can I improve this setup? I have started to research emacsclient (to run in Windows) to potentially connect to Emacs on the Linux side (running in daemon mode), but I&#x27;m not sure that this is actually the correct approach. It doesn&#x27;t totally make sense to me, as the file I&#x27;m trying to open is located on the daemon/Linux side (not Windows). Any help is appreciated!

                              <span>When I do ctrl + space to begin selecting a region of text sometimes a nasty bug happens. When I press the up arrow or down arrow to extend the selected region, it sometimes gets &quot;locked&quot; and continues forever as if the arrow key has been held down constantly. This locks out the emacs window as it goes on scrolling up or down forever increasing the selected region. It does not respond to any user input or a ctrl -g break. Any ideas what&#x27;s wrong ? Usually once it&#x27;s reached the top or bottom of the buffer the control eventually returns to the user.

 I&#x27;ve just joined a new company and the code is indented with only 2 spaces which hurts my feelings, and doesn&#x27;t help readability in my opinion. 
 Since I can&#x27;t really change this, is it possible to use 2 spaces as the indentation style but makes it appear wider? For ex: 2 spaces could look like 4 (only for indentation spaces)

                              <span>A few years ago there were a few attempts to get Emacs to run in a browser. These were exploratory and did not seem to go anywhere. Has something more sophisticated emerged? The idea of running a fully fledged Emacs in my browser appeals to me, especially when considering portability. I would appreciate some ideas and suggestions along these lines. 
 Many thanks.

                              <span>For those who watched Vitalli Honta presentation about ZIO + Temporal.io in the last Functional Scala (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;8MUnEahr5tk), I started playing with it and set a sample app which aims to follow the original Temporal examples and adding functionality on top of it.
 Vitalii helped me on some points I was struggling but I&#x27;ve managed to make an app which has three modules, one as the worker, another a CLI client and last a REST server which listens to an API using zio-http and fires workflows to the Temporal cluster. The app also publishes Prometheus metrics using zio-metrics.

 The code is at: https://github.com/carlosedp/zio-temporal-hello and I look for feedback and ideas.

 Randomly stumbled on this part of the org mode manual:
  
11.4.2 Time-of-day specifications 
 Org mode checks each agenda item for a time-of-day specification. The time can be part of the timestamp that triggered inclusion into the agenda, for example 
  
 Time ranges can be specified with two timestamps: 
 -- 
 In the headline of the entry itself, a time(range)—like ‘12:45’ or a ‘8:30-1pm’—may also appear as plain text.
  
Which means I don&#x27;t have to fiddle with timestamp creation to adjust my times for tasks/events and I don&#x27;t have to worry about going in to a file after capturing something to finish putting in a time range. All I need is a date stamp on a headline and this will work automatically. (You can disable this behavior by setting org-agenda-search-headline-for-time to nil.)
 Somehow I hadn&#x27;t come across this feature before. I&#x27;ve recently gotten more into managing time/time blocking in my org agenda and this was a useful enough discovery that I thought I&#x27;d share!

                              <span>I wanted to get hands dirty of calling GHC Wasm Module from browser, here is what I got and I&#x27;d like to share my experience. I might be rebuilding some wheels here, please let me and everyone know!

 Browser to Haskell Wasm Reactor Module Communication Example
 Setup Using Nix
  nix shell https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc-wasm-meta/-/archive/master/ghc-wasm-meta-master.tar.gz 
 Read more about GHC Wasm: https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc-wasm-meta.
 Run the Demo
 Build
  $ make 
 Serve
 Using python http.server:
  $ make serve 
 Test
 Visit http://localhost:8000/ from your browser and open console.
 You should see the output:
  echo: hello world client.js:67:12 size before 0 client.js:68:12 size after 2 client.js:71:12 a&#x3D; 42 client.js:72:12 b&#x3D; 21 client.js:73:12 c&#x3D;  
 What Was Done
  
A toy Store.hs providing a wasm-independent save2/load2/size2 API globally.
 A WasmComm.hs module that exports Store.hs module through FFI.
 It uses wasm32-wasi-ghc to build a wasm reactor module that exports for Javascript VM to use.
 Browser client library uses browser_wasi_shim to communicate with the module.
  
Javascript String Hurdle
 The biggest challenge is that in order to pass Javascript string between the Wasm Module and Javascript VM, we need to play with the linear memory model of wasm.
 This example creates a few ad-hoc wrapper function to help with the alloc/free memory management convention for the functions exported by the Haskell wasm reactor module.
 Here is an example of how to wrap the Haskell save function as store_save for Javascript usage:
 haskell foreign export ccall save :: CString -&gt; CString -&gt; IO () 
 javascript function store_load(k) { return fromCString(withCString(k, k &#x3D;&gt; inst.exports.load(k))); } 
 Check the client.js for more information about how fromCString and withCString is implemented.
