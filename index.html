                    <span>Hi guys,
 I&#x27;m running emacs 27.2 on macOS Big Sur, and I would like to get double-click on the frame title bar zooming the frame at once, instead of doing first a vertical maximization and then a horizontal one.
 My initial-frame-alist includes (fullscreen . maximized) so the first frame starts maximized and, in this case, double-click on the frame title works as desired (toggling directly between normal and maximized state).
 But I don&#x27;t want any other frame to start maximized, so (fullscreen . maximized) is not included in my default-frame-alist. In this case, when I double-click on the title bar, it first maximizes in one direction, then in the other one. I tried adding (fullscreen-restore . maximized) to default-frame-alist, but to no avail.
 Any idea? Thanks in advance.

                    <span>Hi I&#x27;m wondering if there&#x27;s an easy way to edit the date inserted in Yasnippets.
 Currently I&#x27;m using this command:
 Meeting Date: \(format-time-string &quot;&#x60;
 The output is as follows:
 Meeting Date:  with my cursor being to the right of the date (inside the bracket), such that I can enter the day following the month. The problem that I&#x27;m having is that I can&#x27;t change the month when I&#x27;m using this method. This means that if the meeting occurred yesterday, and today is a new month, I can&#x27;t easily change the month quickly.
 Would it be possible to create a similar command, in which I can easily change the date up and down by scrolling?
 I need help with this as I&#x27;m trying to use Yasnippet to keep track of work meetings.
 Thanks in advance.
 ​
 FOLLOWUP question: Would it be possible to insert the date/time stamp (the same one that uses the ( c-. ) keybinding) inside a snippet?

                    <span>The question is not directly related to Haskell, but I like this community and value your opinions very much.
 I am currently looking into type systems and their implementations. As far as I understand, type checking is done like (omitting some stuff like typing context etc.) ...
 typeCheck :: Expr -&gt; Either TypeError Type typeCheck expr &#x3D; ... 
 ... where the actual implementation of typeCheck conforms to a certain set of type rules. I wonder if we could model these type rules explicitly, like in the following pseudocode:
 type TypeSystem &#x3D; [TypeRule] data TypeRule &#x3D; TypeRule { premises :: [TypingRelation] , conclusion :: TypingRelation } data TypingRelation &#x3D; ... 
 This would allow us to generalize our typeCheck function:
 typeCheck :: TypeSystem -&gt; Expr -&gt; Either TypeError Type typeCheck rules expr &#x3D; ... 
 We could then declare a type system explicitly instead of implementing its rules implicitly, or create a type system more dynamically by providing a dedicated language for type rules:
 hindleyMilner :: TypeSystem hindleyMilner &#x3D; ... parseRules :: FilePath -&gt; Maybe TypeSystem parseRules path &#x3D; ... 
 This would allow us to play around with different type systems in a more declarative way, i.e. we could observe the impact of different rule sets on the result of the type checking phase without modifying the type checking process itself.
 I am not saying that this additional degree of flexibility outweighs the costs in general, since modeling and processing the type rules in a generic manner introduces a significant amount of complexity (as far as I have thought it through). But I think such a system could provide some benefits for educational purposes (e.g., an interactive playground for declaring and executing type rules).
 One could transfer this idea to evaluation rules, too.
 I am motivated to implement such a system, are there any obvious roadblocks (other than the inherent complexity)? Are type rules suitable to be modeled explicitly?

                    <span>I would like to build ghc via mingw64 (msys2) on my windows system. I am trying to follow these guides:

                    <span>I am fairly new to NixOS and I am struggling a bit with the Haskell development setup. I usually use stack, which has a NixOS integration, so I only need to add the packages to the stack.yaml and everything works.
 My question is now with the GHC versions. For some reason, GHC 8.10.4 is the newest compiler version available for me (on unstable). I am pretty sure this can&#x27;t be the case. E.g. I&#x27;d like to use HLS and update my resolver to GHC 8.10.7, but the compiler is not in nixpkgs. How can I fix this? In case it helps, my whole nixOS config is here: https://github.com/jvanbruegge/nix-config/

                    <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;m a CS student learning functional programming with Haskell right now. I find it super fun and interesting and was wondering if anyone knows any good open source projects in Haskell I could develop my skills on? 
 Cheers!

                    <span>I tried reading and re-reading these from LYAH and tried referring some answers on stackoverflow but I’m unable to see the concept as a whole.
 My primary doubts are: 1. What would be a good use case for both? (And not just some small algebraic expression like: Just (*2)) 2. How does applicative functor help over a functor and what would be an alternative if we don’t use an applicative functor? 
 I’d appreciate any external resource too. Thanks

                    <span>Hey folks, how are u doing?
 I&#x27;m experiencing some doubts when implementing the behavior of my entities using companion object, case class and the new given/using concept(the reborn implicit).
 So...
 Let&#x27;s imagine that we are defining an User abstraction that should contain the behavior of addFriend.
 Is this the right location to place the addFriend method and to consume it?
 Idk... It doesn&#x27;t feel &quot;right&quot; this need of declaring given User &#x3D; user and calling the addFriend from the companion object
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;scala sealed trait User(id: String, name: String, friends: List[User])
 object Users { enum UserProfile: case Common
 final case class CommonUser private(id: String, name: String, friends: List[User]) extends User
 def create(id: String, name: String, friends: List[User] &#x3D; List()): User &#x3D; { ... }
 def addFriend(friend: User)(using user: User): Unit &#x3D; { ... } }
 val myUser &#x3D; Users.create(&quot;fakeMyUserId&quot;, &quot;fakeMyUserName&quot;) val friend &#x3D; Users.create(&quot;fakeFriendId&quot;, &quot;fakeFriendName&quot;)
 given User &#x3D; myUser val myUserWithFriends &#x3D; Users.addFriend(friend) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

                    <span>When reading texts, I occasionally find that I didn&#x27;t understand something very well.
I follow a modified version of the Feynman Technique for writing Zettels. Also, I write in a notebook first, then transcribe the writing into my computer to avoid editing while writing.
However, when there are gaps, I&#x27;m not too keen on the idea of referring to resources until I can fill in the gaps. It means that I have to switch from writing to reading. Reading is low effort to me while writing is demanding. I&#x27;m most energetic in the morning. Thus, I&#x27;d rather use my mornings to write than to read if I have anything to write about.
But, if I split the tasks, I need to do something about what I&#x27;ve written so I can address the gaps and re-use the text. I&#x27;ve tried multiple approaches to deal with this to no avail.
So I ask: What is your approach to handle gaps in your understanding when processing reading notes?</span>

                    <span>Hi, brand new Zettelkaster here - as in, I&#x27;ve been reading blogs about it and just ordered How to Take Smart Notes but I haven&#x27;t started implementing anything yet. I feel like I&#x27;ll learn the principles better if I can immediately start implementing the practices, and that means I need to choose what software I&#x27;m going to use (definitely not a card-and-box system - my handwriting isn&#x27;t up to the task).
My existing workflow involves 1) highlighting and commenting on scholarly papers and ebooks in Mendeley; 2) highlighting and scribbling in the margin of hard copy books; 3) saving popular press articles to Evernote from Chrome. Then I write in Word. As you can see, something to process and organize notes and move them smoothly to the writing process is greatly needed.
Since I already have several programs in this process, my top consideration for Zettelkasten software is that it be intuitive and work out-of-the-box without me having to hack any fixes.
I have seen that some people use Evernote for Zettelkasten and I wonder if that&#x27;s the way to go, to avoid proliferating software. It would be nice if I could click from my note on an article to easily see the article itself. However, looking at the earlier thread on Evernote, it seemed to get a bit technical with people figuring out plug-ins and fixes - I wonder if there&#x27;s software I will find more simple and intuitive for Zettlekasten.
Thanks very much in advance for your help!</span>

                    <span>Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
Haskell is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what’s going on in its community.

Making LLVM GEP safer in Haskell by Luc Tielen
In today’s article, I will showcase how Haskell’s typesystem can be used to simplify code generation and reduce the chance of bugs involving the LLVM getelementptr instruction.
Adventures in Looping by Drew Olson
The core of the Slack integration was a never-ending loop that read messages from a web socket and performed actions based on the message. But how should I go about looping forever in Haskell?

                    <span>When I run some shell commands in org-babel it seems that org sets a terminal width of 80 characters, so some commands which configure their output for the width of the terminal format their output accordingly.
 Is there some way to get org into setting the terminal with for the commands, both locally and remotely?

                    <span>I have a problem with Smartparens matching. When I press the &quot; key just before a word, I get a double &quot;&quot; rather than a simple one. I don&#x27;t know if this is the desired behavior (if it is, I find it unintuitive), or if there&#x27;s something wrong in my config.
 See the animated gif here, which also contains my config:

                    <span>Hi all, 
 I tried building Emacs following the docs and removing some packages I don&#x27;t use or want to build myself, yet they seem to still be there when I start Emacs. 
 For example I did, in my up-to-date emacs repo :
 ./autogen.sh ./configure --with-native-compilation --without-org --without-gnus make -j$(nproc) sudo make install 
 Yet when I start Emacs for the first time after building, I can still M-x gnus or org. 
 What am I doing wrong? 
 Thanks for the help

                    <span>I program in c++ in emacs. I use a lot of custom display properties via font-lock-mode and prettify-symbols mode to make my code display in a way that pleases me, including a lot of non-ascii unicode characters.
 I customize the display of doxygen-style comments in several ways including replacing the &quot;//?&quot; sequences with unicode characters. In the example below you can see the &quot;vertical line&quot; character ( 9615) replacing //&lt; in the comment after the function prototype. Note that there is a gap between the vertical bars, which AFAIK is not right (or at least not desired on my part). Is there a way to fix this? Unicode has a lot of nice box-drawing characters that I would like to make use of.

                    <span>Hi everyone, I am using multi occur in Emacs to search several log files for a specific error type.
 I select the buffers one by one, and I find it quite tiresome.
 Would there be a way to select a set of buffers, for example in Ibuffer, and to launch multi-occur with a keyboard shortcut? In this case, I only would have to select the string I want multi occur to locate.
 In short: Ibuffer: mark several buffers Keyboard combination or M-x &#x27;search-marked-buffers-with-multioccur&#x27; Enter search-criteria Enter
 Knowing that I have 0 knowledge in Lisp... How hard would that be to create such a function?
 Thanks for your suggestions

 Now you can draw simple schematics in Emacs.

                    <span>Is there any tutorial or wiki or something where I can learn anything about extending emacs with C.
 We used to have this problem with displaying line numbers in earlier versions of emacs and it performed poorly and once there is a native implementation of it directly in emacs, it is now super snappy.
 I have same issue with indent guides. Whenever they are enabled, it just makes thing a bit flaky and slow.
 I would want to see if there is a better way to write some extensions in C to make this perform better.
 Thanks!

                    <span>I use Doom Emacs and company-mode as a selector. Right now whenever it provides list of choices I can scroll with TAB and select the needed entry with the RET key.
 What I want though is that it pastes in selection on every TAB press, so I can just scroll to the needed selection and continue to type without the need to press RET. 
 For example, I have typed self. and have as a suggestions foo and bar, so if I press TAB it selects foo and my line becomes self.foo, I press TAB again it selects bar and line becomes self.bar, I just press space (it stays self.bar) and I continue to write.

                    <span>I have never got this issue before, I completely don&#x27;t know what to do. I use emacs 27.1 on windows 10. It&#x27;s happened abruptly just today, I have nothing changed in emacs last days.
 update: temporary what I did:
 I found out that the only rep that still works for me is (&quot;gnu&quot; . &quot;http://elpa.gnu.org/packages/&quot;)
 But I need melpa, so I tried and figured out that melpa&#x27;s mirrors with HTTP works fine too.
 So now it looks like this:
 &#x27;(package-archives &#x27;((&quot;gnu&quot; . &quot;http://elpa.gnu.org/packages/&quot;) (&quot;melpa&quot; . &quot;http://www.mirrorservice.org/sites/stable.melpa.org/packages/&quot;)))

                    <span>I am using Stack to manage my Haskell project, and I want to use Chart so that I can make my plots from within Haskell.
 I can see that [Chart](https://www.stackage.org/package/Chart) is on Stackage, and when I add Chart to my &#x60;package.yaml&#x60;, it works. However, it seems that to render the charts, I need the packages Chart-cairo or Chart-diagrams. But these do not seem to be on Stackage, and I am not sure how to install all the components.
 Any suggestions?

                    <span>Hello all,
 I&#x27;m having a little trouble with the following:
 Say i have to following inductive datatype: 
 data Foo a b &#x3D; T1 a | T2 b | T3 (Foo a b) (Foo a b) | T4 (Foo a b) (Foo a b) 
 I want to use pattern matching like so:
 someFunction:: String -&gt; Foo a b -&gt; Foo a b -&gt; Foo a b someFunction x (T1 x) (T2 y) &#x3D; T1 x -- For example 
 I want to patternmatch such that the value of variable x equals the value of the Foo argument T1. However I cannot seem to make it work. Does anyone maybe have an idea how this can be done? Or should i use a different method?
 ​
 Kind regards,

                    <span>Hello! Do you want to use Haskell to help protect critical infrastructure from criminal intrusions? I&#x27;m part of a (remote, US-based) team at CrowdStrike that designs and implements custom query languages, searching our stream of 1 trillion+ events / day for signs of malicious behaviors. Our compilers and associated webservices are written in Haskell. We&#x27;re looking to expand our team by adding a thoughtful colleague who resonates with CrowdStrike&#x27;s mission to stop breaches.
 Please see the posting below for more details, and I&#x27;m happy to answer any questions you might have about the role.

                    <span>Hi everyone, just to give a very brief timeline of my experience in software:
  
Age 19: Completed an Android Mobile Development course that lasted one year (no particular qualification to speak of).
 Age 19½: Started working as an Android Mobile Developer for a forestry IoT company.
 Age 22: Started working as an Android Mobile Developer for a multimedia company in The Netherlands (I&#x27;m from Ireland).
 Age 22¾: Illness
 [SCENE MISSING]
 Age 26 (i.e. now): Learning Haskell with the expectation that by putting in the work upfront I will be in a good position to secure a job (preferably remote) or at least compete effectively for freelance gigs online. This is based on the assumption that most people don&#x27;t learn Haskell, but there are still positions out there for Haskell programmers, it won&#x27;t be as competitive as something like Java/Android.
  
Am I being crazy or is this a reasonable plan? I love programming by the way, and Haskell has always fascinated me, I just never had the time to delve into it. Now that I do, I&#x27;m hoping I can make a career out of it, possibly moving out into other functional languages as time goes on.
 Any advice would be much appreciated. I have a handful of projects I can work on once I&#x27;ve done a couple of Haskell tutorials, which I&#x27;m hoping will be enough to impress potential employers. Is there anything else I could be doing?

 This might be a quite biased group to ask that question. But why is haskell not super famous? It feels like everyone should at least give it a shot.

                    <span>Hello,
 In my org-mode workflow, I export the work done in the week and all current tasks with:
 elisp (setq org-agenda-custom-commands &#x27;((&quot;W&quot; &quot;Weekly Review&quot; ((agenda &quot;&quot; ((org-agenda-span 7))) (todo &quot;TODO&quot;) (todo &quot;STRT&quot;) (todo &quot;LOOP&quot;) (todo &quot;WAIT&quot;)) ; review waiting items ((org-agenda-start-with-log-mode t))) ))  Then I write the list with org-agenda-write. The problem is that I loose heading tree during the process.
 What I got:
 org * DONE [ISSUE] Fix missing dependencies CLOSED: [2021-09-27 lun. 14:01] blablabla * DONE Roadmap for sandbox creation CLOSED: [2021-09-28 mar. 15:09] * TODO Add option to enable debug level - [x] for logs - [x] requests on database 
 What I want: org * API development ** DONE [ISSUE] Fix missing dependencies CLOSED: [2021-09-27 lun. 14:01] blablabla * Architecture ** DONE Roadmap for sandbox creation CLOSED: [2021-09-28 mar. 15:09] ** TODO Add option to enable debug level - [x] for logs - [x] requests on database 
 Is it possible to keep global heading when exporting agenda view ?

                    <span>I&#x27;m thinking about how to efficiently using org-mode to make notes while reading a large presentation (e.g. a PowerPoint file, .pptx-file, with a few hundred slides). Any thoughts on this? 
 I&#x27;m looking for tips in general and to see if this topic results in some interesting discussion.
 The tips could e.g. be about how to use org-mode, how to structure the notes, or techniques and tools about how to import information from the presentation into the .org-file.
 When I google this, I mostly find tips about _writing_ a presentation using org-mode. Instead I&#x27;m looking for tips that could be e.g. (some obvious/general examples): The notes should...
  
Reference the presentation (with it&#x27;s title, file location, author, origin) 
 E.g. through a link to the file.

                    <span>I&#x27;m doing literate programming and ran into a bug using source blocks. Just in case it was my setup, I validated this using Portacle with emacs-lisp as the language.
 Parens are matched correctly
 #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp (defun foo () (princ &quot;Hello there&quot;)) #+END_SRC 
 Open paren in the string is no problem
 #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp (defun foo () (princ &quot;Hello ( there&quot;)) #+END_SRC 
 The addition of an escaped-quote breaks matching.
 #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp (defun foo () (princ &quot;Hello ( \&quot;there&quot;)) #+END_SRC 
 Double escape closes the string early as expected and results in illegal syntax.
 #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp (defun foo () (princ &quot;Hello (\\&quot;there&quot;)) #+END_SRC 
 I could not replicate in lisp-mode major.
 Any ideas? Should I take this to #IRC? Is this org-babel or some other component?

                    <span>So I’m pretty new to scala. I’m building a greenfield application and need to solve my CRUD problem. 
 I’d like to bring a bit of the functional paradigm to CRUD operations. 
 “Find all case class objects in table that pass function, apply this function to update”
 You get the idea. Sorry if my terminology is off anywhere and please correct. 
 My requirements are: 1. Nothing experimental, this is an enterprise application 2. Readability 3. Leverages functional expressiveness
 4. You have personally used it before and have lived with its growing pains. 5. Compatible with SSMS
 Frankly there are so many options and I’m overwhelmed, could use some help narrowing down the field.

                    <span>As a scala data engineer, I normally write some ETL projects and bigdata projects using Spark.
 I learned about functional programming lately and got to know about Cats.
 I see cats is very useful in the aspects of dealing with NullPointer Exception as well as providing higher abstraction for Try, Option, Eigher, Future classes.
 My question is, unlike some other program like web, which is not allowed to crash on runtime, data engineer&#x27;s job allows programming crash and sometimes it&#x27;s more desirable for me to fail fast so I can know what&#x27;s wrong immediately. I don&#x27;t need my data job to run all the time and finally I can only find it&#x27;s wrong in the log.
 With that in mind, I found the Try, Option, Either, Future seems not so useful to me. Because if I use them, I had to use some option.get
 or either.left.get
 to get the method result, which seems rather unnecessary. Otherwise, the program never fail.
 In my company, people don&#x27;t know Cats, but they can carry out their data development normally.
 So is my above perspective right? Please correct me if anything wrong in my thinking.

                    <span>Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a MCMC sampling algorithm which proposes new states based on the simulation of Hamilton’s equations of motion.
One of the main ingredients of this algorithm is its integration scheme — how the equations are discretized and its solutions found.
The standard choice for this is the classical leapfrog.
In this blog post we present our empirical investigation of U7U_7U7​ — an algorithm that is computationally more expensive, but also more accurate.
This trade-off is not a simple one (after all, more precision implies less tries), but our explorations show that this is a promising algorithm, which can outperform leapfrog in some cases.
We don’t suppose previous knowledge of integration methods, but in case you are new to HMC or MCMC methods, a good starting point…</span>

                    <span>Using Doom Emacs in case that&#x27;s relevant.
 I was experimenting with org-agenda-files and did M-x org-remove-file, which set the value of org-agenda-files to every file in my org directory except the file I was experimenting on. How do I set org-agenda-files back to the original value? The documentation says the original value of org-agenda-files was nil, so I set it to nil but that worked as you&#x27;d imagine: org agenda was empty. I want org-agenda-files to be set to what it was before I messed with it, which I assume is org-directory, but (setq org-agenda-files org-directory) didn&#x27;t work as expected.
 Because I obviously don&#x27;t know much about emacs or emacs lisp, here&#x27;s what I&#x27;m doing to confirm changes are working: 1. Change variable 2. Add file to org directory, test.org 3. Restart emacs 4. Check value of variable (it doesn&#x27;t include test.org)
 I want test.org to be included in org-agenda-files as soon as I create it.

                    <span>Hey!
 It would be interesting to read the lisp source code - from that very first lisp function that gets executed by lisp interpreter when Emacs starts.
 What would be the name of this function?
 Thank you!

                    <span>&quot;Making xwidgets-webkit more like a real browser?&quot;
 ​
 Hello everybody, I&#x27;ve been an Emacs user for a year and a half now (evil mode has kidnapped me from Vim) and slowly I&#x27;ve started to migrate my life in org files, reading my emails in mu4e, etc...
 Now I&#x27;m at the point where I want to use a browser within Emacs and I found out that xwidgets-webkit on my emacs-plus@28 (I&#x27;m a Mac user) works pretty smoothly for a single buffer (eg. for keeping my Jira page opened), but not for other features that a modern browser offers (history, multiple tabs, ...). Does anybody knows an alternative or a way to enhance its behaviour?
 ​
 Thank you in advance :)

                    <span>Most people seem to agree that tree-sitter could be a useful addition to Emacs. But in reality the urgency is like &quot;eh&quot;, and despite being brought up bimonthly on emacs-devel, no one yearns for it enough to do it. Anyway, I decided to take it up. With the generous help from guys on emacs-devel, the bulk of the work is now completed.
 Seeing that native-comp had benefited from publishing the code for people to test out and report problems before the work finalizes, I want to follow Andrea&#x27;s example and publish the code for the tree-sitter integration. Please try out the code, and tell me if there is anything not working as expected or can be improved, especially on the font-lock and indent interface. Thanks.
 https://archive.casouri.cat/note/2021/emacs-tree-sitter/index.html
 And yes, I&#x27;m aware of other efforts to provide tree-sitter features to Emacs (and authors of them offered me great help), but they are different. My only comment for &quot;why didn&#x27;t you...&quot; is that I&#x27;m an evil bastard desperate for attention, and I have the code.
 EDIT: “offered me great help” kind of came out wrong, I meant “provided me great help”. Please forgive my English :-)

                    <span>Howdy.
 I’ve taken some light courses on Python, JavaScript, etc. But I fell in love with Lisp. I’m convinced I found my religion. 
 So, basically, for someone like me who’s a lawyer getting into programming as a hobby via scheme, clojure and quil, Overtone, etc. 
 Which version of Emacs should I adopt as my church?
 I started the basic tutorial on the vanilla, but I want to get the most of whatever I do and if there’s one that gets me further along with cool features, even better.
 Gracias!

                    <span>Hi all,you might have seen our previous posts about progress with Wasp-lang, our strong-path library and haskell-handbook that we are (slowly) writing.
 Now we have different news to share -&gt; we are hiring first engineers (besides us) at Wasp!
 Super short, since more details are in the job post:
  
We are twins, Martin and Matija (ex algoritmic competitors, haskellers, interned at Google/Palantir, emacs/vim :D).
 Wasp-lang is an open source DSL (implemented in Haskell) for building web apps with 10x code (using Javascript ecosystem). We were part of YCombinator&#x27;s recent batch and just raised our seed round.
 Right now we are looking for founding engineer: experienced generalist with web dev experience who is passionate about their work and wants the impact and flexibility of working in a startup. Haskell/functional knowledge is not a must if you are excited to learn Haskell as you go.
 Responsibilities: designing and implementing Wasp side to side with us, which means working with both JS ecosystem and implementing compiler in Haskell.
 Fully remote, but limited to [GMT - 4, GMT + 3] for now.
  
If this sounds interesting, check out our full job post: https://wasp-lang.notion.site/Founding-Engineer-at-Wasp-88a73838f7f04ab3aee1f8e1c1bee6dd
 Looking forward to hearing from you!

                    <span>Hi everyone, long time lurker here. So, I&#x27;ve been using Haskell on and off for around the last 5 years now, and I now have a project that I want to pursue that would imply ML (plus some image processing, OpenCV style stuff). Since Haskell is my preferred language, I wanted to ask: What&#x27;s the state of the ecosystem in this area? I am a complete beginner to ML, so I would be learning along the way, and I was wondering if it&#x27;s even worth for me to use Haskell (even just for the joy of using haskell :) ) or if I should just cave in and switch to something like python. I know this has probably been asked countless times before, but I&#x27;d love a more updated response from people who know the field more than I do. Thanks in advance!

                    <span>Hi all, is it possible to use synctex with an org file? So for example I&#x27;d like to do forward search (whilst in org file find corresponding place in pdf), and reverse search (whilst in pdf find corresponding place in org file). The closest I can currently get is to add #+LaTeX_HEADER: \synctex&#x3D;1 to the org file which gets me reverse search in the pdf and be directed not to the org file, but to the intermediate tex file that org creates when compiling org to pdf. 
 I feel like org to pdf bidirectional linking should be possible in 2021. To me this is pretty much the only thing holding me back from using orgmode for all pdf generation.
 Many thanks!

                    <span>I&#x27;ve recently found the Google Maps feature that allows you to save places and organize them into lists (e.g., restaurants you have been recommended), and then choose to show in the map or not the places in a given list. I find it really useful and would like to start using it more, but I don&#x27;t think those lists are a good way to organize a large amount of places, and have some privacy issues with Google Maps. I would rather use org-mode to organize them, and then export them whenever I want to some other open maps application, or maybe keep them synchronized automatically. Do any of you know of something that implements this or something similar?

                    <span>I have the following two tables:
 | ! | slope | intercept | xval | yval | |---+-------+-----------+-------+------| | | 1.2 | -5 | 1.4 | | | | 2.4 | 2 | -5 | | | | -5.6 | -3 | 2.2 | | | | -0.2 | 4 | 2.718 | | | | .56 | 3.14 | -0.5 | | #+TBLFM: $5&#x3D;$2*$4+$3 | | slope | intercept | xval | yval | |---+-------+-----------+-------+------| | | 1.2 | -5 | 1.4 | | | | 2.4 | 2 | -5 | | | | -5.6 | -3 | 2.2 | | | | -0.2 | 4 | 2.718 | | | | .56 | 3.14 | -0.5 | | #+TBLFM: $5&#x3D;$2*$4+$3 
 The only difference between these tables is that the first has named columns while the second doesn&#x27;t. For both tables, I can calculate values in the last column one at a time by doing M-x org-table-recalculate or C-c *, but iteratively updating the table using M-x org-table-iterate or C-u C-u C-c * only works for the second table. For the first table, if I run org-table-iterate, I get the message &quot;Table was already stable.&quot; Is this a bug, or am I not understanding how named columns are supposed to work?
 I am running Org 9.4.6 and Emacs 27.2 on Windows 10

                    <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;m a Scala amateur and I was reading a PR which contained ExclusionRule() in the build.sbt and I am trying to understand what is the purpose of these rules and the effect of transitive dependencies on a project. Is there a top-level dependency, and if so, if you exclude the dependencies of that top-level dependency won&#x27;t it be broken? Or does it come into play if there is an upgrade in the future? 
 Resources, documentation and personal anecdotes and experiences are all welcome. Thanx.

                    <span>Hi all,
 I am changing up the software I use for productivity and am choosing between neovim and emacs, but I&#x27;m a little unsure about which is better suited to my situation... Some details:
  
I&#x27;m mostly interested in writing code + version control, taking notes (I prefer a zettelkasten-like approach, so back-links are a key feature), and academic writing (usually in markdown or latex).
 I don&#x27;t care about calendar or email unless it&#x27;s very easy to integrate with gsuite / outlook (too hard to collaborate in my work environment without using those).
 I want something lightweight and fast (at least compared to a &quot;modern&quot; IDE like JetBrains or VSCode).
 I&#x27;m fairly set on using vim keybindings, so if I went with emacs I&#x27;d be using evil.
 I&#x27;m not familiar with lisps at all (but definitely willing to acquire that skill if emacs can offer me a better long-term solution).
  
Given the requirements above org-mode + org-roam seem like the biggest draws for me, but these are my (maybe unfounded?) concerns:
  
I get anxious about format lock-in for my notes. I know the &#x60;.org&#x60; syntax is widely supported, but it seems (from my reading at least) like emacs is the only place it gets the &quot;first class&quot; treatment.
 Performance. I&#x27;ve heard emacs can be slow, is this something that&#x27;s generally expected/accepted? Are there things I can do to make it faster without sacrificing productivity for the activities described above?
 I have heard some people say that evil doesn&#x27;t always work nicely with plugins they want to use. If my main use-cases are the ones listed above, can I expect evil to (generally) work well?
  
Emacs looks really appealing, but those concerns are holding me back... Given all that, do you think emacs is a good fit for me?
 Do any of you have a similar set of use-cases for your emacs use? If so, how satisfied are you with your setups?
 ​
 Thanks in advance for your advice!

                    <span>At work, I prefer not to save my org files locally. So I use a TRAMP path in org-agenda-files. 
 ​
 Obvious problem #1: 
 I have many org files instead of a few big one. We&#x27;re talking one file for each week, going back 2 years at a time.. it adds up. lots and lots. Loading org-agenda with all my files takes about a minute as I see tramp reads every org file, authenticates, and moves on to the next one... 
 Obvious problem #2: 
 TRAMP was not designed (I don&#x27;t think so anyway) to handle org-agenda searches with IVY, going through every single file and looking for the characters through ssh... This is painfully slow. We&#x27;re talking 15 minutes or more before I see a reaction. 
 ​
 So ok. I get the idea that the way to run Emacs this way, with files connected via SSH, is probably via Emacs on terminal. Or, I could probably just have X11 or something else to remote in remotely. 
 I also tried sshfs, which works on the Mac fine, but it doesn&#x27;t do a thing for Emacs and searching through the files. Same speed. Because well, it&#x27;s still ssh and it&#x27;s still doing the same thing. 
 ​
 So my question is... What do you folks do? Anyone uses org-mode agenda through TRAMP? I know this is half an org-mode question, but I&#x27;m looking for an advice for TRAMP, or maybe something else that works for you.

                    <span>Hello all
 I would like to setup autocomplete in Emacs for small C projects with not more than 1 or 2 files. I usually compile them directly from command line without using any makefile, so the usual tools such as irony or rtags seems a bit too complex for this use case as there is no compilation database generation in my workflow.
 Could you suggest any packages that I can use for my use case, that is relatively easy to setup ?

                    <span>I am an elisp novice trying to write a macro.
 I often write elisp code that looks like:
 (with-eval-after-load &#x27;package1 (with-eval-after-load &#x27;package2 (with-eval-after-load &#x27;package3 (setq important-setting t)))) 
 I want to write a macro called with-eval-after-load-all that takes a list of packages and expands into the above form. With my macro the above code would be written:
 (with-eval-after-load-all &#x27;(package1 package2 package3) (setq important-setting t)) 
 I do not find the docs on defmacro particularly enlightening, but I have came up with some code that I feel like is somewhat close to what I need:
 (defmacro with-eval-after-load-all (packages code) (let* ((pack (car packages)) (packs (cdr packages))) (if (null packs) (with-eval-after-load &#x27;pack code) (with-eval-after-load &#x27;pack (with-eval-after-load-all packs code))))) 
 I could use some help. Thanks.

                    <span>In org mode, I can do C-c C-c on any level and type my tag out. Emacs would automatically right indent the tag, for example :ignore: tag. Sometimes, I find it faster to just type out :ignore:. This doesnt indent the tag like Emacs does if you go the C-c C-c route. In fact, if you do it manually, you need to space bar until they line up. I tried &quot;TAB&quot; and even the Evil indent shortcut, &#x3D;, to no success.

 (setq display-buffer-alist

split the window horizontally using &#x60;C-x 3&#x60;

run &#x60;M-x window-toggle-side-windows&#x60;

 You will see that there is an extra, window added, to the frame.
 Is this an expected behaviour ?

                    <span>So here I am installing R packages, reading some warnings in the ESS console that got spat out during the process, which should be fine to do while it&#x27;s working, right? Then suddenly it&#x27;s time for ESS to compile a package and you know what that means. Tens of thousands of lines of meaningless GCC output and I&#x27;ve lost my place in the console.
 What if we could auto-detect highly verbose output like this, by some metric like amount of lines per second, then react by killing the output so far, moving it to a *comint-verbose-output* buffer, and directing all further output there until the command finishes?
 I may try to write this, but does someone have other solutions?

                    <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;ve been playing around with eshell and one of the things that stops me from using it full-time is the apparent lack of possibility to run a fish shell.
 For example, this script:
 #!/usr/bin/fish echo &quot;a&quot; 
 running fish test.sh or ./test.sh just dump me in a sh prompt.
 I have sh-shell set to fish though.
 Thanks

                    <span>I have an issue with my emacs (27.1) since updating the OS on my work computer (a mac) to Big Sur. Now, when transitioning from normal-mode to insert-mode the cursor would not change (from a box to a pipe) until I start typing. This, however, happens only with &#x60;evil-insert&#x60;, not with &#x60;evil-append&#x60;. Looking up the issue I found posts out there of other complainers (all with Big Sur), but no solution. I wonder if anyone can tell what it might be about?
 Cheers,

                    <span>I started using org for my agenda and I&#x27;m pretty hooked so far. The only thing I&#x27;m not sure about is how to deal with finished (&quot;DONE&quot;) tasks. So far I have one org file and I just manually remove everything what I don&#x27;t need anymore but this seems like quite tedious.
 So how do you deal with them? Do you have some (elisp) scripts which remove them? Or move them to another file let&#x27;s say 2 days after it&#x27;s finished? Or is there an entirely different approach you use?

                    <span>I want to get the delete behavior like this:
  
It only works when the characters are whitespace or tab before the cursor.
 If it is larger than the indent that should currently exist, it is deleted with the indent remaining.
 If it is less than or equal to the indent, it deletes up to the beginning of the line.
  
Is there any package or code that satisfies this?

                    <span>We have the Zen of Unix, the Zen of Python, but I&#x27;m wondering if anyone has come up with a Zen of Emacs. Clearly, Emacs works for some people and not for others. I know of many people who tried it and it just wasn&#x27;t for them. But for those of us who do like it, is it just because it works, or is there something deeper?
 My thing with Emacs is that it breaks the wall between application and library, where extensions are for the most part Emacs Lisp libraries, and that to me seems so consistent and elegant. What are your philosophies of Emacs?

                    <span>For example for Unit
  
The Unit type has a single inhabitant, called unit. It represents values with no computational content.
  
What does &quot;inhabitant&quot; mean in this context? What does it mean to say that unit is the &quot;sole inhabitant of the Unit type&quot;?
 I&#x27;m completely clear on what it means for a function to be a method of a typeclass, for example, but Unit is a data type so this isn&#x27;t that.

How would I go about with this? I am only beginning with Scala so it&#x27;s hard to even reason about this.

                    <span>Hi - I can update a value for a mutable.Map using the &#x27;update&#x27; function/method whereas immutable.Map doesn&#x27;t have it so I tried somethin like this,
 mymap(i) &#x3D; mymap(i)+1
 but that didn&#x27;t work. Alternatively converting the map to a mutable map also did not work for me,
 ....mapValues(somefunc).to(mutable.Map) //didn&#x27;t work
 I&#x27;m using scala version 2.12
 Edit:
 I&#x27;ve put the code below and here are the issues,
  
the &#x27;mapValues&#x27; method is deprecated in 2.13 and unfortunately the scala api doc doesn&#x27;t give any hint on what otherwise I can use
 As per the comments &#x27;to&#x27; factory method exist only in 2.13 version but not in 2.12
 &#x27;update&#x27; won&#x27;t work on immutable map.
 no direct way to create mutable map from an immutable map
  
Not sure what lies ahead in Scala 3 version, I guess having hints and example usage on each API is what will make my future learning easy. 
 def countTriplet(arr: Array[Long], r: Long): Long &#x3D; { val aft &#x3D; arr.groupBy(identity).mapValues(_.length) val bfr &#x3D; new mutable.HashMap[Long, Int]() var cnt &#x3D; 0 var i &#x3D; 0 while (i &lt; arr.length - 1) { val n &#x3D; arr(i) if (bfr.contains(n / r) &amp;&amp; n % r &#x3D;&#x3D; 0 &amp;&amp; aft.contains(n * r)) { cnt +&#x3D; bfr.getOrElse(n / r, 0) * aft(n * r) } if (bfr.contains(n)) bfr.update(n, bfr(n) + 1) else bfr.put(n, 1) // aft.update(n, aft(n) - 1) // this won&#x27;t work i +&#x3D; 1 } cnt }

                    <span>Hi all,
 I am working with a Java API from a data vendor providing real time streams. I would like to process this stream and write using Akka streams.
 The Java API has a pub sub design and roughly works like this:  Subscription sub &#x3D; createSubscription(); sub.addListener(new Listener() { public void eventsReceived(List events) { for (Event e : events) buffer.enqueue(e) } }); 
 I have tried to imbed the creation of this subscription and accompanying buffer in a custom graph stage without much success. Can anyone guide me on the best way to interface with this API using Akka? Is Akka Streams the best tool here?

                    <span>I know that ZIO test has its own mocking setup, but I am not sure how well it works to mock dependencies that aren&#x27;t ZIO services, such as a 3rd party SDK. He is my situation:
 I have a service that depends on the Firebase Admin SDK, specifically the auth module. So the live layer looks like a ZLayer[Has[FirebaseAuth], Throwable, Has[UserService]]. I&#x27;d like to mock the Firebase Auth SDK for testing, but I don&#x27;t want to use the annoying emulator thing they have, it&#x27;s too heavyweight and I don&#x27;t want to deal with running another Docker container.
 UserService wraps around the auth SDK but has some custom logic. For example, UserService.getUserByEmail(email: String): Task[Option[UserId]] returns an effect that returns Some(UserId) (UserId being an internal domain object) if a user with this email exists, None if no user with the email exists, and fails if it was unable to complete either of these. In contrast, FirebaseAuth.getUserByEmailAsync(email: String): ApiFuture[String] returns a Java Future which fails with a specific error if a user with the email doesn&#x27;t exist.
 For example, for mocking FirebaseAuth&#x27;s getUserByEmail, I&#x27;d like to do something like (pseudo-code):
  when (auth.getUserByEmailAsync(email1)) return Future.succeed(&quot;userid&quot;) when (auth.getUserByEmailAsync(email2)) return Future.fail(NoSuchUserException) when (auth.getUserByEmailAsync(email3)) return Future.fail(BadEmailException) 
 and use this somehow in my ZIO-test of my UserService.
 I can&#x27;t find any examples of using Mockito in ZIO test. Does anyone have a code snippet they can share, or if this is better done through ZIO-test&#x27;s own mocking system (I only saw mocking of ZIO services there so I am not sure if it can do more than that), can you explain how to do it?

 elisp (set-face-attribute &#x27;mode-line nil :box &#x27;(:line-width 10 :color &quot;???&quot;)) 
 I tried to see how doom-modeline does it, but I couldn&#x27;t find it.
 I also tried using  (face-attribute &#x27;mode-line :background)  which seems to evaluate correctly, but not in the context of set-face-attribute

                    <span>I have just started using Doom Emacs (out of curiosity). When I press SPC key, it automatically lists some possible completions below. Sometimes, the whole list does not fit in one page and then it shows below something like &#x27;1 of 2&#x27;. How do I move to the page 2? I tried scrolling using mouse, but that does not work. 
 How to solve this issue?

                    <span>I want to create a filter group for ibuffer that collects the many buffers gdb makes (mostly to organize them, but also to make killing them once I&#x27;m done debugging easier).
 However, they don&#x27;t seem to have a common major mode... gdb-frames-mode, gdb-locals-mode, inferior i/o, etc all appear when I use gdb-many-windows (which I use because it&#x27;s great).
 Is there some way to sort all of these into their own category in ibuffer? Or perhaps a way to directly do what I want, quickly clear out all GDB related buffers? Or, even smarter - make GDB clean itself up once the debugging session ends?
 This is how it looks now.
 EDIT:
 I&#x27;m (partially) dumb - it cleans up all of these buffers if you do
 (gdb) quit
 at the prompt - leaving just 1 buffer around (the gdb console itself). Still, I would still like help with sorting them in ibuffer while GDB is still running.

                    <span>I was curious if anybody had any ideas of how to add unread messages
 along with total messages to the hello view for each saved search?
 ​
 I am aware of the count-query parameter to the notmuch-saved-searches
 call that shows a count based on a search term. However when all
 messages are read the folder is hidden from view. I would really like
 to see both unread and total counts.
 ​
 Thanks.

                    <span>I want the current line number my cursor is on to be highlighted (not the entire line). I have seen solutions using either linum or nlinum, but since line number display is built in now, I’m wondering if there’s also a built in way to do this type of highlighting. I looked in display-line-numbers.el, and I couldn’t find anything regarding this. Is there something I’m missing? What’s the best approach for this?

 I&#x27;m using ido for completion, however, I would like to disable &quot;SPC&quot; for completion in ido, as I would like to use it as an actual space in the mini-buffer. Is there a way to achieve this?

                    <span>Does anyone here use these 2 together?
 Aggressive-indent-mode seems to interfere with evil-paste-pop (It pastes text in strange places because of the indenting changing when cycling through my kill-ring)
 It also seems to interfere with the undo-tree by creating unnecessary undo-branch points.

                    <span>The default interface is different than the other ways of navigating an org file and doesn&#x27;t integrate well with the rest of the workflow eg. counsel-org-goto. 
 For instance if I want to jump to a (sub)heading in an org file, I do M-x counsel-org-goto and immediately start typing in the name of (sub)heading I&#x27;m trying to jump to. I know beforehand where I want to go to and I don&#x27;t need to stop and read and then react to the list of headings that come up.
 Contrast this with org-clock-in or org-clock-goto which shows a numbered list of the previous headings that were in use and I have to type a number. This feels a bit jarring as I have to go through the list, find the one that I&#x27;m interested in and then type the corresponding number

 Something like this
  * Section [300 char] .... 
 Ideally, I would like the count would be updated in real-time. Thanks

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been using defcustom to define variables that stick around between sessions. Up until now, that&#x27;s worked fine, but I&#x27;ve run into a roadblock, because I want to be able to programmatically create variables, but that has its own problems. But really, what I&#x27;m doing is kind of abusing the customization system because those variables aren&#x27;t really for user customization, I&#x27;m just using the system as a convenience. 
 I could write them out to a file, but I&#x27;ve already got lots of files hanging around. I&#x27;ve thought about maybe putting them in the .dir-locals.el file, but that would mean parsing the file and inserting things into it manually, which isn&#x27;t ideal, but certainly cleaner than yet another dot file. 
 I&#x27;ve yet to come across a case where I&#x27;ve had an original idea when it comes to emacs, so surely someone has already done something in this vein?

                    <span>Recently I was looking for a package to highlight the symbol under the cursor, but found the current popular options to be slow on large buffers.
 There was an older package called idle-highlight-mode which I have updated with the following changes:
  
Add idle-highlight-exclude-point option to exclude the current word from highlighting.
 Add idle-highlight-exceptions-face to support excluding words by face.
 Add global-idle-highlight-mode (globalized minor mode).
 Disable the repeating idle timer when the minor mode isn&#x27;t active.

                    <span>I&#x27;m using emacs 27.1 on Kubuntu 21.04 with Plasma Wayland session.
 When emacs is started from CLI (just run /bin/emacs) , it starts successfully and new emacs frame is displayed.
 But if I start emacsclient to connect to emacs daemon, it will throw an error with *ERROR*: Display :1 can&#x27;t be opened.
 I tried to Google but there is no information about this so I&#x27;m not sure whether it&#x27;s really an issue or just my configuration has a problem somewhere.
 Anyone successfully started emacsclient with native Wayland or XWayland can share experience here?

                    <span>Someone asked a help question on Emacs help list, and I thought I had a nice simple solution. How wrong :-).
 The problem:
 Given a list with values, increment all values by one.
 some 34 word 30 another 38 thing 59 to 39 say 10 here 47
 So, I thought, let&#x27;s just put in a table and incement column:
 | some | 34 | | | word | 30 | | | another | 38 | | | thing | 59 | | | to | 39 | | | say | 10 | | | here | 47 | | #+TBLFM: $3&#x3D;&#x27;(apply &#x27;1+ &#x27;$2);N&#x27; 
 However, when C-c C-c, i get &#x27; (apostrophes) filled in instead of values. Why? :)

                    <span>I am having a really hard time searching up information for this stuff, google does NOT like to index scala documentation that isn&#x27;t horribly out of date it seems.
 Can I use the fewerBraces feature in a newer version of scala? Is it likely to become a fully fledged feature or is it abandoned? How can I, in general, find out about these things?

                    <span>I have an application that&#x27;s using Phantom to chuck data into Cassandra and I&#x27;m looking to get more performance from concurrent writes. For practical purposes phantom runs queries wrapped in a future (I&#x27;m also tossing up a move to Quill if anyone has experience with both). I keep looking at Cats effect and Zio and I am struggling to understand if their various flavours of &quot;runtoFuture&quot; actually run inside their own executioncontexts/runtimes or if they are creating new Futures thus negating any benefits of the green thread.
 e.g In cats effect HERE it&#x27;s a little unclear If wrapped the future of Phantom in an IO.effect If I&#x27;m going to be creating 1000 Green threads or If I&#x27;m just creating 1000 Normal threads wrapped in IO.effect.
 ​
 the main reason I&#x27;m curious is part of their touted benefits is using green threads over normal Threads. but from looking at the code it&#x27;s a little unclear on if I&#x27;d actually be getting any benefit from using their &quot;run to future&quot; implementation over using a normal future If I&#x27;m going to be using normal VM threads anyway and should just leave the code using &quot;stock&quot; futures.
 ​
 TL:DR. When Effects libraries do interop with Futures. Do you still get the benefits of green threads at the point of execution or not?

                    <span>I was watching a video from a conference about config files and just found about:
  
https://json-schema.org/
 https://www.schemastore.org/json/
  
This is a feature that makes some IDE recognize a lot of known config JSON files and add completion to those files.
 I think it would be a cool project to make it work with Emacs if someone is interesting. For me, I don&#x27;t think I will find time to work on this, but maybe someone has time.
 I was thinking about some minor mode that use company mode. If someone will make this working it will show that Emacs is superior to for instance VSCode that has this feature built-in.

                    <span>This code lists the defuns&#x27; in a file and their comments.
  (load &quot;functions.el&quot;) (let ((doclist () ) (defunpair) (orgfunctions (cdr (assoc &quot;functions.el&quot; load-history ))) ) (while (setq defunpair (assoc &#x27;defun orgfunctions)) (progn (push (list (symbol-name (cdr defunpair)) (documentation (cdr defunpair))) doclist) (setq orgfunctions (delq defunpair orgfunctions)) )) (setq vhfunc-list doclist) (princ doclist)) 
 I thought the let statement (orgfunctions (cdr (assoc &quot;functions.el&quot; load-history ))) takes a copy of (cdr (assoc &quot;functions.el&quot; load-history )) and leaves the the result of the original expression untouched, but after the expression is evaluated all the defuns&#x27; are taken from the list, ie the expression (cdr (assoc &quot;functions.el&quot; load-history )) doesn&#x27;t have the functions in it anymore.
 I have to change the delq to a remq to change that behaviour. Doesn&#x27;t (let ((orgfunctions (cdr (assoc &quot;functions.el&quot; load-history )))) create a copy of the value of the expression?

                    <span>I have a problem. My (Doom) Emacs doesn&#x27;t remember custom capture templates. I have to doom/reload in order for them to be recognized and displayed in org-capture window. But if I quit and start Emacs again it forgets about my templates and offers the default ones.
 ​
 Here is the settings from config.el:
 ;;; Org-mode (setq org-directory &quot;~/Documents/org/&quot;) (setq org-hide-emphasis-markers t) ;;; Org-Agenda (setq org-agenda-files &#x27;(&quot;~/Documents/org/agenda/todo.org&quot; &quot;~/Documents/org/agenda/todo2.org&quot;)) (setq org-agenda-start-with-log-mode t) (setq org-log-done &#x27;time) (setq org-log-into-drawer t) ;; Templates (setq org-capture-templates &#x27;((&quot;t&quot; &quot;Todo&quot; entry (file+olp &quot;~/Documents/org/agenda/todo.org&quot; &quot;Tasks&quot;) &quot;* TODO %?\n%a\n%i&quot; :empty-lines 1) (&quot;a&quot; &quot;Projects/todo2&quot; entry (file+olp &quot;~/Documents/org/agenda/todo2.org&quot; &quot;Tasks&quot;) &quot;* TODO %?\n%a\n%i&quot; :empty-lines 1))) 
 I have no errors in the rest of my config. doom doctor signals of no issues and I&#x27;ve just updated with doom upgrade.

                    <span>I am on Arch Linux and use anaconda-mode with company-anaconda (here is my init.el). I have Python installed both with the primary package manager (pacman) at the system level, and also have a local anaconda installation located in ~/anaconda3.
 When I use no environment, company works well giving me the correct suggestions. On the other hand, when I do conda-env-activate and switch to the base conda environment, company stops giving me suggestions (in the main python-mode buffer). I am still able to run IPython in inferior mode, which selects the correct Python binary from the environment. Also, company works correctly in the IPython buffer, but I see it is using company-capf as opposed to company-anaconda as a backend.
 I am a noob with both Emacs and Anaconda, and have been trying to fix this for a while. My first thought was that company-anaconda could have been using some Python package not available in the conda environment, thus falling back to the system installation for that specific package and causing issues, but I have no idea if that is a realistic explanation. Thanks to anyone who is willing to give me some tips.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve created the mu4e thread folding package (https://github.com/rougier/mu4e-thread-folding) which works nicely but is a bit slow because there are a lot of information that needs to be stored in several overlays and the code has become a bit complex.
 I&#x27;ve tried an alternative method which is much faster and easier to maintain (I think). The code is available here: https://gist.github.com/rougier/98e83fb50e19fb73fe34a7ecc5fc1ccc
 The idea is to add a specific character to thread children (non-breaking space in my case but any other specific character would work I think). Then it&#x27;s really easy to parse the buffer to detect children. Threads are folded by displaying a summary (such as &quot;--- 5 hidden messages (2 unread) ---&quot;) using an overlay. To unfold the thread, I simply search for this specific overlay and delete it. To detect the number of unread, I inserted a specific character (&quot;•&quot;) but this can be removed if you don&#x27;t need the unread count when a thread is folded. Last, you do not have to insert a specific field as I did in the provided code, but you could instead insert the non-breaking space in the thread symbols (for example).
 The code is mostly experimental but I&#x27;ve been using for several days without problem. Screenshots comes from my full configuration but the provided code has no dependency.

                    <span>Hello, I found it hard to choose the xml library to use.
 There seem to be xml, haxml, hxt, xeno and bunch others, and I could not find consensus from recent days.
 I am reading off of a request from a site, which somehow provides xml only for specific data.
 (Which is strange, as other data are also provided in JSON format).
 Basically, I am going to parse a rather large xml file, which is basically a lengthy list of small, identical objects.
 As such, I want the performance to be decent. Which library should I go with?
 I&#x27;d also like a great tutorial for parsing, there does not seem to be many.

                    <span>I&#x27;m trying to understand the limitations of immutability and async together.
 The specific example I am interested in is implementing an async graph traversal in haskell. If the &#x60;get_neighbors&#x60; function is async, you don&#x27;t want to run it sequentailly.
 In python I would do this:
 from gamla import is_instance, map, remove, pair_right, compose_left, curry, pipe, star, just from typing import Callable, Hashable, Any, Tuple class _IgnoreChild: pass @curry async def reduce_graph_async( reducer: Callable[[Tuple[Any, ...], Hashable], Any], get_neighbors: Callable, remember: Callable[[Hashable], None], is_seen: Callable[[Hashable], bool], current: Hashable, ): if is_seen(current): return _IgnoreChild() # Since we may reach a node from two different branches, at the same time, # we have to broadcast to the other branch that we&#x27;ve reached this node, this # can&#x27;t be done in an immutable fashion. remember(current) return await pipe( current, get_neighbors, map(reduce_graph_async(reducer, get_neighbors, remember, is_seen)), remove(is_instance(_IgnoreChild)), pair_right(just(current)), star(reducer), ) 
 But how will this work immutably? How can one async computation branch transmit the nodes it has seen to other branches?

                    <span>Hi everyone. I’m a freshman at college and new to Haskell.
 I need to create a function Integer -&gt; Bool that returns true if I input an N value that is a Ramanujan (or taxicab) number. Basically, if n &#x3D; a3 + b3 should return true, otherwise it’s false (2 would return true, 3 would return false). Also worth mentioning, I can’t use lists. Any ideas on how to do this are greatly appreciated!

                    <span>(I love Haskell and have been eagerly following this wonderful language and community for many years. Please take this as a genuine question and try to answer if possible -- I really want to know. Please educate me if my question is ill posed)
 Haskell programmers do not appreciate runtime errors and bugs of any kind. That is why they spend a lot of time encoding invariants in Haskell&#x27;s capable type system.
 Yet what Haskell gives, it takes away too! While the program is now super reliable from the perspective of types that give you strong compile time guarantees, the runtime could potentially space leak at anytime. Maybe it wont leak when you test it but it could space leak over a rarely exposed code path in production.
 My question is: How can a community that is so obsessed with compile time guarantees accept the totally unpredictability of when a space leak might happen? It seems that space leaks are a total anti-thesis of compile time guarantees!
 I love the elegance and clean nature of Haskell code. But I haven&#x27;t ever been able to wrap my head around this dichotomy of going crazy on types (I&#x27;ve read and loved many blog posts about Haskell&#x27;s type system) but then totally throwing all that reliability out the window because the program could potentially leak during a run.
 Haskell community please tell me how you deal with this issue? Are space leaks really not a practical concern? Are they very rare?

                    <span>Hello!
 Quickly: My goal is to use the new org-cite citation format for org-exports to ox-hugo and LaTex.
 I didn&#x27;t use the org-ref style of citations and org-export workflow so I don&#x27;t know how this would work normally.
 I get citations to get exported but can&#x27;t figure out how to have them exported in the style I want and with a bibliography.
 If someone could point me to a definitive tutorial or their config files + a test org-mode file that would be great!

 Let&#x27;s say that I want to create following source code:
 #+BEGIN_SRC sh cat ./file_doesnt_exist.txt #+END_SRC 
 When I execute this block, sh try to &#x27;cat ./file_doesnt_exist.txt&#x27;. But this method needs existing text file in the working folder. But I don&#x27;t want that. Instead of this I want to something like this:
 #+BEGIN_SRC sh :var file_doesnt_exist.txt&#x3D;&quot;This is context.&quot; cat ./file_doesnt_exist.txt #+END_SRC #+RESULTS: This is context. 
 How can I achieve this kind of behaviour in org-mode?

                    <span>Instead of having a single clipboard item; I would like to have multiple.
 ​
 Functionality description
 The package would offer something similar to a dock and each time you &quot;Copy&quot; with this clipboard a prompt forces you to choose a position on this dock for the selected text. Then you have a parametrized keybinding to paste the dock items (C-y ); and also a tiny buffer to edit the dock (rearrange and delete).
 A nice to have would be that you could open a tiny bar to display the content of each item in the dock.
 ​
 Use case I find this suitable for:
 Sometimes I have unicode keys that I am using a lot; so the benefit in this case is obvious.
 ​
 Final reflexion:
 The functionality may even be extended to store comands that have verbose keybindings and you are using it a lot for a short timespan so store them as keybindings is an overkill.
 This package would be then providing a lightweight solution for transient keybindings.

                    <span>I&#x27;m an emacs noob, so I was really hoping someone on my last post could bail me out and explain that this weird evil-org-mode issue was easily resolvable, but after discovering the reason for it, it doesn&#x27;t seem that it is.
 The issue in question materializes when one uses an evil command that expects to be used in conjunction with a motion: e.g. d 10 j. evil-delete (along with most other evil operators I&#x27;ve seen) uses a special code in its interactive form to read a motion that defines what range it should operate on - in this case, ten lines down. In order to read this motion, at the top of the call stack there&#x27;s a function called evil-keypress-parser that does the atomic operations of reading key sequences and interpreting them.
 0 is a special case for this function though - if 0 is th…</span>

                    <span>So evil-collection doesn&#x27;t have bindings for org-mode; however, what it does have are bindings for outline-mode (which org is derived from). The issue is, evil-collection will bind e.g. M- to outline-insert-heading in outline-mode, but then org-keys.el remaps outline-insert-heading to org-ctrl-c-ret in org-mode - with the end result being that M- is bound to org-ctrl-c-ret in org-mode instead of org-meta-return!
 There are a couple instances of this issue, and evil-org-mode doesn&#x27;t fix most of them. Mostly, what I want to know is if there&#x27;s a canonical way to keep the evil-collection bindings for outline-mode (which I use to edit a specific document format for my job), while at the same time preventing org-keys.el from remapping those evil-bound versions.
 I thought loading org first might prevent this issue, but that doesn&#x27;t seem to be the case; here&#x27;s a init.el to reproduce it. Just open an org mode buffer and do C-h k M- to see that org-meta-return isn&#x27;t being bound correctly. Is my only option rebinding everything by hand?

                    <span>I was trying to find a way clearing my folder where .tex file is located. I&#x27;m using AUCTeX and all files I need is actual .tex file and it&#x27;s .pdf output. But there are many supplementary files witch I don&#x27;t need but they make a mess in the working folder. I found one solution here: https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/284459/auctex-preview-latex-temporary-files.
 So, I have a function
 (defun clear-preview () (interactive) (shell-command &quot;rm -rf *.prv *.fmt *.log *.run.xml *.out *.bcf *.aux *tex# *.synctex.gz *.blg *.bbl&quot;))
 But I don&#x27;t want to use in interactively. One solution: is to put it into the kill-buffer-hook, but what if I will kill buffer other then .tex, then this function will also run. I need it only after killing LaTeX buffer, but I can&#x27;t find a killing hook specifically for latex buffer. Is there such a thing? Or maybe there are other solutions.
 Edit:
 I did one of suggested solutions, where I put this function in the kill-buffer-hook with condition, that extension of buffer-file-name is &quot;tex&quot;. I&#x27;m no so proficient with elisp, and I didn&#x27;t manage to make other suggestion.
 (defun my-clear-preview () (shell-command &quot;rm -rf *.prv *.fmt *.log *.run.xml *.out *.bcf *.aux *tex# *.synctex.gz *.blg *.bbl&quot;)) (defun my-clean () (if (buffer-file-name) ;check if buffer assosiated with any file (if (equal (file-name-extension (buffer-file-name)) &quot;tex&quot;) (my-clear-preview)))) (add-hook &#x27;kill-buffer-hook &#x27;my-clean)

                    <span>What I&#x27;m trying to do:
 I have a function that calls org-roam-node-read and returns a link to that node. Let&#x27;s call this function get-node-link for convenience.
 I want to run this in a loop. It will keep prompting, and append each result to a list. Eventually, the user will hit C-g, and it will then convert all those entries in the list to a string, and then provide a mini-buffer prompt pre-populated with that string. So C-g shouldn&#x27;t quit the function.
 I can&#x27;t figure out how to do this. I&#x27;m trying combinations of setting inhibit-quit and with-local-quit but I don&#x27;t quite have it working. Any tips?
 In English: I have an org roam node for each person I know. I take meeting minutes and want to note the attendees as links to their respective nodes. Occasionally, I won&#x27;t have a person as a node (or do not want to add them as a node), so I also want to add their name as free form text.

                    <span>When is Haskell code just fancy and when is it emulating an important math theory? I asked myself this when I saw this
 f :: Ord a &#x3D;&gt; a -&gt; Either b ([a], [b] -&gt; b) factorial i | i &#x3D;&#x3D; 0 &#x3D; Left 1 | otherwise &#x3D; Right ([i-1], (*i).head) fibonacci i | i  (a -&gt; Either b ([a], [b] -&gt; b)) -&gt; a -&gt; b 
 which I found answered here, but can&#x27;t really understand. What, if any, is the purpose of doing factorial this way? So often Haskell is doing things the &quot;math way.&quot; Is there some deep math lore behind this whole exercise?

 The combination of the 4 tools is quite the challenge! And I want to do the following things:
  
expose some packages as hackage packages
 use my obelisk project&#x27;s haskell packages for building each of my smaller packages
 I&#x27;m not sure whether I should be testing nix vs raw cabal separately when uploading to hackage or whether I can use a nix build to push to hackage?

                    <span>org-emphasize is almost usable, it works perfectly fine for single line markers, but is useless the moment one deals with multiline regions.
 This is basic functionality in essentially any text editor, but aside from regexing it, there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a way to simply append a specified character to the beginning and the end of every line in the region. Org-emphasize, evil-surround-region, facemenu or make-face, no bueno. Either they outright don&#x27;t work because of font-lock, for good reasons, or they have half-functional functionality and put it at the beginning and the end of the region, not every line.
 Does anyone know how to achieve this functionality? I did try this but it didn&#x27;t work either. Having to use regex is not ideal.

                    <span>Just wondering: Is it possible to org link (e.g. file or id or headline) between org files and headlines and have those blog links converted by ox-hugo to link between the files in Emacs.
 For instance, let&#x27;s link or headilne A to org file B and convert both to pages on Hugo. Is there a native method or hack to link the Hugo page of headline A to the Hugo page of file B to one another using org-mode links?

                    <span>I am iterating over a dictionary I get from an SDK call to get certain information from the keys. Here is a code snippet:
 sealed trait UserClaims case object Provider extends UserClaims case object Client extends UserClaims case object Irr extends UserClaims val claims: Set[UserClaims] &#x3D; record.getCustomClaims.keySet().asScala.map { key &#x3D;&gt; key match { case &quot;provider&quot; &#x3D;&gt; Provider case &quot;client&quot; &#x3D;&gt; Client case _ &#x3D;&gt; Irr }} 
 I get a compile error for type mismatch, claiming claims is actually a Set[UserClaims with Product]. Where does this Product come from?

                    <span>Dear all,
 I have begun to try emms today and although it seems to work mostly fine, I have found myself stuck with an annoying behavior: emms-browser-add-tracks will send a track twice to the playlist.

                    <span>Hey all,
 I already use emacs to take notes for classes like history or geology or other heavily text based classes.
 However, I&#x27;m still forced to take math notes by hand, both for speed reasons and for graphical reasons - representing math in a text editor is hard to do for complex stuff.
 Of course something like x2 becomes x^2, but that&#x27;s both not nice to read and doesn&#x27;t work well when it&#x27;s more complex (starts a spam of parentheses).
 I&#x27;ve never worked with org mode (currently just take notes into text files), and I know I should probably port my txt file notes into that. So I guess side question - tips for getting started with basic org mode?
 However that aside, main question is: is there a way to represent math quickly in a text format and have it display like it would if written manually on paper? I know emacs can display images in buffers almost like Microsoft Word can... Some kind of &quot;render this math as an image of how it should look on paper&quot;?
 I assume the profs use some sort of tool to generate pretty formatted math for stuff like HW and exams, but I have no idea what they use. It almost looks like the kind of output you get from typing &quot;one line&quot; math into Wolfram alpha.
 A big important thing though is speed - if it&#x27;s some kind of super complex markup lang that&#x27;ll take me forever to write, no good. I gotta be able to generate this about as fast as I could write it on paper, or at least a basic thing I could go back and pretty up after class.
 Does something like that exist?

                    <span>evil-redirect-digit-argument binds a wrapper function that calls digit-argument if a prefix command has been started and another, default function otherwise. However, after spending some time in the evil codebase, I&#x27;m wondering if it&#x27;s necessary at all.
 The only immediate use I can see for this is to handle how &quot;0&quot; works, which is the only place this function is actually used in the evil codebase. That is, if a count argument has been started, you want 0 to be interpreted as being a part of the count argument (e.g. d 10 j) while if a count argument hasn&#x27;t been started, you want 0 to be interpreted as evil-beginning-of-line (e.g. d0).
 Since evil-beginning-of-line is a motion, I&#x27;m pretty sure any use of it will pass through evil-read-motion, which uses evil-keypress-parser - which contains logic that makes me think evil-redirect-digit-argument might not be necessary.
 evil-keypress-parser has a specific hardcoded check for evil-beginning-of-line&#x27;s wrapper function. This hardcoded check seems to do the exact same thing evil-redirect-digit-argument already does - i.e. if you hit a 0 and it&#x27;s not the first number in the sequence, just add it to the count argument, and if you hit a 0 and it is the first number in a sequence, interpret it as evil-beginning-of-line and complete the key sequence.
 I tried removing the use of evil-redirect-digit-argument and changing the hard-coded check (a two line change) and everything seemed to still be working: d0, d10j d203k, etc.
 Is there a reason for evil-redirect-digit-argument to exist that I&#x27;m missing?

                    <span>I recently upgraded from org 9.2.3 to org 9.4.4 and realize that when I am entering a tramp directory orgmode tress to resolve it as I&#x27;m typing and causes the editor to freeze for short periods.
 Is there some setting to switch of this behaviour?
 In fact after upgrading to 9.4.4 it, so many settings are proving to be distracting and I&#x27;d like to turn off or modify a lot of them.
 One of them is the automatic indentation and backquoting some lines after typing begin_src.
 In another instance I accidentally clicked on a link in a source code block and orgmode just evaluated the whole block as though I had entered C-c C-c.
 I upgraded a quite a number of packages in the process of uprading org and it is hard to tell which of these effects come from the org package itself, but these problems manifest within org documents.

                    <span>I have been inside emacs for about six months and I have noticed lack of guides that shows how to implement IDE-like features in emacs for a particular programming language. (There are, sometimes, guides available but they are often either old or don&#x27;t go detail on &quot;what does this do&quot; etc.)
 I just wanted to mention that people who are new to emacs desperately searches for a guide that covers IDE feature integration in emacs for a programming language. So if anyone contributes on that by, perhaps making a series of videos that shows basic configuration for a programming language, then it would be immensely helpful for beginners.

                    <span>I&#x27;m very new to emacs but have been playing around with it over the past few days and have come up against an issue while using the emacs-jupyter package in org-mode (as a method to try to get wolfram language graphics in org-mode). If I&#x27;m embedding &#x27;standard&#x27; jupyter code (like python) via org-babel, plots are generated and displayed inline (just like in a jupyter notebook). Unfortunately, when I try to do this with a wolfram langauge kernel, everything works as expected except for images, which are displayed as base64 encoded strings (either inside or outside of html, depending on the presence of the :pandoc t option), e.g:
 #+begin_src jupyter :session mathematica :kernel wolframlanguage12.3 Plot[Sin[x], {x, 0, 6 Pi}] #+end_src 
 Results in:
 #+begin_export html 

 #+end_export 
 (where I&#x27;ve omitted most of the base64 string for brevity), or using the :pandoc t option I get:
 #+RESULTS: :RESULTS: data:image/png;base64,iVBOR...5CYII&#x3D; :END: 
 Is there any way I can view this image inline in org-mode? I know I can export the graphic in the inline wolfram language interpreter and then load the image into an inline python block, but it&#x27;s a very ugly and tedious hack.

                    <span>Hello fellow humans!
 I currently use wanderlust as my email client and am not regretting the switch from mutt so far.
 However, using wanderlust&#x27;s built-in IMAP capabilities, my passwords are stored in elmo somewhere. I would much rather wanderlust fetch them from my keyring via secret-tool.
 This works fine for sending email. Wanderlust hands the file to msmtp, which has secret-tool integration.
 But how do I best go about fetching email? I need IMAP exclusively, and not just for fetching email, but also for managing folders on the server. This means that an external tool which just fetches the mail and deposits it in a file is out of the question.
 What is the best (or, failing that, a) way to teach wanderlust about secret-tool?

                    <span>Hiya,
 there is one legacy project that I absolutely cannot migrate from matlab (sadly). I have been eyeing this https://sourceforge.net/projects/matlab-emacs/ for a while now and was wondering if folks here have tried it ? Any good ? Can you use the debugger ? The one big pro of the matlab IDE is that it is great for debugging.
 In fact, if you work with emacs and use matlab, I&#x27;d be very interested in knowing your workflow. 
 Thank you!

                    <span>Today I opened VS Code to work on an assignment and saw an update for one of the extensions I use, the Haskell extension. After updating the whole extension crashed. 
 Uninstalling and reinstalling didn&#x27;t get it to work for me. The only thing that ended up working was going back to 1.6.1. 1.7.0 is simply unusable. 
 The error it gives me is The Haskell (Haskell) server crashed 5 times in the last 3 minutes. The server will not be restarted.
 Is anyone else experiencing this issue and know how it can be fixed?
 Note: I wasn&#x27;t sure if this was a post I should make here or on the VS Code reddit, but I figured more people here could be using this specific extension.

                    <span>I&#x27;m trying to implement &#x27;git clone&#x27; in scala, I&#x27;m following this Haskell implementation, and having trouble with a TCP client: https://stefan.saasen.me/articles/git-clone-in-haskell-from-the-bottom-up/#implementing-ref-discovery
 I&#x27;m having trouble receiving the TCP message. I&#x27;m following this: https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/io-tcp.html
 and only implementing the Client. My problem is that I don&#x27;t know what to pass as a listener with type ActorRef.
 I&#x27;m running a &#x27;git daemon&#x27; server locally which I&#x27;m trying to connect to, send and receive a message.
 Previously, I was following this: https://hmn.stackfinder.net/questions/45992575/how-to-reuse-akka-tcp-connection-to-write-messages
 With this implementation, I&#x27;m able to send messages, and the AkkaTcpClient can receive messages with the type &quot;Received(data)&quot;, but that is all. I see it get printed to the console, but can&#x27;t access it. How can I get this data / String outside of the actor?

                    <span>Hi everyone!
 ​
 Currently I am learning Akka and cats scala-ecosystem. The problem is I don&#x27;t have many resources with little projects. I am willing to write something fun using this stuff - simple roguelike game for example. Do you think it is good idea to use Akka in that case? I haven&#x27;t heard about such a usecase. 
 ​
 Best, 
 Henry

So this solution would take me back to the old Zettelkasten concept: each note has a UID, and I refer to the note by that UID. Period.
Anybody using a digital Zettelkasten without backlinks?

https://www.theverge.com/22684730/students-file-folder-directory-structure-education-gen-z
Adapting an example from the article: Where 30 years ago the professors wouldn&#x27;t understand how students could use a computer without knowing how to solder their own boards, nowadays professors don&#x27;t understand how students came this far without organizing files, and understanding &quot;the file system&quot; at all.
I&#x27;m sharing this here because I do wonder what that means long-term for Zettelkasten software 
I have a couple anecdotes of friends and family that match. I bet some of you have heard similar stories.

 Can&#x27;t some of the parameters be replaced with variables or Lisp expressions?

                    <span>I&#x27;m a few days into learning emacs and as an editor I feel that vim is right for me but since everybody says that emacs is more than just a text editor and videos on youtube about emacs showing off the emacs capabilities like reading emails, browsing files, viewing images, playing tetris, github..... but does a terminal emulator not do that well? For files I use ranger, ueberzug and sxiv for images, neomutt for emails, tmux for tabs and sessions, and there&#x27;s so many other terminal applications that do the job that is never supposed to be done by vim. Vim is just a great text editor. How can it be said that vim can&#x27;t view images or browse github or reply to emails but emacs can... I mean there&#x27;s a tonne of terminal applications that do those jobs.
 I have no grudge against emacs but I&#x27;m a terminal user, I use dwm to manage windows, most of the fancy terminal applications that do emails and stuff.... So to move forward with emacs, I wish to know the benefits I&#x27;d have. To make it more simple I&#x27;ll break it down into two parts :
  
emacs as editor or vim
 emacs as not an editor or the terminal
  
For the first part IG everyone would agree upon vim. Isn&#x27;t that the reason why we have evil mode? and IDK the answer to the second part and I can&#x27;t even say because I&#x27;ve used terminal applications but haven&#x27;t explored the &#x27;other than text editor&#x27; capabilities of emacs. So I want y&#x27;all to point out where the simplest tool(the terminal) fails to do the job that emacs can.

                    <span>Hey r/emacs!
 On previous installs of emacs, when opening a directory defined as an alias such as:
 export DIRNAME&#x3D;/some/dir/name
 emacs would allow me to expand the alias in the minibuffer so that I can go back a level or two if necessary. If I recall correctly, I might have had to do a Double-Escape Double-Tab to make it expand. Is there anything I can set in my profile to allow emacs to expand out these aliases again? I looked online, but cannot seem to find any info.
 Thank you everyone!

Like for example, C-x C-w &#x3D; Word
  
Or even Is it possible to make it that way: if I am typing in the text for example &quot;jjj&quot; it changes &quot;jjj&quot; on the fly to the word I need?

                    <span>I would like to write a function that can serve as a &quot;fall-back&quot; when evil-ex-search returns too many results. To do this I need a function that starts an avy selection interface (e.g., like avy-goto-char-timer) but uses the prior evil-ex-search-pattern.
 ​
 I have this function but it doesn&#x27;t work because I am using the avy functions incorrectly. Could someone give me a hand? I feel like there must be a simple way.
 ​
 (defun jds/evil-search-convert-avy-goto-char-timer () &quot;Repeat the last evil-search but this time using avy-goto-char-timer.&quot; (interactive) (let ((lsearch (car evil-ex-search-pattern))) (avy-with avy-goto-char-timer (avy-process lsearch)))))

 error in process filter: Invalid image type ‘svg’
  
So yeah, I don&#x27;t have SVG support, and the page contains a SVG image, but shouldn&#x27;t EWW still proceed past that? After all, SHR could render the source just fine on its own (it skipped the SVG image).
 Any tips on how I can get this to work?

                    <span>Hey, guys, I&#x27;m switching from Vim and trying to set up behavior I&#x27;m currently familiar with. For my Django + React workflow I created the script which instantiated 3 tmux windows:
 in one I had my django related stuff (automatically initiate virtual env, navigate to project folder, start server);
 in second I had things related to running npm related things (again navigate to the project folder, run server)
 finally third - navigate to the project and start nvim there.
 So basically with one keypress I had my working setup running.
 I wanted to know what is the proper way to achieve this with emacs - with one keybinding start development setup with panes or buffers for multiple terminal instances and send specific commands for each instance and of course opening the editor. 
 The second thing is that I&#x27;m overwhelmed with the amount of commands for M-x. Naturally, I don&#x27;t remember their names, and I thought that there should be something like fuzzy search. So if I need to jump to definition of a function - I can fuzzy-search for word definition, because right now it will show only the commands which start from word definition

                    <span>I&#x27;m currently working on a project that relies JSON comparison for tests instead of standard equality (yeah, I know). For particular reasons, we ignore part of the JSON when comparing between the expected and the actual value. Currently, the code is something like this: 
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;haskell import qualified Data.HashMap.Strict as H
 deleteValues (Object o) &#x3D; Object $ H.delete &quot;values&quot; -- Currently removed &quot;values&quot; key. deleteValues _ &#x3D; Object H.empty &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 We had to change our JSON and we added a new key, which we don&#x27;t want to consider when testing. This key can appear on several positions, not only at the top level like values.
 For example, we have something like this:
 json { &quot;values&quot;: [], &quot;info&quot;: &quot;ok&quot;, &quot;key_to_remove&quot;: 0, &quot;details&quot;: null } 
 Here the key_to_remove is only at the top level. But we could have something like:
  { &quot;values&quot;: [], &quot;info&quot;: &quot;ok&quot;, &quot;key_to_remove&quot;: 1, &quot;details&quot;: { &quot;info&quot;: &quot;ok&quot;, &quot;key_to_remove&quot;: 2 } } 
 The nesting can keep going on, and I really would like to avoid manually traversing the object looking and deleting the key.
 The idea is to remove all key_to_remove from the JSON object, independent of the position or value that it holds.
  
Edit: solution:
 haskell deleteKey :: Text -&gt; Value -&gt; Value deleteKey k (Object o) &#x3D; Object $ H.delete k (deleteKey k  o) deleteKey k (Array arr) &#x3D; Array (deleteKey k  arr) deleteKey _ v &#x3D; v

                    <span>Can someone maybe explain/elaborate a bit what S. Diehl is saying here (What I...):
 To add to the confusion numerical literals in Haskell are desugared into a function from a numeric typeclass which yields a polymorphic value that can be instantiated to any instance of the Num or Fractional typeclass at the call-site, depending on the inferred type.
 To use a blunt metaphor, we’re effectively placing an object in a hole and the size and shape of the hole defines the object you place there. This is very different than in other languages where a numeric literal like 2.718 is hard coded in the compiler to be a specific type ( double or something ) and you cast the value at runtime to be something smaller or larger as needed.
 42 :: Num a &#x3D;&gt; a fromInteger (42 :: Integer) 2.71 :: Fractional a &#x3D;&gt; a fromRational (2.71 :: Rational)

                    <span>I recently discovered exporting your org files to html. Someone developed a very helpful theme package [here](https://github.com/fniessen/org-html-themes] which renders just like ReadTheDocs.
 I&#x27;m trying to be better about code documentation and would like to use this for my current contract. It needs to be hosted locally. I was thinking of using this to convert my literate programming org docs into something my client can browse.
 The license here is GPL3
 Can I use this project to render the documentation for my client&#x27;s commercial, proprietary code? How can I comply with this license and is there any possibility that it can interfere with my client&#x27;s IP or legal responsibilities in any way?
 I&#x27;m an open-source guy but unfortunately that&#x27;s not how I make my living. If I cannot use this, can anyone point me to the typical workflow?

 Just tried org mode and it&#x27;s taking over my life .
 I am writing every documentation with it.
 I am trying to replace the markers with &#x60;o&#x60; to get something like this:
 ​
 markers replaced
 And sometimes I just want to insert a single line of code and I hope to get this approach:
 ​
 markers line return omitted
 Any Idea please?

This code is pretty contrived and currently not compiling, but I&#x27;m just trying to get comfortable with ps syntax and hopefully this gives you an idea what I&#x27;m trying to accomplish.
 What I&#x27;d like to be able to do is
  
Take my duderrr &#x3D; MyDude {b: true, i: 77, s: &quot;hellotest&quot;, c: &#x27;x&#x27;}
 Pass it to succeedOddFailEven
 Given that param i is currently 77 and odd, succeedOddFailEven should return Right (Tuple &quot;hellotest&quot; &#x27;x&#x27;)
 However if i is changed to an even int such as 78, succeedOddFailEven should return Left (Tuple true 78)
  
Problem is, @ -style deconstruction mydude@(MyDude rec) doesn&#x27;t seem to be working? Getting this error but not quite sure how to interpret it.

                    <span>As the data science and machine learning fields have grown over the past decade,
so has the number of data pipelining frameworks. What started out largely as a
set of tools for extract-transform-load (ETL) processes has expanded into a
diverse ecosystem of libraries, all of which aim to provide data teams with the
ability to move and process their data. Apache Airflow, Beam, Luigi, Azkaban — the list goes on and
on.
As users of several of the above frameworks, Tweag has a special interest in
data pipelines. While working with them, we have observed a few common
shortcomings which make writing and debugging data pipelines more complex than
it needs to be. These shortcomings include limited
composability of pipeline components, as well as minimal
support for static analysis of pipelines. Thi…</span>

                    <span>Simple but confounding question: Some of my notes do not show the unique ID and title in red at the top of the text of the note, why? I thought that was supposed to populate automatically.
I&#x27;m just getting started with the archive here and found this odd. I&#x27;d prefer to have the ID&#x27;s there always. Couldn&#x27;t find an answer with a number of searches and preferences don&#x27;t seem to have an option for this.
THanks!</span>

                    <span>Hi, I&#x27;m just getting started with the ZK system. I have a question about numbering: I get that the numbering sequence should proceed 1  2  2a  2b  2b1  2b2 etc. according to whether notes are roughly related to one another. If I had a note that wanted to insert between 2 and 2a in that sequence, because I thought it was very closely related to 2, how would I label it (or perhaps it doesn&#x27;t really matter and I&#x27;m overthinking it and should just stick it in as 2c )?
Thanks!</span>

                    <span>Just out of curiosity, how many bytes/kilobyte/megabyte does your dot file weight? I am new to Emacs, my .emacs is only 17kb, 370 lines most of which are probably my commentaries not to get lost in what I&#x27;ve done there lol I am asking because I am curious how could it be look like in a few years.

                    <span>Hey :)
 I&#x27;m getting myself familiar with Emacs and BufferList and ibuffer and what I don&#x27;t understand is: why do we ever need to mark buffer for deletion?
 What&#x27;s the real-life scenario behind the idea of first marking some buffers for deletion with one keystroke per instance and then deleting them in bulk with another one?
 I mean - why just not to have &quot;d&quot; key in buffer mode to delete a buffer?

                    <span>I am trying to ignore directories in counsel-find-file. From what I undertsood, it is possible with the counsel-find-file-ignore-regexp variable.
 Let us say I want to ignore the directories abc and def, and their subdirectories, from the root of the directory I am.
 I tried:
 (setq counsel-find-file-ignore-regexp &quot;abc.*&quot;)
 It indeed ignores the abc directory and its subdirectories/files.
 I adjusted the regexp to:
 (setq counsel-find-file-ignore-regexp &quot;abc.*|def.*&quot;)
 Now, it does not ignore anything. I also tried:
 (setq counsel-find-file-ignore-regexp &quot;abc.*\|def.*&quot;)
 but the result is the same. Nothing is ignored.
 If I try online the regexp, it looks like it works: https://regex101.com/r/8w1i1b/1
 What am I doing wrong?

 The really maddening thing is that I seem to be the only person who struggles with this. What am I missing? Is there a proper user&#x27;s guide to sgml-mode? Can I just disable it? How do I leave this cursed place? None of the official manuals/docs seem to address this.

                    <span>Hello,
 Hurray, my first Melpa package! https://melpa.org/#/gumshoe
 I originally announced gumshoe here, and just wanted to announce the melpa release now, along with some major changes I&#x27;ve made for the occasion.
 First of all, for anyone unfamiliar, it&#x27;s basically a fancy Point logger to help you remember where you&#x27;ve been. There are many variations of this type of tool, but this is mine. Gifs and usage here: https://github.com/Overdr0ne/gumshoe
 Changes:
 For users:
  
peruse: Now built-in interactive backlog browsing using standard completing read. Entry display is also customizable, so you can show (buffer position) or (perspective file line), or (file major-mode position), whatever set of fields you want from the gumshoe--entry class.

                    <span>I know this is a bit of a long shot, since people don&#x27;t use P4 as much anymore. I&#x27;ve started having this problem over the last couple of weeks. I *think* it might be because I have files open from two different workspaces, and P4 might be getting confused, but even that doesn&#x27;t seem quite right.

But when I org-open-at-point for linked mu4e emails, I don&#x27;t get a split window, but rather the email opens in the same window replacing the document. Is this expected behavior? How would I change this? I tried fiddling with org-link-frame-setup to no avail.

                    <span>I&#x27;m writing my own, improved version of this clever function for jumping to hunks in the current buffer with ivy and gitgutter. Git gutter provides information about the start and end line numbers of the hunks. I also provides the content of the hunks, but obviously without properties (this makes sense -- git doesn&#x27;t deal in propertised text). I thought it would be cool to have a swiper-like interface where the hunk text I see in my ivy listing does have the properties it has in the buffer -- it would make it easier to spot what&#x27;s what. 
 Simple then, for each hunk, I&#x27;ll just lift the text, with properties, between the start and end line. I thought there would be a function for this, but I can&#x27;t find one. I know a few ways I could do it (e.g. go to the beginning of the start line, get the char number, goto end of end line, get the char number and use buffer-substring), but it seems like such a basic thing I&#x27;m sure there must be a good, canonical way.
 Is there?

                    <span>I have two values x &#x3D; foldr op1 x0 l and y &#x3D; foldr op2 y0 l. I need to use both of them in some expression like f x y.
 Obviously, one could compute the tuple (x, y) as foldr (\(a1, a2) b -&gt; (a1op1b, a2op2b) (x0, y0) l. This computation requires only one traversal of l instead of two.
 However, instead of this two tuple, I have a five tuple and my operations are really ugly. So, is Haskell going to do this optimization automatically?

                    <span>Hey guys, I am starting with my haskell journey and am a &quot;learning by doing&quot; person. I decided to pick miso as a frontend framework for spa development and want to look for a simple backend.
 I don&#x27;t want a monolithic solution. Just a server with which I can create a rest (and prefereably also in haskell) graphql api.
 What are your go tos? Which can scale? I am not afraid of harder solutions (if they are worth for production), learning haskell will be hard for me anyway.
 thanks in andvance!

                    <span>Many folks, new and old to org-mode, are wondering about capture and using templates. For others (like me), there&#x27;s always the curiosity to see what others come up with. It&#x27;s a great way to learn. 
 I recently re-visited my org-capture series (originally posted about 2 years ago) and thought I&#x27;ll start updating it. 
 For those interested, here&#x27;s today&#x27;s post, which explains what changed and links to other org-mode capture stuff. I hope you find it useful!

                    <span>Here&#x27;s my block:
 #+begin_src R :results output library(IRanges) IRanges(start&#x3D;seq(100,1000,by&#x3D;300),width&#x3D;75) # +end_src 
 And here&#x27;s the output:
 #+RESULTS: : IRanges object with 4 ranges and 0 metadata columns: : start end width :  : [1] 100 174 75 : [2] 400 474 75 : [3] 700 774 75 : [4] 1000 1074 75 
 The &quot;start&quot;, &quot;end&quot; and &quot;width&quot; should be surrounded by angle brackets, but they seems to get stripped from the results when inserted into the buffer (and thus when exported). Has anyone else encountered this?

                    <span>I love The Archive&#x27;s ability to show images in-line in zettels.  This feature was added a while back (6 months or a year, or so) and I&#x27;ve made frequent use of it.
I wonder if there is some way of changing the size of the graphic as it is displayed in the zettel.  I know I can view the graphic at whatever scale I want in some other app, but it would be nice right within The Archive if I could, say, click on the graphic and expand its size, and that The Archive would remember my preferred size the next time I viewed that zettel.</span>

 but this code from the tutorial fails

 It gives
 Variable not in scope: () :: t0 -&gt; t1 -&gt; Data.Graph.Types.Edge Int () • Perhaps you meant one of these: ‘’ (imported from Prelude), ‘’ (imported from Prelude), ‘’ (imported from Prelude) 
 Why doesn&#x27;t it see and understand fromEdgesList? User error, no doubt, but what?

                    <span>First release since the rewrite a year ago. This release mostly takes care of some technical debt, performance regression on ghc-9, support for ghc-9.2 and other minor fixups. Cool new feature is TGen, which let&#x27;s us use the new monadic stateful interface directly from within STM. Here is the full changelog:
  
Fix support for ghc-9.2 #99
 Fix performance regression for ghc-9.0 #101
 Add uniformEnumM and uniformEnumRM
 Add initStdGen #103
 Add globalStdGen #117
 Add runStateGenST_
 Ensure that default implementation of ShortByteString generation uses unpinned memory. #116
 Fix #54 with #68 - if exactly one value in the range of floating point is infinite, then uniformRM/randomR returns that value.
 Add default implementation of uniformM that uses Generic #70
 Random instance for CBool #77
 Addition of TGen and TGenM #95
 Addition of tuple instances for Random up to 7-tuple #72

                    <span>Those with experience in Go would notice the fast compilation times compared to GHC, and in general the great developer experience while building and managing dependencies with a single command. Being Haskell such a beautiful language, would anyone be in favor of having a fast compiler supporting a decent subset of what GHC supports, and a simplified dependency management? GHC would be the place for experimental features or the ones we wouldn&#x27;t be able to introduce in this &quot;Haskell Core&quot; compiler.
 The following could be useful for defining it:
  
leaving outside of the language everything that Agda does better than Haskell
 
rather than having overloaded strings using an implementation like Data.Text as the default
 
 In general everywhere we find duplicity or diversity we could live without, an unifying solution would be proposed. The core should be simple but farsighted enough for making a 20 years backwards compatibility promise.

                    <span>Well :( once again need help building a project. I swear I&#x27;ll get better at this...
 Trying to build this game following the instructions in the Local Install section:
  
git clone https://github.com/sharkdp/cube-composer.git
 cd cube-composer
 npm install
 bower install
 gulp
  
All goes well until I ran gulp. Here&#x27;s the gulp output. Just my own analysis, looks like there&#x27;s three things going on
  
36 warnings of deprecated features. However these shouldn&#x27;t be blockers for the build, correct?
 22 errors referring to the wrap and unwrap typeclass functions not being implemented. Are these blockers? If so, how did this ever work in the first place and how should I fix? I&#x27;m seeing many (but not all) of these errors coming from bower_components/ which was simply the tool in step #4 above used to build the project, and not from the project itself. Should I try rebuilding without bower? Any recommendation on what to run to do this?
 Then it seems to continue compiling before failing completely with a traceback at the end.
  
Would love any advice on how to build this. What do I need to do please?

                    <span>I am a new ZIO user. I like the dependency injection &quot;recipe&quot; system that it uses, but I fail to understand the difference between ZLayer and ZIO. ZIO is a recipe for producing an instance of a data type and ZLayer is a recipe for producing a recipe of a service, but aren&#x27;t all services also a data type (they&#x27;re all traits after all)?
 I get the innovation behind Has for composition (especially thanks to the great u/kitlangton video on the subject), but in all my ZIO work I could just replace ZLayers with ZIOs and not notice, unless there&#x27;s something I am missing.

                    <span>So I&#x27;m writing my second piano sonata.  Currently I have pages and pages of hand-written music on sheet music. I&#x27;m curious if anyone knows of any markdown-native ways of encoding the notes into a more searchable format than a picture.
The two snippets are here for those curious. https://soundcloud.com/bradford-fournier-135979011/sets/piano-sonata-2-brief-snippets
This is about the length of each sheet snippet that I&#x27;d like per note.
(Forgive the playing, I&#x27;m still learning to play my own piece lol)</span>

                    <span>On the zettelkasten subreddit I came across a post linking to an article on the method (shared by the author of the article). In it he was making some bold proclamations, so I thought I&#x27;d ask what this community thought?
The core argument seems to be

  
Today, however, I shall provide one fundamental component of Luhmann&#x27;s system. This fundamental component is missing from an estimated 96% of digital zettelkastens.
Luhmann outlines this fundamental component in the very beginning of his paper on how his zettelkasten works.

    
Information is an intra-systematic event. It results when one compares one message or entry with regard to other possibilities. Information, accordingly, originates only in systems which possess a comparative schema—even if this amounts only to: &quot;this or something else.&quot;

  
  
You see, built into every single note in Luhmann&#x27;s system is one requirement: he must decide where the note belongs. It forces associations, and associations stand as the fundamental building block of human memory. One must decide if the note is associated with this or something else. It is a comparative schema built into the very root of Luhmann&#x27;s antinet zettelkasten, which surfaces the magic of his system.
Unfortunately, this fundamental component is watered down to near extinction in the world of digital zettelkastens.


(Source: https://daily.scottscheper.com/num/243/)
The idea of &quot;must decide where the note belongs&quot;, while true, misses the point of multiple context within the zettelkasten, as Luhmann was trying to come up with an alternative to filing notes using folders. Or is he just rehashing the classic Folgzettel Debate?

                    <span>I am new to Zettelkasten Method.
I want to use tags not only to specify the content of a Zettel but also the type of the Zettel itself. It is like a meta-information. e.g. I want to categories the type of content like this
:typ:idea
:typ:permanent
:typ:bib
:typ:index
:typ:keywords
:typ:quick_n_dirty

Question 1
Question 2
problem that the : does not work out of the box with zetteldeft. So I look for something else because I do not want to modify the default settings.</span>

                    <span>Hello everyone,
I usually take a ton of notes from narrative non-fiction books I read: story ideas, research etc... Those should be considered &quot;literature notes&quot; in the context of zettelkasten. I find it confusing having these notes in a single file, so I split them by topic or anecdote. But I don&#x27;t like to have my computer crammed with tons of files. When I read a new book on the same topic, rather than creating new notes and linking them, I tend to group the notes I already have with new notes who adds info to the same topic or details to the same anecdote. Still, I keep a reference to the original source (in the form of citation).
To better explain what I do:
I read a book about a writer and I take a note on an episode of his life (which we&#x27;ll call NOTE 1).
Another episode of his life goes to a different note (NOTE 2) in the same folder.
I read another book and I find some detail on the same episode as NOTE 1. I don&#x27;t create a new note but I add it to NOTE 1 and eventually add a citation for the new source.
I read a book about a chemist and I take a note about one of his discoveries in the specific folder of that book/project. It isn&#x27;t directly related to the episode of NOTE 1, but I think linking them can bring to a new perspective. I create NOTE 3 and link NOTE 1 and NOTE 3.
Is that a good practice, or is it better to have a single file for the notes coming from a book, then different super short notes for concepts I want to keep from each book?</span>

Recently, I stumbled upon zettelkasten and the archive. I enjoy it so far and look forward to learning more about the process and tool from you all.</span>

                    <span>I want to add some text to a capture template of mine, that seems to be beyond what normal template expansion can do. I can only calculate the value of the string I want to add, while in the buffer from which I call capture, because it has to use some buffer-local variables. I figured I can calculate my string, put it in a variable, then simply use it in my capture template. Something like:
 &quot;* Some stuff %(identity my-variable)&quot; 
 and call my template (&quot;a&quot;) with
 (let ((my-variable set-my-variable)) (org-capture nil &quot;a&quot;)) 
 But it doesn&#x27;t seem to work that easily. The function I call with %() in the template is outside the scope of my-variable. How am I supposed to properly pass extra custom information that I calculate at the runtime of org-capture to a capture template?

                    <span>I just found out about kroki which wants to be &quot;a unified API with support for - BlockDiag (BlockDiag, SeqDiag, ActDiag, NwDiag, PacketDiag, RackDiag) - BPMN - Bytefield - C4 (with PlantUML) - Ditaa - Erd - Excalidraw - GraphViz - Mermaid - Nomnoml - Pikchr - PlantUML - SvgBob - UMLet - Vega - Vega-Lite - WaveDrom ... and more to come!&quot; I find that a very impressive list. I wonder if org-mode could somehow laverage this to support all of these diagram formats in one go (rather then only plantuml and ditaa). kroki is free software.
 How could a nice interface for kroki in org-mode look like?

                    <span>​
 I&#x27;m trying to get org-footnote-action to create a footnote in a header under the header I&#x27;m currently working. By default, a footnote is created at the bottom of the buffer, parent-level headers. If I change org-footnote-action to nil, it shows right under the text I am writing, but not other a sub-header to that section. Is there a way to do this with the existing options, or do I need some sort of a function?
 ​
 What I have now (with nil):
 *** This is some sub-header Text goes here, a bunch of lines(footer pointer here) (footer pointer here)this is where the footer ends when i use C-x f **** This is the sub-header of the above header  
 Here&#x27;s what I want:
 *** This is some sub-header Text goes here, a bunch of lines(footer pointer here) **** This is the sub-header of the above header (footer pointer here)this is where I want the marker to be when I hit C-x f 
 Any suggestions? Thanks much!

 I know about the excellent apps Beorg and /r/plainorg — but I am really only looking for a plain text app that can read and syntax highlight my files.

I do not understand the concept of backlinks. What is it and how to use it?
From the meaning of the word I would assume that a &quot;backlink&quot; would create a 1to1 relation by default.
But in &quot;B&quot; is a new and automatic created link (back) to &quot;A&quot;, too.
So what is backlinking about?</span>

                    <span>Connecting my app to a local instance directly on my computer works totally fine. The problem happens when connecting via the service name via docker-compose. Here&#x27;s how the database-connection part looks in my haskell code:
 import Database.MongoDB pipe : does not exist (Connection refused)
 Any idea what I&#x27;m doing wrong? Thanks!

                    <span>The level of indenting changes the meaning of a line in haskell.
 Haskell is a decent programming language, but I don&#x27;t like fine-tuning whitespaces in haskell code. Editor support for haskell auto indentation can be often broken. I don&#x27;t want to manually indent haskell code.
 Perhaps, is there a dialect of haskell that ignores whitespaces?

                    <span>I asked this on the libraries mailing list but thought posting here would bring in potentially more responses. I made a recent change to the behaviour of lookup and find (see here for more details: https://github.com/haskell/containers/pull/800). 
 We would like to make sure this change does not cause regressions to downstream users and so I wanted to ask if any of you knew any projects that make serious use of Intmap with benchmarks available so I could measure changes in performance?
 Cheers!

                    <span>Figured I should post these new ones here, as they _might_ actually be useful for someone else.
 https://hackage.haskell.org/package/merge is a very fancy way to write functions which merge two items of the same type into something else, potentially failing with a validation error. I had all this code like:
 g x y &#x3D; Ploop  f x y  h x y  k x y 
 and I figured I could write a little Applicative wrapper that would manage all of that repetitive application of x and y for me. The interface is something like:
 data User &#x3D; User { pubKey :: PublicKey , names :: Set Text , emails :: Set Text , legalName :: Maybe Text } mergeUsers :: Merge [Text] User User mergeUsers &#x3D; User  required pubKey .? [&quot;public key&quot;]  combine names  combine emails  optional legalName .? [&quot;legal name&quot;] f …</span>

                    <span>Every now and then I come across a situation in which I need to transform a sequence of elements, say a List, but the transformation isn&#x27;t independent for each element and I would need to keep additional state during the loop to perform the transformations I need.
 Let me try to give a simple example. In C# I could write something like
  private static List transformSomeElementFirstTimeItOccurs(List list) { bool done &#x3D; false; var result &#x3D; new List(); foreach (var elem in list) { if (!done &amp;&amp; elem is SomeType) { result.Add(transformElement(elem)); done &#x3D; true; } else { result.Add(elem); } } return result; } 
 My naieve attempt at achieving this in PureScript currently looks as follows.
  transformSomeElementFirstTimeItOccurs :: List ElemType -&gt; List ElemType transformSomeElementFirstTimeItOccurs elems &#x3D; reverse (loop elems).result where loop :: List ElemType -&gt; { done :: Boolean , result :: List ElemType } loop &#x3D; foldl (\{ result, done } elem -&gt; case elem of SomeValueConstructor t -&gt; { result : SomeValueConstructor (if done then t else transformValue t):result , done : true } _ -&gt; { result : elem:result, done }) { result : Nil, done : false } 
 But it feels like it could use some improvement. Is there an idiomatic way to do this kind of thing?

 ).
Also, I spend a lot of time writing those notes, around half an hour per note, sometimes for two hours a day. I have a lot of spare time for the last month, but it is going to change. How much time do you spend on each note? How much time it takes you to decide to where to put the note in the ZettelKasten?
Last question, I have 13 index notes out 100. That sounds okay?</span>

                    <span>Hi folks,
 I am playing around with heterogenous lists. I&#x27;d like to be able to get an item from the list. I have written the following functions:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;haskell getFirst :: HList (e : es) -&gt; e getFirst (HCons e _) &#x3D; e
 getSecond :: HList (e : a : es) -&gt; a getSecond &#x3D; getFirst . rest
 getThird :: HList (e : a : b : es) -&gt; b getThird &#x3D; getSecond . rest
 rest :: HList (e : es) -&gt; HList es rest (HCons _ es) &#x3D; es &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Now, I&#x27;d like to generalize them using a type class:
 haskell class GetIdx (idx :: Nat) where getIdx :: HList (Els idx) -&gt; El (Els idx) idx 
 I have come to the conclusion that it is impossible to write a proper signature for the getIdx method, because a type family must reduce to a concrete type. In other words, I cannot have the following type family:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;haskell
 -- For &quot;Els 0&quot;, I am naively copying the relevant part of the type signature from &quot;getFirst&quot; above. type family Els idx where Els 0 &#x3D; (e : es) Els n &#x3D; e : Els (n - 1) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Is my conclusion that it is impossible to write a getIdx function such that it an be called like getIdx @1 myHList correct? Is my reasoning for why it is impossible to do so also correct?

                    <span>I have been thinking of ways to evolve an implementation (backend) of a type class without affecting user code. It&#x27;s been rolling in my head for a while and I&#x27;m looking for feedback and examples. A good example is the functor hierarchy: all the functor type classes are unified by a general FunctorOf interface but they are defined separately for now. We want to be able to generalize existing type classes without modifying every instance. It should be backwards compatible.
 Functor &#x3D; FunctorOf (-&gt;) (-&gt;) Contravariant &#x3D; FunctorOf () Bifunctor &#x3D; FunctorOf (-&gt;) (-&gt;) (-&gt;) Profunctor &#x3D; FunctorOf () (-&gt;) FFunctor &#x3D; FunctorOf (~&gt;) (-&gt;) HFunctor &#x3D; FunctorOf (~&gt;) (-&gt;) (-&gt;) ExpFunctor &#x3D; FunctorOf () (-&gt;) Linear.Functor &#x3D; FunctorOf (#-&gt;) (#-&gt;) FunctorWithIndex i &#x3D; FunctorOf (Cayley (i …</span>

                    <span>I am having a weird problem, org-agenda scrolls the screen down after refilling.
 ​
 In the below screenshots I show a before and after. All I did was refile one entry under the block &quot;To Refile&quot;
 Before
 ​
 After
 ​
 This is moderately annoying, any help would be greatly appreciated!
 ​
 EDIT:
 This seems to be a hack that works a little better than wrapping (org-agenda-refile) in a save-excursion expression. That said, it feels pretty hacky so advice is very welcome.
 ​
 (defun jds/org-agenda-refile ()
 &quot;org-agenda-refile but saves excursion.&quot;
 (interactive)
 (let ((cpoint (point))
 (minpoint (window-start)))
 (org-agenda-refile)
 (set-window-start (selected-window) minpoint)
 (goto-char cpoint)))

                    <span>EDIT: _viz_ showed that is an existing functionality, I tested and is working, just open more windows horizontally and then use follow mode
 -------------
 HI, I am trying since few days org mode and have millions of lines of documents. The idea would be to read ONE document really long in 4 or 5 different columns. I noticed that if I open an emacs instance I do not need too much width, so I can exploit the height of my laptop enlarging vertically the file, but the height is limited to around 25 cms in a laptop. Because org does not wrap the content on default, I can open an instance vertically in 1/5 of the screen width, so 4/5 of the screen are not used at all! There is an option to open a subsection on the right of the first instance, but why not opening different columns and see all the long document or almost, so that in one single screen we may have an outline on 2-3- 4 or even 5 columns on almost all the document. So that we may scroll one column for instance the second and so the all the columns also scroll accordingly, so that we can see for instance almost all the chapters of a huge book , then could open some paragraphs title of chapter 33 and 56, and compare them together, move content in seconds etc. The simple idea is that people say mindmaps give more an helicopter vision of all the document(and in fact mind maps take all the screen), everyone in the org community debates if files should have links or stay in a single file.Why not giving to the users the possibility to open multiple columns with scrolling integration, so that the user can see huge documents with a glance, be more creative, modify things, search occurrences, it would be genial imo, because org supports different colors per level on default, and would be really easy to spot the structure and be more efficient, combine new ideas creatively, never miss the big picture, etc

                    <span>I suck with dependency stuff :( Nothing ever seems to work and I can never seem to understand why. I&#x27;m trying to spago build this tictactoe game. What I&#x27;ve done so far is spago init and added a few dependencies to spago.dhall, which now looks like this
 , dependencies &#x3D; [ &quot;console&quot; , &quot;effect&quot; , &quot;prelude&quot; , &quot;psci-support&quot; , &quot;debug&quot; , &quot;css&quot; , &quot;arrays&quot; , &quot;integers&quot; , &quot;maybe&quot; , &quot;tuples&quot; , &quot;halogen&quot; , &quot;foldable-traversable&quot; ] 
 Running build again I get the following errors: https://pastebin.com/cUutNNn4
 What, why? Debug.Trace comes from package debug and Halogen.HTML.CSS comes from package halogen, both of which I have there.
 What do I need to do please?
 Is there any tool that can take a look at the import statements used in a project and solve the dependencies based on that?

                    <span>I&#x27;m using the following debug function for print statements while debugging.
 import Prelude import Effect.Console (log) import Effect.Unsafe (unsafePerformEffect) debug :: forall a. String -&gt; a -&gt; a debug msg &#x3D; snd $ unsafePerformEffect $ log msg snd :: forall a b. a -&gt; b -&gt; b snd _ b &#x3D; b 
 This would then be used as follows
 myFuncBeingDebugged a b c &#x3D; &quot;test: &quot;  show a # debug $ someOtherFunc $ b c bla... 
 Are there ways to improve the debugging experience? (I&#x27;m using VSCode if that matters)

                    <span>More specifically just want to know 
  
are there any libraries/frameworks commonly used in the industry
 do they use the purely FP or a hybrid of OO/FP
  
I know it really depends on the specific company but best guess is okay

                    <span>So, I was watching a popular Spark using Scala tutorial on Udemy and there I came across this syntax for regex matching:
 val theUltimateAnswer: String &#x3D; &quot;To life, the universe, and everything is 42.&quot; val pattern &#x3D; &quot;&quot;&quot;.* ([\d]+).*&quot;&quot;&quot;.r val pattern(answerString) &#x3D; theUltimateAnswer 
 I am beginner in Scala but I have some knowledge of programming with other languages and this syntax does not make sense to me because it should have been the other way round no?
 Like given below:
 val theUltimateAnswer: String &#x3D; &quot;To life, the universe, and everything is 42.&quot; val pattern &#x3D; &quot;&quot;&quot;.* ([\d]+).*&quot;&quot;&quot;.r val answerString &#x3D; pattern(theUltimateAnswer) 
 ​
 Apologies if I have posted a duplicate question, I have searched related topics but I am getting no relevant results which explain this weird syntax.

                    <span>So...
 Back in the past, something around 2013, we had amazing libs like Scalatra, Finatra, Finagle, Finch, Akka and Play(blergh) in scala ecosystem.
 In that time developers, at least me, used to write code around Finatra or Finagle and now it seems like everything is built around Akka.
 Why Akka became the de-facto solution?

                    <span>Dear haskellers,
 There are many situations where string literals are used, for example in Hakyll website
 I&#x27;m looking for a way to type-check something like this:
 {-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-} import Data.String (IsString(..)) data Shape &#x3D; Triangle | Square | Circle instance IsString Shape where fromString &quot;s&quot; &#x3D; Square fromString &quot;^&quot; &#x3D; Triangle fromString &quot;c&quot; &#x3D; Circle fromString _ &#x3D; undefined myShape :: Shape myShape &#x3D; &quot;^&quot; -- Triangle invalid :: Shape invalid &#x3D; &quot;foobar&quot; 
 Is possible for invalid to not typecheck? I&#x27;m OK with using any language extension

                    <span>Hello. 
 I use org-mode for a couple of years already. And it&#x27;s a great productivity tool.
 The only disappointment for me is its logo. It looks like a bad drawing from a child. 
 I don&#x27;t think it would be hard to find someone willing to design a logo. I know the important part is the tool itself but still, a good logo will bring more people to org-mode (and emacs in general).

                    <span>I&#x27;ve tried this and, as far as I can tell, it doesn&#x27;t fontify anything.
 I&#x27;m mainly looking to fontify ID links which have IDs that don&#x27;t exist.

                    <span>As an interesting and fun learning project, I&#x27;ve written my first python script. And I love to share it with you. I&#x27;ve exposed The Archive to explorations of the quantitative eye. You can look into mine and look into your own archive.
If you are a coder, I know you have many other things on your busy schedules, but I&#x27;m asking if you&#x27;d take a couple of minutes to look at my coding attempt and offer whatever help you want. Even just pointing me where or what to look for would be a great help.

Announcing Evoke, a GHC plugin for deriving type class instances quickly by Taylor Fausak
I’m excited to announce Evoke, a GHC plugin that automatically derives type class instances without using generics or Template Haskell.
Deferred Derivation by Matt Parsons
Freeing a module from Template Haskell speeds up our build tremendously - not because Template Haskell is slow (it’s very fast) but because compiling at all is slow. The best way to speed something up is to spend 0 time doing it — don’t do it at all!

                    <span>If there is a way to easily send the current selection to org-capture from the Linux terminal? I am using gnome-terminal, but can switch to some other if they offer this feature.

                    <span>How many times a day or even hour do you use and rely upon Org Mode? How much easier does it make your life? What would you do if it was no longer actively developed or supported?
 Think about this, and then reflect that this is completely free to use, the product of countless hours of labour. 
 If you are in a position to do so, consider making an ongoing donation to support its development and longevity.

                    <span>It appears that the parser sees em-dashes and double-hyphens immediately following a block quote as part of the quote, while single-hyphens are considered a separate line.
Will that be a lasting convention? I can&#x27;t seem to find any documentation on this, but would like to take advantage of the convention if so.</span>

                    <span>Hi,
 Has anyone had experience in using a dedicated display (an iPad, a tablet, or a small standalone monitor) to always display the org-agenda view? I would like to constantly have it in view, but I&#x27;m not sure where to start with setting this up. I have a macbook pro and an iPad, but I would prefer not to use a separate app like BeOrg, since I&#x27;m very used to looking at the agenda as I&#x27;ve configured it.
 Thanks.

                    <span>I&#x27;m doing some recreational writing using org-mod. I like it so far. Great. I think I&#x27;ve gotten best results using pandoc to create a PDF, but the results are beautiful. I could do the same from within emacs I&#x27;m sure.
 I have one file per chapter, which is natural and works for me. I can maybe be dissuaded. I think every file wants a &#x60;#+TITLE:&#x60;, at least because pandoc requires it or complains. If I output &quot;one chapter&quot; (file), everything looks great. The (chapter) title looks just the way I like it.
 If I do the following with pandoc:
 pandoc -s *.org -o my_book.pdf 
 The problem is that the titles of the chapters end up all mashed together at the top of the document. Everything is more or less perfect.
 Should I maybe just not do this and manage this as one big doc, using hideability to deal with the unwieldiness? I could be convinced.

                    <span>I use windmove to move windows. I have the following setup: 
  (use-package windmove :bind ((&quot;C-S-j&quot; . windmove-left) (&quot;C-S-l&quot; . windmove-right) (&quot;C-S-i&quot; . windmove-up) (&quot;C-S-k&quot; . windmove-down))) 
 However, in org buffers, the C-S-i binding gets overwritten. I can not figure out how it is being overwritten. It seems like it is doing org-cycle global as it will cycle all headers in the file. When I do C-h k I get this: 
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; S-TAB runs the command org-shifttab (found in org-mode-map), which is an interactive compiled Lisp function in ‘org.el’.
 It is bound to , S-TAB, , ,   ,    . &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; The binding C-S-i doesn&#x27;t show up in C-h m or C-h b either. The other windmove bindings do show up in C-h b though. When I&#x27;m in another buffer with a different mode all of my windmove bindings work fine. It seems to just happen with org buffers.
 I&#x27;m really scratching my head as I can&#x27;t find any smoking gun to what&#x27;s actually being called or how it is bound.

                    <span>i am very new to emacs, and i saw all the great things a person can do with it.
 all i want to do is this
 setup three &quot;lists&quot; (sorry i don&#x27;t know what to call them but these are like (backlog-doing-done)
 so basically the item starts in BACKLOG and then it moves to DOING when checked and then it moves to DONE when checked.
 I saw a talk about refile but i didn&#x27;t know how to use it.
 you can just direct me to another thred or article if you think it&#x27;s simple to not be ELI5.
 thanks!
 edit: wow thank you guys, i didn&#x27;t think i would get so many answers. i guess after i would go with org-kanban i know that kanban is intended to use within teams; but i lime the concept of having a backlog that is &quot;messy&quot; and than pulling just one or two feautures to focus on building!

                    <span>I am trying to have a consistent theme across some apps and I&#x27;m looking for a way to tangle my conf/css files using color variables but can&#x27;t figure out how to do it.
 The documentation says CSS doesn&#x27;t support header arguments, and for conf-mode it&#x27;s just not mentioned in the list of languages.
 If you have an alternative to achieve this I would appreciate the suggestions.

                    <span>I am interested in developing an application with pursecript that would work with diagrams drawn by the user. I&#x27;m looking for a library/package that would provide the drawing functionality for me to minimise development time. I&#x27;m thinking of functionality somewhat like Microsoft Visio (e.g. place shapes, connect shapes, move shapes, autorouting of connectors etc.). 
 Are there any libraries/packages either natively or wrapped in purescript? Failing that, are there any suitable javascript libraries I could use through FFI?
 Everything I&#x27;ve found myself is either a dead project, intended for data display (i.e. graphs), static (i.e. closer to MS Paint than Visio) or contains too much functionality (e.g. more general rendering libraries for games or multimedia). I&#x27;d rather not roll my own if I can help it :)
 Any help or advice you could provide would be appreciated.

                    <span>With recent changes to The Archive, I&#x27;ve noticed one oddity in my old notes - perhaps worth pointing out.
First, I create a new note using @Will &#x27;s Keyboard Maestro macro.  An empty new note looks like:

Now, I noticed when going into older Zettels, that my internal and external references were getting bolded as shown below (this is from the end of a note on &quot;Equality in Death&quot; containing my comments on a Daily Stoic post of the same title):

I found that to get back to the format I was expecting, I had to add a carriage return after the last bit of text (which was not required previously):

From the perspective of The Archive and how it operates, this is a minor, silly item, but the extra bolding bothers me aesthetically and so I find myself obsessively going through old zettles, adding a carriage return near the end.</span>

                    <span>Looking over I see the use of thearchive://matchOrCreate/TERM is suppose to create a document with the TERM.  However, if the document doesn&#x27;t exist, it looks like it&#x27;s creating a zettel with just a new Zettel ID.</span>

                    <span>In this post, I’ll show how to build a Go project with Bazel,
using Gazelle to generate the build files.
Why Bazel?
With Bazel, I get incremental, reproducible, and cacheable builds.
It’s designed for large, polyglot monorepos
and can be extended to support more languages than the many already available.
Why Gazelle?
Gazelle looks at the Go source files and generates Bazel BUILD files for me.
I used tendermint
as an example Go project, because it’s large
enough to include several interesting problems:
protocol buffers
external dependencies
runtime dependencies
flaky and exclusive tests
How will we be able to tell when it’s finished?
At the end, we’ll be able to build targets for all of the Go sources,
$ bazel build //...

run tests,
$ bazel test //...

and execute the tendermint binary.

                    <span>The Collector&#x27;s Fallacy, which Christian Tietze has written about, is an example of the Exploration-Exploitation Dilemma, also known as the multi-armed bandit problem.  From Wikipedia:

  
The multi-armed bandit problem models an agent that simultaneously attempts to acquire new knowledge (called &quot;exploration&quot;) and optimize their decisions based on existing knowledge (called &quot;exploitation&quot;). The agent attempts to balance these competing tasks in order to maximize their total value over the period of time considered.


In the case of the Collector, the &quot;agent&quot; explores indefinitely and adds to their collection but postpones making the decision to do something with it. Wikipedia gives a list of practical applications of the multi-armed bandit problem, but I can&#x27;t resist pointing out that the problem of deciding which professor&#x27;s class to take is almost never counted among such lists, perhaps because professors compile them. Someone choosing among Zettelkasten implementations without really settling on one is another.
Given that the multi-armed bandit problem has a name, has been extensively studied since at least the middle of the twentieth century and has been solved in important cases, one question is whether some of these solutions could guide the Collector toward more productive uses of their time.</span>

                    <span>Hello everyone, I hope you are all well. Greetings from Chile.
I hope you can help me. When working on my zettelkasten, I want to link my new permanent notes to old permanent notes, whose number is growing over time, obviously. Because of this large number, it becomes increasingly difficult for me to find an existing permanent note to link with. I wish you could advise me how to make this task easier or how you do it.</span>

Any shared experiences re mathematics research in your zettelkasten would be great.


I think this deserves a discussion of its own, with a more telling title than the one where it came up.
@bradfordfournier - I hope you are OK with this.</span>
