                    <span>I am quite new to ZK method but I thought I understand the basic types of zettels, e.g. literature notes. While watching a workflow video about ZK I saw literature notes that make me wonder that I did not understand it yet.
This is how I do it
When reading a text and &quot;marking important&quot; parts I make a zettel of each part. Here are two examples from the same book but different:
# Shape of the world

The world is a ball.

Source: Bob (1876). The world. p.47

A second one.
# Alternative Shape of the world

Others think the world is a cube.

Source: Bob (1876). The world. p.419

You see: Two informations from two pages of the same book. This is how I would do this.
But in the video I saw two other interesting approaches. I would like to know how do you do this.
Alternative approach A
Approach one is to separate the source itself as zettel.
# Book: Bob 1876 The world

Full Reference:
Bob (1876). The world

Then the two informations
# Shape of the world

The world is a ball.

[link to &quot;Book: Bob 1876 The world&quot;] p.47

A second one.
# Alternative Shape of the world

Others think the world is a cube.

[link to &quot;Book: Bob 1876 The world&quot;] p.419

Alternative approach B
This is the other way around. The bibliographic zettel also holds the TOC of the book and link to the informations zettel form there.
   # Book: Bob 1876 The world

   Full Reference:
   Bob (1876). The world

   TOC
   1. Introduction
   2. Chapter X
   [link to &quot;Book: Bob 1876 The world&quot;] p.47

   3. Chapter A
   3.5. sub
   [link to &quot;Book: Bob 1876 The world&quot;] p.419

And the other two zettel.</span>

                    <span>Not sure what one would call this; &quot;related buffers&quot; is a bit weird. Here&#x27;s an example, maybe you can help figuring out the term?
  
Visit a couple of files in a project folder (e.g. root has a .git/)
 Visit a couple channels on IRC via erc for team chat with colleagues
 Open 2 emails from your boss for reference
  
I usually navigate around by C-x b and filtering from there; sorted by recency, it makes switching back and forth simple.
 But let&#x27;s say I have a potato computer and usually only 1 frame with 1 window open at a time or whatever, so the default is I look at 1 buffer. When I&#x27;m in IRC, I want to switch to other IRC buffers easily -- look at other channels, direct messages, whatever. Focus on these, don&#x27;t show any other buffer in the suggestions.
 When I&#x27;ve switched to the project code, let&#x27;s say I want to focus on other project buffers. (project.el and projectile do this already)
 Same with email: When I&#x27;m reading mail, show another mail buffer plz. Don&#x27;t show me the IRC buffers or code.
  
I bet this has a name and tons of implementations, but I cannot figure this out. Like the ibuffer groupings work, maybe, but for buffer switching, ignoring stuff that&#x27;s not in the current group.
 Any hints what to look for to narrow down the list of all buffers to &quot;related&quot; buffers?
 To write this myself, I&#x27;d filter (buffer-list) by condition(s), and pick a conditions based on context. E.g. if major mode is ERC, filter buffers by erc-mode:
 (require &#x27;seq) (seq-filter (lambda (buf) (let ((buffer-major-mode (with-current-buffer buf major-mode))) (eq buffer-major-mode #&#x27;erc-mode))) (buffer-list)) 
 Is that a thing already?

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been doing all the searches I can, but unfortunately, nothing is helping me with this. I am attempting to get Emacs set up to my liking for a lot of things (Python, Org Mode, LaTeX), but I am running into a problem.
 You see, I keep running afoul of company-mode, in that it decides at the last minute to produce a list of words associated with what I&#x27;m typing, and then, when I press enter (for a completely unrelated reason), it accepts the first choice, despite the fact that I had already typed what I wanted.
 No biggie, I just need to unset  for &#x27;company-complete-selection, right? Maybe move it onto something a little less used, like M-.
 Except I have no idea how to do that. I don&#x27;t want to unset  globally, as I just want to remove the binding for company-mode, and since I use straight in my configs for installing and maintaining packages, I don&#x27;t want to edit the original source (since any updates will overwrite it).
 Is there a method to unset  for &#x27;company-complete-selection that I should be using?

                    <span>Hello there.
 Recently, a video about GopCaml-mode has been made and published on this subreddit. The package itself is pretty good, and it left me wondering: What is the state of structural editing in Emacs, right now?
 Obviously, we have packages like Paredit and Lispy, recently we got SymEx, but these are all for the Lisp family of languages, where syntactic redundancy is very high because of the homoiconicity.
 I wonder if things like LSP can get us some level of standardized structural editing constructs for a set of languages supported by it. That would be really cool.

                    <span>Is there a magit function to get a simple sate of a repository given its path? I just want the status to reflect if there are uncommitted changes and/or untracked files. 
 I can call a git process directly to get this info and not use magit at all, but I prefer to use existing functionality if it exists.

                    <span>My setup has been to launch Emacs as a daemon in a runit userland service and set $EDITOR to connect to it, with --fg-daemon&#x3D; in the former and --socket-name&#x3D; in the latter.
 On my new computer, however, this isn&#x27;t working - emacsclient always says it can&#x27;t connect to the socket name, killing all daemon instances except for one (without a socket name) isn&#x27;t connected to by emacsclient, and (all) variants of emacsclient -t -a &quot;&quot; (run twice to generate a daemon and then connect from a client) foreground themselves (?) and print the contents of *Messages* to stdout (???).
 My new computer is running Void (like the old); the big difference between my computer which works and the one which doesn&#x27;t is that the new one uses ZFS. That shouldn&#x27;t make a difference, though. Otherwise, init.org is the sole source of truth, and the only file copied - everything else was installed by way of tangling to init.el and running its straight.el-integrated use-package recipes.
 I&#x27;ve tried to find out what&#x27;s going wrong by way of Google, then IRC. I don&#x27;t know what to precisely search up and don&#x27;t have the time. Does anyone know what&#x27;s going on?

                    <span>I recently upgraded my emacs config to now use the master branch instead of version 28-ish, and obviously I’ve run into some troubles with my config in the process that are a little different. 
 Before, I was able to have all my packages loaded without using the (package-initialize) function. However now if I run my config like this, (without initializing) I just get an error saying it cannot load use-package, which I use instead of package.el for loading and such.

                    <span>I use Gnus for my email solution, using GetMail to pop my various email servers to local and then parse them into gnus/notmuch. Works like a dream. The trouble is synchronizing sent mail. The solution I&#x27;ve used for several years is to automatically hide a BCC on everything I write, which sends to a sent-mail inbox that each of my PCs gets. Trouble is, not all information is saved in such a case. In particular, any other BCCs I have on the message are lost. This is a problem for the times I need to do &quot;undisclosed&quot; recipients lists. The answer seems like FCC field, which I notice NotMuch attempts to add on its own on the occasions I have mistakenly tried to write something through a NotMuch route. Trouble is, the notmuch default is relative to wherever directory location I am when I invoked it. Also, I read in the docs that things are appended to said location as mbox, like my spools, which means I need to think about how I am parsing that FCC thing.
 Before I dig in to a solved problem, how is anyone else making the most of FCC? Where do you put it, how do you parse it, do you put it in version control, etc?

                    <span>Hey all, I&#x27;m thinking about switching to org-mode from Notion; I&#x27;m a student, a software developer, an activist, am into self-development, journaling, cooking recipes, financial literacy, writing, etc. 
 So you could say I&#x27;m utilizing All of Notion&#x27;s features and really need them (especially tables, linked pages, images). Obviously Notion&#x27;s way buff\heavy, has bad security and isn&#x27;t keyboard optimized, so I wonder how close can emacs get to it. 
 Please give me your best propaganda !

 I wish to use eMacs org mode alongside devonthink. Does anyone have any tips on how to use them? Flexible as org mode is, there are many forms of media that it couldn’t quite handle. It’d be awesome if anyone can tell me a bit about their workflow

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been using Emacs for quite some time, but recently I wanted to try a more &quot;modern&quot; app just to see how it goes. I went with Notion, and what an great app. I got some ideas and thoughts like &quot;that would be cool to have in Emacs&quot;. So how is your note taking workflow and what do you do to make Emacs feel less 80s ( UI packages and general functionalities)?
 EDIT: I should have explained better, what I liked is things like tables, Notion tables are incredible, you can easily replace a sheet editor like Google Sheets with it, the layout is really modular, you can organize the text in whatever way you want. The embeding stuff are really cool too, like calendar inside the file. So what I meant by modern is a interface that lets you do more functional stuff, like the tables that are not only pretty, but so useful.

                    <span>I&#x27;m guessing that the main reason why most programming languages can&#x27;t enforce &#x27;lazy evaluation&#x27; is because of mutability.
 Regardless, as I&#x27;m learning and falling in love with Haskell&#x27;s inner workings, I&#x27;m struggling to thing of ways in which strict evaluation outperforms lazy evaluation (or examples where it is better to use strict evaluation compared to lazy evaluation).
 The only real thing I can think of is that Lazy evaluation requires more memory management than strict since you need to store &quot;potential computations&quot; that have yet to be done. But other than that I can&#x27;t think of more examples

                    <span>I feel that my Haskell program sometimes consumes so much memory that it goes beyond a reasonable amount and chokes up the system. 
 I can understand that I can add some option like +RTS -M8g or something to limit my memory usage to 8g, but I do not understand where to add this to my stack.yaml file.
 The relevant part of my stack file looks like this:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; executables: mnrl-exe: main: Main.hs source-dirs: app ghc-options: - -threaded - -rtsopts - -with-rtsopts&#x3D;-N - -O2 dependencies: - mnrl
 tests: mnrl-test: main: Spec.hs source-dirs: test ghc-options: - -threaded - -rtsopts - -with-rtsopts&#x3D;-N - -O2 dependencies: - mnrl
 benchmarks: mnrl-bench: main: Benchmark.hs source-dirs: benchmark ghc-options: - -threaded - -rtsopts - -with-rtsopts&#x3D;-N - -O2 dependencies: - mnrl &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 I usually use stack bench to run my benchmarks. What option should I add to my ghc-options?
 Also, what is the meaning of -with-rtsopts&#x3D;-N?

                    <span>Hey guys,
 ​
 I am slowly but surely learning some haskell. I am going through the book &quot;learnyouahaskell&quot; and try to write the code before it is shown. I am currently at a binary search tree example and I don&#x27;t understand the warning I get. Or lets say, I don&#x27;t know why I get that warning. I don&#x27;t think that these cases can even happen.
 The warning
 Pattern match(es) are non-exhaustive
 In an equation for &#x27;insertInBinaryTree&#x27;:
 Patterns not matched:
 (Node _ EmptyTree EmptyTree) _
 (Node _ EmptyTree ( Node _ _ _)) _
 (Node _ (Node _ _ _) EmptyTree) _
 (Node _ (Node _ _ _) (Node _ _ _)) _
 I mean lets take &quot;Node _ EmptyTree EmptyTree _&quot;. How am I supposed to know whether it will be in the leftTree or rightTree?
 ​
 What did I forget to specify/constrain? Or what am I missing?
 The code is here:

                    <span>I know that there are much better/fancier approaches to dealing with parameters in generics (e.g., kind-generics, and the GenericN class in Csongor Kiss&#x27;s generic-lens). But I figured it would be fun to implement a (left-associated) version of Generic1 using Generic. It seems it&#x27;s been possible for just a few GHC versions now: it requires quantified constraints and data families with polykinded result along with a whole zoo of older GHC extensions. Here it is!
 Note: I definitely borrowed some marking ideas from Csongor, though I use them a bit differently.

                    <span>Say I have several org mode files. One org file includes some code blocks that are useful as a foundation for other projects. I want to use in other org files the code blocks in this foundemental file.
 For example, one implements a lot functions for modular arithmetic. Now he want to use it for implementing RSA, and Diffie-Hellman algorithms.
 How this could be archived?

                    <span>I have node project (type: module in package.json) and I use typescript lang server.
 want to make this work: import { scaleBand } from &quot;d3-scale&quot;; but can&#x27;t figure out how. require-ing it works fine.
 autocomplete and lsp-find-definition don&#x27;t work, with the latter giving this error
 helm-M-x-execute-command: Wrong type argument: (or eieio-object class), #s(xref-item #(&quot;export function scaleBand(&quot; 16 25 (face highlight)) #s(xref-file-location &quot;/Users/xxx/Library/Caches/typescript/4.2/node_modules/@types/d3-scale/index.d.ts&quot; 2517 16)), obj 
 edit: 
 eldoc works, no the symbol&#x27;s type is known to lsp. autocomplete is actually OK.
 however it&#x27;s not about import vs. require. The destructuring seems to cause the problem. Doing like bellow causes no errors, but still does not navigate to the definition inside the d3-scale module.
 import d3_scale from &quot;d3-scale&quot;; const { scaleBand } &#x3D; d3_scale;

                    <span>I was following this helpful video from System Crafters (https://youtu.be/AfkrzFodoNw).
 The only thing that I had some troubles was to export my org-roam ID links. 
 Tinkering a little with the build-site.el from the video, I did some changes to make it work. 
 I want to share with the community if anyone find it useful.

 Is there some way to only start lsp sessions for active perspectives, or more generally, active buffers and pause/stop sessions when they &quot;go to the background&quot;?

                    <span>tl;dr; Do most people set their org-roam-directory to be the same as org-dictionary? And those that do not - why not?
 I have used pure org for my note taking &amp; TODOs so far. However I do think I would benefit from org-roam/zettelkasten for subset of what I need - keeping a personal knowledge base (debugging history, analyzing problems, keeping track of stuff that has a potentially longer-term benefit, more wishy-washy &quot;plans&quot;).
 What triggered this question was the fact that org-roam does not reuse org directory but has a separate variable for its roam directory. So I wondered if there was a reason to have org files that are not also roam files. One reason that came up was that the number of roam files can grow significantly and org-agenda would get slower and slower. So...
 My current setup idea is this:
  
I separate out org files from roam (or rather have roam files in a subdirectory of org directory)
 Use roam for knowledge-base, journal etc
 I generally won&#x27;t do TODOs etc in roam files, but instead have a TODOs/Schedules in ordinary org (and these files are going to be part of agenda files)
  
Basically - use org-roam for idea/note taking that might or might not be related to tasks but don&#x27;t actually mix tasks into the zettels. Zettels could be referenced/linked to from tasks if needed (i.e. if some information/knowledge could be useful to get the task done)
 I read through https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/hg2m5s/zettelkastenorgroamorgbrain_is_crap/ as an example of discussion of problems/benefits (though I realize that&#x27;s for roam v1 and quite out of date I expect most problems to be the same currently).
 Does anyone use a similar split? How is it? What would I miss (I can imagine referencing agenda items from zettels might be useful etc). If you think I should just merge the two and use org-roam - how do you deal with agenda? Fixed set of agenda files (subset of roam files)?
 Hope the above makes sense...

 ![img](f75h0j1zzct71 &quot;(Left) SVG widget in Emacs buffer (Right) SVG image &quot;)
 Now you can use SVG widget in GNU Emacs. That is, use an SVG image or fragment as background for push-button widget in Emacs buffer. You can also specify the width and height of the widget for finer control. Generally speaking, you can use any type of image for this purpose. But SVG suits best because you can draw widget of any size without any distortion.

                    <span>Hi guys,
 I&#x27;m trying to develop flutter apps with emacs, I&#x27;ve tried lsp-mode + lsp-dart and it worked just fine... my only problem was that it was too slow, my emacs was very laggy (it might be the lsp server that is slow, but at least I could be able C-n C-p continually without lag while emacs waits for server response)... it had lots of features which probably contributed to this.
 I found dart-server which seems like it only requires dartanalyzer and not also dart language server, I tried it on a single test file and some features works. However, when I tried it with my flutter project it didn&#x27;t work although it booted up the dartanalyzer I&#x27;m wondering if dart-server still works or is a viable option for dart/flutter dev in emacs.
 Also, what&#x27;re your thoughts on eglot, does it stay out of my way until I request for features just like dart-server (e.g. C-c ? to give details about symbol under point, or M-/ for auto completions, rather than constant popups in miniframes and the echo area)
 This subreddit has been so helpful in my journey with emacs... thank you all
 EDIT:: sorry for wasting your time, after trying a few times, dart-server seems to work in the flutter project (also some things still aren&#x27;t working, like flycheck support and intelligent completion with M-/). However, I&#x27;m still curious about eglot... I&#x27;d like some of the lsp features, but mainly on-demand

                    <span>Hi
 I currently have a course at my uni where we need to rewrite default Haskell functions, and group was the first to get me a bit lost.
 However, I think I managed a way to do it with the knowledge I currently have, so let me know what you think of it!
 group :: Eq a &#x3D;&gt; [a] -&gt; [[a]]
 group [p] &#x3D; [[p]]
 group (p:listtail) &#x3D; if p &#x3D;&#x3D; (head listtail) then (p:(head (group listtail))):(tail (group listtail)) else [p]:(group listtail)

                    <span>Problem
 So I&#x27;m writing an app that of course works on a lot of data. So far all of the data was kept in a running program, after it was initially loaded from files. Before closing the app the data should be saved into the same files again.
 This has problems: - huge memory usage, unsustainable - there can be exceptions on save, better to have the data be saved incrementally and not loose it all.
 Solution?
 I want to add some database (is there other solution?). In a nutshell I want a simple library, best if can use existing Aeson JSON encodings or can generate all the typeclasses automatically. Complicating matters - I may need to combine in one atomic block both database and STM transactions.
 Here in more detail:

                    <span>I am trying to implement some functions on graphs which are like this:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; module Graph.Algorithms where
 import Data.Set (Set) import qualified Data.Set as Set
 foldGraph :: Ord v &#x3D;&gt; (v -&gt; x -&gt; x) -- operation -&gt; x -- initial value -&gt; [v] -- initial states -&gt; (v -&gt; [v]) -- successors -&gt; x -- final value foldGraph op init inits succ &#x3D; go Set.empty inits where go _ [] &#x3D; init go sofar (v:vs) | Set.member v sofar &#x3D; go sofar vs | otherwise &#x3D; v op (go (Set.insert v sofar) ((succ v) ++ vs))
 collectGraph :: Ord v &#x3D;&gt; (v -&gt; [x]) -- result at each vertex -&gt; [v] -- initial vertices -&gt; (v -&gt; [v]) -- successors -&gt; [x] collectGraph forv &#x3D; foldGraph (\v x -&gt; forv v ++ x) []
 reachability :: Ord v &#x3D;&gt; [v] -- initial states -&gt; (v -&gt; [v]) -- successors -&gt; (v -&gt; Bool) -- final states -&gt; Bool reachability inits succ final &#x3D; foldGraph (\v x -&gt; final v || x) False inits succ &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Is this the best way to implement these algorithms? I plan to use this on graphs whose vertices are something like (Maybe Int, Maybe Int, Bool).
 I feel that this implementation is taking way too long on bigger (but not so big) graphs. For example, consider
 reachability [1] (\x -&gt; [x + 1]) ( &#x3D;&#x3D; 100000000)
 When I run this on GHCi, it blows up (takes a huge amount of RAM). But a python implementation using python&#x27;s set returns like within 100 seconds or so.
 How can I improve on the performance of these algorithms?

                    <span>I have a situation where I want to run a Megaparsec parser on a string that is the result of another Megaparsec action (not a final parse result). As an example, suppose I want to apply my expression parser on the contents of a Haskell-style line comment block within a larger program:
 -- x + -- y + z 
 Since I don&#x27;t want my expression parser to worry about linebreaks being followed by --, the best approach I can come up with is to have a parser that extracts the contents of the line comment block, discards the -- prefixes, and then parses the resulting string. I can run the top-level parse function to essentially invoke a sub-parser, but this raises some questions:
  
How do I best propagate any parse errors to the top parser?
 How do I obtain the file name of the input?
 Is there another way to do this?
  
Instead of running an entirely new inner parser, I might also be able to play games with stateInput, but I&#x27;m not sure what the rules are for messing about with the state at that level.

                    <span>When programming in JS or PHP, given that their package managers (npm/composer) actually download the source under /node_modules/ or /vendor/ ... in most editors/IDEs, from your own project&#x27;s source code that references any packages, you can just ctrl-click something you imported from them, to navigate into the package&#x27;s source code.
 Is there some simple way to do this with Haskell?
 Or is it completely different given that it&#x27;s a compiled language? 
 I see can under ~/.cabal/store/ that it contains packages I&#x27;ve used in a project. But it looks to all be binary .hi files. Does the source code not even exist on my computer?
 If I want to navigate the package locally in my editor, obviously I can find it on github/etc and download a copy. But is that basically the only way to get a local copy of the source? Or is there something more efficient for packages that I&#x27;m already using in a project?
 I know you can browse on Hackage in your web browser, which is cool... but nowhere near as efficient as my normal editor where I do all my code navigating normally.
 I&#x27;m using vscode, and Cabal.

 It seems to me in many instances you could simply define:
 duplicate wa &#x3D; fmap (\_ -&gt; wa) wa extend wab wa &#x3D; fmap (\_ -&gt; wab wa) wa 
 Is this true for all instances? If so, the class is a lot less interesting than it seems.

                    <span>You must use recursion to define ted and you must do so from “scratch”. That is, other than the cons operator, head, tail, and comparisons, you should not use any functions from the Haskell library.
 This is what I have so far
 ted :: Ord a &#x3D;&gt; [a] -&gt; [a] ted xs &#x3D; go (maximum xs) xs where go _ [] &#x3D; [] go m (x:xs) | m &#x3D;&#x3D; x &#x3D; go m xs | otherwise &#x3D; x : go m xs 
 The program is to satisfy all these conditions.

                    <span>This might not be a new thing for many of you but in my last video I had made casual remarks about how easily you can define your own mergesort function instead of the sort function in Data.List module. Well, I took a stab at it and made an episode out of it on YouTube.

 Do check it out and as always, any feedback is highly appreciated. Thanks in advance!!

                    <span>Hey all, emacs noob here. I am trying to add a flowchart to my org-mode doc. I am following this guide: https://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-dot-diagrams.html however it does not work for me.
 Software:
 - OS: MacOS 11.6 - emacs: GNU Emacs 27.2 via brew - dot: dot - graphviz version 2.49.1 (20210923.0004) - pdftex: pdfTeX 3.141592653-2.6-1.40.22 (TeX Live 2021) 
 The error I get is:
 Symbol’s function definition is void: org-babel-execute:dot 
 If I add to my initialization file
 (org-babel-do-load-languages &#x27;org-babel-load-languages &#x27;((dot . t) (emacs-lisp . t))) (require &#x27;cl) 
 I get:
 Symbol’s value as variable is void: params 
 Any Idea how to move forward? Im thinking the documentation is out of date or not for the versions I have :(

                    <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;m wondering if anyone&#x27;s moved from org-mode to other note-taking systems, such as a personal wiki, or markdown in vim, or switched and switched back to org-mode. What caused you to switch? If you switched back, why?
 Thanks.

                    <span>Hey,
 I just took a job that was largely JVM-focused. I&#x27;m not new to the JVM; I&#x27;ve done previous work in Java (1.6/Android) and spent a large chunk of time writing Clojure. My previous work has been in Haskell, which I liked. I guess my question is: Is Scala worth it now? I have a larger Java codebase I&#x27;ll be integrating with, and I get to choose what JVM technologies to use, and other folks have expressed interest in Scala as well. I&#x27;d feel guilty for pushing Clojure on them, just because I know it, but I&#x27;ve also been there and done that, and I like types now.
 Coming from Haskell, are there functional libraries I should build upon but allow for escape hatch style mutability for some of my not so functional teammates? We&#x27;re a small team, and pedagogy will be a part of the gig. 
 I&#x27;m looking for honest opinions of the language and what essential reading material/libraries would be for someone more comfortable with FP in general. I&#x27;m not opposed to pragmatism either; it&#x27;s one thing I like about Scala. It seems like there&#x27;s a lot of excellent libraries because of the existing JVM ecosystem.
 Thanks!

                    <span>I decided to try out the dashboard package. Flukey, because I don&#x27;t much go in for gingerbread, but I&#x27;d seen it mentioned a couple times &amp; thought, &quot;Why not?&quot;
 Installed it, put some simple config in the init, restarted. Hmm. What did I do wrong? Restarted, it showed up this time. Well, it looked okay, nothing special. I clicked out of it into an org file. It took a minute to register. WTH? Buffer-face-mode was gone! I was in an org file with default Emacs faces. This is messed up. Let me restart again.
 Whoa. I&#x27;m getting a Flycheck error now, and faces are still wrong. Well, this doesn&#x27;t fly. I&#x27;ll comment out the dashboard stuff. WTH? The buffer&#x27;s read-only! I toggle read-only, modeline shows file is writable, yeah, no. Let me switch to a different buffer. WTH? C-x b doesn&#x27;t work! I&#x27;m flummoxed. I&#x27;m starting to hate on dashboard.
 Close the program. Start from a command line emacs -Q. That still works, anyway. Get to the init file, comment out the dashboard stuff, restart. Yeah, okay, great - I have my key bindings and my faces back. But, dashboard is the gift that keeps on giving. I still have the Flycheck error - 
 Wrong type argument: symbolp, (flycheck-mode-set-explicitly)
 Where did that come from? It wasn&#x27;t here yesterday. And hey, guess what? A recursive grep for flycheck-mode-set-explicitly through all the files in elpa comes up empty.
 $ ls -R */*.el | xargs grep &#x27;flycheck-mode-set-explicitly&#x27;
 It doesn&#x27;t get any better than this.
 Actually, it does. I reluctantly decide to go to the Flycheck page and submit an issue, try to find out where this is coming from. Hahaha! Joke&#x27;s on me. They don&#x27;t handle issues from Windows. They dump them into a bucket and if someone comes along &amp; handles them, great. In the meantime...
 In the meantime, I switch to Flymake.
 Afterward, I listened to &quot;Not Just the Tudors&quot; podcasts for three hours to regain my equilibrium. God, I love Emacs.

                    <span>Using vim-surround, if you have the text
 you say hello world and i say it back ^ 
 ...with your cursor on the character the carat indicates, then enter ys2aw&quot;, you end up with the line
 you say &quot;hello world&quot; and i say it back 
 However, in Emacs, when evil-surround is enabled, if you take the same initial line and perform the same keystrokes, you instead end up with
 you say &quot;hello world &quot;and i say it back 
 Is this a known issue, or expected behavior in some way?
 I stripped down my init.el so that the only lines in it require and enable evil and evil-surround, so I can&#x27;t see how my configuration would be the problem. I wasn&#x27;t able to find any reference to any similar issues on the Github though, which is surprising to me if other people are experiencing it; it seems like a pretty common command to run.
 If anyone else can reproduce this behavior, let me know so I know I&#x27;m not crazy!
 Edit: 
 A different means of achieving the same effect as desired is referenced in this issue: #25
 Also, after reading TFM and understanding how the aw and iw motions work, I agree with /u/bugamn that evil-surround has the most consistent behavior; since I like homogeneity (I always enable evil-want-Y-yank-to-eol), I don&#x27;t really feel the need to raise an issue. If anyone else finds this irksome though, feel free to copy the text of this post to your heart&#x27;s content if you do want to raise one.

                    <span>Starting to take over maintenance on command-log-mode. Point your package manager to this repo, clm-toggle and done.
 https://github.com/positron-solutions/command-log-mode
 Using this package to stream is a little easier to read and especially more helpful if you were just casting keys. Command names make it very easy to figure out where to go hack. You can&#x27;t always C-h k when you&#x27;re dealing with the minibuffer or some weird modal package or using a command dispatcher like ivy or transient.
 Seeing the stream of function names is so helpful to get oriented faster. You might be questioning if the default org map overrides arrows (it does). Running with the log open quickly illuminates how your bindings and modes are all wired.
 Open issues or PR&#x27;s to add more commands! I was going to add a minibuffer toggle and a way to pause logging (to preserve the mode state while hiding and stopping logging). Out of time tonight but I&#x27;ll get around to anything nobody beats me to.
 The existing implementation was using global hooks instead of setting up hooks in the mode. It&#x27;s more on the road to being a well behaved package now.
 Not on Melpa yet since I probably need to file an issue to take over the recipe.

                    <span>Hey all.
 I&#x27;m having consistent, but intermittent, problems with functions not being defined in .elc files. Here&#x27;s an example.
  Debugger entered--Lisp error: (error &quot;Autoloading file /Users/jabrahms/.emacs.d/elpa/lsp-ui-20210904.2037/lsp-ui.elc failed to define function lsp-ui&quot;) 
 This isn&#x27;t an lsp specific issue. It happens regularly with different files. My normal path is to delete the .elc files and restart, but it&#x27;s risen to the point of &quot;Ugh. This sucks.&quot; so I want to fix it.
 Any clues why this is happening and how to prevent it?
 One suggestion I found suggested that it was caused by shadows in my load path. When I do M-x list-load-path-shadows, it outputs this.. which seems fine?
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; /Users/jabrahms/.emacs.d/elpa/magit-20210928.1325/magit-section-pkg hides /Users/jabrahms/.emacs.d/elpa/magit-section-20210829.1849/magit-section-pkg /Users/jabrahms/.emacs.d/elpa/soap-client-3.2.0/soap-client hides /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/Resources/lisp/net/soap-client /Users/jabrahms/.emacs.d/elpa/soap-client-3.2.0/soap-inspect hides /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/Resources/lisp/net/soap-inspect /Users/jabrahms/.emacs.d/elpa/seq-2.23/seq hides /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/Resources/lisp/emacs-lisp/seq

 Any help appreciated.

                    <span>Hello, I have just recently installed emacs with doom, and was playing around with the config.el file because I didn&#x27;t like the default font. I found where to change the font, but for some reason whenever I do SPC-h-r-f to reload the font, I get an error: set-face-attribute: Font not available: #
 and the code to set the font is:
 (setq doom-font (font-spec :family &quot;JetBrains Mono NF&quot; :size 24)
 doom-variable-pitch-font (font-spec :family &quot;Monospace&quot; :size 22))
 Could anyone please tell me how to fix this?
 Thanks!

                    <span>Recently started using helm with emacs. Am obviously hitting a lot of mistaken tabs. I get that there is a learning curve but things would go much smoother if I could easily exit out of the actions list that tab pulls up and go back to the query I was typing. Does there exist a shortcut to do that? Or is there a way to easily add one?

                    <span>Hi there, emacs NooB here (I&#x27;ve been using basic org-functionality for GTD for about a year)
 I am now using emacs more heavily for research at work (nice and fast). I have recovered from a permissions issue yesterday, but have now created myself new problems by trying to setup reveal.js to output some research via org-reveal.
 I&#x27;m on Ubuntu 20.04 via WSL 1, (Doom) emacs 27.1
 Following the instructions here I setup Org-reveal. 
 I now get a warning about magit-section. 
 Error in private config: config.el, (file-missing Cannot open load file No such file or directory magit-section) 
 Doom doctor tells me the following, but I&#x27;m baffled.
 :~$ doom doctor The doctor will see you now... &gt; Checking your Emacs version... &gt; Checking for Emacs config conflicts... &gt; Checking for great Emacs features... &gt; Checking for private config conflicts... &gt; Checking for stale elc files... &gt; Checking Doom Emacs... x There was an unexpected error Message: File is missing Data: (file-missing . &quot;Cannot open load file&quot;) Backtrace: (require magit-section) (eval-buffer # nil &quot;/home/user/.emacs.d/.local/str (load-with-code-conversion &quot;/home/user/.emacs.d/.local/straight/build-27.

                    <span>Hi guys, My emacs has been quite slow (esp. with lsp-mode/lsp-dart), I&#x27;ve downloaded gccemacs to hoping for some performance gain... I noticed that it took around 129 secs to startup ((emacs-init-time))); I tried it again, and this time, it took around 5.7 secs so I think it was compiling the .el files on the first run. Next thing I did was to start the normal emacs build to compare; This took around 150 - 200 secs, but like 10-12 secs on subsequent launches. When I tried gccemacs again, It took just as long as the first time again.
 It seems that the .elc files are not fully compatible between the two and so they are recompiled... Is there anything I can do about this? I&#x27;d love to use the gccemacs, but doesn&#x27;t seem to be stable yet as I keep on getting comp warnings pop up in a Warnings buffer which is disturbing.
 I thought gccemacs would compile down to .eln while the normal emacs would compile to elc
 My gccemacs is v28.0.5 and normal emacs is like v27.2 Thanks in advance.

                    <span>I&#x27;m interested in the editing features brought by evil-mode and would like to integrate them into my workflow early in my learning of Emacs.
 I read the documentation and noctuid&#x27;s evil-guide and they are great but are more oriented towards vim users, the second one also being too technical for an emacs beginner (I&#x27;m not a programmer).
 The vim documentation is very interesting but I would love to find something like a beginner guide for evil-mode.

                    <span>Hi! I&#x27;m considering getting into Emacs for knowledge management and note-taking using org-mode and org-roam and see how it compares to Obsidian.
 I have three questions:
  
How can I use Emacs on mobile and sync across all of my devices? I need cross-platform usability, especially since I plan to use it on both my iPhone and iPad. I&#x27;ve tried Beorg, but it seems like it&#x27;s only for task management.
 How can I integrate it with modern apps and services (e.g. Readwise)? This is something that Obsidian has, which I want to implement in Emacs if it&#x27;s possible.
 What does Emacs have over Obsidian? Has anyone here switched from Obsidian to Emacs?
  
Thanks.

                    <span>Hi everyone,
 I use Doom Emacs with Evil and the +everywhere flag. I read Wiki pages with eww and I would like jump to urls with the same visual approach as evilem-motion-*, i.e., where the candidates are prefixed by letters.
 Defining the motion
 I followed the definition of the evilem-motion-* motions to create a new one based on shr-next-link:
 (after! evil-easymotion (evilem-make-motion evilem-motion-shr-next-link #&#x27;shr-next-link :scope &#x27;line)) (map! :after eww :map eww-mode-map (:prefix &quot;g&quot; :n &quot;&quot; #&#x27;evilem-motion-shr-next-link)) 
 Which works as intended, but only highlight links in the current line while I wanted to highlight all the links in the window. This happend because I am using :scope &#x27;line.
 Defining the window scope
 I managed to understand what was the scope handled by evil-easymotion, i.e., everything recognised by the thing-at-point function. But I didn&#x27;t find any predefined thing matching the window. Thus, I have created a new one:
 (defun window-bounds-of-window-at-point () &quot;Return the start and end points of a window.&quot; (save-excursion (message &quot;%d-%d&quot; (window-start) (window-end)) (cons (window-start) (window-end)))) (put &#x27;window &#x27;bounds-of-thing-at-point &#x27;window-bounds-of-window-at-point) 
 And then I changed the scope of evilem-motion-shr-next-link from &#x27;line to &#x27;window.
 Problem
 Everything work well, except that (window-end) returns a different value when I run evilem-motion-shr-next-link via the eval prompt, i.e., pp-eval-expression, or via my keybinding.
 For instance, on (eww &quot;https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/IntegerAtPoint&quot;) with the cursor at the beginning, the debuging message in window-bounds-of-window-at-point returns:
  
1-870 via the keybinding
 
1-1531 via the eval prompt
 
 Questions
  
Does someone know why there is this difference between the two approaches to call the function?
 
Is there a simpler and more efficient solution to what I am doing?
 
 Thank you in advance!
 Edit: Fix the formatting

                    <span>I&#x27;m wondering if Emacs supports the ability to search certain tags, by increasing / decreasing order. I&#x27;m planning on using date/time tags as such:  when writing in the appropriate heading, in one document. Would it be possible to search all entries, such that they show up in ascending order? the tag  represents the date and time in the format , and I&#x27;d be putting a tag each time I write in the different headings/subheadings. I&#x27;d like to be able to scroll chronologically through the different entries, and as such it would be useful if I can perform this type of search.
 I&#x27;m currently using Swiper as my main method of searching, is it possible to perform this type of search in Swiper?
 Also, is there a problem with how I&#x27;m planning on keeping my entries separated by topic, and tagging them so that I&#x27;d be able to search them chronologically? How many lines can one document contain before it&#x27;s too much for Emacs to properly process?

                    <span>Hi, I&#x27;m trying to run this function described here https://emacs.stackexchange.com/a/35683/11700
 I have an sql statement highlighted when running the command but the highlighted text gets replaced by 
 Traceback (most recent call last): File &quot;&quot;, line 1, in  ImportError: No module named sqlparse 
 I&#x27;ve tested sqlparse in my terminal by opening a Python 3.7 REPL and the example here https://pypi.org/project/sqlparse/ works fine. Any idea why my emacs process doesn&#x27;t seem to be able to find the package?
 For reference, I&#x27;m on macOS 11.6, spacemacs, and I open an emacs frame by typing emacs in my terminal.

                    <span>I arrange my orgmode notes as single files with lots of entries. This works great for me because emacs is more buffer-oriented than directory-oriented, so all the emacs search commands optimize for single-file approaches (eg search all headlines in my tech/blog file for the keyword of that Linux function I&#x27;ve forgotten how to use).
 The single problem I have is footnotes. From the documentation you have two options: inline or in a file-wide section. My footnotes are often too long to fit inline, so I can change the name of that section but CANNOT make a section-per-entry arrangement, which is what I really want. The way I have worked around this with my blog is to always have the entry I am publishing at the top of the file, so using org-footnote-new finds that entries footnote section first and inserts things where I want them to be. I&#x27;ve used this compromise successfully for quite some time, but it depends on the fact that you are not going to add footnotes to anything but the top entry.
 Now I am converting footnotes in a non-orgmode date made by someone else, and moving the elements to the top of the file is not an option. Does anyone know of a way of implementing an entry-by-entry footnote section (say, for every * entry, or every ** entry as the case may be) without moving the single entry to the top of the buffer? The goal is for each entry to have a working footnote section of its own, which works nicely with org-footnote-action.

                    <span>So I recently installed org-helm and org-roam and now whenever I open any old org file (not in my org-roam path for example) the file starts with everything expanded and even if I hit tab on the headlines they won&#x27;t collapse. Quite vexing and difficult to google-for. I mentioned those recent installs mainly because that&#x27;s the only thing I can think of, but I haven&#x27;t been able to find anything that says that&#x27;s a side effect.
 EDIT: Okay I can Shift-Tab and collapse everything. But org-cycle seems to be something else.
 EDIT: Oh yeah I also upgraded emacs/org-mode, so I could use roam, so that may have something to do with it.

                    <span>We have many really great projects in Scala ecosystem, which must have taken great efforts to build.
 And it seems that most of us are actually using these projects. Then why are we so miserly about indicating our interest in projects.
 I can understand the low &quot;stars&quot; on following nice things as these not really highly relevant to Scala community.
  
 twitter / finagle 8,100  
  
 Angel-ML / angel 6,400  
  apache / zeppelin 5,400  
  gatling / gatling 5,300  
  polynote / polynote 4,200  
  intel-analytics / BigDL 3,800  
  microsoft / SynapseML 2,400  
  spotify / scio 2,200  
  almond-sh / almond 1,400  
 
 But what about the following, which have always been to focus of almost all conferences, talks, blogs and what not.
  
 milessabin / shapeless 3,200  
  
 zio / zio 3,000  
  circe / circe 2,200

  optics-dev / Monocle 1,400  
  typelevel / cats-effect 1,300  
  scalameta / scalafmt 1,100  
 
 Are there really only 1,300 people who care about cats-effect ?
 Are there really only 1,100 people using scalafmt ?
 And I discovered just now that scalqa/scalqa has just 56 stars. yes, just 56!!
 Just why ? It&#x27;s really funny compared to other comminities where even poc projects get more than 5,000 stars.

                    <span>JVM primitive numerical types are limited to Byte, Short, Int, Long, Float and Double. For over two decades everyone was forced to use those primitives, whenever computational performance was important. Luckily, with Scala3 there is a choice.
 Let&#x27;s define an opaque type Price, which will have all the functionality of a Float, will be as fast as a Float, but will be distinct from a Float. We will need to import Scalqa.
 import scalqa.{*,given} type Price &#x3D; Price.TYPE.DEF object Price extends Float.Opaque.Data.Numerical[Price](&quot;Price&quot;): inline def apply(inline v: Float): Price &#x3D; v.toOpaque override def value_tag(v:Price) : String &#x3D; &quot;$&quot;+v.toFloat extension(inline x: Price) // Optional custom methods inline def isNotExpensive: Boolean &#x3D; x &lt; 100 object TYPE: opaque type DEF &lt;: Float.Opaque &#x3D; Float.Opaque 
 By extending Float.Opaque.Data.Numerical Price inherits numerical methods which match those for a Float primitive. Even better, all those methods are inlined, so when used, they will be reduced to primitive calls.
 Consider the following example:
  var price : Price &#x3D; Price(9.99f) var primitive: Float &#x3D; 5.99f price &#x3D; price * 2 primitive &#x3D; primitive * 2 
 when de-compiled to Java, it is clear: the Price is treated same as a Float:
  float price &#x3D; 9.99F; float primitive &#x3D; 5.99F; price *&#x3D; (float)2; primitive *&#x3D; (float)2; 
 We can use Price with the same ease as a primitive without any concern for impact on performance.
 On the other hand Price is distinct from a Float, so the following will fail.
  def discount(v: Price): Price &#x3D; v * 0.75f discount(5.99f) // Fails // Type Mismatch Error: // Found: (5.99f : Float) // Required: Price

                    <span>Hey Reddit, because of the decision my university made I am going to learn functional Scala instead of an other language. Unfortunately it&#x27;s really hard to motivate myself to learn that new language as I was learning rust-lang until now. What are the advantages of Scala especially compared to Rust-lang?
 Thanks for your replies!

                    <span>Hello, I&#x27;m completely new to Scala so I can have a bit of trouble knowing where to start with some things.
 So I&#x27;ve got two text files to load as RDDs, one is called dict and another is called wordlist:
 val wordlist &#x3D; sc.textFile(&quot;text.txt&quot;) val dict &#x3D; sc.textFile(&quot;dictionary.txt) 
 dictionary.txt is a text file of every single verb and its different forms, like this:
 abash,abash,abashed,abashed,abashes,abashing abate,abate,abated,abated,abates,abating abide,abide,abode,abode,abides,abiding absorb,absorb,absorbed,absorbed,absorbs,absorbing accept,accept,accepted,accepted,accepts,accepting accompany,accompany,accompanied,accompanied,accompanies,accompanying ...

                    <span>Almost a million years ago, I was dealing with some sinister bugs inside the
data structures in linear-base and to stop the nightmares I decided to just
test the specification of the data structures themselves. I ended up using
something that I’ve been calling denotational homomorphic testing. In this
post, I’ll walk through how I ended up with this and why this is legitimately helpful.
Our Toy Example
Let’s consider a toy example which corresponds to one of the data structures I
was working with; see PR #263. How shall we test a specification of a simple Set
implementation shown below?
-- Constructors / Modifers
empty :: Set a
insert :: Keyed a &#x3D;&gt; a -&gt; Set a -&gt; Set a
delete :: Keyed a &#x3D;&gt; a -&gt; Set a -&gt; Set a

                    <span>I&#x27;m in one of those &quot;... but it worked yesterday&quot; situations.
 Seems like I suddenly don&#x27;t have permission to access / write to my home directory (a local directory on the c:drive). I&#x27;ve not changed my setup at all, save for writing to my /home/ folder from Windows (I created and saved an org file using Notepad)
 I&#x27;m using org-mode in DooM emacs to take notes for work (making this all the more frustrating) via remote access from WSL (Ubuntu) on a Win 10 machine.
 On startup I get a warning like:
 Warning (initialization): An error occured while loading &#x27;/home/user/.emacs.d/init.el&#x27;: Error in private config: config.el, (file-error Opening input file Permission denied /home/user/org_roam/A_RANDOM_ORG_FILE 
 There is a clue here as &quot;A_RANDOM_ORG_FILE&quot; was a file I was too lazy to use emacs for, so made in Notepad in Win10 and saved to my home/org_roam/ folder
 So:
 emacs --debug-init Debugger entered--Lisp error: (file-error &quot;Opening input file&quot; &quot;Permission denied&quot; ... 
 When I try to write the error buffer to a file (because WSL cut-paste baffles me), I get:
 /home/ write protected 
 So I&#x27;m here to ask: what? why? Given the generic-ness of the problem it&#x27;s hard to google.

                    <span>I&#x27;m having an issue where Python LSP tends to be extremely slow and crashy on auto-completion. I&#x27;ve done all of the optimisations recommended by lsp-doctor, am running native-comp, and have tried a number of servers including pyright and jedi. I&#x27;ve also tried using corfu instead of company, but unfortunately auto-completion freezes everything up quite dramatically. Has anyone else had and fixed this issue before?
 EDIT: It turns out I&#x27;d been overlooking the obvious - I had unknowingly set my workspace to be my entire home directory. I love a good six hour hunt only to find out that I&#x27;m a dunce.

                    <span>I&#x27;m using &#x60;R&#x60; on org-agenda to make it display a clock report at the bottom. But by agenda can be very long, and I&#x27;ll have to scroll to see the clock report. 
 Does anyone know if there is a way to configure org-agenda to show the clock report at top instead?

                    <span>I&#x27;m working on a pretty interesting project right now and I&#x27;m having different results depending on the build tool used: with cabal, the test suite fails but it passes with stack.
 My guess is that there must be some dependency version difference. So far I tried to &quot;dump&quot; the dependencies used by cabal using cabal freeze, and stack ls dependencies when using stack. An issue that I found is that while cabal uses my system-wide GHC (8.8.4), stack uses the GHC version defined by the resolver (8.6.5). Then, different base versions result in very different dependencies versions.
 Nevertheless, the test suite passes if I build the project using stack test --system-ghc (it uses GHC 8.8.4). I&#x27;m not really sure what dependencies are being used in this case (GHC 8.8.4 base or stack resolver base?). Running stack ls dependencies --system-ghc results in an error.
 So, how can I figure out why I get different results when building with the same GHC but different build tools?

                    <span>Hello! You might remember me from two nearly identical posts over the past year, and now I&#x27;m back once again, because Chordify is looking for another Haskell developer! Last time we actually hired someone who found us through this subreddit, and it would be awesome to do that again.
 Chordify is a music platform that you can use to automatically detect the chords in any song you like. This way we help musicians to play all of their favourite music in an easy and intuitive way. You can try it at https://chordify.net
 Now, the backend for our website and apps, that are used by millions of people worldwide, is written in Haskell! We serve the user using primarily Servant, Persistent and Esqueleto. We also have a custom Redis caching layer and use an advanced Cloud Haskell setup to distribute our chord analysis computations.
 We are quickly becoming an autonomous workforce, meaning there is pretty much no hierarchy, and we are looking to expand our fast-growing team with a pro-active, independent and creative functional programmer to further improve Chordify. You&#x27;d get the opportunity to work with advanced type systems to power a website that serves millions.
 More information and a form to apply can be found at https://jobs.chordify.net. If you have any questions, feel free to ask them in this thread, or reach out to me at [rik@chordify.net](mailto:rik@chordify.net).
 We strive for diversity in our team, and encourage people of all backgrounds and genders to apply.
 One more thing, this is explicitly NOT a remote job. We expect our new colleague to come work with us at our (new!) office in Utrecht, The Netherlands.

                    <span>Is there a nice way to create a secret URL in Servant ?
 What I mean, I need some maintenance tasks to be executed at a regular time.
 The easiest (and the more flexible) is to use a crontab which curl the URL where one piece of the URL is secret (ie generated when launching the server or in a config file). Is there a way to do that cleanly with Servant. By cleanly I mean a way which can assure that my route is protected like I will do with AuthProtect.

                    <span>I am pleased to announce the release of a new package, linear-generics, based on GHC.Generics and the venerable generic-deriving. The killer features:
  
Generic1 representations associate compositions the right way around, which is to say the left way around, meaning no more inefficient fmaps or pesky Functor constraints.
 
to, from, to1, and from1 are multiplicity polymorphic, so you can use them in all your fancy new linearly typed code.
 
 The package includes Template Haskell-based deriving, based closely on generic-deriving, which is the recommended way to write instances. There is also a limited, somewhat unsafe, and somewhat inefficient way using provided DerivingVia targets.
 Many thanks to Arnaud Spiwack and Ryan Scott for their valuable advice and assistance.

 I have been making videos about how I use org-mode, and some of the features in scimax (an Emacs starterkit for scientists and engineers) I have written to help me use org-mode. Lately I have been focusing on writing. Next week I will start some videos on some updates and new features in org-ref.
 ​
 You can find the scimax playlist here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list&#x3D;PL0sMmOaE_gs3E0OjExoI7vlCAVygj6S4I

 I hope some of you find them helpful!

                    <span>I’ve just read about “radio targets” in the org mode manual (section 4.3 at the time of writing this), and I immediately thought of using them in my knowledge base (Zettelkasten-style).
 From what I understand though, radio targets only work in the same file. Currently my knowledge base spans a lot of small files. Assuming I concatenated them to one file, it would clock in at 5k lines (and constantly expanding). I am worried that this large org file would slow down emacs.
 Does anyone have experience with using radio targets in such a setup? Are my performance worries unfounded?

                    <span>I still fumble for the right way to use a timestamp.
 Right now, I want to automatically add a timestamp (time of capture) to an entry when I use org-capture. What&#x27;s the right way to do this? 
 Should I add an inactive timestamp right down below the heading? I was thinking of doing something like CAPTURED ON: [2021-10-02]. This is easy to do inside org-capture-templates. But then the first words can have special meanings (as in DEADLINE: ) which makes it look awkward.
 Or should I just add it as a custom property? If so, are timestamps completely legal inside the PROPERTIES drawer (and will they always be?). I&#x27;ve seen other people add a simple date without the brackets, but this won&#x27;t cut it for me cause I want to use the timestamp with org-sparse-tree.
 Or should I add it as a list entry to the LOGBOOK drawer? Accomplishing this with org-capture needs some extra hacking, but this seems like the most semantically correct option.
  
Is it just me, or is org-mode syntax quirky? I&#x27;m confused about something that seems like a very common use-case?

                    <span>How would I go about writing the definition of a typeclass that is constrained on a generic type, and uses the type it&#x27;s generic on. for example: 
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; trait Request[Output]
 @typeclass trait Endpoint[R &lt;: Request[out]] { def apply(req: R): out } &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 I know I could make the typeclass generic on 2 parameters or have a type member on the trait, but is there a way to make it only dependent on the Request type? The information about it&#x27;s Output type should always be deductible at compiletime.
 This would help with derivation above all things, since the derives clause doesn&#x27;t allow you to give it parameters or type parameters.

                    <span>Hello all. I am trying to create a website in HTML, and I would like to use Emacs org mode for that. The goal is to replicate this, https://html5up.net/dimension, in org mode. The index.html file looks something like this:
 
  
  
      
  
 Within the main body, you have stuff like 
...
, 
...
,.....etc. The head definition for css, title, language is easy. In my org mode, I do this:
 #+HTML_HEAD: Tab title for website #+HTML_HEAD:  #+HTML_HEAD:  #+HTML_HEAD: 
 #+HTML_HEAD: 
 
 Basically, copy the content between 
....
 in the #+HTML_HEAD. The ... is automatically create when you type stuff in the ... body of the document. That is fine too. The problem is the nested div, header, footer within body. 
 To simplify the problem, the snippet in the body has this form:
  ...some code here...  
 where X can be head if you do 
...
, and Y is the keyword you use in the document for class and id, e.g:
 
  
 
 How do I enter the above code in Org mode? Additionally, how do I nest them? What about the code in between them, use org-babel block?

                    <span>How do I check what functions emacs is evaluating when I type a given character?
 When I type the &#x27;&#x27; character. I might have set this at some point; I checked the pairs in my electric-pair-pairs variable, which doesn&#x27;t contain the &#x27;&#x60;, I see that characters are entered with the org-self-insert-command function, but this doesn&#x27;t tell me much about what settings I&#x27;m looking for.
 Bonus round, when I highlight a region and type &#x27;&quot;&#x27;, the region is wrapped in double-quotes. What variable do I customize to add other characters to do this behavior?

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been trying to use sexp diary entries and they don&#x27;t show up marked in the calendar, or in the diary view for the respective days. I&#x27;ve included the line, copied straight from the manual %%(diary-anniversary 10 31 1948) Arthur&#x27;s %d%s birthday in my diary file. The standard entries show up, it doesn&#x27;t.
 I can&#x27;t find anything in the manual. I tried adding the following lines to my config (and getting rid of everything else in those hooks) to no avail:
 (add-hook &#x27;diary-list-entries-hook (lambda () (diary-list-sexp-entries original-date))) (add-hook &#x27;diary-mark-entries-hook &#x27;diary-mark-sexp-entries) 
 How does it work?!!!!!
 TIA.

 I completely rewritten it to support multi-translation engines, like bing/google/deepl/etc.
 It is asynchronous and easy to extend.
 If you are interested, you can try it

                    <span>So till now I&#x27;ve been using the src blocks for just Python and R, and since they&#x27;re normally repl anyway, emacs didn&#x27;t seem that much more helpful (outside of not having to copy-paste the code and results into documents).
 ​
 But now, as I&#x27;m playing with some C code I fell in love with emacs again. I literally just write the code, press C-c C-c, and get my results. No manually compiling or anything, and the errors automatically popup on a seperate screen for you to fix.
 ​
 On top of that, print statement output are automatically cleanly separated into a table based on commas (but appear normally if you choose :output results).
 ​
 This has been so helpful for my operating systems course, and wow I&#x27;m so happy I found emacs.
 ​
 Thanks for coming to my talk (I hope the tags C Programming and Org mode help future searchers)

                    <span>Any recomendation for Email under Windows? All what I could find depende on Linux-only external tools. Is there a pure Emacs Elisp based mail package in Emacs?

                    <span>Hi guys, emacs newbie here...
 I&#x27;m moving from package.el to straight.el and Ive been trying to install use-package with it; I keep on getting this error: straight--convert-recipe: Could not find package bind-key. Updating recipe repositories: (org-elpa melpa gnu-elpa-mirror el-get emacsmirror-mirror) with ‘straight-pull-recipe-repositories’ may fix this I ran emacs -q and only executed the minimum code I think is required to install use-package with straight.el but it still gives that same error:  (defvar bootstrap-version) (let ((bootstrap-file (expand-file-name &quot;straight/repos/straight.el/bootstrap.el&quot; user-emacs-directory)) (bootstrap-version 5)) (unless (file-exists-p bootstrap-file) (with-current-buffer (url-retrieve-synchronously &quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raxod502/straight.el/develop/install.el&quot; &#x27;silent &#x27;inhibit-cookies) (goto-char (point-max)) (eval-print-last-sexp))) (load bootstrap-file nil &#x27;nomessage)) (straight-use-package &#x27;use-package)  I know there is a bind-key.el file in the use-package repo, so if it is required by use-package, I don&#x27;t know why it can&#x27;t be found.
 I&#x27;ve already used straight.el to install god-mode and it works just fine, I&#x27;ve also used use-package with package.el and that too works just fine.
 Any help would be appreciated.
 PS I&#x27;m using Windows 10 64 bit, Emacs 27.2

                    <span>I find this feature incredibly useful. It&#x27;s not very well documented, at least the documentation doesn&#x27;t give it the attention I believe it deserves. As other nifty features of ivy it was introduced a few years ago in a post: https://oremacs.com/2016/06/27/ivy-push-view/. It has replaced many uses of winner-mode in my workflow. Essentially it saves a buffer inside the window layout it had at the moment of the &quot;snapshot&quot;, then you can choose to go back to buffer as per usual or inside any of the different layouts in which it was saved. All this from the plain old (ivy-)switch-buffer interface.

                    <span>A few weeks ago Tom Sydney Kerckhove (@kerckhove_ts) published an excellent writeup of a serious DoS vulnerability in aeson, a widely used Haskell JSON library. A new aeson release addresses the hash flooding issue, but you need more than a version bump to ensure your programs are protected. This post outlines how aeson addressed the vulnerability and what action you need to take.

                    <span>Trying to write a program that changes a string based on some conditions. Just have problems when it i want to replace a letter with 2 others(/ just add in a letter after the first) but only if the letter if followed by an specific other. I can get it to find the index och where its happening and replace both letters but i just want to change one. Is there a reasonable way of going about this?

                    <span>I am currently reading the red book to learn functional programming in Scala, and was looking for more resources. I found some other books, and was wondering if this is a good order to learn functional programming in Scala:
  
Functional Programming in Scala (The red book)
 Essential effects
 Practical Functional Programming in Scala
  
Or are there other books/order that you would suggest? I just want to learn pure functional programming in Scala (or as close to pure, but related concepts are welcome too).
 Is the book &quot;Zionomicon&quot; more inline with the red book than the two other books perhaps?

                    <span>I&#x27;m currently looking for master&#x27;s thesis projects. An idea of mine was to rewrite the mathematical kernels my company uses to run on the GPU. 
 Most of the Scala libraries I could find have not been updated since 2.9.x or only supported simple multiplications. Are there any OpenCL or CUDA leveraging libraries that work on 2.12.x?
 Or is it possible to call C++ code from the JVM?

                    <span>Most articles I read about functional programming all point out that it&#x27;s better to write concurrency program in a functional way. With functional programming, one can forget the mental burden to maintain the state of variables, make less mistakes, etc.
 But they don&#x27;t provide examples and I can&#x27;t get an intuitive view about this. Are their any books or blogs provide such an example between the imperative one and the functional one in terms of the concurrent programming? Thanks.

                    <span>Hi
My name is Neal, I&#x27;m in California and likely starting a new software engineering job soon.  I&#x27;ve been using a paper Bullet Journal (BuJo) for a few years. I like that it is offline and I can problem solve with it, since I spend so much time online, and recently I&#x27;ve been looking for ways to make my bullet journal more searchable and useful.  So I came across the Commonplace index, and Zettelkasten, both of which look promising.  I&#x27;ve made some few steps on implementing both in my bullet journal.  I&#x27;ll have new things to learn quickly in my new job so any advice on first steps, software engineering, working on paper, or anything related etc would be greatly appreciated!
Thanks
Neal</span>

                    <span>In the course of writing code, I may have (and be ok with) a myriad of warnings that invariably drown out errors that I really want to notice.
 Can I help flycheck only ever show me the highest rated level?
 IE if errors exist, don&#x27;t show warn/info. If no errors, but warnings exist, dont show info. I&#x27;d be ok with just the first too, if it&#x27;s a simpler solution.

                    <span>Am helping to test espanso v2 alpha, if I edit the config with emacs/client, save it, it should trigger espanso to reload the file - it doesn&#x27;t.
 Micro works as expected. Espanso v0.7.3 works as expected with emacs. Can anybody think of a reason why that I can share with Federico the dev?
 I also tried touching the config, that didn&#x27;t work either. He is looking at his code as I type so hopefully he will spot something, it is rust and I don&#x27;t know rust :smile:

                    <span>Until recently, my init.el basically just called org-babel-load-file on my literate configuration file. However, this led to slow startups and issues where the wrong version of Org was getting loaded; as such, I&#x27;m trying to move to tangling my config.org.
 As of now, I&#x27;m just setting :tangle yes :results silent as properties on my config.org as well as having a function on after-save-hook that checks if the file I just saved is my config, and if so, to tangle it to init.el.
 This doesn&#x27;t feel particularly &quot;tasteful&quot; though, since it means that if I want to make my config easily clonable, I either have to:
  
Commit both my init.el and config.org to github (which will essentially be the same file), or
 
Upon cloning my config to a new machine, flounder around in stock Emacs before tangling my config manually (with an out-of-date, built-in ob-tangle) and restarting, instead of everything working out of the box.
 
 So, I thought I&#x27;d ask /r/emacs: what do you consider the most &quot;canonical&quot; or &quot;tasteful&quot; way of tangling a (single-file) literate config?

                    <span>I&#x27;m trying to help my friend set up her Emacs. She needs to calculate total time duration from some time data. Currently she uses an Excel sheet to log all start and end times of the events, and then calculate the total time of the events. 
 I think org-mode with timestamps can achieve the same thing. For example,
 * Event 1  * Event 2 CLOSED: [2021-10-11 Mon 5:00] SCHEDULED:  
 the total time is 3 hours. Is there any simple way to do the calculation? I&#x27;ve searched for this but it seems there is no built-in function for this. Thanks.

                    <span>Hi friends! I know that we could control the size of inline images displayed in org by setting org-image-actual-size to 500, or 50%, or &#x27;(500, 400, 300) or adding a #+attr_org: :width 50% :height 50%. But all these methods doesn&#x27;t work for remote inline images, i.e. I can&#x27;t control the image like this: [[https:example.com/image.png]].
 Here is an example:
 original
 show inline image in 20%, but the size of the first image is not changed
 ​
 show inline image in 5%
 So, anyone has any suggestions? How could we let org-mode resize the displayed remote inline images?

I am trying to get emacs to first check if the current projectile directory has a .venv directory, and if so then load that as the virtual environment using pyvenv workon. If no .vevn directory is detected then fallback to a default virtual environment i have set up.
 The code looks like this:

                    <span>I was reading through An Introduction to Emacs Lisp, and on the chapter about save-restriction, it&#x27;s mentioned that when using save-excursion and save-restriction one after the other, save-excursion should be used outermost. This advice is also present in the documentation for save-restriction. 
 While the book does give a one line explanation- &quot;if save-restriction is used before save-excursion, Emacs may fail to record the narrowing in the buffer it switches to&quot;, I don&#x27;t quite understand it.
 Can someone please explain this, preferably via an example where something goes wrong if I have save-restriction immediately followed by a save-excursion expression?

                    <span>Basically the title. A friend of mine started using doom emacs, and I like the keyboard centric style of emacs plus the ease of customization (unlike vim imo). 
 That alone got me curious but I am comfortable in vscode at the moment. So, is there something that makes you not leave emacs for vscode? I know that there is a very nice git plugin (magit?) But other than that I haven&#x27;t read anything else. Also I read that code completion and going to function definitions are not easy to do on emacs, which doesn&#x27;t seem right considering how popular it is.

                    <span>I am trying to add a hook that will re-generate the latex fragments when I modify the zoom level in the org buffer.
 Here is my function:
 (defun update-org-latex-fragments () (let ((text-scale-factor (expt text-scale-mode-step text-scale-mode-amount))) (plist-put org-format-latex-options :scale (* 1.75 text-scale-factor)) (org-latex-preview t) )) (add-hook &#x27;text-scale-mode-hook &#x27;update-org-latex-fragments) (add-hook &#x27;org-mode-hook &#x27;update-org-latex-fragments) 
 It only works partially. The zoom level is adjusted only in the org section the cursor is currently in.
 From the org-latex-preview function I read that two universal arguments C-u C-u would rebuild the latex fragments everywhere in the buffer:
  
With a C-u C-u prefix argument ARG, display image for all fragments in the buffer.
 With a C-u C-u C-u prefix argument ARG, clear image for all fragments in the buffer.
  
How do I translate C-u C-u to elisp so that my hooked function regenerates the latex fragments in whole buffer?
 I do not think this matters, but just in case, I am using doom emacs.
 EDIT: Solved! Found the solution in this archived thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/67y5kj/what_is_cu_cu_cu_command_in_code/
  
Plain universal-argument actually creates a prefix-argument of &#x27;(4), and multiplies the car of the list by four with each iteration. So try doing (org-cycle &#x27;(64)).
 You&#x27;ll need to look at the actual command&#x27;s source each time to decide what exactly the function is expecting. Check out the doc-string of interactive for more info.
  
So I just added &#x27;(16) as an argument of the org-latex-preview function:
 (defun update-org-latex-fragments () (let ((text-scale-factor (expt text-scale-mode-step text-scale-mode-amount))) (plist-put org-format-latex-options :scale (* 1.75 text-scale-factor)) (org-latex-preview &#x27;(16)) )) (add-hook &#x27;text-scale-mode-hook &#x27;update-org-latex-fragments) (add-hook &#x27;org-mode-hook &#x27;update-org-latex-fragments)

                    <span>The advice here does not work: https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ShowParenMode
 If show-paren-mode is called anywhere then the show-paren-mode variable still set globally. If the variable is set then the parentheses do not highlight, so the mode isn&#x27;t active (I assume).
 With this code, show-paren-mode is set on initial load:
 (use-package prog-mode :ensure nil ; not really a package :hook ((prog-mode . rainbow-delimiters-mode) (prog-mode . smartparens-mode) (prog-mode . local-show-paren-mode)) :config (defun local-show-paren-mode () (make-variable-buffer-local &#x27;show-paren-mode) (show-paren-mode 1))) 
 I also tried calling &#x60;(make-variable-buffer-local &#x27;show-paren-mode)&#x60; at top level. It&#x27;s still global even though inspecting the variable, it calls itself buffer-local.
 I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s actually still global because when I call M-x show-paren-mode and open another empty buffer, its state in the new buffer is the same as the old buffer. Going back to other buffers, the state likewise stays the same.

                    <span>I hope you&#x27;ll indulge me for an experiment I&#x27;m running at blog.tygr.info.
 I&#x27;ve built a docker image which asynchronously exports org files in the format requested. I started from this awesome example from emacs-web-server and added a file cache and pdf support. You can see it here: org-ssr
 As you might&#x27;ve already guessed, I&#x27;m going live with it. My blog is being served by emacs.
 That means if you ever have to wait a few seconds to see a page load, you are probably the first person to see that page in that format.
 It also means that with &#x60;url-handler-mode&#x60; enabled, you can browse to my site like &#x60;C-x C-f https://blog.tygr.info/index.org&#x60; to see the website in org mode.
 So now all pages on my blog are available as .html, .txt, .tex, or .org. As I mentioned, pdf is available but I don&#x27;t have texlive installed on my server, so it&#x27;ll just fail right now.
 And yes, I realize there&#x27;s no favicon. I don&#x27;t think there ever will be.

                    <span>I don&#x27;t know what happened or what I upgraded, but now my M-x shell prompt looks like

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been using org-mode for a long time, but I&#x27;m not a programmer nor an expert. I just really like Emacs and org-mode. The hierarchical structure is not good enough for lists of data with multiple shared parts. I get lost in what is called a Wicked Problem [look it up on Wikipedia if you want] constantly almost always when I include another list, then I need to rearrange the contents of the lists for better comprehension and/or less clutter/repetitiveness.
 Hi, sorry if this seems simple to you, but I can&#x27;t get my head around this so far. I&#x27;ve heard of something called orgmode roam or orgmode brain, but it seems that I am just stuck and constantly looking up more search results while not comprehending much of what i find really.
 ​
 I&#x27;d like some real world examples of how would you solve this problem preferably with emacs/org software if possible

                    <span>I am trying to use org-cite in org mode 9.5. My emacs is emacs-mac 27.2 (aka Mitsuharu Yamamoto&#x27;s emacs mac port). I use ivy for completion, otherwise my emacs is pretty minimalistic.
 When I use org-cite-insert, I can see bib items in my minibuffer, and I can multi-select bib items with enter key. However, I do not know what key or keybind to press to actually insert the bib keys I have selected.
 My org-cite seems to be configured correctly, because if I just type by hand the citation [cite:@key], it fontifies alright. The only problem is, I do not know how to actually auto-insert such citations by org-cite-insert.
 I have consulted org manual, and also googled a lot, no solution so far. Any help on this?
 suggested solutions so far:
 -  :: doesn&#x27;t work

                    <span>Hi guys,
 I’m wondering if I should change my phone only because of orgmode app. I am currently using iOS and never found good org app. I heard android orgzly is perfect but never used it. I don’t use my smartphone for mamy things and my iPhone 7 is sufficient for my needs except that orgmode app. Is spending 800 dollars for new phone with android worth it? 
 Thanks in advance.

                    <span>During my recent studies into effective learning methods, the phenomena that food plays a major role in cognitive performance has surfaced. Some research observed differences in cognitive performance between 15-20% based on nutrition intake (high cal/protein/fat vs low). From my own experience, if I&#x27;m hungry I get distracted more often and find it harder to enter the flow state of work.
In How Not to Die, the author points to research that observed consumption of burgers/meat lead to a very noticeable decline in cognitive performance minutes after consumption.
In his essay writing guide, Jordan Peterson recommends eating something high in fat and protein first thing in the morning before writing. He also talks about the importance of waking up early &amp; working in the morning. Peterson also said in another interview that he solved a clients anxiety problems by making her eat more. This suggests a link between not getting proper nutrition and anxiety.
The Netflix documentary &quot;The Game Changers&quot;, Connor McGregor puts part of the blame of his loss on eating too much steak - not having energy during the fight. This documentary argues vegetable-based diets are just as effective for building muscle as meat ones, as well as being more healthy for anyone interested.
I haven&#x27;t done much research into this question obviously 
My question(s) to you is: have you experimented with different foods and consumption schedules to boost your cognitive performance during knowledge work sessions? Do you know any interesting resources to continue this line of research?</span>

                    <span>Greetings,
 Began to migration to org 9.5 today and with it to try to adapt the new citations system. I have run into two questions that someone may have the answers to.
  
Trying to use any processor other than &#x27;basic&#x27; results in an error. For testing my configuration is very simple:
  
 (use-package org :demand t :pin gnu :config (setq org-cite-export-processors &#x27;((latex natbib) (t basic)))) 
 If I export to latex with this setup, it results in org-cite-store-export-processor: Unknown processor natbib error. Only basic works. The biblatex, natbib, and csl exporters all result in the same error. Is it really going to force me to perform a (require &#x27;oc-xxx) for each of them?
  
The styles seem a bit limited to me. Is there an option to provide a reference in place without a bibliography? One common use case is produce a list of publications in a chosen order (e.g., NSF-style CVs require &quot;Five relevant publications&quot;). With latex, this is commonly done with \nobibliography and \bibentry. Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t see support for either in the table provided in the very nice Introduction.
  
Is it possible to not insert a bibliography? It would make sense that if citations are used and exported to latex without the #+print_bibliography directive that it automatically inserts \nobibliography.
 For inserting references rather than citations, is there a style I am missing? It might make sense to have an r style that inserts the full reference in place (if exporting to latex, it would use \bibentry while basic would simply insert the reference text).
 Anyhow, I appreciate hearing whether I am missing something on these issues.

                    <span>Not here to start a war on vim vs emacs bindings. I am just more used to C-n to go down vs j. I really like the look and style of ranger and was wondering if there are packages similar to it but with emacs navigation bindings.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been trying to use file links in an org mode document to collect my latex pdfs. When I left click on the link, it opens the file in Atril Document viewer, despite my default pdf viewing application being zathura (zathura is opened by default when I open any pdf from a file manager). I decided to use openwith to try to force pdfs to open in zathura so I added 
 (require &#x27;openwith) (openwith-mode t) (setq openwith-associations &#x27;((&quot;\\.pdf\\&#x27;&quot; &quot;zathura&quot; (file)))) 
 As seen from this emacs stack exchange question
 as well as installing it on packages.el.
 Reloads without issue.
 When I open the file in the console section it tells me &quot;Running atril [path-to-file]...done&quot;.
 I am an emacs beginner so I don&#x27;t really know where to go with this.

                    <span>I&#x27;m an evil user, so &quot;C-k&quot; normally does evil-insert-digraph while in insert mode; however, company helpfully redefines it as company-select-previous-or-abort in its active map.
 Sometimes though, when I&#x27;m navigating to previous company completions, the &quot;C-k&quot; keypress will &quot;fall through&quot; and register as the evil digraph command instead of the company one, which drops me out of the completion I was in the middle of. I&#x27;ve only been able to reproduce this in go-mode while lsp-mode is on; I thought it might be a performance issue as a result of spamming the keypress too fast (I&#x27;m on a fairly weak VM), but I&#x27;ve occasionally been able to recreate it even when I&#x27;m leaving a solid 1 sec pause between &quot;C-k&quot; presses. Anyone got any idea how to debug this? It happens relatively frequently, but really inconsistently, so I&#x27;m having trouble reproducing it on command.

                    <span>Hey everyone, I was talking with a friend about the great text editor and when I talked about packages maintained by &quot;volunteers&quot;, he answered &quot;that&#x27;s awful! What happens if the authors of the package get tired and abandon it? You could have a package that is a whole part of you work flow die ! This seems risky because you have no certitude if the packages come from random people.&quot;
 And I couldn&#x27;t answer because I don&#x27;t know if its common that a package is left to death by its authors, but my intuition was that other people would fork it and still contribute to it or just maintain it... any answer? I didn&#x27;t say much to my friend because I don&#x27;t really know and didn&#x27;t want to say some dumb stuff.
 Thank you for reading!

                    <span>Hello,
 I’m trying to setup gpg encryption for my files in emacs.
 I’ve got the encryption working, and figured out how to get agenda items from said files into the agenda.
 My only issue is that I can’t seem to get full text search working.
 I’ve tried using the grep commands in Doom but they don’t seem to decrypt the files?
 The specific feature I’m trying to get working is Doom’s SPC n s which seems to be a function that calls ivy’s search for symbol at point?

                    <span>A really helpful tool for maximizing keyboard efficiency QMK&#x27;s layer feature, which allows you to hold down one key, and have different functionality for the other keys. Any key can be a layer.
 I was thinking that combining this functionality with something like ryo-modal could make for a very satisfying and efficient modal keybind system. However, it doesn&#x27;t seem like there&#x27;s any ready made way to do this in Emacs. 
 I think that the closest preexisting thing is Hydras, which basically are layers, except you have to define a keybind that exits the Hydra. 
 So the question is, how can I make the exit function for a Hydra be the releasing of its prefix key? I&#x27;m not sure if this is a simple or complicated elisp task, as I&#x27;m still pretty novice when it comes to Emacs hacking. Any help or insight would be appreciated!

                    <span>So, suppose I name a variable t &#x3D; 0/0. If I only operate 0/0 in GHCi the result is NaN.
 Then I ask Haskell to tell me if t &#x3D;&#x3D; read &quot;NaN&quot;. It doesn&#x27;t work. The results is False.
 Then I proceed to ask Haskell if t &#x3D;&#x3D; 0/0. The result is False.
 What I need to compare t to, so I can get a True value from these comparisons?
 ​
 Obs: I know I could do a &#x3D; 0; b &#x3D; 0. So t &#x3D; a/b. So if b &#x3D;&#x3D; 0 it would return True, then t is indetermined. But I want to directly envolve t in the boolean expressions. 
 ​
 Thanks to anyone who answers.

 I have found this project https://github.com/ScalablyTyped/SlinkyTyped/blob/master/c/cypress/src/main/scala/typingsSlinky/cypress/package.scala
 Exist it other cypress wrapper library in Scala?

                    <span>I&#x27;m reading (studying) the book &quot;Scala with Cats&quot;. In the chapters on Functors, it includes a section on covariant functors.
 The book describes contravariant functors as &quot;the ability to prepend a transformation to a context&quot;. What is meant by a &quot;context&quot;? All the examples show how, under certain circumstances, you can derive a type-class instance F[A] from F[B] if you have a function A &#x3D;&gt; B. Unlike contravariant functors, covariant functors seem not operate on type-class instances, but on concrete data-types. Are covariant and contravariant functors in two distincly different categories? I &quot;understand&quot; covariant functors. How can I gain a better intuition of what a contravariant functor is?

                    <span>Hello fellow zettelnauts,
I use the ##tag method from Sasha to signify a root link or parent link attached to a note. When I search for ## I also get all the H2 sections.
##links to @#links, is there a way to have a saved search with a joker like to catch every terms beginning with @# like @#$ or @#catchall?
To organize myself I use ttt to signify a note as a terrain in french, meaning field, for me they work not like hubs. And I have the feeling I would appreciate to have a saved search with ttt AND my root tags to get an idea of where my energy is going.
Thank you</span>

                    <span>What&#x27;s the trick to getting my compose key to work in Emacs under Wayland?
 In X/Gnome I configure things so that
  [I] ➜ dconf read /org/gnome/desktop/input-sources/xkb-options [&#x27;compose:ralt&#x27;] 
 and that works in all programs it seems, including Emacs.
 Under Wayland, with Wayfire have
  [I] ➜ grep compose .config/wayfire.ini xkb_options &#x3D; compose:ralt 
 which works in all apps I&#x27;ve tried, except Emacs!
 In Emacs I&#x27;m told that  is undefined. All the instructions I&#x27;ve found tell me to add the file ~/.XCompose with the contents
  include &quot;%L&quot; 
 but that doesn&#x27;t have any effect at all. So, what do I do? What&#x27;s the trick?

                    <span>Org mode can be used as a Calendar where specific dates pop up on the screen? And notice stays on screen until you close it. Or you can&#x27;t use org mode as a calendar?
 What things without login give notifications of exact dates that stays on the screen until you close the alert?

                    <span>I recently switched from package.el to straight.el, and was surprised by how smooth the transition was - everything worked out of the box and the changes to my config were super minimal.
 However, a couple days and a couple modifications to my config later, I noticed that org-related things were breaking. Checking load-history showed that nearly all the org.*.elc files that were getting loaded were from the built-in version of Org instead of the one cloned by straight. 
 Maybe I was just hallucinating that it was ever working: at least if that&#x27;s the case, it provides a way for my best present theory to be true, which is that the built-in Org is getting loaded as a side-effect of me having a literate configuration. I printed the load-path variable at the beginning of my init.el file (which is basically just (org-babel-load-file &quot;~/.emacs.d/config.org&quot;)), and the straight version of Org wasn&#x27;t on the path yet. This has me thinking that when Emacs hits &quot;org-babel-load-file&quot; it loads the only version of Org available on the path - i.e. the built-in version.
 If so, what&#x27;s the fix? Does keeping a literate config force you to do some ugly workarounds with setting the load-path manually prior to running &quot;org-babel-load-file&quot; or pinning what version of a package you use through straight, or is there some cleaner option I don&#x27;t know of? It seems like Emacs should be able to reload a package to a newer version during runtime once the new source becomes available.

                    <span>Everytime I restart emacs, I have to manually run deft-find-file and org-roam-find-node before my keybindings are able to pull up all the files. If I don&#x27;t do that, deft and roam both show that no files are popping up. 
 I think this is an issue with my use-package config, where the packages are loading on demand instead of by default. Can anyone help with this?

                    <span>Most languages that I work with, I use a code formatter. It takes away a lot of the cognitive load with me having to worry about the code looking good.
 For elisp, I have been using srefactor for a long time, but it has quite a few issues have not been update in 5 years. Most other formatters for elisp/lisp that I have seen has some subtle issues or just does not handle splitting of long lines. People also have suggested just using aggressive-indent-mode and then putting the line breaks manually, but I was hoping to avoid having to decide where/when to split long lines as well.
 Do anyone else use a formatter, any recommendations on a good one?

                    <span>Note: Although the following example is for org-roam-capture-templates, it works in the same way as org-capture-template.
 How can I change the org-capture templates to insert the file name of the current buffer I&#x27;m visiting and format it with a string? create a new file with a name based on the file I&#x27;m currently visiting?
 Example: I&#x27;m visiting a file called book_notes_some_title.org and I want org-capture to create a new file called book_notes_some_title_anki.org.
 The following example doesn&#x27;t work because it will only call the function once - when I evaluate the variable. I need to make it call a function every time I create the template.
 The function simply return the current buffer&#x27;s file-name (through org-roam) and appends _anki.org to the name.
 (setq org-roam-capture-templates &#x60;((&quot;d&quot; &quot;default&quot; plain &quot;%?&quot; :if-new (file+head ,(format &quot;%s_anki.org&quot; (file-name-nondirectory (file-name-sans-extension (org-roam-node-file (org-roam-node-at-point))))) &quot;#+title: ${title}\nDescription: &quot;) :unnarrowed t))) 
 Edit: My explanation was wrong.

                    <span>Some time ago a proposal for better records was accepted and implemented:
 https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/282
 https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0282-record-dot-syntax.rst
 This looked very exciting, and would simplify many things related to record access.
 For example:
 data Person &#x3D; Person { name :: String, age :: Int} getAge :: Person -&gt; Int getAge p &#x3D; p.age 
 This is a standard feature in many languages, not having it may have throw off many beginners looking into Haskell.
 Do you know what is the status? Is it available already?

                    <span>I am trying to link to a C++ library and get this weird error:
 : User-specified static library could not be loaded (/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/10/libgcc.a) Loading static libraries is not supported in this configuration. 
 I use stack with LTS-18.12 and in the cabal file there is:
 extra-libraries: stdc++ gcc dl z pthread 
 The cabal settings are:
 extra-libraries: stdc++ gcc dl z pthread 
 and the ghc options are:
 ghc-options: -O0 -g2 -Wall -Wcompat -Widentities -Wincomplete-record-updates -Wincomplete-uni-patterns -Wredundant-constraints -Wpartial-fields -funbox-strict-fields -threaded -rtsopts 
 This is especially weird, as the exact same settings with the exact same stack LTS are in use in another project and there it works without the error. 
 I am a bit lost about what is happening/where to look at. Does somebody have an idea?

                    <span>Basically I&#x27;m in 3 weeks into my cs degree and have no clue what is going on. We&#x27;re using haskell in our &quot;Introduction to Computation&quot; module. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m incapable of understanding the concepts but everything just moves very fast and I&#x27;m left trying to cram and eventually understanding very little of what&#x27;s going on.
 Maybe this is the wrong place to ask, but how do I efficiently catch up and grasp the concepts so I&#x27;m able to solve basic problems using things like list comprehension and recursion? My grade depends on this because it&#x27;s based on the coursework we submit each week.
 ​
 Any help is appreciated :)

 https://reanimate.github.io/
 It looks great to create video animations, such as in the Youtube channel 3Blue1Brown (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw)

                    <span>I&#x27;m new to the Haskell world and recently discovered The Monad.Reader, which is so enjoyable to read.
 Unfortunately, there seems to be no updates since 2015 [1], yet there&#x27;s no official announcement of shutdown. What happened? Is there any hope TMR can continue?

                    <span>Hi Everyone, I am an organizer of a similar data science community like yours. We are involved in &quot;AI for Earth Monitoring&quot; project. It&#x27;s a cool online course created by experts who teach Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence using imagery datasets from Sentinel satellites. It starts online on October 18th, 2021. It’s a completely free course. We have about 2k registrations so far but would be happy to see folks from other communities foster exchange between us.

                    <span>Hello, fellow Zettlers!
Being fresh to both Zettelkasten method and this forum, I have to first and foremost ask for your forgiveness if this was already discussed or perhaps it is stupidly obvious, but I struggled to find any threads relating to the following conundrum: how to deal with fields of knowledge or areas of practice, which are subject to significant changes in relatively short time frames?
Example: I am a lawyer based in an EU member state, practicing in a global industry dealing with several fields of law (e.g. intellectual property or privacy law) which are subject to quite dynamic changes (due to legislative actions on EU and state level, ever growing case law, technological changes, etc.). Of course, some concepts fundamental to jurisprudence or terminology specific to a given field may stay relevant for some time. However, due to this high variability, when taking notes regarding more practical and recent issues I face the problem of dealing with &quot;volatile&quot; notes, which feel like they may unexpectedly, suddenly, in any moment become irrelevant, useless or even harmful (e.g. by severing an existing train of thought with a statement which is not true any more).
Maybe this is my lack of understanding, but I feel there is a meaningful difference between evolution of sciences (regardless of its pace), where old models or theories give way to new ones, which explain given real phenomena better, or where new evidence provide a fresh look on the reality; 
legal &quot;reality&quot; may change in an instant, rendering prior statements describing this &quot;reality&quot; not so much obsolete or outdated as simply not true any more (or true exclusively within a bound time frame).
Are there any good practices or strategies helping to deal with such volatility of notes and tending the Zettelkasten without getting crazy?</span>

                    <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;d like to run plantuml source blocks against a locally started plantuml server.
 I start the server with:
  docker run -d -p 8080:8080 plantuml/plantuml-server:jetty 
 and I have put 
  (with-eval-after-load &#x27;org (org-babel-do-load-languages &#x27;org-babel-load-languages &#x27;( (dot . t) (emacs-lisp . t) (plantuml . t) (python . t) (shell . t) (sql . t) ) ) (require &#x27;ob-plantuml) 
 in init.el but when I try to run the below source block with C-c C-c
  #+begin_src plantuml :file output.png @startuml &#x27; this is a comment Alice -&gt; Bob: Authentication Request Bob --&gt; Alice: Authentication Response John --&gt; Alice: another Authentication Request Alice --&gt; John: another Authentication Response @enduml #+end_src 
 I get &#x27;org-plantuml-jar-path&#x27; is not set.
 What am I doing wrong? Can someone tell me how to get this running?

  (use-package counsel :init (setq ivy-use-virtual-buffers t) :config (ivy-mode 1) (global-set-key (kbd &quot;C-s&quot;) &#x27;swiper-isearch)) 
 it seems that I have properly instrumented versions of find-file, M-x, describe-function/variable, etc. But the bindings still refer to the original functions, not the counsel flavored ones, e.g.:
  C-x C-f runs the command find-file (found in global-map), which is an interactive compiled Lisp function in ‘files.el’. 
 When explicitly calling the counsel- ones, I see little to no difference, for example some of them automatically prefix the search pattern with .
 How is ivy instrumenting builtin functions under the hood? What does counsel add in top of that? Is it worth rebinding everything as suggested in the manual? Why?
 Sorry for so many questions but I dislike copy&amp;pasting stuff to my init.el without a clear reason. Maybe someone experienced with ivy can help me (an ido old-timer).
 Thanks!

                    <span>I&#x27;d like to be able to run tools such as checkdoc, package-lint, relint, bytecode-compile ... etc, from the command line, passing in multiple files.
 Are there any solutions for this?
  
I&#x27;ve got something basic working but would hold off making a release if there are better options out there.

                    <span>I used to have 3 monitors on my desk, but when I started working from home, I just had the 1 monitor, and for various reasons, I still only have the 1 and it&#x27;s unlikely to change.
 I used to have several small, single-purpose frames off on a second monitor, and one of them was for compilation output. It&#x27;s been 18 months with just one monitor, and I still haven&#x27;t found a solution that I like.
 Currently, I&#x27;ve got a child frame that pops up compilation output in the middle of my main frame. It hides itself if the compilation succeeds. I don&#x27;t really like this because there&#x27;s a lot of extra handling that I have to do, focus switching is weird (like if I&#x27;m in my web browser and click on the child frame, it&#x27;s in focus, but the main frame doesn&#x27;t come to the front. I have to click on a buffer in the parent frame), and it doesn&#x27;t play nicely with which-key, etc.
 I&#x27;ve tried some solutions where the buffer switches to the compilation output and the buffer hides itself afterwards, but those are honestly kinda janky. 
 So I&#x27;m on the verge of going back to a compilation frame--dedicated or not--but then the cues that compilation is still ongoing or has failed or succeeded might be hidden if I&#x27;m working on something else. (I used to try modifying the modeline in every active buffer, but that caused weird conflicts with doom modeline and other things that also wanted to play with the display.)
 There&#x27;s a tradeoff with everything; I&#x27;m not looking for a perfect solution, I&#x27;m just curious what other people do.

                    <span>I&#x27;d like to get very good at emacs lisp, but I&#x27;m usually at a loss about what I can do when I want to practice Elisp. What I&#x27;ve been doing so far definitely hasn&#x27;t been working (implementing a function here or there, going through the EINTR and emacs list manual, looking up things online.)
 What&#x27;s worked well for my learning style is to have a &quot;question of the day&quot; programming challenge, where the poster posts their own implementation of a programming problem the next day.
 Does anyone know of something like this for elisp?
 Thanks

                    <span>Hello everyone, I am optimizing my agenda views using org-super agenda, which is great. I would like to group my TODO&#x27;s both by filename and by path hierarchy. I can group by filenamess using the :auto-category selector, or by path hierarchy using the :auto-outline-path selector, but I cannot figure out how to get both. 
 I would like to get something like this:
 File_1.org/Tasks/Coding File_1 : NEXT Write script File_1 : TODO Debug File_1.org/Tasks/Manuscript File_1: TODO Write draft File_2.org/Tasks/Coding File_2: NEXT Run simulations 
 So basically it would like to add the filename to the groups obtained by :auto-outline-path selector. u/github-alphapapa, is this possible?
 Many thanks!

                    <span>When I first started using emacs (only a few months ago) I played around with speedbar which would open in a narrow frame on top of whatever frame I was in. Now I&#x27;ve gone back to it and I find it is opening full screen in it&#x27;s own frame hiding the original frame.
 I&#x27;ve looked thru the manual and I see something about frame parameters but I don&#x27;t know enough to know what if anything I should change or if I should be looking elsewhere.
 Any help is appreciated.

                    <span>Is there a way to have a context-specific expansion, for example using dabbrev or yasnippets, or another package, where a particular text expands to a different (pre-defined) string depending on the file you are in, or better, a buffer-local variable?
 For example, in one file tagged “baywatch-forever”, “david” could expand to “David Hasselhoff,” and in a file tagged “are-we-the-baddies,” “david” would expand to “David Mitchell.”

 boxy-headlines (previously org-real-headlines) allows you to view and navigate any org file as a boxy diagram.
 org-real allows you to keep track of real things as org mode links.
 Both of these packages rely on the boxy.el layout framework to generate interactive and expandable box diagrams.
 The example above shows off some of the available customization options for each package, like flex-width, margin, and padding, as well as the ability to work well in a linux console.
 Enjoy!

                    <span>Hi, I just got to university and my programming teacher told me we would be using Haskell the whole semester. He didn&#x27;t really tell us how to set it up though. All I have used is C# in VS Community and in Unity scripts, so I&#x27;ve always had it simplified in the IDE.
 What I want to know is: how do I start writing/using Haskell code? What is GHC/GHCup/Chocolatey? It seemed to me that GHC is something like a &quot;plugin&quot; required by the machine to run Haskell code, but I&#x27;m not sure of that, and I don&#x27;t even have a guess for what the other terms mean (GHCup/Chocolatey)
 I also tried installing VSCode with a Haskell extension and it seemed to be the most simple solution, but I would like opinions on that: what is best/easier? VSCode or using the PowerShell/CMD with &quot;manual&quot; writing on something like Sublime?
 If the manual way is best, can anyone explain how I install/set up Haskell/GHC on my PC? And how would I run code? If I have a function/method written on a file, what would I do if I wanted to use it? 
 Thanks a lot

                    <span>Do you guys use FFI to bind your own C/C++ functions in Haskell so that you can use in your own code?
 I&#x27;m not talking about Haskage FFI binding libraries.
 Can you shed some light on it how you do that?
 It is hard or reasonable easy?
 There some FFI examples online, but those examples are just baby example.

                    <span>I am a developer who works with a ticketing system. I get assigned tickets, they contain details, I complete the tickets, and move on to the next task. I would like to incorporate org mode into my workflow but I&#x27;m not sure how. Here is what I&#x27;d like to do, perhaps someone can tell me the best way to accomplish that.
 I want to be able to create a TODO for each ticket that I am assigned. I want to be able to keep notes on that ticket as well as have a check list of things to do. To include such items as:
  
investigate bug
 create a pull request
 verify with test team
  
Additionally I&#x27;d like to have custom states other than TODO and DONE. Something like TODO, IN PROGRESS, DONE, VERIFYING, and BLOCKED. Finally I would like to be able to assign tags to different tickets so I can track them. So if tickets 1,2,&amp;3 all deal with the UI, then they get tagged with &quot;UI&quot;. If tickets 4 &amp; 5 are done on the backend with Java, I&#x27;d like to tag them as &quot;JAVA&quot; and &quot;BACKEND&quot;. Then I&#x27;d like to be able to filter based on my tags.
 What is the best way of doing this in org mode? Should I be making a new document for each ticket? Just have one really big document with all my tickets? Is there something about this that I&#x27;m missing? I&#x27;d appreciate any clues you guys could toss my way.

                    <span>Hi, i am searching for some library where it accepts some image and returns a collection of characters and their position in image (or obviously something in this direction)
 Would be nice if it could work with &quot;weird&quot; text as one can see in comics.
 I do see some java libraries for this, wonder what is the best one and if there is some scala wrap or alternative (but java is fine also if nothing else)
 thanks.

                    <span>Hello folks! My apologies if the title sounds vague, I&#x27;m looking for advice or project ideas to get an introduction to frameworks such as Play, Akka and Spark. and to how they are being used in real world applications. I have some background in Rust, so getting familiar with Scala was pretty straightforward. I&#x27;m loving the language a lot and how natural it feels. 
 However, I would like to start building some hobby projects by using the aforementioned frameworks if possible, but I&#x27;m not really sure where to start, or which of them is more beginner-intermediate-friendly. 
 May I ask; does anyone mind suggesting a learning roadmap or drop some project suggestions/ideas? I&#x27;d deeply appreciate it. Thank you in advance. Stay safe and healthy everyone.

                    <span>A bit of background information may be useful. I&#x27;m from Uruguay. I graduated from high school with an engineering degree, then requested inscription for the faculty of engineering.
However, I was a poor learner back then. Imagine short-term memorization on steroids. Effective short-term, not at all long-term. In other words, I remember nothing. Not even what an atom is.
I&#x27;m not sure if this is important, but I&#x27;m adding it in case it is.
I&#x27;m taking a gap year and now I&#x27;m working on choosing a career to pursue. I don&#x27;t have the research skills necessary to get anywhere with this, so I don&#x27;t know where to even begin. Also, at the same time, I can&#x27;t do research on how to do research. Thus, I&#x27;m double stuck, if that&#x27;s even possible.
I&#x27;ve tried looking on Google, Reddit, and Wikipedia. Didn&#x27;t help. Too much information, some of it not actionable, and I don&#x27;t even know which is trustworthy.
Any tips on how to get unstuck with this project? If research isn&#x27;t important to complete it, some advice or resources on research would be helpful too. Research skills are crucial for most of what I do.</span>

                    <span>Hi!
 I&#x27;m trying to export org-protocol links so I can open stuff directly in emacs, but the ox-html export won&#x27;t even export the link.
 This is the code I&#x27;m using before processing:
 (defun my-open-in-emacs-link (backend) &quot;Add a link to use org-protocol to open a file in emacs.&quot; (save-excursion (goto-char (point-min)) (while (re-search-forward &quot;\\(\\[\\[file:.*?\\]\\[.*\\]\\]\\)&quot; nil t) (message &quot;MATCHED: %s&quot; (match-string-no-properties 1)) (let* ((file-path (replace-regexp-in-string &quot;.*\\[\\[file:\\(.*?\\)\\]\\[.*&quot; &quot;\\1&quot; (match-string-no-properties 1))) (fixed-file-path (replace-regexp-in-string &quot;\\(.*?\\)\\(::.*\\)?&quot; &quot;\\1&quot; file-path))) (message &quot;FILE_PATH: %s&quot; fixed-file-path) (replace-match (format &quot;%s ([[org-protocol://open-file?file&#x3D;%s][open in Emacs]])&quot; (match-string-no-properties 1) fixed-file-path)))))) (add-hook &#x27;org-export-before-processing-hook &#x27;my-open-in-emacs-link) 
 So, before processing the org file, go through each link and make is look like [[link][name]] ([[protocol][open in Emacs]]. However the only thing that shows when exporting is name (). The protocol part won&#x27;t show up.
 How can I export the org-protocol link?

                    <span>Hi,
 I am working on adding more packages to NonGNU ELPA, the new package archive enabled by default from Emacs 28 onwards. Compared to GNU ELPA, there is no need for a copyright assignment (the only requirement is that packages do not endorse non-free software, but that is the case for most Emacs-related software to begin with).
 As can be seen here, I have already added contributed a number of popular packages and am waiting for a few packages to be fixed before they are added (I log the progress on these issues on my homepage).
 Going forward, I&#x27;d like to know what packages there would be an interest in adding to the archive? Note that a lot of popular packages are already on GNU ELPA, but I am specifically interested in the packages that are currently just available on MELPA or in no other package archive.
 (P.S. I am not interested in a flame-war on whether or not NonGNU ELPA makes sense or not. I just want to gather a list of popular packages.)

                    <span>You can redefine function in Elisp. 
 (defalias cursorWord &#x27;thing-at-point) (defalias let &#x27;setq) does not work? 
 ​
 Any idea how to redefine keyword like setq to let in Elisp?

                    <span>Under some circumstances - e.g. when using CPU-intensive plugins - emacs -nw can be seen flickering; fortunately, a lot of modern terminal emulators, such as Kitty, support a feature called synchronized updates which allows for what is essentially double-buffering.
 If you are bothered by flickering, this quick &amp; crude patch might help you:
 https://gist.github.com/Patryk27/c7b9dac8113f4ccdb2ef74e0083d9d41
 I&#x27;ve just created it a few minutes ago, but a quick test shows that the code works as intended; I&#x27;ll try using it for a few days and probably try upstreaming it - in a better, more configurable way, that is :-)

                    <span>From laptop keyboard it works as expected.
 When I use an external keyboard (MS Sculpt), the opt-somekey combinations are recognized as Greek/Special characters (π , © etc).
 If I load emacs without any packages (emacs -q) it works as expected.
 So it is some package loaded later doing this? 
 I had &#x27;Chord&#x27; enabled before. I removed it but it didn&#x27;t improve the situation.
 My Setup
  
Mac OS X Big Sur
 
Emacs28 with native compilation (Same issue with 27)
 
Recent Doom emacs config.
 
 I use Doom with several programming modes, orgmode etc. How do I narrow down which package is causing this?

                    <span>I use org to take notes for my classes, and make pretty good use of &gt;&gt; to make vocabulary terms and definitions get automatically linked-to from other parts of my notes (I use a file per class so I only need intra-file links).
 However upon exporting my notes to PDF to share with classmates (so they don&#x27;t have to ignore all the org markup and it looks pretty), the radio links don&#x27;t work. It does remove all the angle brackets, but no links. Ideally I&#x27;d like it to preserve that so people reading the pdf can click links to jump around in the (very long) file.
 Is this:
  
Something wrong on my config (maybe add some kind of #+ line to the file telling the exporter to include radio links? A variable in emacs?)
 Something wrong with my latex install (I have the full scheme of like 2GB of stuff, I can&#x27;t imagine I&#x27;m missing something)
 A limitation of PDF (do PDFs even support file jump links? Interestingly exporting to ODT mostly preserves them - they work similar to how they do inside emacs, but then converting the ODT to pdf doesn&#x27;t work either, and I can&#x27;t leave it as ODT as they&#x27;re all normie MS Word users, and afaik Word can&#x27;t open ODT files)
 A limitation of org&#x27;s exporter (I just can&#x27;t export radio links/have to make [[manual links]]?)
  
Any leads or help would be appreciated.

 Are there any packages that disable using the same command twice (Like repeated C-n or C-f ) so I&#x27;m forced to move more efficiently?

                    <span>When I am using tramp to visit a remote machine in a dired buffer, I mark several files and hit shift-c to copy. But the auto completion of ivy prevents me from copying remote file to local machine, because it does not allow me to delete the ssh prefix, e.g. /ssh:jky@mac:/, once I delete to the slash, I cannot delete further. 
 How can I get rid of this behavior? Is there a variable to set? I don&#x27;t want to switch ivy on and off just to get this work.

                    <span>I use mu4e for my email management and send emails with smtp. When I send an email, I have to wait a a few seconds for authentication and sometimes even longer if the emails contains a large attachment. Also, although rare, I might be offline. Instead, I am looking into queuing my emails.
 I know of smtpmail-queue-mail and the info here, but I am wondering if there is a way to get the emails sent in the background or when emacs is idle and the internet connection is working.
 Any help/hints are appreciated.

                    <span>Hi,
 I have a lot of projects. Some work related and some are personal. I want to be able to have profiles, wherein work profile would show only work related projects and personal profile would show only personal projects.
 Is this possible to achieve?
 I am using spacemacs + projectile.

                    <span>I am trying to follow this guide to send emails via eMacs: https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/bfsck6/mu4e_for_dummies/
 I can receive emails and all the IMAP functions seem to be working (deleting/reading updates other mail clients).
 However, when trying to send emails it just hangs at “sending via mail…” with no obvious errors.
 I’m using ProtonMail and their bridge, with the default SSL mode. If I try changing it to STARTSSL I get either a certificate error or invalid transport method error, so I can see that it’s maybe trying to send the email if the rest of the config is broken?
 I saw this note that using contexts for smtpmail settings as outlined above might not work, but I was wondering if anyone else had thoughts on that? I’d like to not add another application to the mail process if possible.

                    <span>I was trying to compile the latest sources from the savannah.
 The configure step worked just fine but the make gave the following error:
 /usr/bin/ld: comp.o: in function Fcomp_el_to_eln_rel_filename&#x27;:
 comp.c:(.text+0x379): undefined reference to md5_stream
 I tried to clean up everything and make bootstrap but to no avail. Googling this issue also came in vain.
 ​
 I used to update and compile weekly, and everything was alright then. There was a one-month gap since my last update, and I noticed the version was bumped to 29. I was wondering if there is anything new I missed or it is because of something else.
 ​
 Has anyone encountered something similar? I am so grateful for any hints or solutions for this issue.
 Thank you for the help!

                    <span>Hello!
 I have made a blog with Yesod that uses a Postgresql database. I am trying to deploy this to Heroku. 
 I&#x27;ve tried multiple buildpacks but they all time out. I&#x27;ve tried commenting out dependencies and trying to upload it partially and I&#x27;m still not able to deploy it. Tried using Docker but I&#x27;m quite new to using it so I can&#x27;t say that I knew what I was doing there..
 Does anyone have any relevant guide that you think I can follow? Your experience with this? 
 I&#x27;m getting to a point where I&#x27;m willing to pay someone just to show me how this is done.. 
 Thank you!

                    <span>How does this code works ?
 Map ((:) x) acc
 I&#x27;m having a rough time understanding how this function should change a list/acc.
 And what about this :
 prefixes :: [a] -&gt; [[a]] prefixes &#x3D; foldr (\x acc -&gt; [x] : ( map ((:) x) acc))
 I&#x27;d like to get full explanation.

                    <span>I&#x27;m so close to nailing the first few steps of my note taking system! The final hurdle for me at the moment is getting org-noter-pdftools-create-skeleton to create a much plainer output, and bonus points for it going straight into an org-roam node, but I&#x27;d happy for that not to happen.
 Currently when I run M-x org-noter-pdftools-create-skeleton I get the following org-file. I have no idea what the &#x27;contents&#x27; subheading is doing, but it seems to contain random bit from the annotation.
 Ideally I want the command to just output a bullet pointed list with the &#x27;comment&#x27; text. 
 If anyone has experience with changing the output of this command I&#x27;d love to hear what you did and how. 
 I&#x27;m quite new to emacs on the whole, so forgive me if the solution appears simple!

 Hello everybody,
 droplet is a type-safe SQL library targeting (so far, only) Postgres. Two main features set it apart from similar PureScript (or Haskell) libraries:
  
SQL like DSL
  
The eDSL used tries to stay as close as possible to regular SQL. IMO, this has the advantage of making the translation from PureScript to SQL transparent, specially for more complex queries.
 So far, most common usage SQL keywords are supported, e.g., SELECT INSERT DELETE UPDATE UNION PREPARE, etc.
  
Query mapper 
  
Query result rows are always expressed as records, with projected columns as keys. The query mapper can also be used independently from the DSL, in case raw SQL strings are needed.
 Feedback is highly welcomed. Specially ideas to improve error messages or ease the current type class abuse :)

                    <span>Michael Tsai featured a couple quotes from Matt Gemmell recently about monospace plain text and fully justified layout: 
https://mjtsai.com/blog/2021/09/30/manual-full-justification/
The linked twitter thread is worth a look.
The real banger is this document: https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/snes/588741-super-metroid/faqs/10114
You don&#x27;t have to actually read it; it&#x27;s a guide/walkthrough for a Super Nintendo game. The interesting detail is that the author accomplished full text justification without tweaking the spacing between words. That&#x27;s how you usually accomplish that effect in e.g. MS Word or other desktop publishing applications. The space between words is stretched.

But here, there&#x27;s only ever 1 space between words.
So the author had to write everything to fit. Conversely, that means words and sentence structures had to be picked because of their length to properly fill the available space.
Matt Gemmell points out that this is not a feat one is likely to accomplish for the lulz. It&#x27;s serious effort. And that document sure as heck is long! Now that&#x27;s some plain text dedication</span>

 It would suck if I have to leave my emacs for managing my email...

                    <span>Hello all! I would be grateful for any help with a question about org-mode. I love using org files, and displaying them in Emacs is wonderful: I have my config set up to present subtrees indented, hide leading stars, etc.
 However, I would like to improve how my .org files look when accessed by other editors (or when printed out). Without the illusion of indentation that comes from editing .org files in Emacs, the documents are (at least in my opinion) extremely hard to decipher at-a-glance; there is no obvious visual relationship between headings and subheadings.
 Ideally, I would like for the content under subheadings to actually be indented in the text files, so that they would be easy to read/skim in other editors. My searching led to me to this page in the manual, which seems to explain that this can be done if the following settings are used:
 (setq org-adapt-indentation t org-hide-leading-stars t org-odd-levels-only t) 
 However, even after adding these settings to my config, the behavior doesn&#x27;t change: when I save a .org buffer, it is written to disk without hard indentation. Did I misunderstand something about how this works/should work (perhaps I missed something obvious)? Has anyone else had better luck making this happen?
 Many thanks in advance for any help.

                    <span>TLDR: Try consult-dir and embark
 Lately I&#x27;ve been doing a lot of config hacking. I use Doom as my main daily driver, but starting a vanilla config and playing around with various packages has taught me a lot of cool stuff and helped me rethink parts of my workflow that have been fairly sub-optimal until now (naturally there&#x27;s still lots of room for further refinement).
 Yesterday and today I&#x27;ve migrated features from my vanilla config that I particularly like into my Doom config. While doing it, I got carried away with the latest commit message, which related to adding my consult-dir and embark configurations into Doom. These are both great packages and I am more than happy to do what I can to give them more attention and hopefully convince some people to check them out! Here are links to…</span>

                    <span>Hey all, I&#x27;m trying to make flymake work with a custom init function. First I needed this to make it work on the linux kernel source. I found a stackoverflow answer that creates a flymake.mk in the root of the project and makes flymake to look for that file, which only contains the make recipe check-syntax.
 Of course that didn&#x27;t work. Flymake log says: *** No rule to make target &#x27;check-syntax&#x27;. Stop.
 So I did a way simpler project, just a file.c and a Makefile, with default flymake and that worked fine. So I removed the check-syntax part from the Makefile and put it on a flymake.mk, all three files in the same directory. Now again with the custom init and doesn&#x27;t work either. First of all, I tried to see if the custom init was being selected, and it does, when I run (flymake-proc--get-fi…</span>

                    <span>tldr; You can use C-u M-x command-name to pass the Universal Argument into an interactive command. This is helpful if you do not want to bind the command to a hotkey, but still want to pass the Universal Argument into it.
 I recently encountered a situation with the anki-editor package where I wanted to pass the Universal Argument into the anki-editor-push-notes function. I did not want to create a keyboard shortcut for this command because I will use it less than once a day. First I tried things like M-x anki-editor-push-notes(4) and M-x (anki-editor-push-notes &#x27;(4)) but neither of those worked. Then, following this guide, I created a wrapper function that calls (anki-editor-push-notes &#x27;(4)). This worked fine. I could call my wrapper function which would in turn call the function I really wanted to run with the Universal Argument passed in; however, I figured out a more succinct way. Pressing C-u M-x anki-editor-push-notes will pass the Universal Argument into the command. In my opinion this is better because I don&#x27;t have to have that extra function in my init.el and I don&#x27;t have to remember two slightly distinct commands.
 I figured if I didn&#x27;t know about this and the author of this guide may not have known about this, then there may be other people on the subreddit who do not know about this. So I am just trying to share a cool thing I learned.

                    <span>I use the i3wm on a two monitor setup. 
 I generally have one Emacs GUI window/frame with my org-agenda buffer and mu4e continually open on a single workspace on one monitor. 
 Then I open a new instance of Emacs (in a new frame) for whatever project I intend to work on. If I want to pivot to an unrelated project/task, I open a new Emacs frame and edit the relevant files to that project there.
  
I&#x27;m curious to know if this is the standard in the Emacs community. I sometimes think this workflow is a bit too resource intensive, and it seems wasteful to execute init.el several times and load all my packages etc. every time I do something new (although it takes &lt;5 sec to load, which I&#x27;m happy with).
 An alternative would be running one instance of Emacs, then doing e.g. C-x 5 2 to open a new frame (but now init.el is not re-evaluated) every time I want to work on a different project/task. This also feels a bit resource heavy -- maybe the resolution of this problem is just to not open so many things at once!
 What is your workflow, and do you think it&#x27;s efficient memory wise, or helpful in terms of organization?

So I have a function for inserting the sections from parsed &#x27;result-groups&#x27; (a group is all the DOM material for one result):
 (defun my/w3m-insert-duckduckgo-section (group) (let ((href (cdar (cdadar group))) (title (caddar group)) (body (cddr (nth 1 group)))) (magit-insert-section (result) (magit-insert-heading (insert (format &quot;%s\n&quot; title))) (insert (format &quot;%s\n&quot; &quot;this-is-the-body&quot;))))) 
 I&#x27;m using the &quot;this-is-the-body&quot; string in place of an actual body at the moment, because I haven&#x27;t got round to learning about parsing DOM text yet.
 I run this in a loop over all the groups, inserting each one. This runs inside a root section I insert first.
 This inserts the relevant text, but with no special properties (e.g. magit sections normally have certain faces) and no newlines. Everything is on one line, just running on to the next result.
 If I run something like this in a scratch buffer, the result is correct:
 (magit-insert-section (root) (magit-insert-section (result) (magit-insert-heading (format &quot;%s\n&quot; &quot;Header text 1&quot;)) (insert (format &quot;%s\n\n&quot; &quot;this-is-the-body&quot;))) (magit-insert-section (result) (magit-insert-heading (format &quot;%s\n&quot; &quot;Header text 2&quot;)) (insert (format &quot;%s\n&quot; &quot;this-is-the-body&quot;)))) 
 Running eval-last-sexp after this in the scratch buffer works exactly as expected (standard magit section text properties, newlines are printed correctly). What&#x27;s most stange is that if I use eval-expression to run the above form in a w3m buffer, it works correctly! Correct faces and properties etc.
 So, why do the newlines and properties not show up in the w3m buffer when I call the forms programatically vs interactively, and how can I fix this?
 TIA!

                    <span>Hi emacs lovers, i use mu4e for my mail and changed to the new gnus message view, which has some nice properties amongst others an indication how long ago a message was sent.
 However, I get all the time a popup window called *appease-gnus*, which i can kill (C-x k) but keeps popping up. It looks like a hook is executed when point is on the Attachment field in mu4e:view.
 ​
 Does anyone experience this as well and knows how to stop this popup behaviour?
 Thanks in advance 
 Marcel

                    <span>Is Emacs secure ? As in, if I install some packages, will that poses any &quot;security threat&quot; to my computer ? If I rephrase that - can we make Emacs more secure maybe ? I may sound silly, but if you have any thoughts about that same, I&#x27;m very much interested in that. 
 Thank you.

                    <span>I have a social science background. Most, if not all, of my requirements consists of - taking notes and to be able to search through them to write research papers. I am already using Scrivener, which I feel, seems to do all of that pretty efficiently.
 I have a question for the Emacs community. How can Emacs help me ? I am willing to take the learning curve, but how is Emacs better than Scrivener ? That&#x27;s my main question.
 Any help would be very much appreciated. Thank you.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been working on a cookbook using emacs org mode, and org-chef to import recipes. I set it up so that I can export to a printable bifold booklet that I can use in the kitchen, and it exports to my website: https://www.gnuisnotunix.com/recipes/
 I have a couple more things I&#x27;d like it to do:
 So far I have been manually inserting page breaks with #+LATEX: \newpage to prevent recipes from splitting across odd numbered pages, so you don&#x27;t have to flip a page to see the rest of the recipe. I&#x27;d like a way to automate that if possible. I usually adjust the font size a bit to get everything to fit on a multiple of 4 pages for printing.
 On the HTML end, I&#x27;d like a simple way for each recipe heading to link back to the table of contents, to make the page easier to navigate. It would also be nice if I could get the title of the page to export as a h3 instead of h1, to match the sidebar.
 I have the org mode source here if anyone wants to take a look: https://www.gnuisnotunix.com/recipes/recipes.org

                    <span>Carsten Dominik in his Google TechTalk said that Emacs is for people who like to tinker, and that has definitely been my experience and one of the reasons I love Emacs so much. (link to talk https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;oJTwQvgfgMM )
 I have been using Emacs since 2016, and would roughly estimate that I have spent 100+ hours configuring Emacs to my liking (only using other packages and writing small custom functions), and I still play around with my init most weeks to update it and fine tune it to my liking. Although I could use something like Doom or Spacemacs and get a pretty awesome environment with minimal setup, creating and customising these things to my own personal taste is super satisfying. 
 Was just curious, how much time have you all spent configuring your beloved setup? :)

                    <span>A while ago u/godkbg asked about highlighting enclosing brackets.
 At the time hl-block-mode didn&#x27;t support this, since then I&#x27;ve added options to support this.
 Example configuration:
 (use-package hl-block-mode :commands (hl-block-mode) :config (setq hl-block-bracket nil) ;; Match all brackets. (setq hl-block-single-level t) ;; Only one pair of brackets. (setq hl-block-style &#x27;bracket) ;; Highlight only the brackets. :hook ((prog-mode) . hl-block-mode))

                    <span>I&#x27;m currently trying to make some bindings to a c library. The C library has a whole bunch of constructors and special destructors. Which means I can&#x27;t just free everything with free; I have to use the correct c function.
 My plan was to use the ReaderT monad to hold pointers of the allocated objects and create a typeclass for deletion which would trigger when things fall out of scope:
 class Collectable p where collect :: (MonadIO m) &#x3D;&gt; p -&gt; m () newtype CThing &#x3D; CThing (Ptr ()) instance Collectable CThing where collect (CThing p) &#x3D; ffi_c_delete_function_for_thing p 
 I then created a newtype called &#x27;Bin&#x27; for holding these objects:
 newtype Bin &#x3D; Bin { unBin :: forall p . Collectable p &#x3D;&gt; [p] } 
 The reason for this is that it complained about impredicative polymorphism if I didn&#x27;t create the newtype. It also didn&#x27;t like:
 newtype Bin &#x3D; Bin { unBin :: [forall p . Collectable p &#x3D;&gt; p] } 
 For the same reason.
 I then tried to call the delete functions on the environment:
 mapM collect $ unBin env 
 But GHC complains again:
 Ambiguous type variable ‘a0’ arising from a use of ‘collect’ prevents the constraint ‘(Collectable a0)’ from being solved. 
 Why can&#x27;t it solve the constraint? I have defined a bin to contain only collectable objects!?
 As you have probably worked out by now, I have very little idea what I&#x27;m doing when it comes to higher rank polymorphism! send help!
 I have a backup plan (creating a type level list for the environment and using type families to construct the Collectable class), but it seems excessive

I started migrating many of my notes, api org files (used with verb) and other things at work into it&#x27;s own private org repo. What i&#x27;d like to do is actually somehow combine the content of the repos together without actually having them go to the same repo. So at work, I can add work fiels to the work repo, while at the same time have the db include my personal files that I can also update. I&#x27;m not sure if there&#x27;s ways to manage this seamlessly so that I can not have my private content mixed with my public.

                    <span>How can I set a task to repeat only on weekdays with some specific time?
 I see some documentations Repeated tasks - Org mode, and packages like org-recur, other way that I saw on a suggestion is:
 * TODO Some task SCHEDULED:  * TODO Some task SCHEDULED:  
 Is set the same task to each day from the weekday, but I think that this approach isn&#x27;t correctly.
 Do you know if is there a way to do some task work with only weekdays (Mon to Fri) with a specific time?

                    <span>I have a social science background. Most, if not all, of my requirements consists of - taking notes and to be able to search through them to write research papers. I am already using Scrivener, which I feel, seems to do all of that pretty efficiently.
 I have a question for the Emacs org-mode community. How Emacs org-mode can help me ? I am willing to take the learning curve, but how is Emacs org-mode better than Scrivener ? That&#x27;s my main question.
 Any help would be very much appreciated. Thank you.

                    <span>Is there a good strategy for calling C code from Scala? I know there’s JNI and JNA but they’re both pretty painful. There’s sbt-JNI, which seems good. There’s also graal but I don’t particularly want to run my C++ stuff on the VM too. Seems unnecessary. What I really want is some kind of pybind11 but for the JVM. Maybe something like cppsharp. Any thoughts?

When reporting the prior bug I noticed that my YAML Block in each note is now bold.  Moving it to the last line doesn&#x27;t change the font style back to plain.</span>

                    <span>v1.7.2
Example string of tags with the last one in the series having lost its link decoration.

It seems this behavior is when tags are not on the last line of the file.
Let me explain the following GIF. 
I then line feed 3X, and up arrow, so I&#x27;m not on the last line of the file, and after each tag, a space character causes the last tag to lose its link decorations.
Notice the tag in the YAML block. It is not on the last line of the file, and it has no link decoration because it has a space character after it.

EDIT::
It is the last word in the tag that loses its link decoration. In this screenshot, only the second half of the two-word tag is affected.</span>

                    <span>ok - so I&#x27;m trying to do something I THINK should be simple, but I can&#x27;t figure out how to do it.
 I want to do something pretty conceptually simple. But I don&#x27;t know enough elisp to figure out how to do it.
 I have helm configured with helm-bibtex, I have org, and org-roam, and org-ref all more or less installed and working.
 EDIT: in response to a comment below - I also have org-roam-bibtex as well. 
 What I want to have happen is when I open helm-bibtex and select a paper, and then select edit notes, that instead of opening a note with the paper title (as it does now) it runs the org-roam capture template and creates an org-roam node (if one doesn&#x27;t exist) or opens an existing org-roam node (if it already exists) with the the cite-key as the file name, the paper title as the title, the author&#x27;s name filled in, etc.
 Any idea how I can do this?

                    <span>Now pressing &#x60;C-c C-e h o&#x60; takes half a minute to generate one HTML export. 
 Some one posted the same question a while ago: https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/mmdeei/how_to_speed_up_org_exportpublish/, but things may get worse as org-roam files number goes up.
 Do any org-roam users run into the same issue? I guess I could consolidate multiple org roam files into one while still keeping the node IDs. 
 Do you have any workarounds or comments?

                    <span>Hello all,
 I have been using org-noter and pdf-tools for taking notes during lectures and annotating the slides. However, I would like to have an option to :
  
Automatically update my notes with the highlighted portions, without having to call org-noter-create-skelton every time (more over this function executes interactively so I have to select the options every time). This would make it easier to switch seamlessly between the pdf and the notes.
 When adding precise notes with the shortcut M-i, highlight the corresponding portion in the pdf automatically.
  
Is there any config that I am using missing to achieve these two features ?

                    <span>I am required to write a function that compares the elements of two lists in Haskell. I want to write the function to have the data type signature a -&gt; [a] -&gt; [a]. Here, the a can either be Integers or be tuples (Integers, Integers). I want my function to work in both cases. However, as far as I am aware, tuples cannot be compared with the &quot;&#x3D;&#x3D;&quot; sign, right? So, the function I have so far
 findE n [] &#x3D; []
 findE n (m:zs) &#x3D; if (n &#x3D;&#x3D; m) then findE n zs else m:(findE n zs)
 will work fine for when a &#x3D;&#x3D; Integer but not for when the elements in the list are two-component tuples right? I was looking for how to improve my code so that it works for both cases. Also, it would be preferable if no modules need to be imported unless absolutely necessary to make this function universal for a lot of types. Thank you!

                    <span>I am looking to write a zip function in Haskell, such that each element of list 1 combines to form a tuple with each element of list 2, something like -
 zip&#x27; [0,1,2] [3,4,5] &#x3D; [(0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (1,3), (1,4), (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5)]
 I was wondering if there is a way possible to describe such a function using the original zip. Or ideas on any other way in which this can be done are appreciated!
 I was thinking of &quot;zip (map list1) list2&quot; however this is not really yielding the results it should.

 So I would like to place a static file somewhere inside my source library, a git repository with a directory of Haskell modules together with a cabal file. But what&#x27;s the best way to configure the location of that static template file? What&#x27;s the best way to access it from file system as the default file from within my code?

                    <span>I am writing a code to check if two lists in Haskell contain the same elements. I cannot use library functions for my code, however. Any advice on how I should proceed with this? Although ideally, I am interested in knowing if there is a way to do this even if the lists have duplicates, I am thinking of writing a code to remove duplicates and then check if the two lists are equal. I already have the code written to remove the duplicates, but cannot think of what to do next to actually compare the lists both ways (i.e, to check if both have exactly the same elements).

                    <span>I&#x27;m trying to get a better grasp on the type system of purescript. One thing I&#x27;m struggling to fully understand is how the so-called &quot;kind system&quot; works. The language reference is very brief about it.
 Are there other resources available (perhaps with more examples) that explain this?

                    <span>Hello fellow Zettelkasteners. I have heard that zettel notes should be written in one&#x27;s own words. But I have never understood what it means to write notes in your own words. Most of the time I just copy a passage with minor changes or I translate an English passage as if I copied it.
I thought about different strategies. I could first read a paragraph, then close the book, then rewrite some ideas from memory without looking at the text. Or I could simply read the text and not bother with the information within and just write my thoughts that could come into my mind. Or I could write the note as if I explained it to my mom.
Note that I write my zettel notes in Romanian so when I read a text in English I translate it in Romanian. Not that it helps.
Am I missing something? Can you tell me how can I write a zettel note without copying from the text or write it in my own words?</span>

                    <span>I got a version of snake working with the threepenny-gui library, but I didn&#x27;t like the fact that I was explicitly calling newEvent and addStateUpdate manually instead of defining the behavior completely based on events, e.g. this:
 (updates, addUpdate)  addUpdate $ \manager -&gt; manager&#x27; 
 compared to:
 managerB  \manager -&gt; manager&#x27; 
 IIUC the second is more idiomatic FRP, as it defines a behavior with the actual event instead of creating a proxy event to proxy updates through. But when I make this change, it causes one of two problems:
  
If I define managerB first (using RecursiveDo to access timer, which is defined below), nothing&#x27;s rendered at all
 If I move managerB to the end (using RecursiveDo to access managerB from the DOM elements), the initial movement when hitting an arrow key for the first time lags, and the frames render in a jerky fashion.
  
Am I doing something wrong? What&#x27;s the idiomatic way I should structure these events/behaviors?

                    <span>You can find the code here: https://github.com/santiweight/poker
 Over the last 1-2 years, I&#x27;ve accumulated a good amount of poker-related code that I think would be best to share! Over this week I&#x27;ll be adding some more libraries to the collection of poker libraries, but this is a good place to start :)
 I&#x27;m hoping for:
  
feedback: anything you think/feel about the library and its goals
 usage: try and use the library - tell me if it&#x27;s helpful...
 review: look at the library code, let me know where I need to make improvements.
  
I haven&#x27;t yet been able to upload to Hackage, because I don&#x27;t yet have uploader status. I&#x27;m not restless here (I only asked for permission last night). But let me know if you have any issues downloading. I&#x27;ll also be around all day (west coast USA) to discuss the code in chat or phone call.

                    <span>in polysemy, freer-simple and effectful there are two different functions for interpreting an effect:
 interpret :: e :&gt; es &#x3D;&gt; (e a -&gt; Eff es a) -&gt; Eff (e &#x27;: es) a -&gt; Eff es a reinterpret :: e :&gt; es &#x3D;&gt; (e a -&gt; Eff (e&#x27; &#x27;: es) a) -&gt; Eff (e &#x27;: es) a -&gt; Eff (e&#x27; &#x27;: es) a 
 reinterpret is mostly used to interpret an effect into several other effects:
 m :: Logging :&gt; es &#x3D;&gt; Eff es () myHandler :: Writer [String] :&gt; es &#x3D;&gt; Logging a -&gt; Eff es a reinterpret myHandler m :: Eff (Writer [String] &#x27;: es) () 
 However in any case I am aware of, I could also use interpret to reach similar goal, even with a more lenient signature:
 interpret myHandler m :: Writer [String] :&gt; es &#x3D;&gt; Eff es () 
 Given that, is there practically anything that is only representable via reinterpret?

                    <span>For example a defined syntax shows Nat:
 data Exp &#x3D; Zero
 | Succ Exp
 &quot;No instance for (Arbitrary Exp)&quot; error shows up when I tried to check on some function which are using Exp. 
 It seems like I should set a instance for the Exp because it is not support in Prelude, this link gives some examples, but I am still struggling on create instance for Exp, any instructions on this? Yes, I am new to QC, I would be appreciate!

                    <span>I would like to pick up a workflow manager for my data transformation and analysis pipeline. As it&#x27;s comprised of calls to bioinformatics command line tools and custom R scripts that sometimes have to be submitted to an HPC, I require a fairly flexible solution. 
 There are a billion of them out there (https://github.com/pditommaso/awesome-pipeline), so the decision which one to choose is not exactly easy. Most of my colleagues rely on Nextflow and Snakemake, so I should consider these, but before I start to learn an entirely new language I wanted to explore the Haskell ecosystem for possible solutions. Strong typing should in theory be a perfect match for a pipeline manager. And having this in Haskell would simplify replacing some of my R code with Haskell eventually.
 So far I saw three tools:
  
Funflow: https://github.com/tweag/funflow
 Porcupine: https://github.com/tweag/porcupine
 Bioshake: https://github.com/PapenfussLab/bioshake
  
Is here anybody who uses any of these in production and could share their experiences? Are there other Haskell-based pipeline tools? Is the user community for these tools just to small to make them a feasible choice?

                    <span>I posted something similar before but can I get an opinion on this: https://www.sandromaglione.com/how-to-use-fpdart-functional-programming-in-dart-and-flutter/
 Dart is a null-safe language that I am using for Flutter development and because I want to learn Haskell but my new job takes up so much of my time, I am looking for options where I can combine both. However, reading the documentation above, and with my still-novice Haskell knowledge it is not immediately clear to me if:
 - this is going to help me learn Haskell
 I am already using a package called Freezed for immutable classes (along with a state management package called Riverpod) which in tandem with null-safety makes the code &quot;error-safe&quot; enough. 
 FYI shifting from almost purely academic coding to &quot;doing-it-for-a-living&quot; was invigorating at first but now I feel trapped because I have to learn and get better at what my company uses (Dart, Flutter, FastAPI) leaving me too exhausted. I finally had a whole day off today but still ended up polishing the app I am working on. There has to be light at the end of the tunnel?

                    <span>Org 9.5 has been recently released, and the Org project is looking for help.
 The best way to help are these:
  
Check confirmed bugs and try to provide a patch to fix them.
 Check requests for help and volunteer to tackle one.
 Check *.el file that have no maintainer and propose to become one.
 Please see others ways to contribute as detailed on Worg.
  
When contributing, always beware of the maintenance burden: are you alleviating it or are you adding to it? Be bold, take ownership, be constructive, learn the ropes with the community and enjoy!

                    <span>The Haskell.org committee is considering a change to the Haskell.org Downloads page. The change is being reviewed in a GitHub PR.
 The specifics of the change are to replace Chocolatey with ghcup as the preferred installation method of GHC, cabal-install and haskell-language-server on Windows. The overall effect is that the install instructions become common over Windows, Linux and MacOS. The Chocolatey install method is mentioned further down the page. (The PR does not impinge on Stack. The Stack instructions remain unchanged.)
 The committee would welcome input from any interested parties, particularly those who have familiarity with Chocolatey, or ghcup on Windows, or both. You are welcome to comment on the PR itself.
 Thanks to bodigrim for the PR.

                    <span>hi all,
 new to orgmode. can someone help me amend the following sample config? 
 C-c c t adds a todo item under a title &quot;Tasks&quot; like this:
 *Tasks
 ** TODO todo item
 but i would like to add the todo item without the *Tasks title. also, if possible i would like it to be inserted at the top of the file as the first in the list instead of the bottom.
 any help would be greatly appreciated. thanks.

                    <span>Is there a way to have the carry-over of unfinished-todos that org-journal offers to also work in org-roam dailies? 
 I do like the &quot;integration&quot; of my dailies (which I often use to structure my day - a bit out of my head, maybe because I do not harness the power of the agenda yet..) and also the fact that there are some backlinks when I just jot down some notes on it.
 But I am missing the feature of taking unfinished todos from the past to the current day - to finish stuff that I could not finish the last day..
 Any ideas about this?

                    <span>Hey folks, how are u doing?
 I&#x27;m experiencing some doubts when implementing the behavior of my entities using companion object, case class and the new given/using concept(the reborn implicit).
 So...
 Let&#x27;s imagine that we are defining an User abstraction that should contain the behavior of addFriend.
 Is this the right location to place the addFriend method and to consume it?
 Idk... It doesn&#x27;t feel &quot;right&quot; this need of declaring given User &#x3D; user and calling the addFriend from the companion object
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;scala sealed trait User(id: String, name: String, friends: List[User])
 object Users { enum UserProfile: case Common
 final case class CommonUser private(id: String, name: String, friends: List[User]) extends User
 def create(id: String, name: String, friends: List[User] &#x3D; List()): User &#x3D; { ... }
 def addFriend(friend: User)(using user: User): Unit &#x3D; { ... } }
 val myUser &#x3D; Users.create(&quot;fakeMyUserId&quot;, &quot;fakeMyUserName&quot;) val friend &#x3D; Users.create(&quot;fakeFriendId&quot;, &quot;fakeFriendName&quot;)
 given User &#x3D; myUser val myUserWithFriends &#x3D; Users.addFriend(friend) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

 ScalaMock doesnt seem to exist for scala3, at least sbt couldnt install, and I want to easily create fake instances that my class to be tested depends on.

                    <span>When reading texts, I occasionally find that I didn&#x27;t understand something very well.
I follow a modified version of the Feynman Technique for writing Zettels. Also, I write in a notebook first, then transcribe the writing into my computer to avoid editing while writing.
However, when there are gaps, I&#x27;m not too keen on the idea of referring to resources until I can fill in the gaps. It means that I have to switch from writing to reading. Reading is low effort to me while writing is demanding. I&#x27;m most energetic in the morning. Thus, I&#x27;d rather use my mornings to write than to read if I have anything to write about.
But, if I split the tasks, I need to do something about what I&#x27;ve written so I can address the gaps and re-use the text. I&#x27;ve tried multiple approaches to deal with this to no avail.
So I ask: What is your approach to handle gaps in your understanding when processing reading notes?</span>

                    <span>Hi, brand new Zettelkaster here - as in, I&#x27;ve been reading blogs about it and just ordered How to Take Smart Notes but I haven&#x27;t started implementing anything yet. I feel like I&#x27;ll learn the principles better if I can immediately start implementing the practices, and that means I need to choose what software I&#x27;m going to use (definitely not a card-and-box system - my handwriting isn&#x27;t up to the task).
My existing workflow involves 1) highlighting and commenting on scholarly papers and ebooks in Mendeley; 2) highlighting and scribbling in the margin of hard copy books; 3) saving popular press articles to Evernote from Chrome. Then I write in Word. As you can see, something to process and organize notes and move them smoothly to the writing process is greatly needed.
Since I already have several programs in this process, my top consideration for Zettelkasten software is that it be intuitive and work out-of-the-box without me having to hack any fixes.
I have seen that some people use Evernote for Zettelkasten and I wonder if that&#x27;s the way to go, to avoid proliferating software. It would be nice if I could click from my note on an article to easily see the article itself. However, looking at the earlier thread on Evernote, it seemed to get a bit technical with people figuring out plug-ins and fixes - I wonder if there&#x27;s software I will find more simple and intuitive for Zettlekasten.
Thanks very much in advance for your help!</span>

Which books would you recommend?
And is &quot;Sascha&#x27;s book published&quot;?
Maybe there should be a FAQ section somewhere collecting info ressources like books and videos?</span>

                    <span>Hello,
 In my org-mode workflow, I export the work done in the week and all current tasks with:
 elisp (setq org-agenda-custom-commands &#x27;((&quot;W&quot; &quot;Weekly Review&quot; ((agenda &quot;&quot; ((org-agenda-span 7))) (todo &quot;TODO&quot;) (todo &quot;STRT&quot;) (todo &quot;LOOP&quot;) (todo &quot;WAIT&quot;)) ; review waiting items ((org-agenda-start-with-log-mode t))) ))  Then I write the list with org-agenda-write. The problem is that I loose heading tree during the process.
 What I got:
 org * DONE [ISSUE] Fix missing dependencies CLOSED: [2021-09-27 lun. 14:01] blablabla * DONE Roadmap for sandbox creation CLOSED: [2021-09-28 mar. 15:09] * TODO Add option to enable debug level - [x] for logs - [x] requests on database 
 What I want: org * API development ** DONE [ISSUE] Fix missing dependencies CLOSED: [2021-09-27 lun. 14:01] blablabla * Architecture ** DONE Roadmap for sandbox creation CLOSED: [2021-09-28 mar. 15:09] ** TODO Add option to enable debug level - [x] for logs - [x] requests on database 
 Is it possible to keep global heading when exporting agenda view ?

                    <span>I&#x27;m thinking about how to efficiently using org-mode to make notes while reading a large presentation (e.g. a PowerPoint file, .pptx-file, with a few hundred slides). Any thoughts on this? 
 I&#x27;m looking for tips in general and to see if this topic results in some interesting discussion.
 The tips could e.g. be about how to use org-mode, how to structure the notes, or techniques and tools about how to import information from the presentation into the .org-file.
 When I google this, I mostly find tips about _writing_ a presentation using org-mode. Instead I&#x27;m looking for tips that could be e.g. (some obvious/general examples): The notes should...
  
Reference the presentation (with it&#x27;s title, file location, author, origin) 
 E.g. through a link to the file.

                    <span>I&#x27;m doing literate programming and ran into a bug using source blocks. Just in case it was my setup, I validated this using Portacle with emacs-lisp as the language.
 Parens are matched correctly
 #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp (defun foo () (princ &quot;Hello there&quot;)) #+END_SRC 
 Open paren in the string is no problem
 #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp (defun foo () (princ &quot;Hello ( there&quot;)) #+END_SRC 
 The addition of an escaped-quote breaks matching.
 #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp (defun foo () (princ &quot;Hello ( \&quot;there&quot;)) #+END_SRC 
 Double escape closes the string early as expected and results in illegal syntax.
 #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp (defun foo () (princ &quot;Hello (\\&quot;there&quot;)) #+END_SRC 
 I could not replicate in lisp-mode major.
 Any ideas? Should I take this to #IRC? Is this org-babel or some other component?

                    <span>So I’m pretty new to scala. I’m building a greenfield application and need to solve my CRUD problem. 
 I’d like to bring a bit of the functional paradigm to CRUD operations. 
 “Find all case class objects in table that pass function, apply this function to update”
 You get the idea. Sorry if my terminology is off anywhere and please correct. 
 My requirements are: 1. Nothing experimental, this is an enterprise application 2. Readability 3. Leverages functional expressiveness
 4. You have personally used it before and have lived with its growing pains. 5. Compatible with SSMS
 Frankly there are so many options and I’m overwhelmed, could use some help narrowing down the field.

                    <span>As a scala data engineer, I normally write some ETL projects and bigdata projects using Spark.
 I learned about functional programming lately and got to know about Cats.
 I see cats is very useful in the aspects of dealing with NullPointer Exception as well as providing higher abstraction for Try, Option, Eigher, Future classes.
 My question is, unlike some other program like web, which is not allowed to crash on runtime, data engineer&#x27;s job allows programming crash and sometimes it&#x27;s more desirable for me to fail fast so I can know what&#x27;s wrong immediately. I don&#x27;t need my data job to run all the time and finally I can only find it&#x27;s wrong in the log.
 With that in mind, I found the Try, Option, Either, Future seems not so useful to me. Because if I use them, I had to use some option.get
 or either.left.get
 to get the method result, which seems rather unnecessary. Otherwise, the program never fail.
 In my company, people don&#x27;t know Cats, but they can carry out their data development normally.
 So is my above perspective right? Please correct me if anything wrong in my thinking.

                    <span>Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a MCMC sampling algorithm which proposes new states based on the simulation of Hamilton’s equations of motion.
One of the main ingredients of this algorithm is its integration scheme — how the equations are discretized and its solutions found.
The standard choice for this is the classical leapfrog.
In this blog post we present our empirical investigation of U7U_7U7​ — an algorithm that is computationally more expensive, but also more accurate.
This trade-off is not a simple one (after all, more precision implies less tries), but our explorations show that this is a promising algorithm, which can outperform leapfrog in some cases.
We don’t suppose previous knowledge of integration methods, but in case you are new to HMC or MCMC methods, a good starting point…</span>

                    <span>Hi all, is it possible to use synctex with an org file? So for example I&#x27;d like to do forward search (whilst in org file find corresponding place in pdf), and reverse search (whilst in pdf find corresponding place in org file). The closest I can currently get is to add #+LaTeX_HEADER: \synctex&#x3D;1 to the org file which gets me reverse search in the pdf and be directed not to the org file, but to the intermediate tex file that org creates when compiling org to pdf. 
 I feel like org to pdf bidirectional linking should be possible in 2021. To me this is pretty much the only thing holding me back from using orgmode for all pdf generation.
 Many thanks!

                    <span>I&#x27;ve recently found the Google Maps feature that allows you to save places and organize them into lists (e.g., restaurants you have been recommended), and then choose to show in the map or not the places in a given list. I find it really useful and would like to start using it more, but I don&#x27;t think those lists are a good way to organize a large amount of places, and have some privacy issues with Google Maps. I would rather use org-mode to organize them, and then export them whenever I want to some other open maps application, or maybe keep them synchronized automatically. Do any of you know of something that implements this or something similar?

                    <span>I have the following two tables:
 | ! | slope | intercept | xval | yval | |---+-------+-----------+-------+------| | | 1.2 | -5 | 1.4 | | | | 2.4 | 2 | -5 | | | | -5.6 | -3 | 2.2 | | | | -0.2 | 4 | 2.718 | | | | .56 | 3.14 | -0.5 | | #+TBLFM: $5&#x3D;$2*$4+$3 | | slope | intercept | xval | yval | |---+-------+-----------+-------+------| | | 1.2 | -5 | 1.4 | | | | 2.4 | 2 | -5 | | | | -5.6 | -3 | 2.2 | | | | -0.2 | 4 | 2.718 | | | | .56 | 3.14 | -0.5 | | #+TBLFM: $5&#x3D;$2*$4+$3 
 The only difference between these tables is that the first has named columns while the second doesn&#x27;t. For both tables, I can calculate values in the last column one at a time by doing M-x org-table-recalculate or C-c *, but iteratively updating the table using M-x org-table-iterate or C-u C-u C-c * only works for the second table. For the first table, if I run org-table-iterate, I get the message &quot;Table was already stable.&quot; Is this a bug, or am I not understanding how named columns are supposed to work?
 I am running Org 9.4.6 and Emacs 27.2 on Windows 10
 Update: I posted this question on StackExchange and someone pointed out the following from the Org manual. So it turns out I didn&#x27;t understand how named columns work 😄
  
The documentation (C-h i g(org)Advanced Features) says: 
 Important: Please note that for these special tables, recalculating the table with ‘C-u C-c *’ only affects rows that are marked ‘#’ or ‘*’, and fields that have a formula assigned to the field itself. The column formulas are not applied in rows with empty first field.

                    <span>Hello scala friends, I have been writing small programs using scala and also learning along. I am looking to expand to building REST API with persistence. Eg: bookstore. I am also learning about functional effect. I have a tiny REST application using scalatra + slick + docker. What is the common stack in practise?

                    <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;m a Scala amateur and I was reading a PR which contained ExclusionRule() in the build.sbt and I am trying to understand what is the purpose of these rules and the effect of transitive dependencies on a project. Is there a top-level dependency, and if so, if you exclude the dependencies of that top-level dependency won&#x27;t it be broken? Or does it come into play if there is an upgrade in the future? 
 Resources, documentation and personal anecdotes and experiences are all welcome. Thanx.

                    <span>For example for Unit
  
The Unit type has a single inhabitant, called unit. It represents values with no computational content.
  
What does &quot;inhabitant&quot; mean in this context? What does it mean to say that unit is the &quot;sole inhabitant of the Unit type&quot;?
 I&#x27;m completely clear on what it means for a function to be a method of a typeclass, for example, but Unit is a data type so this isn&#x27;t that.

                    <span>I have a site with the next stack backend(Scala), frontend(React JS). And I have a problem with SEO, the site can&#x60;t be found by google search. I think I can solve this problem with SSR. Who has experience with an efficient way to implement SSR, or knows how to simply make SEO for React JS?

                    <span>So I have a list which contains tuples, List[(String, String, Option[Int]). More tuples have the same first element. I want to check for all the tuples with the first same element that the third element meets some criteria for all of them, and then put the first element in a new list. How would I go about with this? I am only beginning with Scala so it&#x27;s hard to even reason about this.

                    <span>Hi - I can update a value for a mutable.Map using the &#x27;update&#x27; function/method whereas immutable.Map doesn&#x27;t have it so I tried somethin like this,
 mymap(i) &#x3D; mymap(i)+1
 but that didn&#x27;t work. Alternatively converting the map to a mutable map also did not work for me,
 ....mapValues(somefunc).to(mutable.Map) //didn&#x27;t work
 I&#x27;m using scala version 2.12
 Edit:
 I&#x27;ve put the code below and here are the issues,
  
the &#x27;mapValues&#x27; method is deprecated in 2.13 and unfortunately the scala api doc doesn&#x27;t give any hint on what otherwise I can use
 As per the comments &#x27;to&#x27; factory method exist only in 2.13 version but not in 2.12
 &#x27;update&#x27; won&#x27;t work on immutable map.
 no direct way to create mutable map from an immutable map
  
Not sure what lies ahead in Scala 3 version, I guess having hints and example usage on each API is what will make my future learning easy. 
 def countTriplet(arr: Array[Long], r: Long): Long &#x3D; { val aft &#x3D; arr.groupBy(identity).mapValues(_.length) val bfr &#x3D; new mutable.HashMap[Long, Int]() var cnt &#x3D; 0 var i &#x3D; 0 while (i &lt; arr.length - 1) { val n &#x3D; arr(i) if (bfr.contains(n / r) &amp;&amp; n % r &#x3D;&#x3D; 0 &amp;&amp; aft.contains(n * r)) { cnt +&#x3D; bfr.getOrElse(n / r, 0) * aft(n * r) } if (bfr.contains(n)) bfr.update(n, bfr(n) + 1) else bfr.put(n, 1) // aft.update(n, aft(n) - 1) // this won&#x27;t work i +&#x3D; 1 } cnt }

                    <span>Hi all,
 I am working with a Java API from a data vendor providing real time streams. I would like to process this stream and write using Akka streams.
 The Java API has a pub sub design and roughly works like this:  Subscription sub &#x3D; createSubscription(); sub.addListener(new Listener() { public void eventsReceived(List events) { for (Event e : events) buffer.enqueue(e) } }); 
 I have tried to imbed the creation of this subscription and accompanying buffer in a custom graph stage without much success. Can anyone guide me on the best way to interface with this API using Akka? Is Akka Streams the best tool here?
 Edit: I was able to get a solution on stack overflow here.

                    <span>I know that ZIO test has its own mocking setup, but I am not sure how well it works to mock dependencies that aren&#x27;t ZIO services, such as a 3rd party SDK. He is my situation:
 I have a service that depends on the Firebase Admin SDK, specifically the auth module. So the live layer looks like a ZLayer[Has[FirebaseAuth], Throwable, Has[UserService]]. I&#x27;d like to mock the Firebase Auth SDK for testing, but I don&#x27;t want to use the annoying emulator thing they have, it&#x27;s too heavyweight and I don&#x27;t want to deal with running another Docker container.
 UserService wraps around the auth SDK but has some custom logic. For example, UserService.getUserByEmail(email: String): Task[Option[UserId]] returns an effect that returns Some(UserId) (UserId being an internal domain object) if a user with this email exists, None if no user with the email exists, and fails if it was unable to complete either of these. In contrast, FirebaseAuth.getUserByEmailAsync(email: String): ApiFuture[String] returns a Java Future which fails with a specific error if a user with the email doesn&#x27;t exist.
 For example, for mocking FirebaseAuth&#x27;s getUserByEmail, I&#x27;d like to do something like (pseudo-code):
  when (auth.getUserByEmailAsync(email1)) return Future.succeed(&quot;userid&quot;) when (auth.getUserByEmailAsync(email2)) return Future.fail(NoSuchUserException) when (auth.getUserByEmailAsync(email3)) return Future.fail(BadEmailException) 
 and use this somehow in my ZIO-test of my UserService.
 I can&#x27;t find any examples of using Mockito in ZIO test. Does anyone have a code snippet they can share, or if this is better done through ZIO-test&#x27;s own mocking system (I only saw mocking of ZIO services there so I am not sure if it can do more than that), can you explain how to do it?

                    <span>Someone asked a help question on Emacs help list, and I thought I had a nice simple solution. How wrong :-).
 The problem:
 Given a list with values, increment all values by one.
 some 34 word 30 another 38 thing 59 to 39 say 10 here 47
 So, I thought, let&#x27;s just put in a table and incement column:
 | some | 34 | | | word | 30 | | | another | 38 | | | thing | 59 | | | to | 39 | | | say | 10 | | | here | 47 | | #+TBLFM: $3&#x3D;&#x27;(apply &#x27;1+ &#x27;$2);N&#x27; 
 However, when C-c C-c, i get &#x27; (apostrophes) filled in instead of values. Why? :)

                    <span>I am having a really hard time searching up information for this stuff, google does NOT like to index scala documentation that isn&#x27;t horribly out of date it seems.
 Can I use the fewerBraces feature in a newer version of scala? Is it likely to become a fully fledged feature or is it abandoned? How can I, in general, find out about these things?

                    <span>Hello!
 Quickly: My goal is to use the new org-cite citation format for org-exports to ox-hugo and LaTex.
 I didn&#x27;t use the org-ref style of citations and org-export workflow so I don&#x27;t know how this would work normally.
 I get citations to get exported but can&#x27;t figure out how to have them exported in the style I want and with a bibliography.
 If someone could point me to a definitive tutorial or their config files + a test org-mode file that would be great!

                    <span>org-emphasize is almost usable, it works perfectly fine for single line markers, but is useless the moment one deals with multiline regions.
 This is basic functionality in essentially any text editor, but aside from regexing it, there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a way to simply append a specified character to the beginning and the end of every line in the region. Org-emphasize, evil-surround-region, facemenu or make-face, no bueno. Either they outright don&#x27;t work because of font-lock, for good reasons, or they have half-functional functionality and put it at the beginning and the end of the region, not every line.
 Does anyone know how to achieve this functionality? I did try this but it didn&#x27;t work either. Having to use regex is not ideal.

                    <span>Just wondering: Is it possible to org link (e.g. file or id or headline) between org files and headlines and have those blog links converted by ox-hugo to link between the files in Emacs.
 For instance, let&#x27;s link or headilne A to org file B and convert both to pages on Hugo. Is there a native method or hack to link the Hugo page of headline A to the Hugo page of file B to one another using org-mode links?

So this solution would take me back to the old Zettelkasten concept: each note has a UID, and I refer to the note by that UID. Period.

Adapting an example from the article: Where 30 years ago the professors wouldn&#x27;t understand how students could use a computer without knowing how to solder their own boards, nowadays professors don&#x27;t understand how students came this far without organizing files, and understanding &quot;the file system&quot; at all.

                    <span>I recently discovered exporting your org files to html. Someone developed a very helpful theme package [here](https://github.com/fniessen/org-html-themes] which renders just like ReadTheDocs.
 I&#x27;m trying to be better about code documentation and would like to use this for my current contract. It needs to be hosted locally. I was thinking of using this to convert my literate programming org docs into something my client can browse.
 The license here is GPL3
 Can I use this project to render the documentation for my client&#x27;s commercial, proprietary code? How can I comply with this license and is there any possibility that it can interfere with my client&#x27;s IP or legal responsibilities in any way?
 I&#x27;m an open-source guy but unfortunately that&#x27;s not how I make my living. If I cannot use this, can anyone point me to the typical workflow?
 EDIT: The author of this project seems very open to resolving licensing issues. For anyone else considering this excellent project, see the relevant issues on GitHub. Personally I&#x27;m going to be cautious since I&#x27;m not working on a personal project.

                    <span>Hi,
 Just tried org mode and it&#x27;s taking over my life .
 I am writing every documentation with it.
 I am trying to replace the markers with &#x60;o&#x60; to get something like this:
 ​
 markers replaced
 And sometimes I just want to insert a single line of code and I hope to get this approach:
 ​
 markers line return omitted
 Any Idea please?

This code is pretty contrived and currently not compiling, but I&#x27;m just trying to get comfortable with ps syntax and hopefully this gives you an idea what I&#x27;m trying to accomplish.
 What I&#x27;d like to be able to do is
  
Take my duderrr &#x3D; MyDude {b: true, i: 77, s: &quot;hellotest&quot;, c: &#x27;x&#x27;}
 Pass it to succeedOddFailEven
 Given that param i is currently 77 and odd, succeedOddFailEven should return Right (Tuple &quot;hellotest&quot; &#x27;x&#x27;)
 However if i is changed to an even int such as 78, succeedOddFailEven should return Left (Tuple true 78)
  
Problem is, @ -style deconstruction mydude@(MyDude rec) doesn&#x27;t seem to be working? Getting this error but not quite sure how to interpret it.

                    <span>As the data science and machine learning fields have grown over the past decade,
so has the number of data pipelining frameworks. What started out largely as a
set of tools for extract-transform-load (ETL) processes has expanded into a
diverse ecosystem of libraries, all of which aim to provide data teams with the
ability to move and process their data. Apache Airflow, Beam, Luigi, Azkaban — the list goes on and
on.
As users of several of the above frameworks, Tweag has a special interest in
data pipelines. While working with them, we have observed a few common
shortcomings which make writing and debugging data pipelines more complex than
it needs to be. These shortcomings include limited
composability of pipeline components, as well as minimal
support for static analysis of pipelines. Thi…</span>

                    <span>Simple but confounding question: Some of my notes do not show the unique ID and title in red at the top of the text of the note, why? I thought that was supposed to populate automatically.
I&#x27;m just getting started with the archive here and found this odd. I&#x27;d prefer to have the ID&#x27;s there always. Couldn&#x27;t find an answer with a number of searches and preferences don&#x27;t seem to have an option for this.

                    <span>Hi, I&#x27;m just getting started with the ZK system. I have a question about numbering: I get that the numbering sequence should proceed 1  2  2a  2b  2b1  2b2 etc. according to whether notes are roughly related to one another. If I had a note that wanted to insert between 2 and 2a in that sequence, because I thought it was very closely related to 2, how would I label it (or perhaps it doesn&#x27;t really matter and I&#x27;m overthinking it and should just stick it in as 2c )?
Thanks!</span>

                    <span>Well :( once again need help building a project. I swear I&#x27;ll get better at this...
 Trying to build this game following the instructions in the Local Install section:
  
git clone https://github.com/sharkdp/cube-composer.git
 cd cube-composer
 npm install
 bower install
 gulp
  
All goes well until I ran gulp. Here&#x27;s the gulp output. Just my own analysis, looks like there&#x27;s three things going on
  
36 warnings of deprecated features. However these shouldn&#x27;t be blockers for the build, correct?
 22 errors referring to the wrap and unwrap typeclass functions not being implemented. Are these blockers? If so, how did this ever work in the first place and how should I fix? I&#x27;m seeing many (but not all) of these errors coming from bower_components/ which was simply the tool in step #4 above used to build the project, and not from the project itself. Should I try rebuilding without bower? Any recommendation on what to run to do this?
 Then it seems to continue compiling before failing completely with a traceback at the end.
  
Would love any advice on how to build this. What do I need to do please?

                    <span>So I&#x27;m writing my second piano sonata.  Currently I have pages and pages of hand-written music on sheet music. I&#x27;m curious if anyone knows of any markdown-native ways of encoding the notes into a more searchable format than a picture.
The two snippets are here for those curious. https://soundcloud.com/bradford-fournier-135979011/sets/piano-sonata-2-brief-snippets
This is about the length of each sheet snippet that I&#x27;d like per note.

                    <span>On the zettelkasten subreddit I came across a post linking to an article on the method (shared by the author of the article). In it he was making some bold proclamations, so I thought I&#x27;d ask what this community thought?
The core argument seems to be

  
Today, however, I shall provide one fundamental component of Luhmann&#x27;s system. This fundamental component is missing from an estimated 96% of digital zettelkastens.
Luhmann outlines this fundamental component in the very beginning of his paper on how his zettelkasten works.

    
Information is an intra-systematic event. It results when one compares one message or entry with regard to other possibilities. Information, accordingly, originates only in systems which possess a comparative schema—even if this amounts only to: &quot;this or something else.&quot;

  
  
You see, built into every single note in Luhmann&#x27;s system is one requirement: he must decide where the note belongs. It forces associations, and associations stand as the fundamental building block of human memory. One must decide if the note is associated with this or something else. It is a comparative schema built into the very root of Luhmann&#x27;s antinet zettelkasten, which surfaces the magic of his system.
Unfortunately, this fundamental component is watered down to near extinction in the world of digital zettelkastens.


(Source: https://daily.scottscheper.com/num/243/)
The idea of &quot;must decide where the note belongs&quot;, while true, misses the point of multiple context within the zettelkasten, as Luhmann was trying to come up with an alternative to filing notes using folders. Or is he just rehashing the classic Folgzettel Debate?

                    <span>I am new to Zettelkasten Method.
I want to use tags not only to specify the content of a Zettel but also the type of the Zettel itself. It is like a meta-information. e.g. I want to categories the type of content like this
:typ:idea
:typ:permanent
:typ:bib
:typ:index
:typ:keywords
:typ:quick_n_dirty

Question 1
Question 2
problem that the : does not work out of the box with zetteldeft. So I look for something else because I do not want to modify the default settings.</span>

                    <span>Hello everyone,
I usually take a ton of notes from narrative non-fiction books I read: story ideas, research etc... Those should be considered &quot;literature notes&quot; in the context of zettelkasten. I find it confusing having these notes in a single file, so I split them by topic or anecdote. But I don&#x27;t like to have my computer crammed with tons of files. When I read a new book on the same topic, rather than creating new notes and linking them, I tend to group the notes I already have with new notes who adds info to the same topic or details to the same anecdote. Still, I keep a reference to the original source (in the form of citation).
To better explain what I do:
I read a book about a writer and I take a note on an episode of his life (which we&#x27;ll call NOTE 1).
Another episode of his life goes to a different note (NOTE 2) in the same folder.
I read another book and I find some detail on the same episode as NOTE 1. I don&#x27;t create a new note but I add it to NOTE 1 and eventually add a citation for the new source.
I read a book about a chemist and I take a note about one of his discoveries in the specific folder of that book/project. It isn&#x27;t directly related to the episode of NOTE 1, but I think linking them can bring to a new perspective. I create NOTE 3 and link NOTE 1 and NOTE 3.
Is that a good practice, or is it better to have a single file for the notes coming from a book, then different super short notes for concepts I want to keep from each book?</span>

                    <span>I am new to Zettelkasten-method and work with zetteldeft (currently 5 real zettel in it).
I do not understand the concept of backlinks. What is it and how to use it?
From the meaning of the word I would assume that a &quot;backlink&quot; would create a 1to1 relation by default.
But in &quot;B&quot; is a new and automatic created link (back) to &quot;A&quot;, too.
So what is backlinking about?</span>

                    <span>Every now and then I come across a situation in which I need to transform a sequence of elements, say a List, but the transformation isn&#x27;t independent for each element and I would need to keep additional state during the loop to perform the transformations I need.
 Let me try to give a simple example. In C# I could write something like
  private static List transformSomeElementFirstTimeItOccurs(List list) { bool done &#x3D; false; var result &#x3D; new List(); foreach (var elem in list) { if (!done &amp;&amp; elem is SomeType) { result.Add(transformElement(elem)); done &#x3D; true; } else { result.Add(elem); } } return result; } 
 My naieve attempt at achieving this in PureScript currently looks as follows.
  transformSomeElementFirstTimeItOccurs :: List ElemType -&gt; List ElemType transformSomeElementFirstTimeItOccurs elems &#x3D; reverse (loop elems).result where loop :: List ElemType -&gt; { done :: Boolean , result :: List ElemType } loop &#x3D; foldl (\{ result, done } elem -&gt; case elem of SomeValueConstructor t -&gt; { result : SomeValueConstructor (if done then t else transformValue t):result , done : true } _ -&gt; { result : elem:result, done }) { result : Nil, done : false } 
 But it feels like it could use some improvement. Is there an idiomatic way to do this kind of thing?

 , dependencies &#x3D; [ &quot;console&quot; , &quot;effect&quot; , &quot;prelude&quot; , &quot;psci-support&quot; , &quot;debug&quot; , &quot;css&quot; , &quot;arrays&quot; , &quot;integers&quot; , &quot;maybe&quot; , &quot;tuples&quot; , &quot;halogen&quot; , &quot;foldable-traversable&quot; ] 
 Running build again I get the following errors: https://pastebin.com/cUutNNn4
 What, why? Debug.Trace comes from package debug and Halogen.HTML.CSS comes from package halogen, both of which I have there.
 What do I need to do please?
 Is there any tool that can take a look at the import statements used in a project and solve the dependencies based on that?

                    <span>I&#x27;m using the following debug function for print statements while debugging.
 import Prelude import Effect.Console (log) import Effect.Unsafe (unsafePerformEffect) debug :: forall a. String -&gt; a -&gt; a debug msg &#x3D; snd $ unsafePerformEffect $ log msg snd :: forall a b. a -&gt; b -&gt; b snd _ b &#x3D; b 
 This would then be used as follows
 myFuncBeingDebugged a b c &#x3D; &quot;test: &quot;  show a # debug $ someOtherFunc $ b c bla... 
 Are there ways to improve the debugging experience? (I&#x27;m using VSCode if that matters)

Announcing Evoke, a GHC plugin for deriving type class instances quickly by Taylor Fausak
I’m excited to announce Evoke, a GHC plugin that automatically derives type class instances without using generics or Template Haskell.
Deferred Derivation by Matt Parsons
Freeing a module from Template Haskell speeds up our build tremendously - not because Template Haskell is slow (it’s very fast) but because compiling at all is slow. The best way to speed something up is to spend 0 time doing it — don’t do it at all!
