                              <span>So I&#x27;m trying to build a major mode, the functionality is not really that important for the question, but for the curious it is something akin to org-roam.
 I&#x27;m not new to programming, or even lisp, but new to emacs lisp.
 I&#x27;m not sure how to approach a first working prototype, as the resources I found seem to focus only on syntax highlighting and indentation, but I would like to prototype something like when I open a file of this new major mode, that two windows open side by side, one with the source file and another one with a graphical representation based on the contents of the file.
 If anyone can point me in the right direction I would greatly appreciate it. Thanks!
 PD: To anyone who might say it might be silly to start on this if I&#x27;m new to elisp, it&#x27;s the way I like to learn, doing and improving as I go, most often times it works pretty well, but in this case I&#x27;m lost as to where to start.
 Edit: I&#x27;m looking for resources, other than the Elisp manual, which is the only thing I&#x27;m currently reading but I don&#x27;t know if reading the manual top to bottom will point me in the right direction, thanks!

                              <span>Hi,
 I have been trying, and so far not completely succeeding, in setting up mu4e to access Outlook365 email. This setup involves:
  
davmail
 mbsync
 mu/mu4e
  
As I don&#x27;t want to litter the initial message with a ton of configuration, which I can provide later when needed, I will jump to questions.
 Reading the mu4e manual I have learned about the 2 operations: move and refile.
  
Is it correct to think of Refile as what is currently found in email services like Gmail or Outlook365 under the name Archive?
 
what configuration is needed or what actions do I need to apply for email to be actually moved to the target mailbox when using move or refile?
 
 With my current setup, I have noticed the emails being copied (or duplicated) to the target directory while they continue to appear in the Inbox when using the Outlook app. On mu4e, the initial emails are not available anymore (as I was thinking that maybe I could delete them).
 This behavior is surprising to me and I&#x27;m thinking that 1) either it is a misconfiguration; or 2) it involves a different set of actions to lead to the result I intend.
 thank you for helping a mu4e newbie

                              <span>This question can be worded a lot better but I&#x27;m honestly drawing a blank. The premise is this, I&#x27;m thinking of building an upgraded GUI for Emacs (for no reason other than fun). I have two options: 1. building the GUI from scratch and bridging to the Emacs functionality then have the custom GUI render all the events from Emacs OR 2. maybe I can just edit the already existing source code for the GUI and add features or change it entirely. I just want to know what files to start digging. I could be going about this all wrong entirely, but that&#x27;s my plan so far. I know frame.c and window.c manages outputs and stuff I&#x27;m just trying to be thorough and see if there is maybe something else I can look at in the source code.

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to build emacs 29 from source and no matter how I configure, it won&#x27;t build with svg support.
 here are steps I did to build emacs maybe there is something wrong with them:
  
clone emacs from github 
 
take a snapshot of emacs 29 using: archive origin/emacs-29 | tar -x -C ../emacs-29
 
go to emacs-29 dir and run autogen[.]sh 
 
run ./configure --with-gif --with-gnutls&#x3D;ifavailable --with-json --with-modules --with-xwidgets --with-rsvg it only complains about mail being unecrypted no warning or anything about svg.
 
make &amp;&amp; sudo make install
 
run emacs 
 
 when finished I run (image-type-available-p &#x27;svg) it returns nil (also tested with emacs -Q ).
 I tried this multiple times no matter how I did it, it won&#x27;t build with svg.
 I also tried to build with native compilation but gcc failed to compile the test ( when I tested the test file it resulted in an error with segmentation fault )
 my system:
 os: ubuntu-18.04( I know it is old but I have a gpu problem that prevent any recent version to run properly)
 gcc: gcc (Ubuntu 7.5.0-3ubuntu1~18.04) 7.5.0

                              <span>Despite my best efforts, I haven&#x27;t been able to get my normal emacs configuration to render the left and right quotes (u+201C and u+201d: &quot;“”&quot;). Instead, I just the get the ASCII quote symbols highlighted in blue to indicate that they&#x27;re actually not the ASCII quote character. The same applies to left and right single quotes.
 As implied by my post title, this problem only applies when running emacs in daemon mode. if instead of launching emacsclient I run /usr/bin/emacs from a graphical environment, I get a frame where the quote characters work fine. I&#x27;m inferring that there&#x27;s some variable somewhere that determines whether or not quote characters should be substituted, and it&#x27;s being set to false when emacs runs daemonized because there&#x27;s no graphical environment, but I&#x27;m unsure what variable that would be and where it would be set.
 I am using emacs 29.4 with pgtk enabled, on Arch Linux. My WM is Sway, which means I am running under wayland. The font I am using is Terminus 16.

                              <span>This weekend I built a tool for rendering go game diagrams using Diagrams.
 The Diagrams library has the most elegant API I&#x27;ve ever worked with. A bunch of years ago I went to a Haskell hackathon, and Brent Yorgey very patiently helped me make a PR for a simple feature, explained to me about affine transformations, partial vs total functions and the like. It left a lasting impression, really made me want to do more FP. Thanks Brent, whereever you are!

                              <span>Hi,
New member here, hello :-)
I&#x27;ve been reading a lot about Zettelkasten lately and I would like to try it out.
The site https://zettelkasten.de/ has been a great place to start. I still have a couple of questions, but most of them will become clear while I&#x27;m using ZK I guess.
Still 1 thing is not very clear to me. I know a note initially starts as a concept, but I&#x27;m wondering when you add more context to your existing note, what do you do with the original text, do you keep it or rewrite the whole note into something new?
Sorry if my question is not clear.
Thank you</span>

                              <span>elisa 1.0.0 released on MELPA and MELPA Stable. It implements RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) for ellama. In new release:
  
Semantic chunking
 Hybrid search
 Optional reranker
 Implement collections
 Web search
 Search in local files
 Fix async manuals parsing
  
If you want to chat with your own local knowledge base you can try elisa. By default all works locally, except web search.
 If you have already installed elisa you need to check install instructions and reparse info manuals because of internal changes.

                              <span>Emacs fellows, I just created a tool to wrap command lines into Emacs commands so that I can use M-x to call them without leaving Emacs. I did this because I&#x27;m tired of repeatedly typing those start/stop/build commands.
 Hope you guys find it useful.

                              <span>I have created an Emacs package gemini-code-completion to get assisted code with Google Gemini !
 https://github.com/shishimaru/gemini-code-completion.el
 On Google Colabo, Gemini suggests code and the experience was awesome because my development got more efficient and faster, and I could sometimes learn new things with the suggested code.
 I have sent PR to Melpa and hope it will be approved soon so that other Emacsen can easily try this package and make their life a better place.

                              <span>Hey there, I know that when using LSPs there are ways to get documentation to show up when you get a suggested autocomplete, or if you hover your cursor over a symbol. Is there anything like that that works with Sly / Common Lisp?
 I&#x27;m thinking of some kind of popup like you&#x27;d see in another IDE. In Emacs I think it would be a child-frame?

                              <span>This is a deploy service, so its 95% side effects. I&#x27;m going through this code, that has grown over the last 7 years to a consistently working tool, via CI and humans. 
 There are a handful of &#x60;main&#x60; programs, so am working thought converting them to be wrapped in IO. and called within each main. Its a fail fast program, but feel the control given with IO, may make it better. 
 I know that is fairly vague. It was written for Ammonite, and have moved it all to Mill and pure scala. The concept of if its worth it, keeps crossing my mind.

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to figure out the recommend workflow for writing a standalone haskell program. Say I want to write a single program in a file &#x27;test.hs&#x27; that depends on modules not in the prelude. And I want to compile this into an executable. So I cannot simply complie this with &#x60;ghc test.hs&#x60;, since I will get the complaint that ghc cannot find the module I need.
 So what is the recommended work around? I know you can use cabal or stack to build a project and the specify dependencies in the .cabal file. But this seems heavy duty for a single haskell file. Specifically, using &#x60;cabal init&#x60; will create a directory &#x60;app&#x60;, the file &#x60;CHANGELOG.md&#x60;, and the .cabal file, just for this single haskell file. Further &#x60;cabal init&#x60; asks quite a lot, including asking about which license to use, leading me to believe &#x60;cabal init&#x60; is meant for much more heavy duty projects.
 Using stack has a similar amount of, if not more, overhead.
 tldr; Is using &#x60;cabal init&#x60; or &#x60;stack new&#x60; the best way to create a stand alone &#x60;.hs&#x60; file depend on hidden packages? What is the recommended way?

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to find some YT videos I&#x27;ve seen before, on writing technical docs using org-mode. I already have some System Crafters ones, and also those from spudlyo but while useful, they&#x27;re not the specific one(s) I&#x27;m thinking of. I think the presenter had either an Australian (or maybe Kiwi/Tassie) or South African accent.
 Any suggestions?
 Incidentally, I did ask ChatGPT for its input. And while I have to acknowledge that accent is not a perfect predictor of nationality, I reckon it&#x27;s still often a good one. And so I have my doubts over ChatGPT&#x27;s three suggestions. The first was David Wilson, who doesn&#x27;t sound very Australian. The second was System Crafters, but that Just Is David Wilson. The third reply was the charm though, and makes me think ChatGPT must be having a particularly bad day, hallucinations-wise, because it said:
  
...another prominent Australian YouTuber who focuses on Emacs and Org mode is &#x27;Protesilaos Stavrou&#x27;
  
Again, I know accent doesn&#x27;t map perfectly to nationality, but clearly Prot doesn&#x27;t sound remotely Australian. Thing is, ChatGPT actually seemed to be &quot;aware&quot; of the issue, because it went on to say:
  
While not exclusively Australian, his content is highly relevant and valuable for Emacs and Org mode users.
  
So there you go, Prot. If you&#x27;re reading this you&#x27;ll be glad to know that ChatGPT acknowledges that you are not &quot;exclusively&quot; Australian. Fair dinkum.

                              <span>I need to change the color of the modified lines in my git-gutter. I found this code online and I put it in my config.el
  (custom-set-faces &#x60;(git-gutter-fr:added ((t (:foreground &quot;#00ff00&quot;)))) ;; green &#x60;(git-gutter-fr:modified ((t (:foreground &quot;#ffff00&quot;)))) ;; yellow &#x60;(git-gutter-fr:deleted ((t (:foreground &quot;#ff0000&quot;)))) ;; red ) ) 
 But it doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything and there are no errors.
 I need to change the color of git blame line (from why-this package). The README file says I need to add:
 (set-face-background &#x27;why-this-annotate-heat-map-cold &quot;#203448&quot;) (set-face-background &#x27;why-this-annotate-heat-map-warm &quot;#382f27&quot;) 
 I put this also in my config.el and this no effect at all either. I have already tried restarting Emacs and everything and none of my settings have any effect.
 Is it just me or did everyone else also start with so much of frustration when they got started with Emacs? I did not expect something like just changing a color to be so complicated.
 UPDATE:
 Fixed the first issue based on this thread: https://github.com/doomemacs/themes/issues/268
 (custom-set-faces
 &#x27;(diff-hl-insert ((t (:foreground &quot;#00ff00&quot;))))
 &#x27;(diff-hl-change ((t (:foreground &quot;#ffff00&quot;))))
 &#x27;(diff-hl-delete ((t (:foreground &quot;#ff0000&quot;))))
 )
 Still struggling with the why-this package.

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m trying to setup emacs for python. Here is my current configuration:
 (setq major-mode-remap-alist &#x27;((python-mode . python-ts-mode))) (use-package eglot :ensure t :hook (python-mode . eglot-ensure) :config (add-to-list &#x27;eglot-server-programs &#x27;(python-mode .

 This has multiple problems. First, when writing import ... I don&#x27;t get completions. Second, if I have import numpy as np then later np. doesn&#x27;t get completed to anything correct. I&#x27;m not sure which package is in charged of this and would love help in this regard.

                              <span>I’m on a bit of an FFI discovery journey, trying to make some bindings to openCV (it’s mostly to get better at FFI writing, less for publishing)
 OpenCV is a really interesting library because it’s Mat data type handles memory really well.
 It reference counts the actual matrix data. You can have several openCV transformations that use several Mats, but open CV will maybe do everything in place.
 The question is, how best to do this in Haskell? It feels like a job for the ST monad?
 So my questions: Is there a way of using c++ class destructors in Haskell? Calling them when values go out of scope? I worry about this because using Cont would lead to space leaks with loops(?)
 Even though I have storable instances, I seem to only be able to work with pointers to Mats, not the types themselves
 Can I use the ST monad? Is there any reason I shouldn’t?

                              <span>Last 3 releases of jsoniter-scala were focused on improving performance in Scala.js:
 https://github.com/plokhotnyuk/jsoniter-scala/compare/v2.30.3...v2.30.6
 The main operations that contributed on time/battery spends happened to be divisions of &#x60;Long&#x60; values on some constants during serialization of &#x60;BigDecimal&#x60;, &#x60;BigInt&#x60;, &#x60;Long&#x60;, &#x60;Float&#x60;, &#x60;Double&#x60;, &#x60;java.time.Duration&#x60; and &#x60;java.time.Instant&#x60; values.
 Here are final results measured on different browsers:

are you aware of a good writing app that allows to control differences side-by-side? I found BBedit, but I perhaps, there is something better that you are aware of?

                              <span>I&#x27;m actively debugging a recurring crash (in garbage collection sweep) with Emacs 30.x. While I have a crashed Emacs locked up in gdb, what do y&#x27;all recommend for backup editor? 
  
Another Emacs server session with another name? (ex: --daemon&#x3D;) 
 
Zile? mg? Neither of those seem to share all of the common key bindings with actual Emacs nor do they seem to have readline on Debian 12.
 
 thx

                              <span>So I keep reading about how Emacs (Doom Emacs) has great support for LSPs, etc. I can see that pyright is running, but it keeps saying my imports could not be resolved and my code is full of warnings.
 I tried MyPy and it creates a .mypy directory all over the place so I deleted it.
 Is there a Python LSP that actually works with Emacs?

                              <span>Stumbled over interesting keyboard-macro-terminates-prematurely issue. I love keyboard macros, I love the odd puzzler, this one I’m at a loss, and maybe someone can send me off in an orthogonal direction that’ll get me using some new feature…
 I want to keyboard-macro search in dired buffer for a file name of the form ‘fuu[0-9]’. When playing macro, As long as there is a file name in the dired buffer of the form fuu[0-9]+, I’m good, keyboard macro continues playing after finding the file name. However, if dired buffer only contains file name ‘fuu’, macro terminates prematurely with failed regexp search when ‘]’ char is played, before ‘’ char is played. Any ideas?

                              <span>Few days ago I happened to stumble upon an interesting read and link on SX, about a calendar library in Common Lisp. I actually ordered a book to the local library (we can distance-borrow in Sweden), and I found an interesting statement in Preface:
 &quot;Our initial motivation was an effort by one of us (E.M.R.) to create Emacs-Lisp code that would provide calendar and diary features for GNU Emacs ( ... ) A deluge of inquiries from around the globe soon made it clear to us that there was keen interest in an explanation that would go beyond the code itself&quot;
 Ha! Looking at the calendar.el, indeed, the author is one of the authors of the book in question (Calendrical Calculations).
 Basically, what they say, Emacs and Emacs community inspired them to gather together information and write probably the most authoritative book on the subject yet. How cool is that!

 Is there a way to implement something like this? I want the keymap to be repeatable but I want a key to exit the keymap.
 I tried to use &quot;q&quot; #&#x27;ignore :repeat (:exit (&quot;ignore&quot;)), but that did not work.

                              <span>I have the following load/config of Flycheck in my init.el:
 (use-package flycheck ;; Flycheck base package :ensure t :commands global-flycheck-mode :config (setq flycheck-global-modes &#x27;(not org-mode)) :init (setq flycheck-emacs-lisp-load-path &#x27;inherit) (add-hook &#x27;after-init-hook #&#x27;global-flycheck-mode)) 
 Note the sixth line, it tells global-flycheck-mode not to apply in org.
 On my Linux machine, this works. On my MacOS MacBook, it doesn&#x27;t. Both machines use the same config files (managed in a GitHub repo), and both are running Emacs 29.4 (Linux is custom-built, Mac is a Homebrew cask).
 Yesterday (when I noticed this while doing some heavy editing of an org file on the Mac) I tried a number of different things to get FC to not be on for org, but every time I restarted Emacs the org buffers had FC enabled.
 Does this sound familiar to anyone here?

                              <span>Hi,
 I use the &quot;src&quot; block and it is very good but how I can use the tab to indent like a normal file or how I can format the code in the &quot;src&quot; block ?
 The  is binding to the org-cycle what is good but how I can bind it to the indentation ?
 thanks in advance!

                              <span>I am entering my senior year of my BSc. in Data Science (primarily use R and python). I first learned about Emacs my freshman year and was intrigued by the potential -- keyboard-focused, modularity, customization, etc. I started using and configuring vanilla Emacs as my &quot;daily driver&quot; about 18mo ago. Within the last 6mo I have used &#x60;org-agenda&#x60; to organize my schedule, Jupyter notebooks for class assignments, and record most* of my notes using &#x60;denote&#x60; (*need to spend some time configuring latex for math notes). 
 This summer, I completed a Data Science internship at a medium-ish sized tech company. Although most of my classwork is in Jupyter notebooks, the dev team discourages the use of notebooks. Experiments are mostly organized in python files but it does seem that others still use Jupyter notebooks to tinker with code snippets or intermediate plotting. All development is done remotely across a number of servers and docker containers.
 Needless to say, my &quot;little&quot; Emacs configuration was not up to the task. The jump from using Emacs for my homework assignments to fleshing out a reliable IDE that I can be used on the job is overwhelming. I struggle to envision how I would make that jump. I am aware of &#x60;tramp&#x60; and &#x60;lsp-bridge&#x60;, for example, but have read a lot of complaints about latency or &#x60;magit&#x60; being slow. Alternatively, one could install Emacs on given server ... but how common is it that companies allow you to do that? 
 For those that use Emacs professionally: How do you use Emacs at your company? Do you run Emacs locally but develop over tramp, what is that experience like? If not, does your company allow you to install Emacs on a server?

 I have all-the-icons installed, and ivy icons and so on, on my config file All-The-Icons under &quot;All The Icons&quot; title, and Ivy under &quot;Ivy&quot; title, but when icons must be shown, when trying to open a file for example or M x for a command, icons are not shown and I have no idea why.

I have re-implemented a part of expand-region for the new tree-sitter modes, using only a few lines of elisp and built-in packages. This is probably already in Mickey Peterson&#x27;s excellent combobulate package.
 To use it, open a treesitter enabled buffer (say with python-ts-mode) and then hit . Repeat invocations of  will expand the region, - will contract and C-g will reset and exit.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been having this issue for going on about a year. It&#x27;s pretty regular. Several times a week, when I unlock my screen (regolith3/X11/i3) Emacs will die immediately or as soon as it gets focus. It doesn&#x27;t seem to dump a core file anywhere obvious and even if it did I&#x27;d have to learn how to debug a core file for Emacs.
 Anybody have any advice on how to debug this?
  
EDIT1: This Emacs is 30.x from the Guix emacs-next pacakge. TIL that you can guix install emacs-next --with-debug-info&#x3D;emacs-next and Guix will recompile the package with debug symbols. Now how long is THAT going to take? ;)
  
EDIT2: So I was able to get a backtrace and it looks like I&#x27;ve got something odd going on during garbage collection. I had a backtrace but reddit&#x27;s editing environment chokes on it.

                              <span>I&#x27;m working my way through the excellent Crafting Interpreters book and decided to do the first part in Haskell instead of Java. Everything has been going swimmingly until we got to closures, which introduced a subtle problem involving variable shadowing. To fix this, the book introduces a semantic analysis pass where all the variables get resolved to their proper scope before any actual interpreting happens.
 This analysis pass uses a Map Expression Int, mapping from an expression to a location in the stack of scopes of the program where the variable can be found. In Java, because &#x60;Expression&#x60; is a separate object with its own object ID, this works out fine. In my Haskell version I have implemented Expression something like the following:
 data Expression &#x3D; Grouping Expression
 | Unary UnaryOperation Expression
 | Binary BinaryOperation Expression Expression
 | Literal LiteralContents
 | Variable String
 | Assignment String Expression
 -- etc
 deriving (Show,Eq,Ord)
 This has worked very well so far, however it does introduce a problem with regards to the Map Expression Int: Any Variable &quot;abc&quot; will be considered equal, even if they come from very different nodes in the AST. The derived functions for Eq will not do here.
 What is the recommended way to solve this? So far I&#x27;ve come up with:
  
Try and fake the Java way of object equality by using &#x60;StablePtr&#x60; and friends, though that may not work too well with the (hash)map.
 Add a unique integer to every node in the AST to disambiguate them.
 Add the original source location to every Expression, so that different references to the same variable would be disambiguated by their source location. This feels a bit dirty though, since it would bleed implementation details from the scanner/parser into the interpreter.

                              <span>Is there a neat way of handling configuration data in Haskell that doesn&#x27;t involve threading the configuration all the way through the compution?
 What I mean by &quot;constant&quot; configuration is stuff that will not change throughout the lifetime of the program, so you could embed it in code as a simple function, but where it would be generally good software engineering practice to keep it in an updatable file, rather than embdedding it in code.
 A few examples of what I mean:
  
A collection of units and their conversions, it would be useful to have a file of this data and have it read when the program starts, so that additional units can be added or values corrected without recompiling, plus some functions to get units by name, etc.
 Calendars giving things like the (notoriously difficult) dates of Easter
 Message files
 Locale information, such as Basque days of the week
  
The default, as far as I can see, is to embed the data directly into the program, possibly using template haskell or just as code. For example, I can see how Yesod handles messages and keeps type safety. But not being able to add a new language or reword things without recompilng is more than a bit meh to my eye.
 In my current application, I&#x27;m looking at calendar definitions. I&#x27;d like to be able to have a file saying &quot;Pentecost is the 50th day after Easter Sunday. Easter Sunday is supposed to have a definition but it got messed up and it&#x27;s now effectively an arbitary list of dates. Australia Day is on the 26th of January.&quot; etc. etc. and then, if I&#x27;m reading JSON and there is a named calendar, just get the calendar defintiion. Threading stuff through the compution looks both incredibly awkward and just a bit tacky.
 Does anyone have any pointers to a good technique?

                              <span>Consider the following:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; type role M nominal data M a -- .. a has a nominal role
 type role N representational data N a where N :: (Coercible b a) &#x3D;&gt; M b -&gt; N a &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Now if M is a functor, N is a functor, like so:
  instance Functor N where fmap f (N m) &#x3D; N (fmap (f . coerce) m) 
 But less say I have: 
  class MakeM a where makeM :: M a 
 Then I can&#x27;t say:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; class MakeM a where makeM :: M a
 newtype MyM a &#x3D; MyM a deriving newtype (MakeM) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Because a has a nominal role in M.
 But I can say: 
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; class MakeN a where makeN :: N a
 newtype MyN a &#x3D; MyN a deriving newtype (MakeN) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Because a has a representative role in N.
 But it&#x27;s my understanding that the Coercible dictionary is still included in the datatype as a field at runtime (see here and here): 
 Why?
 Is this just an optimisation GHC could make but it hasn&#x27;t got around to?
 It seems to me if that any calls to coerce are eliminated at runtime, you should be able to drop the pointer to the Coercible dictionary. You&#x27;re never going to use it anyway.
 Furthermore, in this particular case, I can&#x27;t see why we just make N a newtype of M:
  newtype N a where N :: (Coercible b a) &#x3D;&gt; M b -&gt; N a 
 As once we get rid of the dictionary we&#x27;ve just got an indirection, could we just get rid of it (I&#x27;m not as sure about this though).

Any advice on how I can best render it in org-mode syntax (it doesn&#x27;t have to be exact)? Because I&#x27;ve been scratching my head for a bit. Thanks!

                              <span>Choosing Haskell as the primary language for a startup product is not an easy decision, but there are those who do it anyway, like Avi from Scarf. If you haven&#x27;t read the blog post &quot;12 Reasons Why Haskell is a Terrible Choice for Startups (and why we picked it anyway),&quot; I encourage you to do so.

                              <span>I have installed Haskell on Ubuntu 22.04 via ghcup (curl command).
 Everything is installed and seems to work, at least as far as I tested. But in the ghcup tui all tools are marked with a grey check mark (with a little &quot;1&quot;), if I try to set a tool as default. I would expect two green check marks.
 On my Laptop everything works as expected. I don&#x27;t know why it in not working on my PC. Any idea?
 Edit: I completely removed .ghcup and .cabal folders from my home directory and installed everything from scratch. With the same result.
 I can install everything and get a green check mark, but if I try to set it with &quot;s&quot; I get the single grey check mark with a &quot;1&quot;
 I think I found the answer. The problem is the font I use in the terminal. The check marks change depending on the font I use. If I use DejaVu Sans Mono I see two green check marks. Some other fonts show two grey check marks. I assume that what I thought was a &quot;1&quot; is actually a cut-off second hook.

 This is from an advent of code problem (2020, day 1). The goal is to take a list of integers and find a pair that sums to 2020. If no such pair exists, return &#x27;Nothing&#x27;. If the pair is (x , y), return &#x60;Just (x , y)&#x60;. Here is the fuction I came up with:

 search_sum_to_2020 :: [Int] -&gt; Maybe (Int , Int)
 search_sum_to_2020 [] &#x3D; Nothing
 search_sum_to_2020 (x : []) &#x3D; Nothing

                              <span>So I was recently fiddling with programmed completion and want to document it for posterity. There&#x27;s no example snippet like this in the manual, and it&#x27;d have got me started much more easily.
 (defvar my-coll &#x27;(&quot;foo&quot; &quot;fnord&quot; &quot;baz&quot;)) (defun my-programmable-coll (str pred flag) (let ((coll my-coll)) (cond ((eq flag nil) (try-completion str coll pred)) ((eq flag t) (all-completions str coll pred)) ((eq flag &#x27;lambda) (test-completion str coll pred)) ((consp flag) (completion-boundaries str coll pred (cdr flag))) ((eq flag &#x27;metadata) (completion-metadata str coll pred))))) ;; These are equivalent! (completing-read &quot;Pick: &quot; my-coll) (completing-read &quot;Pick: &quot; #&#x27;my-programmable-coll) 
 My use-case: now I can hardcode an affixation-function in the metadata, so that I do not need to let-bind completion-extra-properties every time I write a call to completing-read.

                              <span>Hello. I recently got a new PC (ASUS NUC 14 box) and Ubuntu 24.04 LTS with Cinnamon interface was installed. Now, when I installed the default version of GNU emacs (v29.3) via sudo apt install emacs, I got a peculiar problem. When I run emacs as the end user, I got the following error shown in the minibuffer:
 Symbol’s function definition is void: eieio-defclass
 When I run it with -q option, it works, but clearly my ~/.emacs.d/init.el file is not loaded. So, when I run: emacs -q --load ~/.emacs.d/init.el it works as usual. So, what is wrong here? Does GNU emacs by default first load and check some files before loading my ~/.emacs.d/init.el file? Thanks a lot for your help!!

 I remember once coming across a short 3 panel comic where someone&#x27;s boss is marveling &quot;How are you so productive? It must be a gift, it must be a superpower&quot; and the person is saying &quot;It&#x27;s just emacs&quot; over and over.
 I need this jpeg and I know it&#x27;s out there somewhere but I can&#x27;t find it. Do you any of you freaks have this thing in your ~/Downloads? Pls resyndicate for me.
 TY!

                              <span>Recently I found out that Emacs can deal with so-called noncontiguous regions. I cannot find very much information about these on the internet, the Emacs manual or the Emacs help system. But I&#x27;m curious about these noncontiguous regions and want to see if I can use them for something. As an example, something I want to do is to narrow to a noncontiguous region. But to be clear, narrowing to a noncontiguous region is not the problem I want solved here. I just want to learn how to use noncontiguous regions. 
 I&#x27;ll try to define a clear question. If I want to create a noncontiguous region that contains the columns 4 to 7 on rows 1 and 2 then I can do this using a rectangular region(at least interactively, but I imagine I can recreate that in elisp too). But what if I want to create a noncontiguous region containing columns 4 to 7 on lines 1 and 3 but not line 2. Then I cannot use rectangular regions(as far as I know). Is there a way to do this? I&#x27;m not necessarily asking for an interactive way to do it. An elisp solution is fine and even prefered. 
 I&#x27;ve found the variable region-extract-function that perhaps could be useful, but I&#x27;m not sure how to use it. In particular, I don&#x27;t know when the function that this variable is bound to is called. 
 I also found the library zones.el. But from the documentation it seems like it doesn&#x27;t actually define noncontiguous regions, just something that looks and feels like noncontiguous regions. So this doesn&#x27;t really satisfy my curiosity. And I&#x27;m mainly interested in learning the builtin functionality, so a third party package like this isn&#x27;t really what I&#x27;m looking for.

                              <span>I understand the title may be vague or nonsensical. But I had to make one, and that was the best I could come up with. A longer version of my question follows.
 I am an amateur Emacsist. I&#x27;ve got a solid understanding of all things *nix, lisp, and configuring a text editor (from prior vim experience). I&#x27;ve been eagerly building up a very comfortable .emacs for the past few months, and have been loving the experience in general. However, there is one thing that bothers me which I don&#x27;t believe bothers others as much, if not at all: When I try to use some package that adds to or modifies the fundamental Emacs experience — something that modifies things like buffer management, text editing or whatnot — it often clashes with my own previous customizations or even default Emacs behavior. 
 For instance, If I were to use a modal editing package like Evil mode, I&#x27;d need to rebind keys to work correctly for every package I added. Think Magit for instance. Another time I faced a similar issue was when I tried popper.el. It&#x27;s a great package, but It&#x27;s job is to augment default buffer-handing behavior. I often ran into issues where a buffer created by a function from one package ended up in the wrong place due to popper. This is not a devastating problem as I could always just place the buffer where I want it manually, but that&#x27;s the point, sort of. 
 I have a very large config, and adding anything that changes the fundamental experience of Emacs becomes a software project of its own with the involvement of design, and large refactors and whatnot. I wonder if that&#x27;s the case with you guys.
 Does anyone else have the same experience? Is this something I just have to settle for and solve bottom-up by solving the problems as they arise? Am I holding it wrong? I&#x27;d love to know you guys&#x27; thoughts

 But there is no chat support so I started to write it. After some days of work, here is the result : https://github.com/chep/copilot-chat.el
 I need help to maintain and improve it. Feel free to submit issues and pull requests.

                              <span>Hey everyone,
 I spent about an hour trying a myriad of things to get this to work. It seems like it should be a fairly straightforward thing for Magit yet I couldn&#x27;t seem to get it to work. 
 I tried the -- flag on checkout and no matter what I tried, it would either only check a single file out or the entire branch. 
 Is it possibly a conflict with Evil, Vertico, etc? I&#x27;m grasping at straws here.

                              <span>This idea has been festering since February when @Andy brought up @Philaquino post1. It&#x27;s a prime example of refactoring a large collection of notes collected during my reading. 2
Let&#x27;s examine the format, process, or content of this note. How does it fit into the ZKM scheme? Is this approach even appropriate?
First, I owe some shout-outs.
@Andy — A big thank you for suggesting this book and hinting that IBIS has some use in research and note-taking. Your suggestion started me documenting questions each idea asks or solves.
@ZettelDistraction — Your thoughts on building the &quot;Zettel Critique GPT&quot; sparked some ideas. Specifically, the concept of a section called SEE ALSO and a footnote link in the body of the note keeps the flow of the text smooth without the distribution of interspersed wik…</span>

Release Notes

New: More Markdown commands now have entries in the &quot;Format&quot; menu so you can assign custom shortcuts.
Inline code: Cmd+Ctrl+C
Code blocks: Cmd+Ctrl+Shift+C
Link (insert or remove): Cmd+K


New: Smart re-emphasis. Existing emphasis in the selection will be removed before wrapping the result in the desired markup.

New: &quot;Reveal in Finder&quot; added to right-click menu on image paths.
New: Hidden preference to change the pasted image filename pattern via thearchive://preference/pastedImageFilename/. Accepts Unicode Technical Standard #35 format.
New: Hidden preference ot change the Zettel identifier date format via thearchive://preference/identifierDateFormat/. Accepts Unicode Technical Standard #35 format.
Changed: Markup shortcuts operate on selected or adjacent words. This should &quot;do what you mean&quot; more often.
Improved: Typing performance in long documents (especially when typing auto-pairing characters).
Improved: Search responsiveness in situations of limited resources (e.g. during a video call on relatively slow Intel MacBook Airs).
Fixed: Moving lines up/down with a shortcut scrolls the new line location into view if Typrwriter Mode is disabled, so you can actually see where you&#x27;re moving the line.</span>

                              <span>The Archive has a couple of settings that you cannot change from the graphical user interface.
https://zettelkasten.de/the-archive/help/#hidden-preferences
If you want to create a simple settings dashboard, you can use the thearchive:// URL scheme in one of your notes inside of The Archive. There, you can click the links to change settings -- no terminal needed.
For example, try to paste these into a note:
Pasted image filename without spaces: thearchive://preference/pastedImageFilename/set/yyyyMMdd&#x27;_image&#x27;
Pasted image filename without date: thearchive://preference/pastedImageFilename/set/&#x27;pasted-image&#x27;
Pasted image filename reset: thearchive://preference/pastedImageFilename/delete

ID&#x27;s accurate to seconds: thearchive://preference/identifierDateFormat/set/yyyyMMddHHmmss
ID&#x27;s accurate to minutes: thearchive://preference/identifierDateFormat/set/yyyyMMddHHmm  (original)
ID&#x27;s accurate to days: thearchive://preference/identifierDateFormat/set/yyyyMMdd
ID reset: thearchive://preference/identifierDateFormat/delete


Then you can play around with different formats.
Note: Most of these settings don&#x27;t actually require a relaunch of the app, but if something doesn&#x27;t work, quit and open the app again if in doubt.</span>

                              <span>Not the type system extensions, not 3 new kinds of metaprogramming apis, not givens, but braceless syntax is the most noticeable thing in everyday codewriting and codereading. 
 It is with great pleasure to realise we won war against begin-end style boilerplate and &quot;you can&#x27;t use braceless with lambdas&quot; pointless prejudices and now most of }}}}}}} alike eyesores can be purged with single scalafmt setting. 
 I cannot understand why &quot;reviewing MR with braceless&quot; is &quot;harder&quot; i mean, most of diff visualisers were able to provide unreadable diffs that would make you open both versions and compare them by eye, but aren&#x27;t you review diff by imaging code which was there and how it changed? To add, diffs show spaces and, its like mostly obvious which indentation level it is. If it isn&#x27;t, you have indent rainbow, which trivializes tracking.
 Same story with merge conflicts - sometimes you would be able to get braces mismatch regardless, and its harder to fix than indentation mismatch. 
 Well, now we have (), that are the second source of unpronouceable clutter, and [] which are, as well, in some places, yet not as common. I hope someday these would be optional as well.

Building a data compression utility in Haskell using Huffman codes by Marcelo Lazaroni
In this post we will implement a data compression program in about 150 lines of Haskell. It will use Huffman coding and handle arbitrary binary files using constant memory for encoding and decoding.

                              <span>Is there additional configuration needed when setting up lsp-mode with respect to the tab key for indenting?
 I&#x27;ve noticed that my indentations are always inconsistent. For example, when editing a React typescript component, if i just hit , or create a new line, it indents 4 spaces from the last line. But if I highlight the region and hit  then it seems to indent based on LSP rules and indents it by 2.
 The same is true when I&#x27;m in C++ mode. While writing, and hitting tab when I&#x27;m on the line, I get the following header:
 #pragma once namespace some_name_space { class SomeClass { public: SomeClass() private: int someMember; } } 
 But if I highlight the buffer and hit , or call lsp-format-region, then I end up with:
 #pragma once namespace some_name_space { class SomeClass { public: SomeClass(); private: int someMember; } } // namespace some_name_space 
 Which i assume is different because when I do that, it&#x27;s calling clang-format (based on the fact that the endspace ending comment get added.)
 Is there a way to make it so that indentations will use lsp to formatting rules if lsp mode is enabled?

 But, in the help doc, those symbols seem to be hidden, and you can see highlights and blocks, but without special characters/lines.

 Is it possible to do that in my org docs, so it looks like in the help example?

 I have a hook for dired and I changed the auto-revert-interval to 1
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; (add-hook &#x27;dired-mode-hook (lambda () (auto-revert-mode)))
 (setq-default auto-revert-interval 1) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Is there any advantage to setting global-auto-revert-non-file-buffers to t, when all I am interested in is keeping my dired buffers up to date? Also is there any significant performance penalty to keeping the auto-revert-internal lower than the default of 5?

 I recently noticed that I don&#x27;t get a preview of grep matches when I am using CONSULT-GREP on a directory on a remote machine. However, I do get previews when I execute CONSULT-GREP on the locale machine.
 Do you have any idea why this might be the case? Is there anything I can tweak to get it?
 Have a good day, fellows :)

                              <span>I am trying to get better at Haskell by using it more in &quot;anger&quot; ... and Megaparsec is definitely making me angry.
 I am attempting to parse a NATS protocol message. I have two variants of the &quot;message&quot; one that indicates a reply subject and one that doesn&#x27;t.
 With reply:
 MSG target.subject 1 reply.subject 500\r\n
 Without reply:
 MSG target.subject 1 500\r\n
 And now here are my parser functions. The problem I&#x27;m having is that no matter what I do, I can _either_ get it to parse the first form or the second form, but I can&#x27;t get it to properly &quot;fall back&quot; to one or the other.
 pMsgMessage :: Parser ProtocolMessage pMsgMessage &#x3D; do msgMessageWithReply  msgMessageWithoutReply msgMessageWithReply :: Parser ProtocolMessage msgMessageWithReply &#x3D; do _  parseTest parseMessage &quot;MSG this.subject 1 120\r\n&quot; 2:1: | 2 |  | ^ unexpected end of input expecting numeric character or white space 
 I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ve just forgotten something dumb, but I can&#x27;t for the life of me get these alternatives working and I&#x27;ve re-read &quot;the&quot; megaparsec tutorial over and over until it hurt.

                              <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;m trying to learn &#x60;haxl&#x60; library with servant. I&#x27;m having a custom reader monad stack which contains &#x60;Env&#x60;. Right now, I am using &#x60;runHaxl&#x60; function in the handler function to fetch the data. Something like this:
  
fetchUsersH :: (MonadIO m) &#x3D;&gt; AppT m [Int] [User]
 fetchUsersH &#x3D; do
 (env0 :: Env () [Int])  String -&gt; ID -&gt; GenHaxl u w ID
 addTimeline name aid &#x3D;
 unCacheArticle aid $ unCacheCount (&quot;timeline:&quot; ++ name) $ RawAPI.addTimeline name aid
  
And it was getting converted into IO like this:
  
scottyOptsT opts (runIO u state) $ application [logStdout]
 where runIO :: (HasPSQL u, HasOtherEnv C.Cache u) &#x3D;&gt; u -&gt; StateStore -&gt; GenHaxl u w b -&gt; IO b
 runIO env s m &#x3D; do
 env0 &lt;- initEnv s env
 runHaxl env0 m
  
I want to do similar thing with servant, but I didn&#x27;t find any example.
 Also, I want to know what would be the best practice for handling haxl
 data fetching? getting the env from the reader and calling runHaxl within
 the handler function or runHaxl should be called at the &#x60;hoistServer&#x60; level?

                              <span>Hi, I am wanting to dive into Scala more and would not mind porting over a library. What are some missing libraries for the AI or ML scala ecosystem?

 I was in search for a light weight system for contact management and customer relation management. The main purpose for me is to have all address/telephone numbers/emails available at hand and easy to search. Another aspect is, that I would like to use this in conjunction with org-mode of Emacs, where I do all my business administration things.

                              <span>Hi folks,
 I&#x27;ve been searching for a package that enables the simple &quot;one tab per project&quot; workflow, so each project is isolated in its tab.
 I used tabspaces for some time but I faced several issues with it. Then, I switched to the more lightweight project-tab-groups which creates a &quot;tab group&quot; per project, but with some limitations. The latter was simple enough to inspire me to create the package I&#x27;m looking for, one-tab-per-project (or otpp).
 The idea is simple, install the package and its dependency unique-dir-name (another package of mine, created specifically for otpp), enable otpp-mode and you are good to go. Whenever you switched to a project project-switch-project (C-x p p), otpp will switch to a dedicated tab. And in case of conflicting projects names, otpp will resolve the conflict by renaming the similar tabs.

Looking for your feedback!

                              <span>I just picked up a Mactop (not my FIRST, but I&#x27;m trying to seriously consider a primary platform change.)
 Pulled down homebrew, then emacs, and...I&#x27;m just flummoxed.
 I&#x27;m about 40 years used to &quot;alt/control&quot; on both sides of the space bar being &quot;meta/ctrl&quot;. 
 How? Can I remap those for use with emacs? I naively thought I could just &quot;describe-key&quot; to see what it thought those were natively, then reassign them in .emacs, but...no go.
 Point me, Obi Wan, to TFM that I may R it.
 Thanks.

Is it possible to open a subrepl within the context of a given frame? This way I could look at the local variables and test out different changes to them. I have looked in the manual but all I could find was an eval in frame command, which is annoying for extensive probing.

                              <span>Emacs noob trying to set a simple JS environment.
 Since eglot doesn&#x27;t support multiple LSP servers, I&#x27;m using flycheck for eslint(with consult-flycheck) and leave alone flymake(with consult-flymake) for eglot.

                              <span>Hi! I need an advise.
 How can I reach that behaviour for my function?
 It is a pseudo haskell code
  runC :: (f a -&gt; g b) -&gt; f a -&gt; g b runC :: (f a -&gt; f b -&gt; g c) -&gt; f a -&gt; f b -&gt; g c runC :: (f a -&gt; f b -&gt; ... -&gt; g n) -&gt; f a -&gt; f b -&gt; ... -&gt; g n 
 So a, b, ..., n are different types I need runC to be polymorphic like this

                              <span>I have already read a few Haskell books, at least the first 25-30% of them.
 In my opinion, the best book for beginners is &quot;Get Programming with Haskell&quot; by Will Knut. Although it is a somewhat older book, it is written and structured in a much more comprehensible way than &quot;Lern you a Haskell&quot;, for example, which I didn&#x27;t get on with at all. Haskell in Depth&quot; was also not a suitable introduction for me.
 Which book was the best introduction for you?

                              <span>Hi everyone, sorry if my question is silly.
 In Haskell report 2010, section 1.3, it says: &quot;An expression evaluates to a value and has a static type.&quot; In chapter 3, functions are not listed as expressions, only function applications. In section 4.4.3.1 it says: &quot;A function binding binds a variable to a function value.&quot;
 If I understand correctly, a function is a value, therefore an expression. So why functions are not classified as expressions?

 I&#x27;ve definitely found myself in many situations where capture groups would be useful, when I came across this I also really liked the live feedback of what you&#x27;re matching. Anyone come across a good package for it, or even someway to do it that&#x27;s built in?

 You can open any media file (audio or video) from dired and start playing. With repeat turned on, it’ll keep playing all files in directory and loop over. 
 I wrote about this new mode when I announced it https://lmno.lol/alvaro/ready-player-mode
 While still early days, the package is on GitHub https://github.com/xenodium/ready-player

                              <span>Hello emacs fellas.
 This is my second attempt at trying to switch to emacs. First time I tried System Crafters&#x27; emacs from scratch series, and it is good, but I just find navigating through his video playlist a bit too long and inconvenient, and because of that I could not find myself finishing that playlist.
 Are there any text oriented guides with a thorough explanation with something like code snippets and such if possible, to read through and end up with a reasonably good config to start the journey? It would also be good to see something like that but for elisp, once I get a good emacs config rolling.
 Many thanks for those who respond.
 EDIT: I came from vim environment, and it would be nice if a resource acommodated that.

                              <span>So I use notmuch. 
 When replying to emails, the message buffer would look like this: 
 To: ... Subject: ... --text follows this line-- **CURSOR**someone  writes: 
 Note the cursor location.
 I would always press CTRL+o, so I get an empty line below --text follows this line--, and start writing there. 
 Is there a way to avoid doing CTRL+o everytime other than adding custom function to message-setup-hook?

                              <span>I have recently begun building Emacs 30 from source, but for some reason I can&#x27;t get SVG support to work properly. I have librsvg installed and (even though it should be default) have tried adding the --with-rsvg flag to ./configure. However, I am still getting nil for (image-type-available-p &#x27;svg) and svg is not part of the image-types variable. I am getting errors for the math-preview package relating to svg not being a valid filter type.

                              <span>We used to have the language extensions OverlappingInstances and IncoherentInstances, and now they&#x27;ve been deprecated (but not removed) in favor of per-instance pragmas like
 instance {-# OVERLAPPING #-} Foo a &#x3D;&gt; Foo [a] where ... 
 Could we do the same with UndecidableInstances, like
 instance {-# UNDECIDABLE #-} Foo a &#x3D;&gt; Bar a where ... 
 ? That seems like it would be a small but significant improvement to me. I don&#x27;t see any downsides or fundamental obstacles to doing it, but maybe I&#x27;m missing something.
 If it can be done, I&#x27;d have some interest in writing up a GHC proposal and if it gets accepted trying to implement it myself. I weakly guess I&#x27;d be able to do that mostly independently.
 (There&#x27;s a similar question for UndecidableSuperClasses and maybe it would make sense to do them both at once? But I use that less often so my vague inclination is to keep scope small.)

 &#x27;A Lazy Scheme In Haskell&#x27; by André M van Meulebrouck
 André implemented a lazy subset of Scheme in Haskell and discusses his insights. Interesting for anyone into language implementation or lazy evaluation.

 What do you think about implementing other languages in Haskell?

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I’m currently facing a decision between two job offers and would appreciate your insights, especially from those familiar with the Scala ecosystem.
 I’m based in Romania and relatively new to the industry, with a junior level of experience. Here are the details of the two offers:
 1. First Offer: This is a B2B position in a well-established outsourcing company focused on a betting project. The project is run out of Poland and involves working with Scala on a platform that is already up and running for a major client in the betting industry. The role offers about 50-60% higher compensation compared to the second option. The job provides a flexible work schedule, allowing for mid-day breaks like going to the gym. However, I have some ethical concerns regarding working in the betting industry. 2. Second Offer: This is a permanent employment (CIM) position at another outsourcing company, but on a project that is just about to start. The project involves Python and AWS, and the salary is lower. The work hours are strict, from 9 to 18, with little flexibility. 
 Given the market trends, I’m inclined towards the more stable option, even though stability sometimes seems illusory if the employer decides to let you go. I have experience with both Scala and Python and try to remain language-agnostic in my career.
 My question for you is:
 • Considering the current state and future of Scala in the industry, do you think the first offer has a significant advantage in terms of career development? 
 Thank you for your help!

                              <span>I have a use case where I want to create my own format of file links within Org files that are identified via a regexp, my-file-link-regexp. You can&#x27;t assume anything about the format of the regexp or any delimiters it has except that if point is at the start of file link, it will match to it exactly. When I use the Org exporter to convert files with such links to HTML, I want these file links converted just as a [[file:...]] link would be. Can someone knowledgable with Org internals explain which functions and sections of the functions I would have to adapt or what configurations I would have to change to make this work. Thank you. Of course, I would prefere if there were a workable solution without modifying the code but I expect that will be necessary.

                              <span>Hi guys, i want to start a side project and Scala is my Swiss Knife for almost everything, i want to create a crud app as fast as possible.
 The main problem that i found with Cats Effect / ZIO libraries is that those are only the &quot;effect libraries&quot;, if you want to do something you have to build it, i ended up building my own &quot;micro-frameworks&quot; for every (professional or hobby) project that i start and most of them are almost the same.
 Any good template or unknown framework suggestion is great!.
 PD: I want to do a Web Application, i already have the Tyrian app working for my front/mobile app but i&#x27;m okay working with templates too.

                              <span>I define a Bar type and a bar funtion as follows,
 scala&gt; type Bar &#x3D; [X] &#x3D;&gt;&gt; List[X] &#x3D;&gt; X // defined alias type Bar[X] &#x3D; List[X] &#x3D;&gt; X scala&gt; def bar(f:Bar[Int]) &#x3D; f(List(1,2,3)) def bar(f: Bar[Int]): Int scala&gt; bar((xs:List[Int]) &#x3D;&gt; xs.head) val res7: Int &#x3D; 1 
 Everything is fine. If I change &#x3D;&gt;&gt; to &#x3D;&gt; for Bar,
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; scala&gt; type Bar &#x3D; [X] &#x3D;&gt; List[X] &#x3D;&gt; Option[X] // defined alias type Bar &#x3D; [X] &#x3D;&gt; (x$1: List[X]) &#x3D;&gt; Option[X]
 scala&gt; def bar(f:Bar) &#x3D; f(List(1,2,3)) def bar(f: Bar): Option[Int]
 scala&gt; bar((xs:List[Int]) &#x3D;&gt; xs.head) -- [E007] Type Mismatch Error: ------------------------------------------------- 1 |bar((xs:List[Int]) &#x3D;&gt; xs.head) | | Found: List[Int] &#x3D;&gt; Int | Required: Bar &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 The type definition seems a valid but I cannot fit any function to bar(...) as shown above. Is there any function that can satisfy the function bar(...) or I just made a bad Bar type definition even though it compiles? Thanks

                              <span>Emacs just crashed on me 3 times in the span of 10 minutes for no apparent reason. I had sly open and I was editing a lisp file and then the emacs window just closed. When I launched emacs from a terminal all I got as an error was &#x60; Job 1, &#x27;emacs &amp;&#x27; terminated by signal SIGSEGV (Address boundary error)&#x60;. I installed Fedora last night so I doubt there is anything on my system that I could have added to might be causing this problem. Since I am running sway, I do not have the .xsession-errors file. Journalctl just says &#x60;Jul 07 13:50:59 zenbook systemd-coredump[14384]: Process 2164 (emacs) of user 1000 terminated abnormally without generating a coredump.&#x60; How can I debug this?

                              <span>Hey, I&#x27;m trying to write an LSP server for a project which uses json files. First thing I am doing is parsing the JSON files and validating the syntax. Something strange is happening with the published diagnostics. Eglot is showing the actual position of the diagnostic 1 line after and 1 character before the actual reported location of the error. Here&#x27;s a screenshot of the file as well as the message from the server. The error is because the 2nd line is missing a comma. As can be seen in the event log, the server is publishing the right location for the error, which is line 3 character 4. But the error actually shows up in line 4 character 3. Other language server work just fine with my emacs so it is likely that I&#x27;m doing something wrong. Is this because of a mismatch of 1-based and 0-based indexing between the server and the client? Is there a setting that I need to tweak? I took a cursory look at the LSP spec but couldn&#x27;t find anything about negotiation of indexing. Any help is appreciated.

  (setq-default gnus-sum-thread-tree-leaf-with-other &quot;├── &quot; gnus-sum-thread-tree-single-leaf &quot;└── &quot; gnus-sum-thread-tree-vertical &quot;│ &quot;) 
 When I&#x27;m reading my mail or mailing lists like emacs-devel via news.gmane.io it works as expected.
 Expected behaviour looks something like this as opposed to the default behaviour.
 Unfortunately I can&#x27;t get this to work in nnhackernews and nnreddit written by u/nnreddit-user.
 There threads just get indented by whitespace.
 Does anyone how what I am missing here?
 Thanks in advance.

 Hello! I&#x27;m trying to get this repository to work on Mac OS and I&#x27;d like some help!
 The setup is that there is a C++ library with a C interface. It needs to link to the WebKit framework.
 I have made a haskell library which is bindings for the c++ library. In the cabal file, I reference that it needs the WebKit framework.
 The executable depends on the library, but the executable (or the library) does not seem to link to WebKit. As a result the executable breaks.
 Is this a bug in cabal/haskell? Does anyone know how to fix it?
 Thanks :)

 Please test it and let us know at the Stack repository if you run into any trouble. If all goes well, we hope to release the final version in a couple of weeks.
 Release notes:
  
The change in major version from 2.x to 3.1 marks the dropping of support for versions of GHC before 8.4, deprecated in Stack 2.15.1.
  
Changes since v2.15.7:
 Behavior changes:
  
Stack uses the version of the Cabal package that comes with the specified version of GHC. Stack no longer supports such Cabal versions before 2.2, which came with versions of GHC before 8.4. Consequently, the init command will not try LTS Haskell before 12.0.
 The init command initialises stack.yaml with a s…</span>

 Can eat be used with ssh? If so, how can I fix this issue?

                              <span>I have tons of bookmarks. Many in folders and subfolders. I&#x27;d like to export them to an HTML file, and then drop that into an org-mode file, the bookmark folders becoming subtrees, and the individual bookmarks in bullet points. What are some ways I could do this?

                              <span>for convenience i have these options set:
 &#x27;(tags-add-tables t) &#x27;(tags-revert-without-query t) &#x27;(imenu-auto-rescan t) 
 What&#x27;s really annoying to me is when i regenerate tags table (for example i edit source code to add new functions and run this command ctags -e --languages&#x3D;c++,c --c-kinds&#x3D;+p -R .) 
 imenu ui updates itself perfectly well, and gets populated with new tag candidates automatically, meanwhile any xref command doesn&#x27;t get updated, so i have to M-x visit-tags-table each time i want to update it / get new tag candidates.
 Tested on Emacs 31.0.50, 29.4, and emacs -q with same results.
 Should i report a this as a bug or am i missing some option?

                              <span>I recently moved to emacs 31 and noticed a substantial increase in memory usage. This is the first time I&#x27;ve come across something that I can conclusively say is not a problem with my system. Is this the kind of thing the emacs devs might be interested in as a bug report? 31 is clearly in the beginning stages of development and I didn&#x27;t expect it to be perfect. I get very little chance to contribute to the community of people that produce one of my favorite programs and was wondering if this feedback would be of use.Apart from the Emacs bug checklist and the emacs wiki memory leaks page, is there anyplace I can look to as a way to gather information to help with development?

 I just had a problem where updating the global ESLint binary used with my editors caused no more linting, unless my project was on the specific newer version 9.x.x.
 I took inspiration on some old hacks I found (but none of they worked with me) to patch my on way to force flymake-eslint to use the LOCAL project eslint instead of the global one.
 If it is of any help I made this blog post explaining how to achieve this: https://www.rahuljuliato.com/posts/eslint-on-emacs

                              <span>I&#x27;m going through the Advent of Code 2023 problems to get back into Haskell. For the second part of day 4, I&#x27;m using an STUArray to keep track of the ticket counts, and I want at least version 0.5.6 of the array package so I can use modifyArray&#x27;. However, when I try to build my solution, cabal is not able to resolve the dependencies (error message below). I know that cabal caches packages globally, and this caching seems to be the source of the issue. For example, the error message is saying that the deepseq-1.4.8.0 requires array&#x3D;&#x3D;0.5.4.0, while the Hackage page says that it simply requires array &gt;&#x3D;0.4 &amp;&amp; &lt;0.6. I&#x27;m guessing this is because the cached version was built specifically with array-0.5.4.0, but I can&#x27;t figure out how to fix this error. Any help is greatly appreciated.

                              <span>I&#x27;m a late stage phd student in physics data analysis, doing some light numerical computation (mostly linear algebra, stats), training models with pytorch, and plotting various relevant combinations. I have made several bugs related to using numpy arrays incorrectly and modifying them inplace only to realize much later and fix them with hundreds of .copy() making everything ugly.
 I am interested in haskell to avoid making several objects, their interfaces, when in reality I can clearly see that my research is several composed functions of data. All the while ensuring that my data doesn&#x27;t need .copy() everytime when handing over arrays from one class to another.
 I have some questions mainly regarding the current state of the libraries:
 1. is it easy/possible to natively think about xarray - n-dimensional arrays like numpy with named dimensions like pandas (essentially pandas multi-index) in haskell?
 2. is it easy/possible to achieve the various plotting routines in matplotlib, but mainly imshow, scatter, histogram2d, natively in haskell?
 3. Is it easy/possible to train pytorch models natively in haskell? 
 I imagine needing O(~months) to get up to speed and I would appreciate if that sunk time would be worth the benefits soon after.
 Optionally, I would also like to hear about your success stories in switching to haskell even if vaguely related to these ideas.

                              <span>Hello, I&#x27;ve been trying to make a program which can compress a string using Huffman encoding, where encoding returns you the mapping of character to its code, and the encoded string
 I&#x27;m now trying to write a short IO loop where you can enter text to be either encoded or decoded, but I&#x27;m not sure how i can &#x27;save&#x27; my mapping [(Letter,[Int])] to be carried over for decoding later (or if this even possible / normal in Haskell).
 Ideally I&#x27;d like to be able to save it somewhere so I have a loop like 
 main :: IO () main &#x3D; do putStrLn &quot;would you like encoding/decoding&quot; c  encodeLoop &gt;&gt; main &quot;D&quot; -&gt; decodeLoop &gt;&gt; main _ -&gt; putStrLn &quot;Character not recognised, please try again&quot; &gt;&gt; main 
 and then after encoding, I could store the mapping created, and later on pass it to the decoder to use.
 If there is a better / more Haskelly way of doing this I&#x27;d be really glad to hear it 
 Thanks in advance

 I have installed Haskell via ghcup and created a new project with stack new project-name
 If I want to run stack build stack ALWAYS wants to install GHC 9.6.6, no matter which version I have installed and set in GHCup. And I activated the &quot;better GHCup integration for stack&quot; while the installation.
 I don&#x27;t know why stack always wants to use GHC 9.6.6
 EDIT: I currently try to install the lastest versions of stack, cabal and HLS and set GHC 9.6.6 and try it again.
 With GHC 9.6.6 and the latest versions of the other tools it seems to work now

                              <span>I have installed all recommended tools with ghcup. Than I created a new project with stack and open the project in VSCode. I have installed the official Haskell extension. Then VSCode wants to install all tools again.
 Simple question: why?
 And more important: it doesn&#x27;t seem to work. I can&#x27;t attache a screenshot, but I have several notifications like &quot;Processing 1/2&quot;, &quot;Formatting Main.hs&quot; or &quot;Saving &#x27;Main.hs&#x27;: The Formatter &quot;Haskell&quot; is executed&quot; after I tried just to save the file.

                              <span>Does anyone have advice on the best library for loading images from image files and processing them? The two options I&#x27;ve come across for loading images from files (for example, jpg files) are Juicy Pixels and Friday, more specifically, friday-devil. The issues are:
 1) Juicy Pixels can load images, but it seems to be quite slow. Loading an image representation from a jpg file runs substantially slower than doing the same thing in other compiled languages, like Go and Nim.
 2) Friday seems pretty far out-of-date, and I run into dependency conflicts when I try to use friday-devil.
 Can anyone suggest alternate possibilities? Or is there something more I could do with Juicy Pixels, to run it more efficiently? I tried adding ghc-options: -O2 in the executable stanza of my cabal file, but this didn&#x27;t have any discernible effect.
 To further complicate things, ideally I&#x27;d like to find a solution that allows compiling the program as a static binary. I dunno if that will be an option if I use a solution (or develop my own) based on a C library.
 Thanks for any suggestions.

                              <span>Hi,
 Up until now, I extensively run (C-c C-c) code blocks in multiple org files, mainly for data fetching, cleaning, processing and in the end, the resulting data is exported to some other format (csv, spreadsheet, database, ...). Using orgmode for self documenting and structuring these blocks is wonderful. I can organize each block by its functionality, by client, etc, and also add some usage tips, or other useful info.
 These seems manageable when these blocks are simple, and just a couple of lines. But when they get bigger, and/or require other code from other blocks, it gets harder to maintain.
 For example, block A needs a function from block B, which in turn needs a class from block X and a function from block Y. I could solve with noweb references, but in terms of manageability is …</span>

 I would love to use emacs and orgmode (have been hearing about it&#x27;s capabilities for years) but this whole thing becomes moot for me if I can&#x27;t sync a todo list on several devices and computers.
  
Is it doable in a way that won&#x27;t make me feel like tearing my hair out?
 Bonus question: is there anyway to put simple password protection or encryption on the synced file? 
  
Thanks!

                              <span>In i3, you can set it up so that Super and right click resizes the current window without having to click exactly on the border. Is it possible to do something similar in emacs using C-rightclick drag?

                              <span>I wanted to make eldoc-box frames transparent so that the code in main frame shines though it. I tried adding eldoc-box-frame-hook and setting (set-frame-parameter nil &#x27;alpha-background 80) in it. This indeed makes the child frame transparent, but not in a way I intended. Instead of seeing main frame through it, I see my desktop background. I wonder if this is even supported or if I&#x27;m doing something wrong. I&#x27;m in KDE plasma waylaynd and I have built emacs (couple days ago) from sources without PGTK (because with PGTK was very slow in my setup).
 I don&#x27;t even know if I actually want it transparent but now it bugs me a lot because I was not able to try it out :)

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been using highlight-indent-guides.el for years now, and really appreciating it. 
 This morning I was doing some config-file cleanup and re-discovered the fact that it supports the use of a &quot;bitmap&quot; for your indentation guide.
 Have any of you folks done something cool with that? The example of creating a subtle vertical dotted line is cool, but surely someone&#x27;s had a &quot;hold my beer&quot; moment and done something kind-of outrageous with this. 
 If it was you, I totally want to see.

 So far I&#x27;ve been using (or rather trying to), dir-locals, but it does not play well with function overriding.
 Is this even possible, or am I missing something?

 I just tried here and I am impressed on how faster compared to ssh -X.
 I have some problems when running emacs directly waypipe ssh $remote emacs. If I run a terminal waypipe ssh $remote alacritty and then open emacs GUI, it works better (at least, I have not found major problems).

                              <span>Just installed GNU Emacs an I am working my way through the manual. I thought it was a lightweight text editor, but I just found out that it has: games, lsp support, version control, mail(??), news, and a fucking psychotherapist. I&#x27;m starting to reconsider my usage of Emacs. This seems extremely bloated.
 Additionally, the Emacs manual itself is massive. I&#x27;m starting to question if this is worth reading.

 &quot;minibuffer-with-setup-hook&quot; runs the function before the buffer is active so it&#x27;s not possible to just &quot;setq major-mode&quot; inside of it.
 EDIT: I guess just changing the keymap temporarily will do the trick, since I just need the arrow keys to move the cursor in another window.

                              <span>I know it sounds cryptic but I just happen to want to type Cyrillic on a spanish layout keyboard. I am able to do so by using this:
  (require &#x27;quail) ;; Define a custom keyboard layout (setq quail-keyboard-layout-es &quot;\ \ ºª1!2\&quot;3·4$5%6&amp;7/8(9)0&#x3D;&#x27;?¡¿ \ qQwWeErRtTyYuUiIoOpP&#x60;^+* \ aAsSdDfFgGhHjJkKlLñÑ´¨çÇ \ zZxXcCvVbBnNmM,;.:-_ \ &quot; ) (add-to-list &#x27;quail-keyboard-layout-alist &#x60;(&quot;pc105-es&quot; . ,quail-keyboard-layout-es)) (quail-set-keyboard-layout &quot;pc105-es&quot;) (add-hook &#x27;after-change-major-mode-hook (lambda () (unless (or (minibufferp) (member (buffer-name) &#x27;(&quot;*scratch*&quot; &quot;*Messages*&quot; &quot;*Help*&quot;)) (derived-mode-p &#x27;shell-mode &#x27;eshell-mode &#x27;term-mode &#x27;dired-mode)) (set-input-method &quot;russian-computer&quot;)))) 
 The problem is that characters &#x60;^ which should print cyrillic letter х and characters ´¨ which should print cyrillic character э are compound -&gt; which means they are used for vocals like àâ áä through the use of use of dead keys (keys which are used to modify other characters and print not by themselves unless typed twice), however I&#x27;m into the problem that despite creating my own keyboard layout emacs still makes me type those dead characters twice and its annoying.
 Do you know how can I deactivate this behaviour?

                              <span>Hello!
 I’m making a library and executable and having a tough time!
 In my library I have: ~~~ frameworks: WebKit ~~~ But the final executable that links to the library doesn’t link to WebKit. Is this a bug? Or am I doing something wrong?
 I’ve tried adding the framework to the executable as well, but it still won’t show up in otool.
 Edit: To further explain the situation. I have a c++ library (the source, I’m not linking to it) which presents a c interface which I add using cxx-sources in the cabal file. This uses the WebKit framework on Mac OS. I then have a hsc file which exposes the c functions to Haskell.
 I then use this Haskell library and it crashes because the framework isn’t linked.

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to add LaTex support for my blog. I started out with this template which uses slick as opposed to Hakyll since it seemed less daunting. After looking through the codebase, I realised that I needed to modify the mdtoHTML function in app/Main.hs by adding writerExtensions which I found here to render the LaTex in the Markdown. This is the function after I&#x27;ve made my modifications:
 mdToHTML :: T.Text -&gt; Action Value mdToHTML &#x3D; markdownToHTMLWithOpts markdownOptions htmlOptions where markdownOptions :: ReaderOptions markdownOptions &#x3D; def { readerExtensions &#x3D; fold [ extensionsFromList [ Ext_yaml_metadata_block , Ext_fenced_code_attributes , Ext_auto_identifiers , Ext_footnotes , Ext_link_attributes , Ext_pipe_tables ] , githubMarkdownExtensions ] } htmlOptions &#x3D; def { writerExtensions &#x3D; fold [ extensionsFromList [ Ext_tex_math_dollars , Ext_tex_math_single_backslash , Ext_latex_macros , Ext_fenced_code_blocks , Ext_backtick_code_blocks , Ext_fenced_code_attributes ] ] } 
 However, after building and running the site, I noticed that anything enclosed in $..$, $$...$$ and \[...\] still down get rendered at all. I&#x27;m not sure what to do. Any suggestions?

                              <span>Let&#x27;s define a simple record:
 data R &#x3D; R { r :: Bool } 
 Now, with DataKinds and KindSignatures on, we can attempt to use it like this:
 data X (r :: R) &#x3D; X type XR1 &#x3D; X (&#x27;R True) type XR2 &#x3D; X (&#x27;R { r &#x3D; True }) 
 The definition of XR1 compiles without issues, but XR2 gives an error:
 app/Main.hs:12:22: error: parse error on input ‘&#x3D;’ | 12 | type XR2 &#x3D; X (&#x27;R { r &#x3D; True }) | ^ 
 Something very similar happens when we try to pattern match at the type level. With TypeFamilies enabled:
 type family F (r :: R) where F (&#x27;R True) &#x3D; () F (&#x27;R { r &#x3D; True }) &#x3D; () 
 The first equation works fine, but the second one results in an identical error message:
 app/Main.hs:16:15: error: parse error on input ‘&#x3D;’ | 16 | F (&#x27;R { r &#x3D; True }) &#x3D; () | ^ 
 One final example (the error is still the same):
 type R1 &#x3D; &#x27;R True -- Ok type R2 &#x3D; &#x27;R { r &#x3D; True } -- Error 
 What is going on here? When using records as values, the two ways to construct and pattern match on records are equivalent (as far as I know). Why are they treated so differently when used at the type level?

                              <span>Hello. I am having issues with my parser combinators in this code: https://play.haskell.org/saved/WQpzwZAM (You can change the input binding to test out the parser) The issue is that I am unable to parse function application: when appP&#x27;s left is defined like left  parseTest (exprP  x + 1 in x 1&quot; 1:26: | 1 | let x &#x3D; \x -&gt; x + 1 in x 1 | ^ unexpected &#x27;1&#x27; expecting end of input, symbol, or white space  I believe the issue here is that left  varP, but it errors in a different place here: hs ghci&gt; parseTest (exprP  x + 1 in x 1&quot; 1:17: | 1 | let x &#x3D; \x -&gt; x + 1 in x 1 | ^^^^^ unexpected &quot;+ 1 i&quot; expecting &quot;false&quot;, &quot;let&quot;, &quot;true&quot;, &#x27;&quot;&#x27;, &#x27;(&#x27;, &#x27;\&#x27;, alphanumeric character, integer, or white space  Seemingly because it parses x + 1 as an application, and it doesn&#x27;t let the exprP do it&#x27;s job of parsing operators? So I had the thought process of &quot;maybe, if I make valP do ...  try appP  ... instead of ...  appP  ... so that it backtracks, exprP would get to the binary operators before appP,&quot; and I tried to change the code for that, but I think that&#x27;s a dead end.

 We are trying to better understand what things are causing the most pain for long term maintenance of applications built with Scala and to this end I&#x27;ve started a poll on Twitter/X at
 https://x.com/lukasz_bialy/status/1808807669517402398
 It would be awesome if you could vote there but if you have no such possibility, a comment here on reddit would be very helpful too. The purpose of this is for the Scala team at VirtusLab to understand where we should direct our focus and to figure out better ways to help companies that feel &quot;stuck&quot; with Scala-based services or data pipelines that pose a problem from maintenance perspective. If you have some horror stories about maintenance of Scala projects, feel free to share them too!

                              <span>Hi there, I&#x27;m getting to know Quill and while I like its concepts and what it offers in comparison with other JDBC libraries, I&#x27;m still trying to assess its limitations. The documentation is very short and to be honest i feel like it doesn&#x27;t cover even half of questions one can have while learning the library. There are only few examples for the most basic cases, then when it comes to the Contexts section there are almost none. I have no idea when to use &quot;lazy val ctx &#x3D; new PostgresJdbcContext(SnakeCase, &quot;ctx&quot;)&quot; and when to simply use &quot;quill: Quill.Postgres[SnakeCase]&quot; from the Getting Started section.
 There are 6 JDBC dialects provided by the library - H2Dialect, MySQLDialect, PostgresDialect, SqliteDialect, SQLServerDialect, OracleDialect. I wanted to ask if Quill can also be used for other databases maybe for some more generic queries, or is it better to choose a different tool for other RDB?

                              <span>Hi all,
 Neovim has this nifty feature by default that when a region/line is copied, it temporarily flashes to notify the user the exact region being copied.
 Is there a way to do this in emacs? Thanks.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been using Emacs for about half a year now, and my feeling is that Emacs is the most flexible and powerful editor I&#x27;ve ever used. I think I won&#x27;t need to try any other editors for at least the next 5 years.
 Previously I was using Sublime Text, the shortcut design of it felt very smooth and responsive, I even wrote many plugins for it. But as my customization requirements for editing became more and more personalized, I felt it was time to try other editors. Then, I had to choose between the Vim family and Emacs, and ultimately chose to systematically learn Emacs because I wanted to try Org-Mode.
 Emacs has satisfied my biggest requirements for an editor:
  
100% configurable (built-in customization system, Elisp...)
 Visibility. In Emacs, you can even see all the information (UTF-8 e…</span>

                              <span>Pretty much the above question. I am using Emacs 30, mainly to use the built-in which-key-mode and use-package with VC. So far, I have had no problems with them. But I was trying to install doom-themes from GitHub, and now for lisp-dirs, I think I have to include both &quot;extensions&quot; and &quot;themes&quot;, at least that&#x27;s the impression I got from downloading the tar file from melpa. So far, I have done this:
 (use-package doom-themes ;; :vc (:url &quot;https://github.com/doomemacs/themes&quot; ;; :lisp-dir &quot;themes/&quot; ;; :lisp-dir &quot;extensions/&quot;) :config (setq doom-themes-enable-bold t doom-themes-enable-italic t) (load-theme &#x27;doom-solarized-light t)) 
 but, it didn&#x27;t work. How do I include both the directories? (and yes, I am a newbie)

Also I went through similar posts on this subreddit once again, searched for solution on search engines, there a lot of tricks/tweaks and &quot;solutions&quot;, but I found this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;OSv5JCIlPZA and this repo of the same author https://github.com/amosbird/emacs/tree/onemodeline . May be it is possible to merge this to the official emacs repo?

I&#x27;m using the sourceforge builds of Emacs 30 native Android port. However, I&#x27;m struggling to get a nerd font going. Various fancy icons just don&#x27;t display properly, outside doom-modeline which uses nerd-icons, leaving org-mode, eshell et al without their usual bling.

 What am I missing?

 I am no dev, I tried to have something created with the help of Chatgpt... but it does not work. 
 A first bookmark was created, but the day after I received an error message (and the same everyday since then): &quot;No such bookmark in bookmark list &#x27;tmp-2024-07-04&#x27;&quot;

                              <span>Hello. I&#x27;ve looked around but I can&#x27;t quite find a good guide to haskell for people with a background in agda. Forgive me if I missed something.
 I am very familiar with using agda as a proof assistant, but haven&#x27;t used it too much as a programming language. I am interested in learning more about using agda as a programming language. A (somewhat distant goal) is being able to solve advent of code problems in agda.
 But, agda doesn&#x27;t have that many existing libraries. So I&#x27;d like to learn haskell to get the feel for how one should write programs in a functional language. I figure learning haskell is useful for other reasons as well. So I want to give it an honest go. I&#x27;d like to be able to solve some advent of code problems in haskell.
 Does anybody know a good introduction to haskell for someone fairly familiar with agda, but who has only used agda for formal verification? I am very familiar with the lambda calculus and type systems, algebraic data type, inductive types, and pattern matching, etc. I mostly need a crash course in syntax, important functions, input and output, and whatever else I might be missing from the agda proof assistant side of things.
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>Hi Everyone,
 I&#x27;ve been playing around with a parser exercise to try to understand applicatives and how they can be used to compose parsing functions together. I have a basic Parser type like this: (Full code Replit here)
 newtype Parser a &#x3D; Parser {runParser :: String -&gt; Either (String, Int) (a, String, Int)}
 The left side is a failure with the error message and char position, and the right side is a success with the value, the remaining string, and the char position.
 I made an Applicative instance for my parser type so that it would compose together and keep track of the char position in the original text as it moves along.
 instance Applicative Parser where pure :: a -&gt; Parser a pure a &#x3D; Parser g where g xs &#x3D; Right (a, xs, 0) () :: Parser (a -&gt; b) -&gt; Parser a -&gt; Parser b (Parser rp1)  (Parser rp2) &#x3D; Parser f where f xs &#x3D; case rp1 xs of Left (err, i) -&gt; Left (err, i) Right (pf, s&#x27;, i) -&gt; g s&#x27; where g xs&#x27; &#x3D; case rp2 xs&#x27; of Left (err, pos) -&gt; Left (err, pos + i) Right (val, l, pos) -&gt; Right (pf val, l, pos + i) 
 My problem is that the char position seems to work fine with single-level S-expressions:
 https://preview.redd.it/a2nipo5v8iad1.png?width&#x3D;431&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;7bf1c9ccdbaa1038455de9a75e281a19da4bb812
 This wordks and it is exactly what I want it to do.
 But it does not work with embedded S-expressions! It just shows the error at the beginning of first embedding of an S-expression.

 The rest of the code can be found on this Replit link. Can anyone take a look at this code and help me out on my learning journey? Thanks so much!

 I have created an eDSL for the SMTLib 2.6 standard.
 It&#x27;s very much like ekmett/ersatz for QSAT.
 Features a strongly typed and clean API with pure formula construction.
 If you are into SMT, it&#x27;s worth a look!

                              <span>Hello, I have recently switched to Emacs (&amp; Org-Mode, probably not an uncommon sentence ya&#x27;ll have heard :)) specifically for doing writing (non fiction &amp; fiction.) Almost all of my use-cases work perfectly with the export: &#x3D;C-c C-e l p&#x3D; and I&#x27;m done. However, sometimes I am in need of just raw regular ascii text of the content.
 Here&#x27;s the problem: I write using semantic line breaks, Headers, annotations with comments, etc. All the good org-mode stuff. So I just export it to ascii instead of trying to copy from the buffer. Unfortunately, in ascii export it breaks off each line at 72 characters.
 Now, I know there is a variable (org-ascii-text-width) but I tried setting it to a very large value and it just breaks. I can&#x27;t adjust this value per export. Is there any way I can just turn off the hard-line wrapping feature of the ascii export? 
 Sorry for the long-winded explanation of a very simple problem, but after awhile searching I haven&#x27;t found a very satisfactory answer (besides a mailing list response of &#x27;No you can&#x27;t, just write an elisp macro to undo it.)

                              <span>Hello All,
 I&#x27;m using the csl processor for my LaTeX export, which I think means that I&#x27;m using citeproc-el.
 Up until recently, this worked nicely for me. After an update, however, I&#x27;m getting some results and functionality that I don&#x27;t prefer.
 What I&#x27;d like is simple and unlinked LaTeX like this:
 \footnote{Robert W. Snyder, \textit{The Voice of the City: Vaudeville and Popular Culture in New York} (New York: Oxford University Press, 1989), 12.}
 Instead, I&#x27;m now getting a much more complex output, which uses a &quot;\cslbibitem&quot; command defined in the preamble:
 \footnote{\cslbibitem{520}{Robert W. Snyder, \textit{The Voice of the City: Vaudeville and Popular Culture in New York} (New York: Oxford University Press, 1989), 12}.
 How do I get the simpler output?
 Thanks for any help!

                              <span>Hey,
 So I come from experience in .NET and I&#x27;m trying to learn Scala and functional programming paradigm. I got very interesting because it sounded completely different from OOP and maybe knowing both could enhance my skill set and problem solving.
 Anyway, I started learning, and immediately hit the wall with all 3rd party libraries and understanding what is useful, what is not. What libraries I should learn, which I should not. Seems that Scala without Cats is not pure FP. There is a akka library, which is so big and heavy, that I even consider If I want to touch that.
 In .NET you kinda have everything out of the box, most of the thing you want to achieve, you can by using standart library. And in Scala, seems that standart library is minimal on purpose.
 I would like to ask if anyone could share some tips or steps in understanding what should I learn in Scala. What are you actually using in your work environment. In real life scenarios.
 I feel like choice fatigue is starting to settle in me.

Announcing Haddock Dingus, a tool for previewing Haddock markup by Taylor Fausak
I’ve often wanted a web-based tool for previewing what some Haddock will look like. Over the weekend I put one together. I call it the Haddock Dingus, after the original Markdown Dingus. It’s pretty simple: Input some Haddock, click “Submit”, and see what the output HTML looks like. Give it a whirl and let me know what you think!

While react-native-svg has served React Native developers well for basic vector graphics, it often falls short when it comes to replicating the more complex effects seen in web applications. We’ll be integrating Skia for rendering sharp, efficient 2D graphics and Reanimated for creating fluid, responsive animations. Step-by-step, we’ll explore the setup, key coding techniques, and best practices to implement a dynamic image slider that is both smooth and visually stunning.
Skia is an open source multiplatform 2D graphics engine which supports GPU-accelerated rendering on Android, iOS and others, and can be used in the React Native ecosystem. The @shopify/react-native-skia library brings Skia to the React Native ecos…</span>

                              <span>Has anyone tried using org-roam with git branches? I was worried about messing up my main base, but I want to use org-roam-node-find when I&#x27;m doing new research, both on old notes, and hot fresh new notes I just wrote down. I did it unprotected(no versioning or backup) sometimes ago and fucked that notebase up pretty bad that I abondanded it shortly after.
 I was thinking about writing a package specifically for this: creating a new org-roam-directory and combine search result of org-roam-node-find of the main one and the new one, but later I find out I would eventually want to merge the new one into the old one, which make it looks teriblly like a git dev branch.
 So my questions is has anyone tried something like this, to develop new node communitiy on a branch, and what are some probably caveats and watchouts for that?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been working on technicolor, an abstraction above the APIs that various custom themes and theme packs use to access the colors for the currently loaded theme in emacs (like doom-themes&#x27; doom-color and modus-themes&#x27; modus-themes-get-color-value).
 The impetus is straightforward: if you are a user of a variety of themes or theme packs and you want to use your current theme&#x27;s color palette somewhere in elisp, but struggle to homogenize your code across all the possible themes you might have loaded at any given time, technicolor might be worth a look.
 It works by letting you define a &quot;universal palette&quot; of colors, which is a list of colors that can sensibly be accessed in a specified collection of themes, e.g. &#x27;(red green blue). You can then set rules for each theme (or group of themes) for exactly which color in the theme&#x27;s palette the universal color accesses. You can set these rules on a per-theme basis within a theme pack as well.
 From there, accessing the current theme&#x27;s color reduces to (technicolor-get-color &#x27;color), where color is an element of your universal palette. Technicolor will dispatch the appropriate API function, which you might have to write yourself, depending on the theme. 
 It also provides some basic color manipulation wrapping the color library, with the same ethos that accessing the colors should be via the universal palette.

                              <span>I&#x27;m using vertico for mini buffer completion. I&#x27;m currently using the flat completion style but ideally the solution should work for anything. How can I bind a custom key to a function that acts on the current vertico match in the mini buffer? E.g. Bind C-o to call my custom function which might open the current completion using the OS file browser? Thanks.

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I hope someone can help me. I am trying to work in emacs-jupter with REPL-client. I have set up and installed everything as recommended in emacs-jupyter and at first glance everything seems to work.
 If I run &#x60;M-x jupyter-run-repl&#x60; I can select one of the installed kernels and a new Ipython buffer opens:
 Launching org_test kernel...
 Starting org_test kernel process...done
 Launching org_test kernel...done
 Requesting kernel info...done
 However, if I then execute &#x60;M-x jupyter-interaction-mode&#x60; in the original buffer and then try to send code with &#x60;C-c C-c&#x60; I get: 
 &quot;Wrong type argument: &quot;Not a valid client&quot;, nil, jupyter-current-client&quot;
 Interestingly, when I try to establish a connection with &#x60;M-x jupyter-rep-associate-buffer&#x60;, no client is recognised and a new one is opened into which I cannot write with the same error.
 When I select a connection file with &#x60;M-x jupyter-connect-repl&#x60; a new ipython buffer opens with Requesting kernel info...done When I try to transfer code, jupyter-current-client is still nil. (same error)
 When I work with org-mode code-blocks and select a kernel, emacs-jupyer works.
 Is there any information that can narrow down the problem?

                              <span>When doing consult-ripgrep if I then do embark-collect the results of my query is nicely grouped by filename in the embark collect buffer. However, when doing the same consult-ripgrep query followed by embark-export (which is more powerfull than emabark-collect since I can use wgrep) the results are not grouped by filename, instead, every line starts with the file and line the result comes from:
  file1:line: ... file1:line: ... file2:line: ... 
 Is it possible to get the same behaviour in embark-export buffers as the one in embark-collect?
  ---- file1 line: ... line: ... ---- file2 line: ...

                              <span>I have just discovered about indirect buffers in the emacs manual, I understand what it does, it&#x27;s a link to the original buffer but can have different major/minor modes, narrowing etc...
 I still don&#x27;t see any practical ways to use it even tho i have a feeling they are powerful....
 anyone is using them? and how do you use them?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been using Emacs for a very long time, but I&#x27;ve never done much beyond very basic tasks. Recently, I moved back to Linux on my desktop, and I&#x27;m using Emacs a lot more, so I started running Emacs as a user service systemctl --user enable emacs.service and aliased the Emacs command to emacsclient. 
 I&#x27;m having some trouble on a few items and was wondering if y&#x27;all could provide some advice:
  
Is there a way, from a shell cmdline, to start emacsclient in magit mode? I find myself either launching with an unnecessary dired buffer with emacsclient . or a useless scratch buffer if I use emacsclient -t. 
 
Let&#x27;s say I have previous opened files A, B, C, D, and then quit out of emacsclient. If I run emacsclient E, if I C-x k on E, the client exits. However, if I C-x k on those other buffers, they&#x27;re killed normally and the client continues running. Is there a way so that killing that &quot;E&quot; buffer doesn&#x27;t exit the client?
 
I need some recommendations for packages that help me handle buffers. C-x b is getting way too annoying, especially combined with the previous point where if I kill the &quot;launching file&quot; it kicks me out of the client. I&#x27;m broadly thinking of some kind of tab bar or side frame that lists buffers (with some file path) that has good navigation. I do a lot of work that involves using the shell and manpages, and it&#x27;s so obnoxious how those buffers use an asterisk...
 
 Thanks!

                              <span>I’ve been working on a project using a major mode for an obscure language called Inform 6 and the mode has several issues with it, including weird and inconsistent behavior. I want to either edit or completely rewrite this mode but I have some questions about how Elisa works.
  
Currently the mode is supposed to automatically format object code and this works with any object declared with the language’s Object or Class keywords but if you create a class called (for example) Room it won’t recognize that word as declaring an object and thus won’t format it correctly. Would it be possible upon opening an Inform 6 file to have the mode dynamically identify such objects and format them correctly, or is that impossible? Currently I’m having to add the names of new objects manually to the package just to get it to format code correctly, and honestly even without doing that the package seems to get confused fairly easily.
 
Are there any good tutorials on creating a language major mode from scratch? I am interested in learning some lisp anyway so will already be consulting the GNU documentation, but really any kind of quick primer to understand how Elisp “talks” to the rest of the editor might help speed things up a bit.

                              <span>A question related to https://tyrian.indigoengine.io/ . Just curious, did anyone use tyrian to develop complicated forms? What would qualify as a complicated form? A form where you have fields that require front-end and back-end validation (and maybe back-end validation before the user submits the data), forms with drop-downs where the content of a drop-down depends on the selection in another field, forms with editable tables/grids or multiple read-only tables/grids whose data can be populated independently, forms where sections of a form are hidden or displayed based on other field values.
 I wonder if this pattern is conducive to developing such forms where the data can come from different sources. The examples I came across are simple forms and I am not sure what the code would look like if you have more complicated stuff.
 Thanks

 What are the best libraries for this?
 It looks like jsoniter is fast but doesn&#x27;t give AST.
 Is json4s with jackson the best option?

                              <span>Hi everyone, I am implementing Fingertree from the following paper: https://www.staff.city.ac.uk/~ross/papers/FingerTree.html
 Of course, not an easy data type, but a great way to learn more about inductive data types in practice. I have managed to implement everything up to appending trees, which is what this question is about. 
 Source code exists here. Because it was a lot of work trying to figure out exactly how to implement append, I reused the functions in the source code. In my version, however, I do not use a Measured (there is no value, this comes later in the paper). Apart from that, everything is the exact same. However, on every single function (appendDigits1, appendDigits2, appendTree1, etc.) there is the error described in the title whenever I use Node2 or Node3 as an input for any of the functions that expects a as an input. For example: 
 addDigits1 m1 (One a) b (One c) m2 &#x3D; appendTree1 m1 (Node3 a b c) m2 
 causes the error in the title, where 
 appendTree1 :: FingerTree (Node a) -&gt; a -&gt; FingerTree (Node a) -&gt; FingerTree (Node a) 
 This is of course strange, because in the source code, they use the exact same abstraction where they feed appendTree1 a Node type as second input, without trouble. When I edit all occurrences of a to Node a, the error simply moves to the Node type itself, saying that Node3 constructor cannot take Node a as an input and expects a, even though Node3 (Node2 a b) (Node2 c d) (Node2 e f) is a perfectly valid output. Also, a should be an abstraction from Node a as far as I know. 
 What is happening?

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 Are there recent guides for automating CI testing of Haskell projects on GitLab.com?
 Specifically, setting up .gitlab-ci.yml files to run the tests in Haskell libraries with stack, against different LTS snapshots or different GHC versions?
 A few years ago I created one based on snippets I&#x27;d found in existing repositories. It used the fpco/stack-build:latest docker image:
 https://gitlab.com/robstewart57/gitlab-haskell/-/blob/master/.gitlab-ci.yml
 Alas, it no longer works:
 https://gitlab.com/robstewart57/gitlab-haskell/-/jobs/7250651651
 Any suggestions on getting a CI script, which runs this library&#x27;s tests against multiple versions of LTS (or at least multiple GHC versions), would be much appreciated!

                              <span>I am using the &quot;Agenda and all TODOs&quot; as my primary view to interact with the agenda. However, I struggle to configure it with org-super-agenda.
 My current config is
 (setq org-super-agenda-groups &#x27;( (:name &quot;In Progress&quot; :todo &quot;INPR&quot; ) (:name &quot;Todo&quot; :todo &quot;TODO&quot; ) (:name &quot;Waiting&quot; :todo &quot;WAIT&quot; ))) 
 which displays the undated TODOs nicely below the time grid, grouped by their state. But the items with a date associated are not displayed correctly:
 https://i.sstatic.net/EDSXKLUZ.png
 Enhancing my groups definition by a time-grid selector:
 (setq org-super-agenda-groups &#x27;( (:time-grid t) (:name &quot;In Progress&quot; :todo &quot;INPR&quot; ) (:name &quot;Todo&quot; :todo &quot;TODO&quot; ) (:name &quot;Waiting&quot; :todo &quot;WAIT&quot; ))) 
 fixes the agenda view but makes the &quot;Global list of TODO items&quot; printed ungrouped.
 How can I have both, a time-grid with correctly placed icons for icons that have a date and a grouped global TODO list?
 An example org file:
 * TODO Today&#x27;s item with time  that does not apear on the time-grid, but below * TODO some non-dated item which appears correctly 
 Disclaimer: this is cross-post, but I received no reply at StackExchange and org-super-agenda GitHub.

 I tend to prefer explicit or qualified imports, and generally find it a bit difficult to follow documentation, tutorials or code samples when imports are both implicit and unqualified. Following is an example of my struggle.
 This code works:

                              <span>I made a starter template for creating Haskell web-applications using HTMX, AlpineJS, Servant, TailwindCSS and Lucid (HASTL) - I really enjoy working in this stack and I think it brings together a lot of cool technologies with the awesomeness of Haskell doing all the heavy lifting! I also tried to make it &quot;production ready&quot; by adding build and test tools e.g. it comes with simple Make targets and with unit and integration tests that use testcontainers to spin up the database and web application to test against.
 It uses PostgreSQL by default but can work with any database supported by the persistent ORM, and handles migrations, model creation and more.
 It&#x27;s based on the awesome servant-persistant example by Matt Parsons (https://github.com/parsonsmatt/servant-persistent) and it&#x27;s licensed under MIT.
 The template is available on Github here:

 Hope this is useful to someone! &lt;3

 Here is an example comparing Emacs and Vim: https://i.postimg.cc/t4b0Xsrn/image.png
 Any resource to help understand why is that, and how to replicate that behavior in Emacs?

                              <span>Hello,
 I have read extensively on this issue, but I have not found a solution.
 I am running Emacs within a terminal on Linux. The terminal emulator I am using is &quot;foot&quot;. The linked page has a section with information relevant to the issue, found here.
 When I use Emacs, the Backspace character correctly deletes a character before the point. When I press Control+Backspace (C-BackSpace), Emacs understands this input as &quot;C-h&quot;. This behaviour is understandable, because upon invoking &quot;C-h v term-file-aliases&quot;, I see that the &quot;foot&quot; type is associated with the &quot;xterm&quot; alias. I take this to mean that &quot;foot&quot; implements the &quot;xterm&quot; terminfo, which has a particular specification here, that explains something about ^H and the BackSpace key.
 The README.md for &quot;foot&quot; has a section about what is tran…</span>

                              <span>I like the convenience of image-view for quick peaks at images from dired. If I need anything more involved, I open the image in an external viewer. I also like image-view n/p keyboard bindings to open next and previous image in the current directory. 
 Is there something like image-view but for audio? I’m aware of multimedia systems like emms and listen.el which focus on listening to music (and playlist management), but I’ve not come across any like similar to image-view. Closest is maybe mediainfo-mode. Am I missing others?
 I’ve been playing with a tiny major mode that I threw together. Seems to do the job, but wondering if there’s something already out there?

                              <span>I recently implemented the jinx &quot;enchanted spell checker&quot; and am overall impressed with the performance and functionality of the package. My configuration below modifies the &#x60;jinx-include-faces&#x60; to only check comments; text in &#x60;org-mode&#x60; and &#x60;text-mode&#x60; are also checked.
 However, I noticed that jinx behaves different in org-mode and prog-mode. Specifically, spelling errors in a comment of a code block are only flagged when I open the &#x60;org-edit-special&#x60; buffer. The text properties for a given comment in an src-block is &#x60;(font-lock-comment org-block)&#x60;. When I add &#x60;(org-mode font-lock-comment-face)&#x60; to my definition of &#x60;jinx-include-faces&#x60; spell check is effectively turned off across my &#x60;org-mode&#x60; buffer (&#x60;jinx-mode&#x60; is still active). I am aware of &#x60;jinx-exclude-faces&#x60; and that many faces in &#x60;org-mode&#x60; are excluded by default. Yet when I remove faces like &#x60;org-block&#x60; from that list, the entire src-block including variable definitions and functions are flagged as misspelled.
 Has anyone implemented &#x60;jinx&#x60; in &#x60;org-mode&#x60; in this way?
 (use-package jinx :hook (org-mode text-mode prog-mode conf-mode) :custom (jinx-include-faces &#x27;((conf-mode font-lock-comment-face) (prog-mode font-lock-comment-face))))

I&#x27;d like to know more about the editor, it&#x27;s a harder to find the specific capabilities of emacs bc everywhere I look people just say that it&#x27;s &quot;theoretically possible to do everything with it&quot; but even if my editor is Turing Complete and can run doom or be an OS by itself I&#x27;d like to know what are the realistically achievable things that I can do with emacs without going through years of learning and configuration. I&#x27;d like to also keep nvim bc terminal but this is probably my second favorite code editor (or IDE). I think it would be nice to see what needs you had that emacs covered for you individually, I don&#x27;t care how niche it is. Ty in advance.

 (Disclaimer: I maintain Bedrock. This is informal user research. :)
 UPDATE: ALRIGHT ALRIGHT I forgot Spacemacs! I threw this together late at night and that makes me a little stupid. I knew I was missing something big. So, I really hope I didn&#x27;t offend any Spacemacs enjoyers out there: it&#x27;s a magnificent project and it really should have been on this list. My bad. I do wish Reddit let me have more than 6 options though…

                              <span>A recent thread provided a solution for xwidget-related crashes in emacs with pgtk3 via the following:
 emacs -xrm &quot;emacs.synchronous: true&quot; 
 However, I have recently started using emacsclient, where the problem has reared its head again.
 I start the emacs daemon automatically on login using the following command:
 ExecStart&#x3D;/usr/local/bin/emacs --fg-daemon -xrm &quot;emacs.synchronous: true&quot; 
 Out of my depth here. Appreciate any suggestions.

                              <span>I have struggled understanding how to do complex calculations in org-tables. Yesterday I spend some time and here are some hints and examples.
  
Check the calc section of the emacs manual. Any function available in calc is available in org-mode tables. Calc functions are named calcFun-. They are meant to be used infix in org tables. You can also use describe-function and completion to find functions.
 
Many calcFunc- functions take a vector as a parameter. Usually this vector is composed of strings (even if the function is numeric). The converstion from strings to numbers if done automatically.
 
You can define new functions for calc by defining a function using defun and naming it calcFun-. I recommend you look at the definition of a function in the emacs source code.

                              <span>Hi everyone,

Can Zettels be printed onto paper without programming or maestro? I record notes digitally and want to keep them in an A5 spiral binder for reference. I use both The Archive and ia Writer to make Zettels.


an I automatically update the format of all my Zettels so they&#x27;re consistent? I&#x27;ve tried different templates and would like to remove the YAML formatting instead of a simplified design and one that doesn&#x27;t hide tags and ID numbers when printed.


My current workflow involves using Zettels to take notes as I learn more about ADHD. Some of these Zettels contain strategies for coping with ADHD and include links to other Zettels that provide additional context and research.
I want to carry these notes in an A5 binder so that they are available when needed. Many of the programming solutions are over my head, but there could be an easy way to update Zettels to the same format and print them. I know iA Writer has an export template function, but I&#x27;m no coder. 
Thanks for any advice you can provide!</span>

                              <span>Hey guys. I&#x27;ve been asked to design any program/plugin/API that gets the project name, name of modules and the dependencies of each module. Any idea what I can do here 
 For example, in a maven project, we can use the maven session and lifecycle participant classes to extract info out of maven projects.

                              <span>Hi,
 Basically when I am in the org-agenda and press &#x27;l&#x27; to activate the logbook mode I see all my clocked entries. To change their face I need to change the &#x27;org-done&#x27; variable and that works fine.
 But when I press &#x27;[&#x27; I get additional logbook entries because this is bounded to the function org-agenda-manipulate-query-add.
 I am not sure what variable to change to change the face of these entries. Does anybody know?

                              <span>Posting this in case anyone else runs into the problem I&#x27;m seeing. When trying to install emacs-plus, either from a bottle or build, the clone attempt would fail repeatedly:
 Failure while executing; &#x60;/usr/bin/env git clone --branch emacs-30 --config advice.detachedHead&#x3D;false --config core.fsmonitor&#x3D;false https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs.git /.../emacs-plus@30--git&#x60; exited with 128. Here&#x27;s the output: Cloning into &#x27;/.../Library/Caches/Homebrew/emacs-plus@30--git&#x27;... error: RPC failed; curl 56 Recv failure: Connection reset by peer error: 999 bytes of body are still expected fetch-pack: unexpected disconnect while reading sideband packet fatal: early EOF fatal: fetch-pack: invalid index-pack output 
 There are several &quot;it might be your network connection, it could be something else&quot; threads out and around. I&#x27;ve got a high speed fiber connection and traffic was light and latency was fine.
 What finally worked for me was to make some updates to my global git config:
 [core] packedGitLimit&#x3D;512m packedGitWindowSize&#x3D;512m [pack] deltaCacheSize&#x3D;2047m packSizeLimit&#x3D;2047m windowMemory&#x3D;2047m 
 Upping the default for http.postBuffer to 4 gig was also suggested. If you do that, be sure to set it back to the default.
 Another suggestion was to change the core.compression to 9. I didn&#x27;t mess with that. It was the inverse of the suggestion to turn off compression and do shallow clones manually ... I didn&#x27;t want to get anywhere near that sort of approach.
 I have some questions about running with a daemon on Mac still, but I&#x27;ll ask separately if I don&#x27;t figure it out. Hope this saves someone some time.

 Alternatively, if anybody knows any command-line tool that would also do this job that would equally be great.
 Many thanks in advance!

                              <span>Hello all!
 I&#x27;ve been using Emacs for a while so far, but there is a thing that bothers me quite a lot: dual-space CJK fonts and their alignment.
 CJK programming fonts usually provide both half-width characters (for Latin alphabets) and full-width characters (for CJK characters). Thus, when rendering, the width of a full-width characters must exactly equal to that of two half-width characters.
 This is where Emacs fails; even fonts like Sarasa Gothic (which I know that they line up nicely elsewhere) will not line up when I actually use them. This is especially annoying when editing tables on Org-mode or Markdown, since the columns don&#x27;t line up.
 I&#x27;ve noticed for two Korean programming fonts I purchased (semteulche and hesalche) the characters line up if and only if the font height is set to exactly 110 and 120 respectively (or their integer multiples). I could repeat this process for all fonts, but in my HiDPI screen, I&#x27;d like to have my fonts taller than at least 130.
 Basically, what happens is below:
 \&quot;hesalche\&quot;, height 120. They line up nicely.
 \&quot;hesalche\&quot;, height 140 (which is my preferred font height). Columns start breaking up.
 \&quot;hesalche\&quot;, height 240. 240 is an integer multiple of 120, so the columns are back straight.
 Is there a way to fix this problem?
 Here is the relevent section in my WIP configuration file.
 Thanks!

                              <span>Source blocks can have header arguments. For example, from that link, here&#x27;s a source block with header arguments:
 #+NAME: factorial #+BEGIN_SRC haskell :results silent :exports code :var n&#x3D;0 fac 0 &#x3D; 1 fac n &#x3D; n * fac (n-1) #+END_SRC 
 The :results silent :exports code :var n&#x3D;0 part is the header arguments.
 I&#x27;m writing an exporter. I have a function that is exporting the source block, but I&#x27;m not sure how to access the header arguments.
 The purpose here is to have some custom header arguments. I see there are also switches, but I&#x27;m not sure the difference between switches and header arguments, except for that switches seem to need to be a single character long.

Overview
 Some features and prerequisites. The following setup is for Mac; similar settings can be applied on Windows.
  
After editing and saving files on mobile, you can immediately see the content updates in Emacs. Similarly, after editing and saving in Emacs, you will quickly see the updates in the mobile app, allowing for real-time collaboration.
 Automatic and seamless. On the Mac side, everything is fully automatic. On the mobile side, you only need to pull down to refresh in rare cases.
 No additional software is required on the Mac side except for Emacs.

                              <span>Due to the nature of wanting to do absolutely everything in org mode, I found myself using it for things that I can simply use a more corporate piece of software for, i.e. QuickBooks for taxes, yet I use org mode, habit tracking instead of just an excel sheet, todo&#x27;s instead of todoist, you get the point. My worry is that I hear with large amount of data in tables and formulas it&#x27;s slow... Would it be a paranoia to decide it doesn&#x27;t fit my financing requirements on the basis of it being slow down the line or is it at the point where you can throw thousands of pieces of rows into it without a stutter?

In PDF software, this is accomplished by adding a Highlight Annotation (e.g. keyboard shortcut 5 in Okular). In LibreOffice, the keyboard shortcut is broken but one can use the menubar to add Character Highlighting (actually applies to more than one character, but this is the name used).
 How can I mark up small sections of inline text in my Org mode documents, so that when they are exported with Pandoc it will use real PDF Annotations or real LibreOffice Character Highlighting?

But we noticed that over the years, large and badly compressed images take up a ton of space on our hosting provider 
So today (2024-07-01) we&#x27;re introducing a size upload limit of 2000x2000 pixels, where larger images will be downscaled.
That should fit a whole screen&#x27;s worth of a non-retina screenshot -- and retina ones should compress without much loss for the viewer, so every picture should look crisp enough for sharing/consumption here while not inflating our bills.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve learnt a bit of Haskell, specifically the first half of Programming in Haskell by Graham Hutton and a few others partially like LYAH
 Now I&#x27;m trying to learn Rust. Just started with the Rust Book. Finished first 5 chapters
 Somehow Rust syntax and language design feel so inelegant compared to Haskell which was so much cleaner! (Form whatever little I learnt)
 Am I overreacting? Just feels like puking while learning Rust

                              <span>I am trying to use emacs for programming python and c/c++. I recently upgraded my MacOS setup to emac-plus@30--with-ctags--with-dbus --with-debug --with-mailutils --with-no-frame-refocus --with-xwidgets --with-imagemagick --with-native-comp --with-poll. Now everytime I open a python script, I get the message File mode specification error: (error Feature provided by other file: project). I am unsure if this is something specific to emacs 30 or if there is something wrong with the following script I have been trying to use:
 (setq major-mode-remap-alist &#x27;((c-mode . c-ts-mode) (python-mode . python-ts-mode) (c++-mode-hook . c++-ts-mode) (c++-mode . c++-ts-mode)) ) (use-package eldoc :init (global-eldoc-mode)) (use-package eglot :ensure nil :hook ((python-base-mode c-ts-base-mode) . eglot-ensure))

                              <span>After updating to emacs 30, I&#x27;ve taken the opportunity to experiment with themes switching between solarized light and modus vivendi tinted. However, all of the themes I&#x27;ve tried so far have been too distracting when it comes to coding color schemes so I&#x27;m trying my hand at a minimalist one of my own making.
 Goals: 
 * Most text is black with only key elements highlighted
 * Only one color used: goldenrod which matches the rest of my theme well. I&#x27;m still deciding if I need a darker variant for string/constants or not.
 * de-emphasize/distinguish comments 
 * emphasize strings to handle the missing quotation issue.
 * Make types a slight bit different (semi-bolded gray) 
 * bold keywords

                              <span>Hi,
 I would like to have a keybinding to
  
copy the defun/function the point is in into the kill ring
 insert the current file+line of the point into the buffer of the &#x27;other window&#x27;
  
The first one is to easily share a function with coworkers.
 The second one to easily write breakpoint locations into a debugger script file (gdb) that is open in the other window.
 Now, how can I determine the current function name the point is in, especially the &quot;fully qualified name&quot;? Example for C++:
 class C { int func() { // point here: I need &quot;C::func&quot;, not &quot;func&quot; at this point } }; 
 I&#x27;m aware of which-function-mode, but that one reports &quot;func&quot; and not the fully qualified name &quot;C::func&quot;.
 Any other ideas? :)

                              <span>I am trying to make an org document for my doom emacs config, it is basically like this
 ~/.config/doom/README.org
  #+title: Doom Emacs Config #+property: header-args :tangle config.el * Config part 1 #+begin_src emacs-lisp ... #+end_src * Config part 2 #+begin_src emacs-lisp ... #+end_src 
 but whenever I do M-x org-babel-tangle it says &quot;Tangled 0 code blocks from README.org&quot;, but the exact same thing works with my AwesomeWM lua config. I saw this reddit post, and they had the same problem, but I didn&#x27;t really get the solution. If you know how to fix this, please comment!

                              <span>I have installed emac-plus@30--with-ctags--with-dbus --with-debug --with-mailutils --with-no-frame-refocus --with-xwidgets --with-imagemagick --with-native-comp --with-poll and I noticed that when I try to play the Tetris game, the appearance is not very easy to use as I cannot see the blocks in the following text. I am wondering what could be the cause of this issue. It is the same for other games like snake in emacs:

 It works fine if I disable my init.el file, and I was able to narrow it down to the following svg code. But I am wondering what is responsible for this and is there any way around it:
 (use-package svg-tag-mode :straight t) (use-package svg-lib :straight t) (global-svg-tag-mode t)

                              <span>I left the language for a little while and I&#x27;ve been diving back in for the past few months. Around the time I left the standard way seemed to define all your effects through composing the various Monads provided by mtl. Towards the end of my time with Haskell however the consensus seemed to be forming that you really only need Reader over IO, using a sort of &quot;God Object&quot; like AppT or Env that holds all of your configurations and application state, and you would define more granular &quot;XMonad, YMonad, ZMonad&quot; types for particular effects, which the base AppT would then instance.
 Coming back I see a lot of buzz around algebraic effects, in particular polysemy seems to be the standout example. It seems pretty ergonomic, although I still have no clue how type level lists work or when they were introduced, so that&#x27;s something I&#x27;ll have to get up to speed on. Is this something that I should be using going forward, or is it still in research mode, and I should stick with the standard mtl for now?

                              <span>Hi all,
 I hope this is okay to be posted here - this is a Haskell and Nix question. I have been trying to build a version of GHC that uses -fPIC with Nix. I have managed to do this and can use this version of GHC in a development shell, but I have had difficulty getting that version of GHC used when building the project with Nix. When running &#x60;nix build&#x60;, I get lots of linker errors to do with libraries not being built with -fPIC, but I can build the project just fine with &#x60;cabal build&#x60;.
 Here is my flake.nix file that I am using to build a shared library (it just exports one function that squares an int).
 Any advice on how to get &#x60;callCabal2nix&#x60; to use the custom GHC would be greatly appreciated!

 How can i rid off syntax errors in Vim (which appears in command line on the bottom, screenshot below)?
 Screenshot
 In code i just removed last quote to trigger syntax mistake:
 (line 7) putStrLn &quot;Hello, Haskell!
 SOLVED:
 Ormolu plugin was responsible for it, solved with adding to .vimrc

                              <span>I work with a lot of Org files which have several top-level headline, some of which have nested headlines 2 or 3 levels deep in the subtree. Recently, I&#x27;ve found that after working on one of these subtrees for a while and collapsing the heading, TAB no longer unfolds that particular subtree, while others can be unfolded. Visually,
 * Heading 1: won&#x27;t unfold... * Heading 2: unfolds Blah Blah Blah 
 hitting TAB, or even C-c C-r (org-fold-reveal) has no effect on Heading 1. This sometimes occurs for higher level headlines in a subtree as well.
 Has anyone else noticed this behavior? (And hopefully found a fix?)
 This could be as a result of various settings I have in my init.el, including
 (setq org-support-shift-select &#x27;always) (setq org-cycle-separator-lines 1) (setq org-cycle-emulate-tab t) 
 and the fact that I use EVIL key-bindings.
 I&#x27;m using Emacs 29.1, Org mode version 9.6.6.

                              <span>I discovered something about general.el that I think is neat. I recently started using perspective and wanted to be able to access the keybindings from perspective-map with general to use my own prefix instead of binding it to something like C-c M-p. 
 This works out of the box by specifying perspective-map in general-define-key:
  (general-define-key :prefix &quot;SPC&quot; &quot;p&quot; &#x27;(perspective-map :which-key &quot;perspective&quot;) ... ) 
 Pressing SPC p opens up the minibuffer with all of the perspective commands!

 I&#x27;m using utf-8 (U in the modeline) but setting the language environment to Russian neither does change the keyboard input and it the modeline changes to R and russian characters look wrong

                              <span>Hi everybody, I was looking for a mode that may do exactly what I wrote in the title, that is, given a class with a set of attributes, that can be marked or just by selecting the attribute in the current cursor line, would generate
 def attribute(self): return self._attribute 
 for example. Does anyone have an idea of such mode ? Or even how to code it in lisp with the help of a lisp library that can provide the list of symbols for the current document ?

Thanks to the Doom Emacs shipping, I knew of magit, projectile, LSPs and other utilities, but Emacs itself always came with wonderful &quot;utilities&quot; (e.g., M-x doctor, hanoi, calc, calendar, org ...) and just only to mention an example, I recently knew of M-x re-builder which I found awesome when doing M-x replace-regexp.
 In the end, I always feel like I&#x27;m not aware of a lot of functionalities in Emacs which are there, at my finger tips and thus the question, what are your favorite services/utilities/functions available in (Doom)Emacs?

                              <span>Community feedback request. In latest ellama release (already on MELPA) was added new command ellama-solve-reasoning-problem that implements Absctraction of Thought technique. It uses a chain of multiple messages to LLM and help it to provide much better answers on reasoning problems. Even small LLMs like phi3-mini provides much better results on reasoning tasks using AoT. I hope it can be useful. Also it can be reference implementation for your own chains.

                              <span>I wanted to have a way to temporarily run a command without an alias in Eshell, which is command grep or \grep in bash. After many attempts, this seems to work (entered in Eshell; to put in alias file, remove both of the &#x27;):
 alias command &#x27;export original&#x3D;${alias | grep -h --color&#x3D;never &quot;^alias $1 &quot; | head -n 1 | sed &quot;s/alias $1 //&quot;} &amp;&amp; alias $1 &amp;&amp; $1 ${cdr ${listify $*}}; alias $1 $original &amp;&amp; unset original&#x27; 
 I have to set the grep color flags because I also have grep aliased.
 I just wanted to post this in case anybody else wants it, or if I&#x27;m stupid and there&#x27;s a much better way to do this, or if it could be simplified/turned into elisp.
 Welcome to the Emacs shell ~ $ alias command &#x27;export original&#x3D;${alias | grep -h --color&#x3D;never &quot;^alias $1 &quot; | head -n 1 | sed &quot;s/alias $1 //&quot;} &amp;&amp; alias $1 &amp;&amp; $1 ${cdr ${listify $*}}; alias $1 $original &amp;&amp; unset original&#x27; ~ $ alias rm &#x27;echo &quot;no&quot;&#x27; ~ $ rm test no ~ $ command rm test ~ $ cat test /usr/bin/cat: test: No such file or directory ~ $ rm whatever no

                              <span>I love to use emacs in batch mode for text manipulation. I have done it so much I started to enjoy it and started code golfing with elisp. Its great but there are a lot of long function names like &quot;with-temp-buffer&quot; that could be assigned to a single character. Also it should automatically output the current buffer to stdout and argv arguments could be easier to retrieve.
 Sure common lisp would probably be better for most answers but my brain has been trained to do things in a emacs buffer and by god thats how its gonna be!
 Long story short, lots of tweaks could be made to make elisp code shorter albeit harder to read. I considered byte compiling the code but it was actually more bytes! Maybe the solution is to use keyboard hotkeys? Or maybe the solution is a custom golfing language interpreted by elisp
 Would appreciate any questions or suggestions on this topic.

                              <span>I&#x27;m a developer who loves scala&#x27;s syntax and functional paradigm. However, my company is using kotlin and golang a lot and I want to understand the advantages of scala like type safe, correctness, compile-time error checking, etc. so that I can convince my company to use scala as well. Can you recommend any papers, blogs, videos, github repositories to learn these things? If there is a cost, I would be willing to pay.

 I created this package as part of the tooling I &quot;&quot;&quot;need&quot;&quot;&quot; (wink wink) to create publishing tools to host a static website using Fastmail, which basically exposes files stored in your account.
 I started with a couple functions to upload files, but then I wanted to list files...and a few days later I was putting it all in an independent package, yak shaving be blessed. 
 I hope someone else finds it useful! There are a few things to improve, but from my testing the last few days it works well. Probably the most glaring omission is recursive uploads/downloads. And maybe caching.

 I&#x27;m looking through the docs to see if anything has changed but haven&#x27;t seen anything yet - has anyone encountered this / know what&#x27;s going on?

                              <span>In a podman container run with -p 8192:8192, I run inside an sbcl image:

 If I run
 (require &#x27;jsonrpc) (defvar *conn* (make-instance &#x27;jsonrpc-process-connection :process (lambda () (open-network-stream &quot;JSONRPC&quot; nil &quot;localhost&quot; 8192)))) (jsonrpc-request *conn* :subtract &#x27;(:l 42 :r 12)) (jsonrpc-notify *conn* :quit &#x27;()) 
 from an emacs instance running inside the same container, everything works fine. But if I run that same code from an emacs instance running on my host outside the container, I just get
 [jsonrpc] Server exited with status 256 
 I have no clue what this error code is, I cannot find it in the docs. I am not sure why this is happening, given that I exposed the port and the code works fine from within the container.

                              <span>I could name a lot of examples but one thing that I immediately couldn’t live without was the flycheck error list buffer. It is really handy for rust, since the compiler is so thorough, and it makes refactoring much less tedious. Ultimately, I probably use less than a quarter of the tools and features in emacs and many of the packages I have, so I suspect that there are dozens of game-changing tools right under my nose. What are some of your favorites, and how do you like to use them?

 This is a valid response
 m10 will be converted to margin: 10;
 
 css-ts-mode 
 This is an invalid response
 m10 will be converted to 
 
  
How to fix this?

The latter has been built in for an enough time but I haven’t seen anything so far other then plans to add support for c in packages like combobulate or symex. Is there any released package that support it? If not, what package are you using for C/C++?

                              <span>After about 20 years of living in emacs, my left thumb has started to hurt badly, and it&#x27;s because keyboards place the left Alt key so far to the left that I have to bend my thumb inwards to hit it.
 BTW, I used to hit CTRL by curling up my left pinky, but now I use mechanical keyboards which allow me to press it with the left side of my palm, so, no pinky stress anymore.
 Anyway, back to the Alt. I&#x27;m trying to rewire my brain to use ESC instead of the Alt. Or, in cases where I need it pressed continuously (e.g. M-b M-b M-b to keep going back a word), I try to use the right Alt key with my right thumb. (A key almost never used.) It&#x27;s not easy, the muscle memory is strong, but I try.
 Do others here have the same problem? Any good suggestions?

 For example inside {}, (), [], &quot;&quot;, &#x27;&#x27;, html tags, jsx tags etc...
 A bit like https://github.com/redguardtoo/evil-matchit but I wouldn&#x27;t have to navigate to one of the nodes in the first place.

In this part of the course, we discuss Haskell code with side effects, such as terminal input and output, disk access, networking, random numbers, global state, and more. We motivate and introduce the IO type that is being used for side-effecting expressions. We learn how to compose IO actions, do notation, and how to combine the functional programming techniques we have been using so far with the world of IO.

 Haskell has evolved a lot since the &#x27;98 standard with lots of awesome features that many of us feel like we can&#x27;t live without. At the same time it has, in my opinion, become cluttered and inconsistent partially due to incremental nature of these developments and the need for compatibility.
 This leaves me to ask:
 What what you do differently if you were redesigning a Haskell-like language from the ground up?

                              <span>I love the learning/pleasure values of calligraphy. I handwrite study notes and more, including letters (old-days mail, not e-mail). Mostly with fountain pens.
I fell in love with Zettelkasten, and wonder what share of followers handwrite their notes, in the original Luhmann way.</span>

 Right now running my/open-frame opens new frame as expected and shows my/transient at the bottom. Issues: 1) transient menu disappears the moment window loses focus. 2) if I exit this newly created window then going back to main instance of emacs will show this transient menu 3) transient menu not fullscreen. 
 This is how new created frame looks now https://i.imgur.com/lsVqIWx.png (shows currently opened buffer in my emacs and then shows my transient menu at the bottom)
 Ideal goal is something like doomemacs +org-capture/open-frame
 https://i.imgur.com/P76yrAd.png full height. Would love to be able to remove modeline too and show it afterwards doing refiling/capturing process. 
 Is there any packages or examples how I could achieve this?

                              <span>Hi, my org-directory is set to ~/org but I also have ~/org/roam for roam notes. I installed org-ql package which doesn&#x27;t recurse into the roam dir by default.
 So I found it has a variable to enable recursing:
 (defcustom org-ql-search-directories-files-recursive nil &quot;Recurse into subdirectories by default in &#x60;org-ql-search-directories-files&#x27;. This should probably be disabled by default, because e.g. &#x60;org-directory&#x27; may include deeply nested directories of non-Org files, such as a \&quot;.git\&quot; directory, Org attachments directories, etc, which would make it slow to list the &#x60;org-directory&#x27; files recursively.&quot; :type &#x27;boolean) 
 I use doom, so I set it in my &#x60;doom.d/config.el&#x60;
 (setq org-ql-search-directories-files-recursive t) 
 Restarted emacs and it still doesn&#x27;t recurse into the dirs. Did I configure it wrong?

                              <span>Sorry for the confusing title, but I&#x27;m having trouble describing my problem.
 I find window behavior in emacs is very difficult to understand. There are many commands that either create a new window or replace the current buffer with a &quot;temporary&quot; buffer (eg help window). And some commands simply replace the buffer in current window, some replace the buffer in the other window, still others create a new split. And when something takes over an existing window, sometimes when quitting it returns the previous buffer, and other times it removes the window altogether.
 So far I have not been able to discern a method to this madness and I am often surprised by what happens. A lot of winner-undo.
 First question: is there any underlying logic here I&#x27;m not seeing? Or is it just a free for all?
 Second question: how do you handle this? Memorize/internalize how each command will behave? Rely heavily on winner mode? Something else? 
 I recently stumbled on popper.el so was thinking to give that a try. Curious what others are doing.

                              <span>I love Emacs! It makes so many aspects of my work a delight. I LOVE the ability to edit files over SSH from Emacs. I have a Docker file that’s on my Linux box which takes a very long time to build; I wanted to keep my monitor and keyboard connected to my mac so I could work on other stuff, so I just SSH’d into the Linux box in iTerm and ran docker build. When the build broke, I could switch to an Emacs buffer that was editing the Dockerfile on the Linux box, make edits, then re-run docker build. Once it finally worked, I fired up magit and it Just Worked™ and ran all the Git commands over SSH. So nice!
 What delights you about Emacs?

However, magit is unable to commit because my identity is unknown to it from within the container. Is there anyway I can provide my git credentials set already outside the container to magit inside the container?
 Have I no choice but to copy my git config file into the container?

                              <span>I have evolved my approach to organizing large elisp projects, but still am not completely satisfied, in particular in attempts at keeping the byte compiler warning-free.
 Different approaches I&#x27;ve seen, and their pros/cons:
 Put everything in one giant file:
  
pros: easier to keep the compiler happy (though order within the file still matters).
 cons: harder to navigate/reason about. May be daunting for other developers.
  
Divide into multiple files along sensible boundaries:
 Put common functionality in a main package.el file, and require it in all sub-files.
  
pros: clean division of concern.
 cons: supports one-way dependencies only: package.el cannot use capabilities of any of the sub-files without declaring them.
  
Require all sub-files in the main file:
 Create one main file (pa…</span>

                              <span>I fiddled with compile-multi and projection-multi-compile to get my PHP projects to recognize the build commands I&#x27;m interested in.
 The README for compile-multi was enough to get this to work; the meat of the code is reading the composer.json from the project path, selecting the &quot;scripts&quot; key and listing all available commands.
 Since not everyone is rocking Emacs with native JSON support, I wrapped everything in (json-available-p). That level of indentation makes me sad a bit :)
 It works as is, but tips are welcome:
  
Is there a way to check for JSON availability when wrapping this as a package/auto-loadable .el file?
 Do you have any code review suggestions? Like better combining (message ...) nil in the un-happy path?

 When there multiple instances of a program this makes it impossible to find out which frame is running a program.
 Is there a way to add the screen a program window is running in to the helm-exwm window list?

                              <span>I am reviewing the structure I use for my zettels, mainly to provide some agnosticism in the software I use to read and edit them.  I have two questions about this and would welcome comments from forum members.
1. Important MetaData
Several years ago, after reading through comments on this forum, I settled on the following simple structure:
First line: Combined Unique ID and Title
I use @Will &#x27;s Keyboard Maestro macro to create the &quot;empty&quot; zettel file.  For example, here is a recent zettel I made to capture a personal history item (between &quot;Start&quot; and &quot;End&quot; but not including those words).
Start
202406232104 Memories of Braefoot Valley People and Places
[[202406232104]]
#Unfinished    #Unlinked
The main text of the zettel goes here.....
internal links:
external links:
End
The title line is …</span>

                              <span>I noticed that when exporting org mode to a LaTeX buffer, it automatically converts inline math fragments delimited with dollar signs $n$ into the other format \(n\).
 I understand that there are advantages to the second way of writing inline math, but I was wondering if there were a way to customize this behavior so that inline math remains written with dollar signs.

                              <span>Hi, I have been writing clojure and fsharp for the last few years, and am currently looking to transition to scala. I get contacted by recruiters occasionally but it seems I am never invited to an interview probably due to the fact that I have no professional job experiences in scala. I have been learning scara so far and practiced it, but I&#x27;m not sure what else I can do to have myself get a job in this new language. Would you be able to advise me? I am thinking of writing small libraries or participating in open source projects.

Competitive Programming in Haskell: sieving with mutable arrays by Brent Yorgey
This is one of those cases where for efficiency’s sake, we actually want to use an honest-to-goodness mutable array. Immutable arrays are not a good fit for sieving, and using something like a Map would introduce a lot of overhead that we would rather avoid. However, we only need the table to …</span>

                              <span>Integration testing, a crucial phase of the software development life cycle, plays a pivotal role in ensuring that individual components of a system work seamlessly when combined. Other than unit tests at an atomic level, every thing in the software development process is a kind of integration of pieces. This can be integration-in-the-small, like the integration of components, or it can be integration-in-the-large, such as the integration of services / APIs. While integration testing is essential, it is not without its challenges. In this blog post, we’ll explore the issues of speed, reliability, and maintenance that often plague integration testing processes.

                              <span>I have installed sbcl in an alpine container and mapped port 4005 to my machine. I can connect to the repl just fine from emacs using sly, but when I try to compile a file, I get an error saying that the TRUENAME could not be found. I imagine this is because of confusion between pathnames on host vs guest. The manual says to use the following snipped
 (add-to-list &#x27;sly-filename-translations (sly-create-filename-translator :machine-instance &quot;remote&quot; :remote-host &quot;remote.example.com&quot; :username &quot;user&quot;)) 
 But I dont know how to fill in the options. Setting remote-host to localhost and user to root does not work.

                              <span>Hi, i installed gnus for emacs and then nnreddit.
 When i start gnus there is no way i can authenticate for reddit.
 There is a reddit group when i connect it connects and when i press u to
 subscribe to groups i get: nnreddit-rpc-call: ‘nnreddit-rpc-request’: response timed out
 How can i get nnreddit to work under Gnus?
 Thanks

                              <span>Hello guys, i&#x27;m new to emacs(started learning 2 days ago), i&#x27;m trying to swap ctrl key and meta using this:
 (setq x-ctrl-keysym &#x27;meta)
 (setq x-meta-keysym &#x27;ctrl)
 now it works fine under x11 but on wayland only ctrl key gets remapped and the meta doesn&#x27;t get remapped so i end up with two meta keys (also i don&#x27;t want WM level remapping). does anyone knows what should i do ? 
 thx in advance❤️

                              <span>Hey, I&#x27;m running Emacs on windows with C# for my job. Everyone else on my team uses Visual Studio (obviously) and the files are encoded with &#x60;UTF-8-BOM&#x60; or &#x60;utf-8-with-signature-dos&#x60; in Emacs speak. Emacs somehow wasn&#x27;t reading these files properly and kept saying the encoding is ISO-LATIN-1 and would just print the BOM characters literally on the screen. I had no clue about all this except that I saw 3 weird characters every time I opened any file. So yesterday I decided to dig deep and gather whatever I can to fix this. After trying a few approaches what worked is &#x60;(prefer-coding-system &#x27;utf-8-with-signature-dos)&#x60;. The files are read properly now and the language server is also happy. I use Sharper to build and run my project and it started failing after this change. It uses &#x60;shell-command-to-string&#x60; and others to run &#x60;dotnet&#x60; commands in the project. The commands fail with
 &#x27;ï»¿dotnet&#x27; is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.
 The first 3 characters are BOM and windows command prompt cannot handle this encoding. Is there a way to fix this, either from Emacs side or from the windows command prompt side?
 EDIT: This is with GNU Emacs 29.1 on Windows 11.

                              <span>There was a merge conflict in my configuration and now I&#x27;m getting an error when emacs loads my init.el. I think I understand the error but I&#x27;m unable to find the location. Here&#x27;s the output from starting with --debug-init:
 Debugger entered--Lisp error: (invalid-read-syntax &quot;)&quot; 222 41) read(#) load-with-code-conversion(&quot;/home/brendan/.emacs.d/init.el&quot; &quot;/home/brendan/.emacs.d/init.el&quot; t t) load(&quot;/home/brendan/.emacs.d/init&quot; noerror nomessage) startup--load-user-init-file(#f(compiled-function () #) #f(compiled-function () #) t) command-line() normal-top-level() 
 I tried using goto-charto jump to 222 and 41. The first location is inside a simple setq and the other is a comment in the first line of the file. How can I get to the point where the extra, or missing parenthesis is causing the read error?

                              <span>When trying to use the lsp-mode ts-ls server, I get errors (it exits) that indicate that Emacs uses an older node version. I already have the stable node version set on on my machine but Emacs takes the old one. 
 Is there a way to configure Emacs to use the stable node version?

                              <span>I know I&#x27;m supposed to be the acme mouse guy, but for lisp editing, I became enamored of the mouse functions in the SEDIT editor from medley interlisp, so I created some defuns and bindings to (mostly) replicate them in emacs. Code can be found at GitHub. It currently is very basic, sets global mouse bindings,etc.
 Enjoy!

                              <span>Hey all
 I am using Eglot to connect to the typescript-language-server which is used for both ts and js. However, my project does not have TS, it&#x27;s an older React project in plain JS.
 Now the problem is typescript-language-server will report type errors and throw the error on some JSX components that these cannot be used as JSX components which is really annoying. Is there any way to resolve this? In VSCode for example there is an option javascript.validate.enable&quot;: false to add to the editor config and it will not validate the JS files anymore, however, it will still provide code fix suggestions, like imports for example.
 If there is no way to do this, is there a way to at least somehow get the import fixes working or connect eglot to some eslint server if such exists instead of typescript-language-server?
 Thanks!
 EDIT: 
 The eglot code-actions do not work at all, I cannot fix imports anymore. Good thing is that I was able to get both eglot / eslint reports to show up in Flycheck, but code actions do not work and it still reports the type errors as well. Here&#x27;s the current config that I have:

                              <span>i&#x27;ve been using anki-editor.el and i&#x27;m loving it. i use it alongside org-roam to build a network of knowledge, while at the same time, create flashcards. however, there are times that i cannot write a flashcard using org-mode. an example is when i use my phone / another person&#x27;s computer, or when i write a card with image occlusion enhanced.
 when i create a card in anki, i want it to show up on a defined org file as an entry (so i could then use a refile command to choose where i want it to go). is it possible to do this with a python script? i&#x27;ve seen people online use python as an automation tool for anki, and i wonder if that can also be applied this? thanks

                              <span>Is the only way to install emacs with native treesitter by compiling from source with the &#x60;--with-tree-sitter&#x60; flag? For example, I know a package called &#x60;emacs-plus&#x60; exposes some flags like &#x60;--with-native-compilation&#x60;, though it seems to me it doesn&#x27;t directly mirror the available underlying available flags and it wasn&#x27;t documented if &#x60;--with-tree-sitter&#x60; is supported.

                              <span>So this is probably a very basic question, but I can&#x27;t seem to find a solution anywhere. I&#x27;ve been using conda.el to manage my python environments, and I appear to have my Lsp working fine. However, whenever I use the &quot;run-python&quot; command and try to run a file, it raises errors as if it was only using the base environment. The modeline says it is in the correct environment, but that is obviously not the case.

                              <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;m trying to incorporate launching emacs as emacsclient with the daemon running in the background. So far, I simply have an autostart script containing the line emacs --daemon &amp; and launch a frame with emacsclient -c -a &#x27;emacs&#x27;.
 I have an init.el and an early-init.el. I suspect it is the latter that is causing problems. The fonts are set in init.el.
 However, launching emacs this way results in a different font as compared to launching emacs with the daemon running. I&#x27;d really appreciate any help on this. Thanks!

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to set up MIT Scheme with Scmutils (mechanics.com band file) to work seamlessly with Org-Babel and Geiser in Emacs, but I&#x27;m running into issues. Here’s what I have so far:
 (use-package geiser :ensure t :config (setenv &quot;DISPLAY&quot; &quot;:0&quot;) (setq geiser-active-implementations &#x27;(mit)) (add-hook &#x27;geiser-repl-mode-hook &#x27;hn-disable-trailing-whitespace-and-empty-lines)) (use-package geiser-mit :ensure t :config (setenv &quot;MITSCHEME_HEAP_SIZE&quot; &quot;100000&quot;) (setenv &quot;MITSCHEME_LIBRARY_PATH&quot; &quot;/Users/harish/Applications/mit-scheme/lib/mit-scheme-svm1-64le-12.1&quot;) (setenv &quot;MITSCHEME_BAND&quot; &quot;mechanics.com&quot;) (setq geiser-mit-binary &quot;/Users/harish/Applications/mit-scheme/bin/mit-scheme&quot;)) (org-babel-do-load-languages &#x27;org-babel-load-languages &#x27;((scheme . t))) (defun hn-org-confirm-babel-evaluate (lang body) (not (string&#x3D; lang &quot;scheme&quot;))) (setq org-confirm-babel-evaluate #&#x27;hn-org-confirm-babel-evaluate) (defun hn-disable-trailing-whitespace-and-empty-lines () &quot;Disable showing trailing whitespace and indicating empty lines in the current buffer.&quot; (setq-local show-trailing-whitespace nil) (setq-local indicate-empty-lines nil)) 
 With this setup, I can start a Geiser REPL and it beautifully loads mit-scheme with Scmutils functions, including talking to X for graphics. But Org-Babel (whose docs claim that it relies on the Geiser REPL) seems to load vanilla mit-scheme and not Scmutils. I cannot get it to recognise D and other Scmutils functions when executing Scheme code blocks.
 What is the best way to ensure that the mechanics.com band file is properly loaded in Org-Babel sessions, just as it is in REPL? Any help to streamline this process would be greatly appreciated!

When no buffers associated with files are open, I&#x27;ve restarted emacs, how does it have this path to prompt me with?
 When I have two files open in 2 buffers, how can I get ediff to use those files/directories, instead of prompting for some weird path?

                              <span>Why doesn&#x27;t dired/find-file update the path list when switching projects?
 I had an old clojure project and then created a new one with the same project name at the same root path. 
 IMO, because the path and the name are the same dired/find-file after switch-to-project lists the old and new project file and directory paths together.
 Should not the old project paths be removed, because it is not valid anymore?

I know it is not enough to simply add :global t, but I am stuck on how to do the modification.

That doesn&#x27;t seem to work though.... any help is appreciated.
 Here is the function defined by the package:
 (define-minor-mode org-starless-mode &quot;Starless org-mode&quot; nil nil nil :require &#x27;org (let* ((keyword &#x60;((&quot;^\\(\\*+ \\)\\s-*\\S-&quot; ; Do not hide empty headings!

                              <span>Hey, I recently started using the NS version of emacs 30 (previously I was using emacs-mac). The experience was great for most of the time but sometimes I&#x27;d get terrible stuttering which I eventually diagnosed to fringe rendering.
 As it turns out, the NS redisplay draws fringes by converting the bitmap into a vector where each pixel is a square. Both the &#x27;copy&#x27; and &#x27;fill&#x27; methods of such an NSBezierPath are incredibly slow on my system (perhaps rasterising a path was cached at some point but now on ARM MacOS Sonoma it is not?), with 90% of the cpu time being spent inside -[NSBezierPath copyWithZone:].
 I&#x27;ve come up with a patch that changes fringes such that they&#x27;re drawn using masked CGImages, which completely eliminates this slowdown when drawing fringes. But I&#x27;m no expert on NS so this might not be the best solution: https://gist.github.com/simmsb/7998452560b10a4de645a3d7d2adee32

                              <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;m curious to know what the workflow of fellow emacsers is on this sub. Do you run just one frame of emacs (no emacsclient) and use that one frame to do your work, or do you run emacsclient to work on multiple frames?
 I find the one frame workflow to be more integrated into the idea of using emacs for most applications.

 I&#x27;ve tried to look up stuff on comparing the two so that I can decide on which to use but I just can&#x27;t seem to find anything. 
 Anything on how they compare and why one would use one over the other would be great to know. Or if one is just simply superior in every way that would be good to know too.

 Hi everyone!
 In case anyone is collecting the Topps stickers for the current Euro 2024 tournament, I have created a small program which keeps track of your duplicates and the ones you still need.
 Essentially, you add the stickers you&#x27;ve got in files/Got.txt and it generates a list with your duplicates (together with how many extra copies of each sticker you&#x27;ve got) and the ones you still need. See the readme file for more instructions.
 This should work as it is, although there is still some room for improvement. Most importantly, how to print proper umlauts instead of escape characters in the files and how not to surround strings with &quot;&quot;. If anyone knows the solution to this please chime in! :)
 I hope this would be of help to someone. It certainly is it me as I couldn&#x27;t find a similar app for this tournament.
 Happy swapping!

                              <span>Just deconstructing a tuple is making each iteration overhead to around microsecond. For 3-tuples or 4-tuples, it&#x27;s up to a few microseconds. Does this make any sense.. is this what you would expect? Modern laptop CPU compiled with -O2.
 For tight loops, I&#x27;m doomed to go back to pointer management (Ptr) and IORefs? (to simulate variables, just so i can get closer to C speeds)?

                              <span>Dear Haskellers,
 We are happy to announce that there is a new job opening for a Haskell developer at Chordify! We have had some success via this subreddit in the past, so the content of this post may ring a bell to some.
 Chordify is a music platform that you can use to automatically detect the chords in any song you like. This way we help musicians to play all of their favourite music in an easy and intuitive way. You can try it at https://chordify.net
 Now, the backend for our website and apps, that are used by millions of people worldwide, is written in Haskell! We serve the user using primarily Servant, Persistent and Esqueleto. We also make use of a custom Redis caching layer; you may know us from https://hackage.haskell.org/package/redis-schema
 We are looking for a new proactive, independent and creative functional programmer to improve the Chordify backend infrastructure, core technology, and launch new ideas to join our team of experienced developers in our offices in Utrecht or Groningen. You&#x27;d get the opportunity to work with advanced type systems to power a website that serves millions.
 More information (e.g. expectations, salary range, secondary benefits) and a form to apply can be found at https://jobs.chordify.net. If you have any questions, feel free to ask them in this thread, or reach out to me at [menno@chordify.net](mailto:menno@chordify.net) 
 We strive for diversity in our team, and encourage people of all backgrounds and genders to apply.
 For transparency: this is explicitly NOT a remote job. We do allow working from home, but expect our colleagues to be in the office at least 50% of their time.

                              <span>I&#x27;m relatively new to Haskell programming, so please don&#x27;t be too harsh if this is a silly question.
 There&#x27;s a particular behaviour I&#x27;m accustomed to in vscode with other languages that Haskell&#x27;s extension doesn&#x27;t seem to provide, and I&#x27;m curious if any solution is available.
 In most languages, when you type out a functions name and then type the opening bracket for the function call, you get a popup showing the function signature, as well as the name of each function parameter as you type.
 In Haskell, you only get the function signature popup when you&#x27;re typing the name of the function itself, so you have to memorize the order of the function parameters, then go about actually typing them out. Sometimes, when there&#x27;s an error over a function, you don&#x27;t even get the popup when you hover over the function name, meaning you have to go elsewhere and type out the function name to check the order of its arguments.
 Some of this annoyance seems to be down to a fundamental incompatibility between Haskell and vscode; vscode expects a C-style language, where function calls are characterized by brackets, so can&#x27;t understand function calls without brackets. It also obviously can&#x27;t give parameter names, since parameters in Haskell can have multiple names because of pattern matching.
 Is there any solution to this issue, or is it just an annoyance you have to deal with?

                              <span>Serokell and the Haskell Foundation are excited to announce a community-led Haskell Certification Program. Serokell has developed an online testing platform for administering practical and theoretical Haskell problems. Haskell is a complex language, offering a wide range of techniques and features for programmers. It’s simply not feasible for a novice or intermediate programmer to master them all. The goal of the Haskell certification is to help standardize what it means to ‘know Haskell’ at various levels of experience.
 As a community driven effort, we are soliciting self-nomination for volunteers to take part in the organization and decision-making around the certification process. These volunteers will help determine how the certification process evolves and which questions are relevant to the various experience levels of a Haskell programmer. Volunteers from organizations that use Haskell professionally are especially welcome.
 Please send your self-nomination to certification@haskell.foundation by the end of July 10th 2024.

                              <span>I have a couple questions, if people don&#x27;t mind me asking.
 1) Are there any cabal build flags that tell it to maximize runtime efficiency, or is the binary I get from just running cabal build as fast the program is going to get? I&#x27;m not looking for removing safety, just wondering if debugging support can be removed for a faster run time.
 2) Would someone mind telling me the latest guidance for making a static binary? I know this has been asked many times, but searching around online I see a lot of old advice, and I&#x27;m not sure what the most current guidance is.
 Thank you!

                              <span>I noticed today a new section in the offical website: https://orgmode.org/. It&#x27;s called &quot;Project heartbeat&quot; and it&#x27;s an eclectic collection of links, mailing list messages, feature requests, links to specific git commits, some specific packages, etc. 
 I don&#x27;t think it should be in the TOP page of the official landing page for orgmode, pushing down the introduction, features, quickstart links and actual code examples. It&#x27;s distracting and of interest to a smaller group than to justify the front facing real estate. It can be put in the &quot;Update&quot;s, &quot;Worg&quot;, &quot;Contribute&quot; sections, pick your choice.

                              <span>Think about how you probably use magit, especially the log, where you tend to visit commits alongside the history, with the log in one window and particular log items in another window. Magit has a lot of views and these views often list items that can be in turn viewed in multiple ways. This list &amp; item interaction model has a lot of good karma with respect to both architecture and user interaction.
 I&#x27;m mainly picking on &#x60;org-agenda-list&#x27;, but not using the full window width always has bad voodoo in Emacs. When I see complex agenda views with a lot of information to the right of the list of items, I think it&#x27;s neat, but I also think it should be left &amp; right window for those cases so that the functionality can be remixed and viewed in a mix &amp; match kind of way. This is one of the main reasons I&#x27;m not building on top of agenda.
 Another reason this works with magit is because of collapseable sections for showing details of items. Vertical organization can hold arbitrary amounts of detail while left-right organization in a single window, well, this isn&#x27;t a web browser. Organizing information left-right in sections and controlling reflow are likely to not obtain a good result.
 This is related to casually spiking more work on afterburner, only at the pace that I am getting value out for now.

                              <span>Just installed emacs 29.4 pure GTK from source.
 When I run
 emacs --daemon 
 It says:
  
Due to a limitation in GTK 3, Emacs built with PGTK will simply exit when a display connection is closed. The problem is especially difficult to fix, such that Emacs on Wayland with multiple displays is unlikely ever to be able to survive disconnects.
  
And emacs daemon also doesn&#x27;t run.
 These may be two separate issues - the emacs GUI disappearing and daemon not starting, but in regards to the first, on a laptop we can expect there to be network connections to continually connect/disconnect. 
 Is anyone using a pgtk build on a Windows laptop running WSL2?

                              <span>Running emacs-mac (--with-no-title-bars --with-xwidgets --with-imagemagick). 
 When I take a pic from my iPhone, send it to my computer, and try to view it in Emacs, it just shows as blank, both in dired as well as an org inline image. I can take a screenshot of the image and use org-download to paste THAT image successfully, but specifically a photo taken from my phone just doesn&#x27;t show up. (I&#x27;ve checked the &quot;most compatible&quot; setting on my phone, so it&#x27;s making JPEGs and not .HEIC or whatever. I tried .HEIC and they also don&#x27;t work.)
 Other .jpeg and .jpg files work, but specifically not ones from my iPhone. 
 Any ideas?

                              <span>I would like to add a few packages to auto-load when I open Emacs. These are Newsticker, EMMS, ERC, and a few others. However, I don&#x27;t want them all to pop-up all-at-once on the same buffer when I load into Emacs. Is there a way to have these loud in the background?

 I have an org file with this content:
 * John Doe
 :PROPERTIES:
 :NAME: John
 :SURNAME: Doe
 :PLACE: Disneyland
 :GROUP: Fantasy
 * Jane Doe
 :PROPERTIES:
 :NAME: Jane
 :SURNAME: Doe
 :PLACE: Neverland
 :GROUP: Power
 And so on...
 What i would like is to display only the headlines (+content) with say :PLACE:&#x3D;Fantasy
 And hide the rest
 Now with C-c / i see only headlines marked with &gt; when the property matches and the other
 headlines + content are still there
 With M-g i can go to the next match but all i want is only headlines+content filtered
 and hide the rest
 Is this possible??
 thanks
 Ray

                              <span>Hi everybody, I started exploring this world 3 days ago. I want to manage my notes with org-roam and org-download.
 How can I make images adapt to the width of the window dynamically? Because if the image is too large, it gets cut off halfway (and Emacs crashes many times).
 If this is too hard, How you manage this workflow?
 Sorry for my silly question, but I feel a bit overwhelmed when searching for information with so little learning time. Thank you very much.

                              <span>This version polishes the first-order refinement methods introduced in v2.5.0 and many compile-time messages enhancements.
 What is Iron?
 Iron is a library for refined types in Scala. You can attach predicates (also called &quot;refinements&quot;) to types and ensure they pass at compile-time or runtime:
 val x: Int :| Positive &#x3D; 5 val y: Int :| Positive &#x3D; -5 //Compile-time error val z: Either[String, Int :| Positive] &#x3D; -5.refineEither //Left(&quot;...&quot;) 
 There are many other features including: - Custom constraints - New zero-cost types - Many integrations with other libraries such as Cats, ZIO, Doobie, Decline, Circe...
 Check the README for further information.

                              <span>I&#x27;m just considering a rewrite of a webapp-server from Express.js to HTTPurple. The server does the following things:
  
Manages user sessions and injects user auth to all requests (to resolve an issue with opening protected raw files in new tabs, which is probably a terrible idea that needs rework anyways)
 Proxies paths starting with /api to backend servers
 Interprets other paths as paths to static files and serves them, if they exist
 Finally serves index.html if paths don&#x27;t match anything
  
All other routing is done in the SPA.
 Why do I want to rewrite the server? There is a very fine-grained role-based authorization scheme managed by the backend. For UX-reasons, some backend responses contain a permission object with some requests (e.t. GET /api/entities/ returns { data: ..., permissions: { create: true } }.
 Setting up accounts for all possible combinations of permissions is tedious, and for some combinations/new functionality, roles don&#x27;t even exist yet, so I would like to inject permissions to (some) /api/... requets after they return from being proxied to the backend. Express&#x27; imperative handler will not let me access the responses after a handler has matched, but with pure functions this should be trivial.
 So, are my use cases supported/possible with HTTPurple? Any suggestions?

                              <span>I&#x27;m trialling a digitized version of my small physical ZK, and I&#x27;m running into a small issue with what constitutes a seperate note.
Most of my notes are MUCH smaller than other&#x27;s, sometimes I can fit the entirety of the idea into the title. So I&#x27;m wondering if instead of focusing on reducing the idea I should be adding more of the &#x27;therefores&#x27; onto the notes?
For example, I have the following notes, which were titles only in the paper version but I have expanded on slightly in the digital.
The patient&#x27;s art is only understood through therapy, (Naimberg 1953)
Art seeks reaction, (artlust, 2024)
Art can only truly be understood in relationship
To me, the third one is the &#x27;therefore&#x27; of the first two. This is particulary obvious in the digital version where I expand slightly on &#x27;art seeks reaction&#x27;, because reaction can only happen in relationship. Initially I thought these are three seperate ideas, but now I&#x27;m not so sure.
Should I combine the second two notes?</span>

 I just released a new web framework I&#x27;ve been working on: FastScala - it includes some ideas from the LiftWeb framework and allows you to do very quick development, coding both the backend and frontend in Scala.
 If you&#x27;re curious, you can see more here: http://www.fastscala.com/
 Comments/suggestions appreciated 🙂

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking for ideas or options on how to go about in some way incentivising through financially sponsoring (as an individual, not corporate), or co-sponsoring, an upgrade to an open source Scala.js 3 repository.
 I don&#x27;t currently have the time to do the entire upgrade myself (although I&#x27;d love to try and contribute some hours), and I want to give the upgrade back to the community (as opposed to just keep a private fork).
 What sort of option frameworks exist for this kind of approach to incrementally improving open source in general, and within the Scala specific subdomain?
 While my exploration is about the more general problem, here&#x27;s the particular repository upon which I&#x27;m currently focused: https://antoine-doeraene.medium.com/make-your-google-spreadsheets-scala-ble-5695d9dd784f

                              <span>Hey,
 I have a little brain teaser if anyone is interested.
 I have multiple list of properties (house, apartment, …). Each list comes from a different source. The goal is to group properties to avoid duplicates.
 Because every source has their own way of doing things, it isn’t as easy as group by address.
 I need to come up with a way to group by address, or by geo coordinates, or by bedroom + bathroom + size, or by cover picture, or … some sort of group by similarity score.
 Would anyone have a solution to such problem?

In the microservices world, we spend a lot of time making ad hoc http requests to debug failing services, do sanity checks, etc. As a GUI, Postman makes it pretty easy for beginners to get started with this sort of work. However, you quickly run into its limitations:
  
 Leaking passwords to postman.com, or into your exported files, is easy
  Importing/exporting Environment and Collection files means, in practice, that these files do not end up in version control
  Working in your preferred editor/IDE requires an impractical amount of copy/pasting

                              <span>Hi all! I was wondering what ways to promote a Scala tooling ecosystem PR would you suggest?
 E.g., Scala Steward PR: https://github.com/scala-steward-org/scala-steward/pull/3372
 (I&#x27;m aware I&#x27;m promoting the PR itself with this post 😂, but I&#x27;m way more interested in any answer to the previous question 😊)
 TIA!

                              <span>As a researcher who primarily uses interpreted language, I’ve recently been exploring compiled languages, especially functional languages. Right now I’m looking at Scala, and I really like its features. However, the jvm dependency, while great for some purposes (I do a lot of work in clojure), is a concern for others. One reason I’m looking at compiled languages is for building cli tools as static binaries that can be flexibly copied into docker containers, over ssh, etc.
 I’m curious how practical scala native would be for this purpose, or if I’d be better off using another language for cli tools. What if I wanted to do something that depends on third-party libraries, like image processing?
 Thanks for the help.

 Hello friends. I recently made a post here about switching to emacs. It&#x27;s been a few days (probably..? I&#x27;m sure you are no strangers to getting sucked into editing your .emacs file) I&#x27;m back with some updates!
 Upsides:
 Counsel, Which-key, Ivy, and Avy were all solid recommendations. these are instant benefit-adds that I could notice immediately. 
 Org mode is obviously a win. Org-novelist is also very powerful, but I have to spend a lot of time in that to really get a feel. I still haven&#x27;t setup magit yet (sorry! I know it&#x27;s amazing!)
 I opted for meow. I know, I got a lot of evil recommendations. Since I added the &quot;don&#x27;t recommend evil&quot;, and yet still got them, I can tel…</span>

                              <span>I have been using projectile for years and it works nicely. However, recently I have noticed that more people recommend project.el because it is lighter and has the backing of the Emacs maintainers. Therefore, I want to give it a try.
 One confusion about project.el is how to specify a project if no version control exists.
 For example, suppose I have the following directory:
 \---myproject | +---subproject1 | \---.git | | Makefile | \---subproject2 \---.git | Makefile 
 How to specify myproject as a project? Note that the myproject itself is under VC. 
 By projectile, I just add a empty .projectile to myproject.
 From Emacs docs:
  
Whether a given directory is a root of some project is determined by the project-specific infrastructure, known as project back-end. Emacs currently supports two such back-ends: VC-aware (see Version Control), whereby a VCS repository is considered a project; and EDE (see Emacs Development Environment). This is expected to be extended in the future to support additional types of projects.
  
Therefore I have to write a back-end by myself? or use EDE which seems rarely used?
 Thanks.

                              <span>Hello everyone!
 I am looking for a way to customize my C indentation style in Emacs to fit my school style guidelines.
 One of the guidelines I am trying to implement goes like this: &quot;Each variable declaration must be indented on the same column for its scope&quot;, see my example below for clarity. 
 Example:
 int main(void) { int a; int b; int c; } int main(void) { int a; char b; float c; } int main(void) { int a; char b; unsigned char c; } 
 As you can see I have to indent the variables on the same column as their longest neighboring type name basically (C89 style).
 So far, I have dealt with it by remapping my TAB key to insert actual tabs with this elisp snippet: (local-set-key (kbd &quot;TAB&quot;) &#x27;tab-to-tab-stop) so I can indent everything manually. It does the job for me but I&#x27;m curious if there is a way to make full use of c-mode functionality to do that without having to write a super complicated elisp function that checks if the symbol at point is a C type and then indents it to the right column (with potential backtracking also). 
 I think the short answer is probably no but I&#x27;m curious how you would deal with this if you were in my situation or/and if you personally had to do any &quot;hacks&quot; to your c-mode config to fit some project&#x27;s guidelines. 
 I quickly skimmed through manual, it probably has all the answers I need but nothing really stood out to me at first glance.

 so I&#x27;m trying to follow the installation from here and in it it mentions MELPA. So I go to install MELPA from here but it mentions this
  
Enable installation of packages from MELPA by adding an entry to package-archives after (require &#x27;package) and before the call to package-initialize in your init.el or .emacs file:
  
yet my .emacs file located at the home directory has a single line
  
(put &#x27;upcase-region &#x27;disabled nil)
  
which I assume is because I enabled this command
 but I add the entry anyway and run M-x package-refresh-contents which tries to contact melpa.org but then it throws a signature error

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I&#x27;ve recently started using Emacs and found it to be an incredibly cool and powerful editor. However, I noticed that there wasn&#x27;t a GitHub theme similar to what Neovim offers, so I decided to create one myself. I have developed GitHub dark theme, light, and dark dimmed versions. The theme has been tested on WSL2 running on Windows Terminal, but if you encounter any issues, please let me know on GitHub.
 You can find theme on Github.
 Key Features:
  
Customizable colors for comments, keywords, strings, numbers, etc.
 Support for various modes including org-mode, term, ivy, swiper, and more.
 Compatibility with Emacs 24 and later.
 Easily modifiable to suit personal preferences based on the provided code.
  
Since I&#x27;m not familiar with Emacs package managers yet, you can install and use the theme manually as long as autothemer is installed.
 Feel free to customize the theme according to your preferences. If you have any questions or encounter issues, please report them on GitHub :)
 P.S.
 I also tested the themes using the emacs -nw command. Both the dark and light themes work perfectly in the terminal. However, the dark-dimmed theme isn&#x27;t fully compatible because I couldn&#x27;t find a suitable color to replicate the greyish tone used in the GUI version.

                              <span>I&#x27;m having trouble with citations in my Org-mode documents when trying to include them in QUOTE or EXAMPLE blocks. The current setup I have doesn&#x27;t allow citar to recognize and insert references in these blocks, which causes issues during LaTeX export.
 #BEGIN_EXAMPLE [cite:citationKey 20] #END_EXAMPLE 
 The above snippet gets rendered in LaTeX as:
 \begin{example} [cite:citationKey] % instead of \cite{citationKey} \end{example} 
 I see two potential solutions, but I&#x27;m not sure how to implement them, being quite new to Lisp:
  
Allow Citar to Add References in Blocks: Expand the context variable in citar-org.el to include blocks. Here&#x27;s the relevant line in the citar code.
 Modify LaTeX Exporters: Ensure that [cite] expressions within blocks get parsed correctly during LaTeX export.
  
What would be the best approach to achieve this? Any suggestion would be greatly appreciated!

 I came from update org to version 9.7.5 and now I have an issue running a emacs-lisp block source. The block source is very simple:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 +BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :session ego :results output
 (setq org-babel-python-command &quot;~/.virtualenvs/data-science/bin/python&quot;)
 +END_SRC
 The message error is: &#x60;org-babel-execute:emacs-lisp: ob-emacs-lisp backend does not support sessions&#x60;.
 What&#x27;s wrong with my block source code ?

                              <span>I just released Org mode 9.7.5 that fixes a critical vulnerability. The release is coordinated with emergency Emacs 29.4 release.
 Please upgrade your Org mode or Emacs ASAP.
 The vulnerability involves arbitrary Shell code evaluation when previewing attachments in Emacs MUA (gnus-based: at least, mu4e, Notmuch, Gnus itself) or when opening Org files. All the earlier versions of Org mode are affected.
 Note that the vulnerability solved in this release has nothing to do with recent Org 9.6.23 release (https://list.orgmode.org/871q7zbldp.fsf@localhost/). It existed since long time ago and was discovered by accident.

                              <span>Hi there,
I&#x27;m Justin, a 32 yo nurse assistant who work with elders suffering from severe dementia.
I&#x27;ve been lurking here for a few months and finaly found the time to convert my website to a zettelkasten(ish) thinking machine.
I&#x27;ve been exploring ideas about caring, gardening and sociology for a few days and I quite enjoy the process.
Luhmann ID user I&#x27;m currently between Obsidian and Acme Editor (plan9). I&#x27;ve been working on a few shell script to adapt my workflow with the later as I find it quite relaxing when writing.
Thanks for all users here for your greate debates and ideas. A pleasure to read, a pleasure to think about.
Take care,
Justin</span>

                              <span>(This is one of the reasons I don&#x27;t like building/installing emacs myself. When I built 29.1, this happened and now it&#x27;s happened again with 29.3 and I can&#x27;t remember how I fixed it...)
 This is for Ubuntu 22.04, using a pretty stock GNOME desktop environment.
 Having just updated emacs to 29.3 by building and installing it myself (under /usr/local), I am having some weird interaction with the GNOME desktop. I run emacs directly, and leave it running for my session. I have (had) the desktop icon fixed in my taskbar. I only just noticed this morning that there was a second emacs icon in the taskbar while the application is running. Hovering over the icon, it reads, &quot;Emacs (Client)&quot;. I thought perhaps there was a minor conflict between 29.3 and 29.1, so I removed the fixed icon from the task…</span>

I&#x27;m doing it right now as hook for the entire mode as shown below but I would love to do it for the given project so I can work in other projects that do actually use clang-format. Does anybody knows how to accomplish this? Below my current config simplified:
  (use-package apheleia :preface (defun my--disable-apheleia () (apheleia-mode -1)) :hook ((prog-mode . apheleia-mode) (c-ts-mode . my--disable-apheleia) ;; TODO: how to do this per-project as opposed to per-mode?

 I&#x27;ve been looking something to make graphic notes like obsidian&#x27;s canvas for a while now, and I spotted this today. Absolutely brilliant package.
 And the same method(ors-get-id and copy to canvas) works on obsidian-excalidraw as well

                              <span>Hi. I have trouble setting up mbsync to properly handle deletion in two GMail accounts. They&#x27;re configured identically (&quot;When I mark a message in IMAP as deleted&quot; &#x3D; &quot;Auto-Expunge off&quot;, &quot;When a message is marked as deleted and expunged from the last visible IMAP folder&quot; &#x3D; &quot;Move the message to the Trash&quot;), however, the behaviour for them is quite different. For the first one, it is more or less fine:
  
👌 mu4e-headers-mark-for-trash for mail in inbox moves it to trash
 👌 mu4e-headers-mark-for-trash for mail in archive moves it to trash
 🤷 mu4e-headers-mark-for-delete for mail in inbox moves it to archive
 👌 mu4e-headers-mark-for-delete for mail in archive moves it to trash
 😠 mu4e-headers-mark-for-delete for mail in both inbox and archive does nothing (the email gets removed from my local maildir, but it is still present in GMail web interface)
  
However, for the second account (configured identically) the situation is much worse:
  
🤷 mu4e-headers-mark-for-trash for mail in inbox moves it to archive
 😠 mu4e-headers-mark-for-trash for mail in archive does nothing
 🤷 mu4e-headers-mark-for-delete for mail in inbox moves it to archive
 😠 mu4e-headers-mark-for-delete for mail in archive does nothing
 😠 mu4e-headers-mark-for-delete for mail in both inbox and archive does nothing
  
I&#x27;d like to have a way to just press a button and send an email to trash folder, without checking where this email comes from.
 Is it something I&#x27;m missing, some kind of hidden GMail setting or perhaps something in mbsync configuration? Here&#x27;s how I configured mbsync: https://pastebin.com/7wR4RCpt

 SVG specifications allows flowing text along a curve via textPath element. This opens up possibilities for cool text effects e.g. Formula Editor in GNU Emacs.

                              <span>Hi everyone! I&#x27;d like to announce release 0.13.0 of dunai. It is accompanied by a matching release of dunai-test and bearriver.
 Dunai is a reactive programming library structured around a notion of Monadic Stream Functions. Dunai can be used to implement other reactive and FRP frameworks on top, including Classic FRP and Arrowized FRP variants.
 Dunai comes with:
  
bearriver: API-compatible implementation of Yampa. (The Bear River is a tributary to the Yampa river.)
 
dunai-test: QuickCheck-based temporal testing library that can be connected with the testing system haskell-titan.
 
 See https://github.com/ivanperez-keera/dunai#features for details on Dunai&#x27;s features.

                              <span>In Haskell, why is the following code valid:
 haskell f :: a f &#x3D; f 
  
Is it because we can infer the return type, together with Haskell not requiring a term to have parameters and being lazy?
  
What I mean is that I can get something similar in ML only in two steps:
 ocaml let rec f (x: &#x27;a): &#x27;b &#x3D; f x let x : &#x27;a &#x3D; f () 
  
How does this relate to the halting problem?
 Having a inhabited bottom makes Haskell&#x27;s type system inconsistent and, hence, unsound (because inconsistency implies unsoundness). So why do we say that it is sound? Do we say that considering just the consistent subset? (I&#x27;ve read the article on fast and loose reasoning).
  
Note: Haskell is my favorite language, so I&#x27;m not trying to bash it. I&#x27;m writing an assignment for uni on formal logic about consistency in lambda calculus. I would appreciate it if someone could answer as objectively as possible so I can further my investigations on how Turing completeness (the inclusion of general recursion) impacts consistency in type theory.

                              <span>Hi everybody,
 I would like to know if there is a way to have an org-agenda view for today presented in a time-grid view where I can see my notes, state changes, clocks and all the things from logbook?
 The idea is to visualize in a single time-grid view for a day all the logbook related things from my TODOs. So in exactly the same way as the SCHEDULED items are shown on a time grid now, I would like to see notes, clocks, state changes etc for all TODOs.
 If such a view is not possible, I would like to implement it. Is there any advice you can give, or a suggestion, on how I could manipulate the time grid view to display data I parsed from logbooks? I could format it while parsing in any way it is needed but the display of information on the time-grid I am not familiar with.

 I need a basic lsp setup with treesitter
 Can you guys link to specific snippet?
 Treesitter is not showing correct syntax highlighting on my end especially for c++-ts-mode
 Lsp is working but c++-ts-mode is not
 Is there a thing in emacs like kickstart in neovim?

                              <span>I&#x27;m using eglot over tramp for python development. lsp is pylsp. I use pythonic-activate to activate the venv after tramp to the remote machine, and eglot works out of box, which is great.
 The problem is I&#x27;m asked for password twice for each python file I visited. This is not there when I don&#x27;t have eglot, so I think it is eglot establishing connection or something. I use ssh config to hop 3 times into the remote server, one with public key and other 2 password, so I had to type 6 passwords for each file I opened(and they are all different), which is annoying.
 Does anyone else have this problem? How do you solve it?(make eglot ask for password less often)

                              <span>Hello! I&#x27;m a writer, and a programmer. I&#x27;ve in the past obviously leaned towards vim for my text editing &amp; writing, and have become very comfortable in that environment with vim movements.
 Recently I&#x27;ve decided to give emacs a try (as I&#x27;ve always wanted to), and after hearing about org-mode (&amp; org-novelist, export with pandoc, etc) I wanted to try and move my workflow over to emacs for writing. I have a few questions though:
 What is the best way to move around a text file, in your experience? I&#x27;m of course reading through documentation, but things like sexp movement don&#x27;t benefit much from prose! In Vim I could move to any line and any word with a pretty quick series of inputs: is this possible in emacs?
 What are some must haves in the config? i&#x27;m doing vanilla (please don&#x27;t recommend evil--I want to experience emacs for what it is) This is specifically for writing. I know emacs has thousands of commands, and I can only imagine it has a similar amount of settings (setq&#x27;s? what are these called?)
 I already have lived a long life with capslock as ctrl (started after i got a HHKB, couldnt&#x27; go back) but is there a way to use meta/alt as spacebar instead? I know I said no evil, but space as my leader key has been something of a game change in terms of ergonomics for me.
 Finally I plan on just using bleeding edge, building from source. I know theres some exciting things that have just came out, or will be coming out in 30. Has anyone had any issues using the --pgtk with wayland? It&#x27;s hard to find any communication about this back and forth online (i suppose a lot of emacs folks are still on mailing lists or on matrix and not reddit/discord)
 I&#x27;ll appreciate any feedback, even if it&#x27;s not regarding a question. Thanks so much
 edit: thanks for all the help. I have literally never made a post on reddit in over a decade between many accounts that received such useful input.

                              <span>Hej fellows,
 I want to be able to narrow down the candidates to SWITCH-TO-BUFFER not only based on the buffer/file name, but also based on the major mode (or any other information provided by MARGINALIA, for that matter).
 Is there some integration, or some variable I can set? I struggle to believe that no one else has run into this problem, so I am CERTAIN someone has already encountered and fixed this problem.
 I am glad for pointers, advice and recommendation.
 Have a good day, fellow &#x27;macsers!

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been unsatisfied with existing tree file browser packages for emacs, they all have been too slow for me. 
 Expanding whole tree for bigger projects takes, like, forever, so I&#x27;m writing my own.
 It mainly utilities unix tree command output:
 https://gitlab.com/OldManProgrammer/unix-tree
 one functionality it&#x27;s missing is interactive expand / contract tree, for example:
 ├── assets/ │ ├── images/ │ │ ├── testImage.jpg │ │ └── testImage.png │ └── shaders/ │ └── default.glsl 
 contracted would look like:
 ├── assets/ │ ├── images/ │ └── shaders/ 
 and even more contracted would look like:
 ├── assets/ 
 Before i write my own logic for this, i thought built-in outline-mode could be a perfect fit for this.
 But I&#x27;ve been playing with outline-regexp for quite a while, and i always can&#x27;t quite get it right.
 if anyone is interested, i can post repo for this later in the comments. Its&#x27; pretty simple, but i want to fix few more things.

                              <span>Hi everyone. I would like the normal mode in meow to not include any delete operation and maybe create a delete mode. Does anyone have any idea how I could achieve that?

                              <span>I have the following block in init.el:
 (use-package which-key :ensure t :delight which-key-mode :commands (which-key-mode which-key-setup-minibuffer) :custom (which-key-idle-delay 0.3) (which-key-prefix-prefix &quot;◉ &quot;) (which-key-sort-order &#x27;which-key-key-order-alpha) (which-key-min-display-lines 3) (which-key-max-display-columns nil) :config (which-key-mode) (which-key-setup-minibuffer)) 
 However, which-key-mode is not triggering when emacs starts up. If I navigate to the (which-key-mode) line and C-x C-e, it will activate. This appears to be the only package I&#x27;m having this issue with.
 Is there maybe a known list of packages that this one conflicts with?
 Edit: It seems that removing the :commands line fixes this (but results in &quot;function X might not be defined&quot; squiggles for both of the :config commands).

                              <span>I am wrecking my brain over the following:
 (fmap . fmap) sum Just [1, 2, 3] yields Just 6
 But why? a composed fmap, in my understanding, is to &quot;jump&quot; (so to speak) over the structure of 2 functors, in this case Maybe and [] functors. So why is this not an error? Isn&#x27;t this supposed to run sum on the values of the list?
 I would expect:
 fmap sum (Just [1,2,3]) to yield Just 6, and indeed it does (with paranthesis).
 What am I missing here?
 Thanks in advance!
 Edit:
 Even if I follow the types, I get:
 (fmap . fmap) sum :: (Functor f1, Functor f2, Foldable t, Num b) &#x3D;&gt; f1 (f2 (t b)) -&gt; f1 (f2 b)
 where f1 &#x3D; Maybe, f2 &#x3D; [], t &#x3D; [], and Num let&#x27;s say is an Int, so:
 (fmap . fmap) sum :: Maybe [[Int]] -&gt; Maybe [Int]

                              <span>Hi everybody,
 I would like to know if there is a way to have an org-agenda view for today presented in a time-grid view where I can see my notes, state changes, clocks and all the things from logbook?
 The idea is to visualize in a single time-grid view for a day all the logbook related things from my TODOs. So in exactly the same way as the SCHEDULED items are shown on a time grid now, I would like to see notes, clocks, state changes etc for all TODOs.
 If such a view is not possible, I would like to implement it. Is there any advice you can give, or a suggestion, on how I could manipulate the time grid view to display data I parsed from logbooks? I could format it while parsing in any way it is needed but the display of information on the time-grid I am not familiar with.

                              <span>i&#x27;m basically writing down a list of various stuff, and it&#x27;s organized like this:
  - total [/] - first category [/] - game one [/] - expansion one [/] - [ ] foo - [ ] bar - expansion two - second season - [ ] foo - [ ] bar - [ ] biz - second category [/] - game two [/] etc...  
 as you can see it&#x27;s subtree shenanigas; now, I tried to re-do the file from scratch, and checking for syntax errors, but everytime i try to C-c C-c the 40th counting box I get this error (with backtrace) 
  Debugger entered--Lisp error: (wrong-type-argument integer-or-marker-p nil) org-update-checkbox-count() org-update-statistics-cookies(nil) funcall-interactively(org-update-statistics-cookies nil) call-interactively(org-update-statistics-cookies) org-ctrl-c-ctrl-c(nil) funcall-interactively(org-ctrl-c-ctrl-c nil) call-interactively(org-ctrl-c-ctrl-c nil nil) command-execute(org-ctrl-c-ctrl-c)  
 i tried on Org version 9.6.24, emacs 29.3 and 30, but I always get stuck at the 39th, the 40th throws that error.
 any idea on what i&#x27;m doing wrong? I can share the file if that help, it&#x27;s just a collection of RPGs and Tabletop games that i want to collect, it&#x27;s nothing too personal, but i would rather get what exactly i&#x27;m doing wrong.
 also, I have this at the top of my file: 
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 +begin_src emacs-lisp
 (define-key org-mode-map (kbd &quot;M-RET&quot;) &#x27;org-insert-todo-heading) (setq org-checkbox-hierarchical-statistics nil)
 +end_src
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; 
 I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s relevant, but it&#x27;s worth mentioning.
 thank you all for your help!

                              <span>In recent years, many ideas from Haskell, mainly those rooted in category theory, have found their way into Scala and become well-established in parts of the community.
 Coincidentally or not, many Scala developers have started to migrate to Kotlin, whose community takes a more pragmatic approach to programming and is less inclined towards category theory.
 Haskell is quite open about its goals, with the slogan “avoid success at all costs.” This philosophy allows them to experiment and conduct language research without chasing mainstream success. I&#x27;m curious about the Scala community&#x27;s vision for Scala&#x27;s success.
 While Haskell is extremely aware and open about its goal of not chasing success, how aware is the part of the Scala community that promotes Haskell&#x27;s ideas?

 Can someone help me, I want to implement the createNewUser function. If the error already exists, it will return an AlreadyExistsError. If it doesn&#x27;t it will insert the user in the database and return the UUID.
 Edit: Used generic F instead of IO

                              <span>This week marks the release of the 10 year anniversary edition website overhaul 
We&#x27;ve changed the landing page to better guide new readers into the topic, and we overhauled the blog to provide a table of contents that helps with orienting and navigating in longer documents.
One caveat, though:  the table of contents navigation doesn&#x27;t yet work on mobile. I think a sidebar/temporary toggle would be best on constrained devices, but that requires more JavaScript, so let&#x27;s not be too hasty 
Hope you enjoy it!</span>

&quot;Hidden Preferences&quot;. 
Oh, and while I am at it, for some reason I can now also not find the setting for the new file ID in The Archive! I set it to be YYYYmmDDHHMM and vividly remember how I removed the seconds, but now fail to figure out where that setting is! 😅 In other words, I am lost in the settings - which are not many - so feels like I am lost in a forest of three pines 😄
Thanks in advance to anyone kind to respond!</span>

                              <span>I am currently using a custom-built emacs (29.1) on my Ubuntu 22.04 system. I decided just now to try the Homebrew version, to see if there were any config issues or anything. There aren&#x27;t, but it seems to be limited to terminal-only. I can&#x27;t seem to get it to run a GUI.
 Is there a way to get this through Homebrew? I&#x27;d like to keep emacs (relatively) up-to-date, but don&#x27;t have the bandwidth to rebuild it regularly.

                              <span>Dear members of the church of emacs, 
 I have a fairly good laptop setup (rtx 4070,i9, 32 gigs) and have been ok with using windows (this is only OS i have ever really used). Recently, I realized that I really just use my laptop for 5 main things: VS Code (mostly for simulations), Browsing, Latex, Obsidian notes, and file explorer (or on the rare ocassions, some MS office software). And I have been really thinking, if it would be possible to maximize my comfort and efficieincy if I could find a way to manuever between these seemesly, at first I thought about downloading Linux (Gentoo/arch/nix) but since I have 0 experience with it, I am unsure if it would just end up making my life harder instead of easier. 
 Then I heard from a friend that I could just use EMACS to combine all of these things and get it pretty close to an OS. I have zero experience with emacs and wanted to ask if it could be the key for this seamless vision I had?
 Thnx !

I thought lsp-ui would render flymake obsolete but it appears that it is necessary for documentation-on-hover.
 What is needed to detect the error in the while statement (raed)?
 I&#x27;m getting auto-completion inside *.el files even though no corresponding mode has been selected inside lsp&#x27;s configuration (unlike sh): where does it come from?

                              <span>[SOLVED]
 I just built the latest Emacs on Ubuntu 22.04:
 GNU Emacs 29.3 (build 1, x86_64-pc-linux-gnu, GTK+ Version 3.24.33, cairo version 1.16.0) of 2024-06-20 
 It starts with a 10-point font no matter what I do. I&#x27;m using the same config that works fine on older versions of Emacs and always starts with a larger font. If I use &gt; Options &gt; Set Default Font, I can select a font that works for *that session only*. If I click on &gt; Options &gt; Save Options, it adds this to my .emacs:
 (custom-set-faces ;; custom-set-faces was added by Custom. ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful. ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance. ;; If there is more than one, they won&#x27;t work right. &#x27;(default ((t (:family &quot;Ubuntu Mono&quot; :foundry &quot;DAMA&quot; :slant normal :weight regular :height 143 :width normal))))) 
 Upon reopening Emacs, the font is back to 10 point. This basically makes Emacs 29 unusable.

                              <span>Hey. I wondered how, or if, you guys setup your editor indentation, comment and general source code formatting rules, on a per-project basis, and how well that works with projects using external source formatter configurations?
 For instance, if working on a C/C++/Python project using clang-format, ruff, gnu-indent, or uncrustify to format its source, how do you tell your Emacs to use the same rules according to their settings? Also, how do you keep this on a per-project basis (.dir-locals or similar) ?
 Any advice or anecdotes are welcome :-)

 do you have a dockerfile what can compile emacs on debian:stable and make a deb package ?
 Please share with me :)
 thanks in advance!

                              <span>What are the best practices to keep your emacs environment in sync across multiple devices? I&#x27;ve always used SyncThing to sync what emacs considers my HOME folder between devices, but I&#x27;ve encountered some problems below with my ELPA folder where packages are installed (&quot;~/.emacs.d/elpa&quot;).
 Specifically I noticed that when I upgraded emacs from version 28 to 29 on one machine and then upgraded some packages like pdf-tools and org-mode on that machine, those packages (which SyncThing synced to my other devices) no longer worked on the machines still running emacs 28 because emacs 29 has some new functions that those two packages use, like defvar-1.
 So should I have different ELPA folders for different versions of emacs, e.g., by putting a line in my init.el like (setq package-user-dir (concat &quot;~/.emacs.d/elpa-&quot; emacs-version))?
 Thanks!

 But I still want to use them. I guess I could add a (load-file &quot;path/to/file&quot;) to my init, but that feels a little odd for some reason.
 What do y&#x27;all do?

                              <span>Is there some way to get Emacs to show the JavaDoc (or other language equivalent) in a popup for the function at point?
 I like the idea and expressiveness of such documentation, but I am never going to run my code through a doc formatter like Doxygen, but it would be helpful if Emacs could make use of it.
 Eldoc shows my function and the parameter names, but none of the available docs for each parameter.

                              <span>I didn’t find any solution in documentation. I have all my tables in a specific schema say abc. By default beam or any other database library works with public schema. How to set the schema in beam? It would also work if I can set the schema at Postgres-simple level…maybe while creating the connection. I looked around for other languages, there are some solutions that says you can pass in key&#x3D;value parameter in the connection string with your current schema&#x3D; . I didn’t try it because there is no mention of it jn postgres documentation.

 We aim to focus a lot on real world aspects of Haskell, specifically on web applications.

 I&#x27;m using Jaxson Van Dorn&#x27;s invoice template from here: https://github.com/woofers/org-invoice-template
 As you can see, the sub-totals for each day are correct, but those subtotals, for some reason I can&#x27;t figure out, aren&#x27;t being summed together to arrive at the correct total for the invoice.
 I have scrutinised the formula, but I&#x27;m rather new to org table formulas and find the cell references alone difficult to follow, so I can&#x27;t spot what&#x27;s amiss. Can someone identify what&#x27;s going wrong?

                              <span>This might be kind of an obscure question, but here goes anyway:
 The LaTeX memoir document class has a nice feature to add breaks within a chapter, called \pfbreak (plain/fancy break). What it does is add a couple of lines between paragraphs, when the break is in the middle of the page, and adds 3 asterisks to the top or bottom of the page, when the break is between pages.
 In a regular LaTeX document, I can get it to work fine, but in Org Mode, I&#x27;m struggling. The break in the middle of the page works, but if the break is between pages, I don&#x27;t get the 3 asterisks.
 I figured all I would have to do is add #+LaTeX_HEADER: \documentclass{memoir} to the in-buffer settings, and then use $\pfbreak$ when I wanted to add a break, which seems to be somewhat right, since it works in the middle of a page. Just not the end.
 Any way I can track down what I&#x27;m missing, or if this will even work in Org Mode?

I&#x27;ve honestly avoided writing this post because I don&#x27;t think I am accurately conveying the issues I&#x27;m having but I do really want feedback from you all - Here are some things I&#x27;m struggling with.
So first of all, I notice that I&#x27;m really stuck in my ways and often seem to write essays rather than notes. In order to avoid stressing about a note being atomic, I try to allow my notes to build up until they naturally can be broken down. However, by then, I feel like the statements are too intertwined and codependent and then I struggle to break things down. This is mainly referring to things I write about from background knowledge but happens with referenced things too.
I really want to know how other people structure arguments, claims they don&#x27;t believe, and things they don&#x27;t…</span>

                              <span>One of the key features of Nickel is the merge system, which is a clever way of combining records, and allows defining complex configurations in a modular way.
This system is inspired by (amongst others) the NixOS module system, which are the magic bits that tie together NixOS configurations and gives NixOS its insane flexibility.
Nickel merging and NixOS modules work slightly differently under the hood, and target slightly different use-cases:
Nickel merge is designed to combine several pieces of configurations which all respect the same contract. This allows an application developer to define the interface of its configuration, and have the user write it in a modular way.
NixOS modules, on the other hand, are designed to combine pieces which not only define a part of the final configurat…</span>

                              <span>Hi all,
 Coming to vim, I would typically navigate my file system through basic shell commands like cd and would then edit the files with vim filename.txt.
 With emacs, instead of using dired to open files, is there a way I could directly open them using vterm?

                              <span>One common concern with emacs&#x27;s included terminal modes is that they used to run on interpreted elisp code that&#x27;s the reason alternatives such as vterm outperform it. But now that there&#x27;s native compilation I cannot help but wonder if there&#x27;s really that much of a difference

 I&#x27;m using the scheme layer in spacemacs. Here is my config
 scheme-implementations &#x27;(mit) geiser-mit-binary &quot;/path/to/mit-scheme&quot; geiser-default-implementation &#x27;mit 
 The person who closest ran into this issue I could find it seems like this person:
 https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/nnuapw/geiser_not_sending_correct_code_to_chicken_repl/
 They were using chicken scheme and it seems like some chicken scheme command fixed it.
 The closest analog I can think of with mit-scheme is there is a Setup.sh script to run (which I haven&#x27;t), though it seems this requires an already working mit-scheme compiler 😵‍💫
 I am able to run code fine in the geiser REPL 👍

                              <span>I want to create a (mode? package?) that behaves like a tui. The content should be read-only, but on key press I want to fetch data from a server, generate a collapsible/expandable tree from the result, be able to navigate the items and trigger further actions on the focussed items by more keypresses.
 I&#x27;m new to elisp, but data fetching, parsing etc. is not what gives me a headache - I&#x27;m familiar enough with Clojure to have a grap of lisps and willing to learn the language &quot;enough&quot;.
 The great unknown for me are the emacs internals on how to actually build the ui. Are there any introductions, tutorials or simple examples I can use to learn from? I could start with magit, which does all what I&#x27;d like incredibly well, but I feel like that&#x27;s a little over my head ;)
 Of course, best practices for fetching and parsing JSON are appreciated, too.

                              <span>Let&#x27;s say I want to write a function that returns an IO[Int] that might have a NOT_FOUND or DUPLICATE error. What would be the best way to write this function?
 Any blogs or videos that discuss about this topic? I&#x27;m confused onwhat the best practice in scala is. I hate java style exceptions and prefer error as values.
 If you can give me an example method or repo for doing this that would be nice.
 Edit: I&#x27;m not trying to make an app. I want to know what the usual way in scala is so that I can read scala codebases

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m new to scala and I am using vscode with Metals to code. However, when I create a project and import the build following the tip of Metals , Metals will be stuck on indexing even longer than 20min. It also cant navigate to the source of lib.
 Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. THX !

                              <span>I want to use Haskell for back-end (paired with Elm for front-end), but I&#x27;m not sure about committing to it for two reasons:
  
Haskell&#x27;s compiler error messages are confusing and feel unhelpful to me. I&#x27;ve been spoiled by Elm and Rust, and languages like Gleam seem to incorporate a similar style of compiler messaging I appreciate.
 I&#x27;ve heard that Haskell is difficult to maintain in the long run. When it comes to packages in my experience, cabal feels a bit less organized in comparison to package systems like Elm&#x27;s or Crate for Rust.
  
Are there solutions that could make Haskell a winning choice for a language in these aspects, or would I be better to go with something else?
 (As a side note, I admire the direction of Richard Feldman&#x27;s language Roc, but as it is still a developing language, I would not be keen to invest in that too much at the moment. If you think it&#x27;s worth it, maybe let me know.)

                              <span>So this is a little bit strange, but I cannot see any reason why this shouldn&#x27;t be possible, using various low-level GHC runtime functions etc.
 I want a function that looks like this:
 writeExecutable :: FilePath -&gt; IO () -&gt; IO () 
 Calling writeExecutable fpath action on a Linux machine should create a Linux executable file at fpath that, when run, runs action as if it were main of that executable.
 To be a bit more specific regarding pre-existing state, I want
 writeExecutable fpath action args &lt;- System.Environment.getArgs System.Posix.Process.executeFile fpath args Nothing 
 and
 action System.Exit.exitSuccess 
 to be essentially equivalent, modulo the created file of course. (Bear in mind executeFile is UNIX exec, which does not create a new process but replaces the current process with new code).
 Why do I want writeExecutable? Because I wrote an interpreter and I want to turn it into a compiler for free.
 Does anyone know of any work that&#x27;s been done in this area (even in another language)?
 (also asked on SO)

                              <span>Is there a configuration to force the Ediff window to pop next to the main window instead of on top of it?
 The default position is inconvenient since the Ediff window will be covered if I click on the main window. I&#x27;m always having to move it aside so I can go back to keep looking at the diffs.

                              <span>One day, I tried to reflect on why I don&#x27;t really like EasyMotion-like packages (Avy, Ace-Jump, etc.). It was because they feel too intrusive to my flow - I want to go to a place almost mechanically, without thinking like, &quot;So I need to go to this &#x27;f&#x27; symbol, I should type &#x27;f&#x27;, then wait, read, and type the next symbols one after another&quot; 
 So, I tried to create a package that works the opposite way—you always go to the same place with the same keybindings. E.g., if you type M-s f u p, then you will always be in the top right corner.
 It might be slower at the start, but probably more mechanical, faster, and freeing your head in the end. 
 I wrote an example package and a training game, only to find out later that there exists the package I wanted, but which does it on a system level :) And it is https://github.com/rvaiya/warpd/

 But still want to share my training game - maybe it would be useful :) https://github.com/haukot/dead-eye-jump

                              <span>Hey!
 At work we use 2 indentation styles:
 void shortFunction(int arg1, int arg2, // ..., int argN, int argM) { // ... } void SomeClass::AndAnotherInnerScope::veryLongFunctionNameJustForFun( SomeOtherVeryLongTypeName arg1, int arg2, std::string arg3, ) { // ... } 
 Default tree-sitter indent rules can&#x27;t cope with that. They weally want to align all arguments to an opening brace, turning second function declaration into a mess.
 I have written my own indentation rule, maybe ugly, but it get the job done.
 It tries to indent first argument by 4 spaces if it is on its own line, and doesn&#x27;t move it at all otherwise, and everything else is aligned to it.
 (defun lazy/smart-indent (node parent bol &amp;rest _) (let ((first-real-child (treesit-node-child parent 1))) (if (or (not node) (treesit-node-eq node first-real-child)) (save-excursion (goto-char (treesit-node-start parent)) (back-to-indentation) (+ (point) 4)) (treesit-node-start first-real-child)))) 
 Then I had to create my own c-ts indentation style where I changed 2 rules: for argument lists and parameter lists to this:
 ((parent-is &quot;argument_list&quot;) lazy/smart-indent 0) ((parent-is &quot;parameter_list&quot;) lazy/smart-indent 0) 
 I don&#x27;t know a good way to do it other than copy existingy styles and patch in place.
 Hope it helps someone.

                              <span>I like vc as a lightweight alternative to magit. The problem is like this: I just commit all my changes to git, but I found a mistake in the message. I want to modify the log message, but the function vc-git-log-edit-toggle-amend seems to work only in the log-edit-mode buffer, which I don&#x27;t know how to invoke without committing changes. 
 Does anybody know a solution to this issue? Thanks.

                              <span>Hi, everyone!
 I&#x27;m relatively new to Emacs, I&#x27;ve watched a few SystemCrafters videos, flipped through the documentation and tutorials. I&#x27;ve started writing my config, but it still looks far from what I want it to look like...
 So I&#x27;m here with a question: where can I find more variety of good cofigs for inspiration (and possibly for use)? The usual search on the net and on github gives mostly very outdated builds(
 For the context, I&#x27;ve been on Arch Linux for two years now, I&#x27;m switching to emacs from obidian, and I want to fit most of my activities into emacs: PKM (org-roam), Task manager, programming (C, Python, JS), etc

 Has anyone experienced this bug with poly-org and org-mode 9.7? 
 https://github.com/polymode/poly-org/issues/49
 I see the issue when the buffer glitches from top to bottom, with the cursor moving line by line too fast. It&#x27;s basically unworkable at this state. 
 My solution is to stay in 9.6 until there is a permanent solution for it. 
 Best.

 Could someone please explain why it makes sense that m needs to be a type constructor that takes one type argument, so of kind * -&gt; *? Why wouldn&#x27;t it make sense to have Monads where m is of kind *?

                              <span>Hey, ive worked a lot with haskell. A friend teached me everything. What i didnt know: He manaager everything in the background, from giving me packages to using stack. So im sitting here without any knowledge about that. I only know the Syntax.
 Is there a way to gather all the knowledge in one course?

                              <span>MLabs is a leading Haskell consultancy, primarily building in the Cardano space. We rely heavily on QuickCheck to ensure our applications are robust and reliable. However, we have noticed that many developers overlook the added security and peace of mind that effective property testing can bring.
 Our latest article explores how we use QuickCheck while sharing some insights and best practices. Have a read and let us know what you think.

                              <span>Ik that raylib, glsl, sdl, Cairo exist but idk which of these is the best library. Some libraries will be buggy and some libraries are not a good fit in some situations. I also want a library that is simple but I don&#x27;t mind losing some simplicity for power(performance, capability etc). I want to make Conway&#x27;s game of life like automata based artwork. Where entities interact with each other and through emergence create complex structures, groupings and behavioral patterns. Based on my needs can someone point to me the best library, tool etc

 I can&#x27;t instantiate it with new MonadErrorExample[F](xa) I&#x27;m getting the error below

 I can&#x27;t seem to figure out how to use MonadError here. Im new to scala and dont understand the syntax that well.
 Edit:
 I tried doing this
 class LiveVendors[F[_]] private ( xa: Transactor[F] )(implicit ME: MonadError[F, String]) 
 But Im getting No given instance of type cats.MonadError[F, String] was found for parameter ME of constructor LiveVendors in class LiveVendors in the apply method

 This post is not specific to Scala but I like this community so I ask it here.
 What do you think makes more sense for testing API status code and messages returned to the client? Unit testing (and mocking your services)?
 Or Integration testing to test with the real system?
 Thanks!

 I&#x27;m an experienced Scala dev currently working through a consultancy for US clients. Lately I&#x27;ve been looking around for Scala jobs in LinkedIn and stuff, but it seems like all dev jobs are either US or Europe based.
 Does anyone have any tips for the job search taking that into account? As an aside, I&#x27;d rather not relocate right now, but I&#x27;m open to it in the future.

                              <span>I should just use old pinned stack resolver versions but I have a small compulsion to update the resolver versions of my many little projects to the latest LTS version.
 life is so much easier if I add allow-newer:true in each project’s stack.yaml file.
 It seems a little sloppy doing this, but are there specific reasons why this is a bad idea?
 thanks in advance for any advice.

 I&#x27;m not a programmer, am a writer looking to switch his primary digital writing process from Obsidian to Emacs, specifically Org Mode and Org Roam. I&#x27;ve been looking at a lot of intro guides and have done most of the in-built Emacs tutorial. I will keep on learning Emacs itself and the key commands and such as I go on, but today I wanted to get started actually using it (haven&#x27;t really worked the last few days as I spent time just reading about whether Emacs is worth it, then started to dip my toes into the water). Honestly I just wanted to make an org file to list the three dozen odd tabs I have open for various Emacs resources. N…</span>

Since most of the time I&#x27;m on very large monitors, I have the base font size set to be readable there, though sometimes I&#x27;m on the laptop and need it to scale down a little bit.
 I&#x27;ve done some searching for solutions but seems like the only ones I&#x27;ve come up with are from EmacsWiki (zoom-frm.el). This is fine, but also seems like it requires a lot of additional packages, also from EmacsWiki. 
 Anyone ever tried these solutions? I can go searching through EmacsWiki for all the dependencies and download them if I need to, but the Git repo is absolutely gigantic to try to get small amounts of packages so a bit of a pain. But if they&#x27;re the miracle cure, I&#x27;ll do what it takes.
 Also open to other packages that do the job. Just would like to control the text when the laptop is hooked up to dock with big monitors, and when it&#x27;s just a laptop.

I wanted to try and give emacs a go because I&#x27;ve heard good things about it. However, I&#x27;m a bit confused on how to get started with it. Anyone have any resources they recommend to get started? Thanks. Also, i&#x27;m wanting to learn C and use emacs as my IDE, I&#x27;m on MacOs. I previously learned javascript for around 8 months.

                              <span>The following settings help me compile my LaTeX documents via C-c C-c, and synctex works quite well with Skim on MacOS, with one exception. The LaTeX document compiles fine only when compiling from the root directory.
 Typically I have a main file acting as the &quot;scaffolding&quot; that imports various chapters/sections in separate files.
 main.tex └── sections ├── chapter-1.tex └── chapter-2.tex 
 Everything works as expected only if I compile from a buffer open with main.tex, but not with any of the chapter files in the sections directory.
  (use-package latex-mode :init (setq TeX-view-program-selection &#x27;((output-pdf &quot;PDF Viewer&quot;)) TeX-view-program-list &#x60;((&quot;PDF Viewer&quot; ,(concat &quot;/Applications/Skim.app&quot; &quot;/Contents&quot; &quot;/SharedSupport/displayline&quot; &quot; -b -g %n %o %b&quot;)))) :hook (LaTeX-mode . auto-fill-mode) (LaTeX-mode . variable-pitch-mode) (LaTeX-mode . tex-source-correlate-mode) (LaTeX-mode . reftex-mode) (LaTeX-mode . visual-line-mode) (LaTeX-mode . (lambda () (local-set-key (kbd &quot;&quot;) #&#x27;TeX-view) (setq font-lock-maximum-decoration t line-spacing 3 fill-column 80 TeX-command-default &quot;LaTeX Make&quot;))) :mode &quot;\\.tex\\&#x27;&quot;) 
 In main.tex, I have the following at the end of the document.
  %%% Local Variables: %%% mode: latex %%% TeX-master: t %%% End: 
 And in all other TeX files, I have the following.
  %%% Local Variables: %%% mode: latex %%% TeX-master: &quot;../paper&quot; %%% End:

                              <span>I&#x27;m running pretty recent Emacs 29.3 PGTK build, with Org 9.7.4 and pdf-tools 1.1.0
 When exporting an org file as PDF with preview, Emacs creates a new window showing the PDF correctly but also switches the current org-mode buffer to show the same PDF file, as show in this screencast recording.
 It also seems to create a new frame showing the PDF if current frame is &quot;too small&quot;, which is not an issue for me.
 What annoys me is something switches the org-mode buffer to the PDF viewing buffer.
 I do not have &#x60;display-buffer-alist&#x60; rules regarding pdf-tools buffers.
 Have any of you seen this before?

                              <span>Hello Emacs Community!,
 I heavily use org-mode src blocks, normally with the ob-shell extension (sh, bash...), I previously worked in a MacOS system where the installation is a little complex, but can be done. Now, I recently got the opportunity to change systems so, I did.
 In a new Debian 12 installation, I have my Emacs installation and, when testing Src code blocks with *:async*, I noticed that my Emacs was still being blocked. This is a fresh installation.
 What I did:
 Run a src code block from the documentation that worked on the MacOS system, but didn&#x27;t in the Debian. Async should put an ID and then replace it:
  
+begin_src bash :session execute-asynchronously :async yes
 echo &quot;Execute session blocks in the background&quot;
 sleep 20
 echo &quot;Using the :async header&quot;
 +end_src
  
What happened:
  
In MacOS, an ID is put in the results, Emacs doesn&#x27;t get worked and after the 20 seconds I get the result. Works perfectly.
 
In Debian, Emacs gets blocked, with the message &#x27;Executing Bash code block at position 480&#x27;.
 
 Things I&#x27;ve tried:
  
Emacs -Q for a minimal example, same issue.
 
Searched for the ob-async github, nothing related and, no &#x27;requirements&#x27; I may have missed, or packages.
 
Searched the web for answers, apparently, this is not an issue that I can find logs about, and given that I am in a new installation, I&#x27;m at a loss at what else to check... 
 
 At this point, I&#x27;m not sure what do debug, since usage of src code blocks is a must and, the support of Emacs in Linux should be better as I understand, for example, I don&#x27;t have issues with gpg in Debian, while I couldn&#x27;t configure it on MacOS.
 Thanks!

                              <span>emacs master branch has an updated file that I&#x27;d like to use rather than the version included with emacs 29.1. Preferably, I would use a URL pointing to the raw file on github, but could cope with a file downloaded to local storage.
 I really want to use this file as a drop-in replacement for use with use-package.
 Update: I&#x27;ve discovered :load-path so that answers the local-storage part

The servers were upgraded and some trivial maintenance needed to be done (bump the PHP version by +0.1). At least it would&#x27;ve been trivial if there had been any advance notification   While my mood is soured a bit by the experience, nothing was lost, merely inaccessible for a while, so that&#x27;s good news.</span>

                              <span>Hey guys, 
 I have ADHD and it is a struggle to clean up my tasks or rather doing them, I mean I love how I can capture any idea and any to-do for a given project, but doing them ... that is a whole other story. 
 I recently read about how gamification can help people with instant feedback problems, to better work if their tasks are gamified. So my question is, is there a way in emacs, to implement like a point system for tasks, like when im capturing a to-do, give it an value or link the prio of the task to points and at the end of the month, get like a highscore or somehting?
 I was just wondering, if anyone did something like this and can help someone out who is really in need of something like this :D
 Thank you all, and a happy day to you all!

                              <span>As in the title i have been offered two different roles. This would be my first job after a bootcamp. 
 One is in Scala, it provides a high level of training and supervision and you work with big clients but my fear is whether Scala is future proof as someone beginning their career. 
 The other is in C# in a very small company. I hope the training will be good but there will only be 4 of us so we&#x27;ll have to see. 
 currently living in the UK but planning on moving to the USA in a year or so?

                              <span>Just wanted to see if anyone here could help me brainstorm a setup using org roam dailies to track my phyisical fitness / lifting goals. I&#x27;d like to use org roam dailies to track my body weight, some measurements, my workout lifts, and possibly progress photos sporadically as well. Org roam dailies stores information in a one-file-per-day system where each file is named after the date. I&#x27;m comfortable with the templating required to make information entry quick and easy in this system, and have already been tracking all of this on pen and paper for over a year. Organizing and inputting this information is something I&#x27;ve already figured out for myself. I can get somewhat close-ish to the functionality I&#x27;m looking for with org-ql, but can&#x27;t quite get the feedback I&#x27;d like displayed the way I want. Ideally, I&#x27;d like to be able to make line charts of certain tagged entries in the daily file and plot them over time. Certain things will not be in every single entry. I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a way to accomplish this, I have not found the right plugin yet.
 Has anyone here ever used emacs to analyze information this way?

                              <span>I am trying to define a custom coding system for PETSCII, that currently uses a custom font with the appropriate symbols in a Unicode Private Use Block #xE000-#xE100. Eventually I&#x27;ll switch to the Symbols for Legacy Computing block, but for now...
 Finding useful documentation (or even code samples) for creating coding systems has been difficult - any pointers greatly appreciated. At present, the code below 1) decodes the PETSCII properly, but only 7-bits. Characters &gt;#x7F do not get translated. 2) Does not encode properly at all. Everything below #x7F gets translated to #x20 on writing.
 I&#x27;m being overly-explicit with some of this code, so excuse the verbosity. I did not include the entirety of &#x27;petscii-unicode-map&#x27; here for brevity, but it&#x27;s just a one-to-one mapping (and I&#x27;m hard-coding un-printable symbols ATM):
 (defvar petscii-unicode-map &#x27;((#x0 . #xE41D) (#x1 . #xE41D) (#x2 . #xE41D) (#x3 . #xE41D) [...] (#x3C . #xE03C) (#x3D . #xE03D) (#x3E . #xE03E) (#x3F . #xE03F) (#x40 . #xE000) (#x41 . #xE001) (#x42 . #xE002) (#x43 . #xE003) [...] (#xFC . #xE07C) (#xFD . #xE07D) (#xFE . #xE07E) (#xFF . #xE07F))) 
 Then I define a charset (which seems to work), an encode and decode translation-table, then the coding-system itself.
 (define-charset &#x27;petscii-standard &quot;PETSCII coding&quot; :dimension 1 :code-space [0 255] :map (seq-into (flatten-list petscii-unicode-map) &#x27;vector)) (defvar petscii-decode-table (make-translation-table petscii-unicode-map)) (defvar petscii-encode-table (make-translation-table (mapcar (lambda (v) (cons (cdr v) (car v))) petscii-unicode-map))) (define-coding-system &#x27;standard-petscii &quot;PETSCII coding system&quot; :mnemonic ?P :coding-type &#x27;charset :eol-type &#x27;mac :ascii-compatible-p nil :charset-list &#x27;petscii-standard :decode-translation-table petscii-decode-table :encode-translation-table petscii-encode-table) 
 Any help is greatly appreciated. I&#x27;ve dug through mule-conf.el and a few other bits of existing elisp, to no avail.

                              <span>I posted a week or so ago about a problem with consult-register-load. I get this error when using consult-register-load or consult-register-save. Both of these functions work but they do not display the little mini buffer info with the preview and the optional do what you mean stuff that makes consult-register so great.
 Error running timer: (void-function nil) register-read-with-preview-traditional: Non-character input-event 
 This morning I took another swing at working on tracking down this bug. I put together a basic init.el file and ran emacs with -q -l test.el. Then I used M-x package-install-file. Directed it to the consult folder my regular emacs init file uses and found that consult-register-load works flawlessly. So I can eliminate the possibility that this was a bug in consult conflicting with the fact that I&#x27;m running emacs 30 or that emacs 30 it self had an issue.
 On the emacs wiki page about timers this line jumped out at me. Seems clear that it is the heart of my problem but I don&#x27;t know what to do to try and isolate or resolve it.
  
This predicate function returns non-nil if object is a timer.
  
I don&#x27;t know enough elisp to understand what that means. I&#x27;m also confused by what is going on in consult-register.el. Without a deeper understanding of what the offending functions in consult-register.el are doing. I don&#x27;t know how to proceed. Could someone explain it for me? Any tips on debugging this? Any and all suggestions welcome.
 Full emacs config.

                              <span>This question is just to satisfy my curiosity. Looking in the site-start.d I notice that asy-mode.el is loaded at the start of the load process. As I understand it, this mode is for the editing of asymptote vector graphics files (something I never do) and so I was wondering why it is autoloaded so soon? Does anyone know? Is it required by another crucial package?

                              <span>I&#x27;d like to announce a new release of csound-expression on hackage. The CE is a music framework for haskell with focus on ease of use and feature rich as it rides on top of the powerful audio programming language Csound. It is a DSL to build Csound programs. So the library embeds Csound in Haskell. 
 It&#x27;s a bug fix release. Many algorithms in the low-level renderer csound-expression-dynamic were rewritten and fixed. In the previous version unforunately there were severe bugs in effectful expressions and in if-then-else blocks. But now they are fixed. 
 Also I&#x27;ve updated the library to include new Csound opcodes (audio processing units from 6.18 version).
 Happy music making with Haskell!
 About the future of the csound-expression:
 I&#x27;ve started the implementation of more tiny csound-core package. It offers a missing layer of low-level building of type-safe Csound expressions. In the previous version I&#x27;ve created lots of abstractions to make music making more pleasant for FP style. But this layering makes it kind of hard to debug rendered code. So I&#x27;d like to create a tiny imperative style core that will allow me to debug produced Csound code. And the rest of the code should be expressed in terms of this library. I&#x27;m not there yet. I&#x27;ve built the core library and it turned out very well. But now I need to rewrite FP abstractions on top of it. I&#x27;m not there yet. But I hope that gradually I will make it. 
 Also I plan to deprecate GUI features as FLTK was deprecated in Csound and it&#x27;s not packaged with Csound anymore. I think maybe it would be better to substitute them with JS+OSC.

                              <span>Does anyone else have this issue? If the cursor is on the far right side of a line which is folded you can&#x27;t move it to the left. It just says &#x27;beginning of line&#x27; at the bottom. 
 I&#x27;m using evil mode and it works when I&#x27;m in insert mode, but not in normal mode. So, maybe it&#x27;s related to evil? I tried to figure it out using chatGPT, but I couldn&#x27;t find a simple answer.
