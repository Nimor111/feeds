                    <span>Not strictly a Zettelkasten, but almost. I was ready &quot;How to write mathematics&quot; by P. R. Halmos. and on page 134, he discusses how he organizes a book or long article:

  
At one stage of writing a 300-page book I had 1000 sheets of paper, each with a mathematical statement on it, a theorem, a lemma, or even a minor comment, complete with proof. The sheets were numbered, any which way. My job was to indicate on each sheet the numbers of the sheets whose statement must logically come before, and then to arrange the sheets in linear order so that no sheet comes after one on which it&#x27;s mentioned.


Emphasis mine.
It is of course not quite a Zettelkasten, since the numbers are only used to describe predecessors, but I think it is still interesting to look at these examples of almost-Zettelkasten. I think it gives credibility to the Zettelkasten technique that it is not really something entirely new, but that the elements can be recognized elsewhere.</span>

                    <span>I recently installed emacs and doom emacs on top of it. And its cool and all but i have one question. When ever i launch emacs why is it that the vanilla emacs first starts and then the doom emacs screen comes up? Is that normal? Like when i launch emacs first theres like the normal emacs you get without doom and then like 5 seconds later doom emacs launches.

                    <span>Is it possible to configure whitespace-mode to display only leading whitespace? When displaying whitespace, I find that the space indicators in between words is a bit too much and makes it harder to read, but I really like the idea of just seeing leading whitespace to check indentation etc.
 I&#x27;ve played around with the whitespace-style customization option a fair bit, but haven&#x27;t managed to do what I want. 
 Thanks!

                    <span>The problem occurs with the pcase-let binding in the function below. In the original source buffer it fails to bind and the variables are nil. I copied over the function into another buffer, re-evaluated, and it works. I can only guess it has something to do with the back-quote but I have no idea. Anyone know?

                    <span>For example, I would always like to start firefox in char mode by default, while the other applications in line mode, what can I do?
 Do I need to add a hook to everytime when exwm is opening a new buffer and compare the buffer name with regex? Or is there a default way to do such a thing? I have read the exwm wiki but found no useful guidelines.

                    <span>I apologize if this is a trivial question, but I know very little about web-development, javascript, node.js, etc. 
 Is there anyway I can set up the ox-reveal package so I can open the html file on the browser once and it&#x27;s updated every time I change and save the .org file?
 Thanks.

                    <span>I started getting the titled message from a few days ago every time I clock out a task. I did not make any changes to my config lately, but I did pulled the org repo. (i&#x27;m using straight.el) 
 It seems to me the error is from the org-clock-remove-empty-clock-drawer function within the org-clock-out-hook. 
 And removing the function from the hook does fix the issue immediately. 
 It seems the hook is being executed when the current buffer is the Org Note buffer instead of the org buffer. 
 is anyone else getting this? 
 I was able to reproduce the issue with these steps: 
  
Download https://orgmode.org/org-9.4.6.tar.gz and extract to ~/org-9.4.6
 
Start emacs 27 with emacs -Q 
 evaluate (add-to-list &#x27;load-path &quot;~/org-9.4.6/lisp&quot;)
 create a new org file, create a heading and clock in 
 evaluate (setq org-log-note-clock-out t) 
 clock out. 
  
I&#x27;m using WSL2/Ubuntu 20.04 on Windows. this shouldn&#x27;t be relevant though.

                    <span>Hi!
 My assumption is that Haskell has no support for a scenario where a client ought to be authenticated (certificate send and verified) as part of establishing a TLS connection. OnCertificateRequest function does not seem to be called back.
 We see a lot of code examples such as this one:
  creds  return creds , onServerCertificate &#x3D; \_ _ _ _ -&gt; return [] } clientParams &#x3D; (defaultParamsClient hostName &quot;&quot;) { clientHooks &#x3D; hooks , clientSupported &#x3D; def { supportedCiphers &#x3D; ciphersuite_all } } tlsSettings &#x3D; TLSSettings clientParams 
 For Windows 10 and ghc 8.4.3 has someone gotten onCertificateRequest called back?

                    <span>I have the desire for a top level function. It feels artificial to me to put it in an object that I have to name with an arbitrary noun when I just want to refer to it by its verb method name. So I was toying with this pattern.
 object FormatCurrency { private lazy val instance &#x3D; NumberFormat.getCurrencyInstance def apply(num: BigDecimal): String &#x3D; instance.format(num) } 
 so I can call it like FormatCurrency(1.00).
 What do y&#x27;all think? Should it be formatCurrency to make it look more like a function and less like a class constructor?

                    <span>I recently, added projectile, counsel, and vterm to my emacs configuration. I am quite happy with these recent additions, and everything has been going very well.
 Except today, while pair programming in C I discovered that my setup chokes on C files. Emacs runs full tilt using %100 of a core, and the session can no longer be used. I disabled projectile and company (I never have clang installed anyway), but that didn&#x27;t do anything. I can&#x27;t find any crash reports; I presume because emacs is in some infinite loop, so there is no way for it to make a report.
 Anyway, I ran emacs in a terminal with -q to do the hour or so of work in C today (it is not my primary language at work), but I am pretty stumped about what is wrong. I hope someone here has a clue what is happening. I sure as hell don&#x27;…</span>

                    <span>I am trying to set up ox-hugo to auto export files in my org-roam directory. Ox-hugo provides the org-hugo-auto-export-mode function/variable for this purpose. As such, I want to enable this for every org file in the org roam directory but only in that directory. I found here that this can be done with 
 ((org-mode . ((eval . (org-hugo-auto-export-mode)))))
 added to the directory&#x27;s .dir-locals.el
 After trying this, it simply didn&#x27;t work for me. I have tried restarting as well and with this code snippet, the mode simply doesnt get activated. My problem is this is the first time I have worked with directory local variables/modes and I can&#x27;t find another way to do this online. 
 Anyone have a clue why this isn&#x27;t working. I would love if I could properly do this. 
 Thanks in advance!

                    <span>Hello! I just started using Emacs and have a noob question:
 How to configure Emacs to automatically close brackets like in VS code or other text editors?
 I switched from Vim to the latest version of Doom Emacs and didn&#x27;t like the behavior of auto-closing brackets. Specifically, I don&#x27;t like two things:
 - Auto erasing closing bracket(&#x27;|&#x27; -&gt; cursor):
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;c++ int main() { {| } &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; becomes: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;c++ int main() { | &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; 
  
No new line with indentation after pressing Shift+Enter:
 c++ int main() { { |} } 
 Just Enter:
 c++ int main() { { | } } 
 
 I tried several solutions from the internet, but neither of them worked as I wanted(I also tried hacking on them, but it was really hard because I am a noob in Elisp and Emacs). My requirements are not that high, though: - Add a closing bracket - Add new line and indent after I press Enter (and Shift+Enter) - Don&#x27;t remove the closing bracket when I erase the opening one (I usually start erasing from the closing bracket and when I reach opening one, it removes the next closing bracket)
 In vim, I used simple bindings:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; &quot; brackets
 inoremap &quot; &quot;&quot; inoremap &#x27; &#x27;&#x27; inoremap ( () inoremap [ [] inoremap { {} inoremap { {}O inoremap {; {};O 
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 I tried to implement it in Emacs but couldn&#x27;t. Will appreciate some help.
 Is there a good way for auto closing brackets in Emacs?
 EDIT: I think electric pair suits me. As for me, smartparens&#x27; behavior is really annoying: it deletes closing pair and acts strange. I figured out how to turn off it in Doom Emacs: lisp (remove-hook &#x27;doom-first-buffer-hook #&#x27;smartparens-global-mode) (smartparens-global-mode -1) 
 One thing left: I want auto indentation after pressing Shift+Enter too.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been trying to set up for python development. Everything is working fine so far, only flycheck is giving me some headaches. I&#x27;m using lsp, so flycheck defaults to using lsp as it&#x27;s checker. But I want to use flake8 as the default checker, which depends on the virtual environment to be loaded before. The environment is automatically loaded using direnv. I tried this to select flake8 as default:
 (add-hook &#x27;pyhon-mode-local-vars-hook (lambda () (when (flycheck-may-enable-checker &#x27;python-flake8) (flycheck-select-checker &#x27;python-flake8)))) 
 However it doesn&#x27;t select the checker and I have to do it manually (M-x flycheck-select-checker). I also tried disabling the lsp checker completely and to always select flake8 (without checking if it can be enabled) but it still doesn&#x27;t work. I guess what causes a problem is that flake8 cannot be selected until the environment is loaded, since the executable is in the virtual environment. Is there any way I could still make it load flake8 automatically?

                    <span>Background: With projectile, I usually use projectile-grep or projectile-ag to search for stuff in my code bases or blogs. Thanks to wgrep etc., I can then edit the results in place and perform changes to my project next to any occurrence of the search terms.
 Observation: I noticed that with Emacs&#x27;s new-ish built-in project.el stuff, there&#x27;s C-x p g to perform a regex search (project-find-regexp) without grep in a project. The resulting buffer is using xref-mode. It looks rather nice and tidy. But there&#x27;s no built-in wgrep equivalent to make it editable.
 Question: Is there a wgrep, but for xref-mode? Web search yields confusing results because &#x27;xref&#x27; hashistorically been the name of a couple of things in Emacs land. Help by ye all would be appreciated!

                    <span>Recently, I found out about haskell and got intrigued to find more about it. I was also fascinated with Xmonad so I been tweaking in it. But I&#x27;m having a bit hard time to understand the codes of different modules so I thought it would be best to know the basics of the language as such would help me to understand the codes as well as make me more able. Can you all suggest me books that I can refer to as a novice in this field? 
 I know this question has been asked quite a few times but it all dated atleast 5 years ago or so. It&#x27;s 2021 and many things have changed so I&#x27;m looking for any book which is totally updated and beginners friendly. Please consider myself as total novice in the programming world as I had very little exposure to programming. I know a bit of C and Bash and I used it mainly to make my life easier on Linux by building small scripts. Any sort of help is totally appreciated.

                    <span>So I&#x27;m coming back to my haskell project after some months and hitting the good ol&#x27; &quot;wow this is a giant mess, I should totally revamp this&quot;.
 I&#x27;m realising basically everything I write is of the type foo :: a -&gt; b -&gt; m c for some huge m ~ ReaderT BigOlRecordType1 (StateT BigOlRecordType2 IO).
 This seems like...a huge oversight. For reference, the thing I&#x27;m working on is a text adventure, so the big abstraction I have is a game world populated by objects. If I want to go query some property of some object, I have to lug around this huge monad stack. It doesn&#x27;t feel very haskell-y. Rather than handling propertyCheck :: SomeSpecificObject -&gt; Bool, I&#x27;m doing things like HasSomeSpecificObject w m &#x3D;&gt; EntityID -&gt; m Bool.

 These are companies that are hiring right now, and they are all Haskell related, even if they list additional stacks.
 I was honestly a bit surprised how many there were.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been recently gaining interest in Scala as a tool for data engineering. I was trying to do some cool Data Analysis pipelines on Scala as a practice but I can&#x27;t seem to find any libraries or learning resources for the exploratory data analysis phase, nor the feature engineering and selection.
 I wonder if anyone here is aware of any libraries/notebooks or other materials showing tools to do EDA (especially visualization) and preprocessing on Scala. Thanks

                    <span>Hello, 
 I have a codebase that&#x27;s quite old now that uses akka http with Futures as a main IO monad and throwing exceptions for error handling.
 I would like to improve on this and have been looking into other options like using Monad Error. However I am wondering how I can handle this because it seems to me in akka http youre obliged to create an exception handler. Also, I am not sure Monad Error will be compatible with the monad used by the app (Future) 
 Any suggestions or code samples i can get inspiration from?

                    <span>I&#x27;m studying Scala with the Coursera specialization. I want to start with scala because 2 reasons: 1) functional programming and 2) higher salaries. I think in November I will complete the specialization. I have 10 years of experience with .NET, Angular, Python, and some Julia. I&#x27;m Latin American, very well paid for Latin American standards. My question is... how do you focus the career plan to get a remote job with North American salaries with North American company?
 ​
 I&#x27;m paid above average for national standards, but the average at the USA is much higher... I would be happy to find a Job with a USA-average salary.....

                    <span>What is a lawless type class, and should they be avoided? Are orphan instances
inherently evil, or just misunderstood? Is global coherence a mistake or a
fundamental requirement? In this post we argue that most of the arguments over
these questions stem from the fact that type classes embody a number of
disparate concepts, with each facet giving rise to perceived wisdom which does
not necessarily map to other facets. We look at the various concepts which are
combined in type classes, and posit how one might disentangle them.

Is this the best way to reference other Zettels? I know the question is subjective. Just looking for a clean way to say:

 ; Package repositories. (setq package-archives &#x27;((&quot;gnu&quot; . &quot;http://elpa.gnu.org/packages/&quot;) (&quot;melpa-stable&quot; . &quot;https://stable.melpa.org/packages/&quot;)))

 ; Load a language server if one is available. (add-hook &#x27;prog-mode-hook #&#x27;lsp) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 It seems like this installed the packages I want, but I can&#x27;t tell if lsp-mode is working. Do I need (package-initialize)? I also see other configures calling (require lsp-mode). I tried doing that and it said symbol undefined.
 Any help?

 I have something like this.

 I want an interactive function which will insert empty lines bellow and above images.
 Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipiscing ![Image name](image.png) ![Image name](image.png) 
 Edited:  
 This looks closer to what I want but will insert empty lines even if an image is already surrounded with empty lines :(

                    <span>I have no idea what this option is called 
 A previous emacs install I used would let me format (Perl) quoted text with spaces or tabs so I could write 
 my $sql &#x3D; &quot;SELECT foo, bar FROM wibble WHERE baz &#x3D; &#x27;done&#x27;&quot;; 
 Hitting tab on those lines would not change the formatting 
 However currently if I hit tab on those lines it changes it to an ugly
 my $sql &#x3D; &quot;SELECT foo, bar FROM wibble WHERE baz &#x3D; &#x27;done&#x27;&quot;; 
 I could use heredoc, but was wondering if there was option I needed to disable.

                    <span>I am working on an NBT parser for Minecraft and I wanted to test my implementation. There is an official test file, but that one is far from code coverage and I had since tried to find the best way to create my own files. These are some examples (ignore .bin files).
 I tried to use hexdump and some other GUI tool which were not very useful imo. The best luck I had was with a custom c++ code but the issue I had was that code is since broken, besides its not the best idea to rewrite source .txt and forget to update the .bin. Which led me to writing my own elisp file editor.
 A binary file would look like this:
 0a 00 00 01 00 00 11 00 ^ ^ ^ ^ | | | end of vector | | byte data | following data will be a byte vector // Those 00 00 are lengths of names of vector and byte // but i removed the names to make it fit on the line // More details in the NBT specs. 
 The above would be diplayed like this:
 0a 0000 01 0000 11 00 
 Or like this: ([%] means vector, b means byte)
 [%] &quot;&quot; { b &quot;&quot; 0x11 } 
 Or:
 [%] &quot;&quot; { b &quot;&quot; 17 } 
 So it should be at least hexadecimal, indented and separated into lines, but I would also add some readability.
 Optional: While editing the file I would like to safeguard myself and do checks on the data that I insert. Maybe even a separate buffer like in calc for stack and trail, but for insert/edit and view.

                    <span>Hello, I&#x27;m a long time Vim user who switched to (DOOM)Emacs yesterday and I am looking for a way to translate all of my UltiSnips LaTeX snippets to yasnippet. So far I figured out how make basic snippets which can be expanded by pressing TAB and snippets which expand only in certain environments like the math environment but I can&#x27;t figure out how to translate my more complicated snippets which expand automatically. Here is an UltiSnips example:
 snippet / &quot;Fraction&quot; i
 \\frac{${VISUAL}}{$1}$0
 endsnippet
 What this one does is the following: If type 1/ it will automatically expand to \frac{1}{} . Another example is the ket:
 priority 100
 context &quot;math()&quot;
 snippet &quot;\|(.*?)\&gt;&quot; &quot;ket&quot; riA
 \ket{\!p[snip.rv&#x3D;match.group](https://snip.rv&#x3D;match.group)(1)\}\&#x60;&#x60;
 endsnippet
 This gives me \ket{a} when I type |a&gt; . I&#x27;m sure there must be a way to write snippets like these in yasnippet but I haven&#x27;t found any examples of such snippets.

                    <span>Being a user of multiple-cursors.el, I have always been envious of evil-mc&#x27;s abilities to pause fake cursors and allow free movements for the real one but that evil variant doesn&#x27;t suit me because it doesn&#x27;t play well with non-evil commands (like sp-kill-sexp).
 After scavenging on the Internet without success results, I decided to write those myself: after-multiple-cursors-core.el
 Although a hack, the idea is simple: Just extract cursor positions from mc/all-fake-cursors&#x27;s output and save it in an association list (maybe we don&#x27;t need a hash table since it&#x27;s not too often, and buffer-local variables are lost when we revert the buffer; and yes there&#x27;s the limitation of editing will render positions incorrect, but I think we don&#x27;t need to handle that case) with buffer objects as keys.

                    <span>Hello there,
 I have an LG 2k 34-inch ultra-wide monitor, which I have setup sideways in portait-mode(which I setup with xrandr).
 Anyways, how do I correctly setup emacs for it to look better? 
 The text does not fit correctly on the screen, so it looks messy.
 I&#x27;m going to try out different font sizes, but I was wondering if other elisp packages/configurations would help with this particular setup?
 I heard about horizontal scrolling, but I need to look more into it.
 Thanks in advance for the help!

                    <span>At this year&#x27;s HasuraCon we&#x27;re doing a workshop on how to extend the Hasura GraphQL-Engine with support for a new database backend.
 At the workshop (on 2021-06-24, 16:00-17:00 UTC), /u/nicuveo and /u/plcplc will be going through the parts of the design of the Hasura GraphQL-Engine that enable backend modularity, and showcasing the work needed to develop a backend for SQLite from scratch.
 Those interested can head to https://hasura.io/events/hasura-con-2021/register/ and register for the conference, which spans the two days of Wednesday 2021-06-23 and Thursday 2021-06-24.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been working to understand the theory behind algebraic effects, with the understanding that that&#x27;s what Polysemy&#x27;s based on. I&#x27;m starting to think I&#x27;m fundamentally confused. 
 Following through citations (Polysemy cites Kiselyov and Ishii, who cite Kammar, Lindley, and Oury, who cite various papers by Plotkin and Pretnar) strongly suggests that &quot;extensible effects&quot; are just a rebranding of &quot;algebraic effects&quot;, and that equational reasoning gets left out of implementations because that&#x27;s more practical (but Polysemy&#x27;s trying to add it back?). Is this a good understanding of the situation?
 Similarly, in Petnar&#x27;s representations of algebraic effects (e.g.), it&#x27;s quite important that the handlers have access to the computation&#x27;s continuation, and get to decide how it&#x27;s used. I haven&#x27;t been able to find any support for this in Polysemey, but everything&#x27;s phrased so differently it&#x27;s difficult to search. 
 Any suggestions for bridging the gap between theory and practice, or for quickly getting up to speed on the last twenty years of research in this area?

                    <span>A new release of fakedata has been released: https://github.com/fakedata-haskell/fakedata
 Brief Summary of what fakedata is: It&#x27;s a library for producing fake data such as names, addresses and phone numbers.
 The changelog contains the list of changes in this release: https://github.com/fakedata-haskell/fakedata/releases/tag/v1.0
 Note that this release contains breaking change. I have documented it with more detail in the changelog entry. The most interesting one is making Fake type as a transformer which allows writing efficient code more easily. This was done by Isaac Van Bakel and more details are here: https://github.com/fakedata-haskell/fakedata#using-the-faket-transformer
 The current release also adds various new modules (+ 15), locale improvements and contains updates to fake data sources. Also, the test suite has been enhanced which helped me find bugs in the upstream Ruby data sources (Corresponding fix: https://github.com/faker-ruby/faker/pull/2339) . And thanks to Tristan de Cacqueray for fixing the test failure issues related to random 1.2.0 as part of ZuriHac.
 The following packages can be used to create generators out of fakedata:
 * quickcheck integration by Jappie Klooster: https://github.com/fakedata-haskell/fakedata-quickcheck
 * hedgehog integration by Matt Parsons: https://github.com/parsonsmatt/hedgehog-fakedata

 I am using Doom Emacs with (org +pretty) and org-autolist installed (disabling this didn&#x27;t seem to change behavior) if that is relevant.
 I am kinda new to org-mode so apologies if this is dumb. Any help is appreciated including alternate ideas.
 Thank you.

                    <span>I just found Orgzly and would like to use it as a diary/journal.
 I like that I can add entries quickly into my Diary note using the + widget.
 However when I go into the app, I&#x27;d like to see my entries listed by date (with the creation date on the left), instead of as a bullet list... What am I missing?
 Note that I&#x27;m not talking about scheduled tasks/events. I&#x27;d just like to do simple journal entries, and see them in a journal format.
 PS: I&#x27;m posting here because this sub seems to be the most active with Orgzly. To be honest I don&#x27;t really know what orgmode is!

                    <span>I use doom emacs and use org mode in it. I have the below configuration for TODO states.
 (setq org-todo-keywords
 &#x27;((sequence &quot;TODO(t)&quot; &quot;PROJ(p)&quot; &quot;NEXT(n)&quot; &quot;WAIT(w)&quot; &quot;|&quot; &quot;DONE(d)&quot; &quot;CANC(c)&quot;)))
 The fast access to TODO states as mentioned in https://orgmode.org/manual/Fast-access-to-TODO-states.html#Fast-access-to-TODO-states doesn&#x27;t seem to work for me anymore. When I do &quot;SPC m t&quot; it just tries to cycle through the available TODO states TODO-&gt;PROJ-&gt;NEXT ... and not ask for a shortcut letter to my desired state.
 I remember this stopped working after I did a fresh install of doom emacs, but this doesn&#x27;t seem to be related to doom emacs. Any pointers on where to look at?

                    <span>It&#x27;s a small thing and I don&#x27;t know why it bothers me. 
 When I create a list and I hit enter to start the next item, it always indents the cursor. Is there a way to stop this?

                    <span>Hi all!
 I wonder what is the right/common way to collect outputs from multiple asynchronous processes (which may run concurrently) into one log buffer. So far I have found three options:
  
Associate all the processes with the log buffer (as the process buffer). This is discouraged in the manual and indeed seems like a bad idea (it may interleave the outputs).
 
Create a unique process buffer for each process and copy the output from the process buffer to the log buffer at the end in the process sentinel. The problem is that we may have lots of buffers left. It seems to work if we kill the buffer as well in the sentinel, but I am not sure if that works reliably. Here is a sample of this solution:
 
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 (require &#x27;cl-lib) (defconst output-buffer (get-buffer-create &quot;*output*&quot;)) (defun copy…</span>

 import turtle johnny &#x3D; turtle.Turtle()

 Traceback (most recent call last): File &quot;&quot;, line 1, in  File &quot;/home/charly/Dev/TutorialPython/day16.py&quot;, line 9, in  johnny &#x3D; turtle.Turtle() File &quot;/usr/lib/python3.9/turtle.py&quot;, line 3814, in __init__ RawTurtle.__init__(self, Turtle._screen, File &quot;/usr/lib/python3.9/turtle.py&quot;, line 2558, in __init__ self._update() File &quot;/usr/lib/python3.9/turtle.py&quot;, line 2661, in _update self._update_data() File &quot;/usr/lib/python3.9/turtle.py&quot;, line 2647, in _update_data self.screen._incrementudc() File &quot;/usr/lib/python3.9/turtle.py&quot;, line 1293, in _incrementudc raise Terminator turtle.Terminator 
 my emacs config is pretty much vanilla, I&#x27;m just using python-mode. Any ideas? thanks.

                    <span>I&#x27;d like to disable a specific behavior in *eshell* buffer, that is very much similar to the result of applying the comint-postoutput-scroll-to-bottom in inferior buffers, like M-x shell or M-x ielm (and others alike).
 For the buffers that use comint mode, I can simple remove-hook from the comint-output-filter-functions, and whenever I use C-l C-l to recenter current line to be the top one, and evaluate some expression, I like that the top line I was on is still the top line (unless the expression result is bigger than the window height).
 *eshell* always moves current line to the bottom first, then prints the result of the command, which is a bit annoying, as I mostly use it in a long vertical buffer, and going from the top to the bottom visually is very distracting. Clearing previous output is not an option, because I want to refer to it occasionally.
 But I can&#x27;t seem to find anything in eshell that corresponds to this feature, and it doesn&#x27;t use comint either, so any help would be great. Thanks!

 it&#x27;s like godbolt but it is extendable, supports multiple languages, written in elisp and is completely offline. thought i&#x27;d share my discovery :)

 e.g the screen for set-buffer contains links to with-current-buffer, pop-buffer and switch-to-buffer. So if you want to view current-buffer or save-to-current-buffer you have to use C-h f to get them.
 Even more annoying is the set-x family of commands. set, setq, setq-local, setq-default etc.
 Isn&#x27;t there some way around this, eg, setting some advice where on displaying a page you could display your own manual or automatically generated links below them.

                    <span>I am begining go find Emacs key combinations such as Ctrl-Alt-Shift-&#x27; (mark-sexp) too awkward and I&#x27;m now looking at different key schemes such as modalka, god-mode, ryo-modal etc.
 With modalka there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any particular leader key, though I suspect I haven&#x27;t read it well enough or understand it.

 Vanilla Emacs functions properly.

                    <span>I&#x27;m getting a really weird issue with my package with Unicode on GHC 9.0.1.
 Where I expect to see, respectively
  
β (or \946) and
 γ (or \947)
  
I instead see
  
β?KQHTLXOCBJSPDZRAMEWNIUYGV and
 γ?EYJVCNIXWPBQMDRTAKZGFUHOS
  
and the appended strings come from elsewhere in my code!
 This one really has me stumped, and any help is much appreciated! It feels like something deep in how Unicode is stored, unless it&#x27;s just my bad code (which has worked fine since GHC 7.10.3).

                    <span>I think this is a pretty straight forward yes or no question, so here goes: as a beginner I&#x27;m starting to see the cleanliness of defining point-free functions. Somtimes I&#x27;m having trouble doing it though, especially when the input variable needs to be fed to multiple intermediate functions, like when you&#x27;d want to find the average of an Int array:
 avg :: [Int] -&gt; Double avg xs &#x3D; fromIntegral (sum xs) / (fromIntegral (length xs)) 
 So I&#x27;m wondering if there&#x27;s a way to do it at all, or if I should even bother.

                    <span>Is the system described in https://youtu.be/sl2zo7tzrO8 still up and running in Facebook? I want to make sure I don&#x27;t provide outdated information when advocating Haskell.
 There are 2 aspects to this:
  
Is Haskell still being used for Spam Filtering?
 Is the system still using Static Rules? Or all static rules are gone and replaced with ML models?
  
Two friends who left Facebook at 2016 gave me contradicting information, one said it was replaced with ML written in C++, and the other said the system is still up and running. So I am asking here to see if anyone has more recent information.

                    <span>(Background issue I&#x27;m facing: https://github.com/snapframework/snap-core/issues/309)
 I think the functionality of MonadUnliftIO is exactly what I want, but unfortunately Snap appears not eligible for:
  
the intuition is that a monad must have no monadic state, but may have monadic context. This essentially limits MonadUnliftIO to ReaderT and IdentityT transformers on top of IO.
  
Then I found Snap has a MonadBaseControl instance, and thought it should work for me. But sadly to find it losing states. Also I failed to find a user side example of MonadBaseControl on Github (as there&#x27;re only instance impl. hits), so I have not way to verify whether that&#x27;s due to my incorrect usage.
 Any way quoting u/snoyberg : https://github.com/fpco/unliftio/issues/17#issuecomment-363655106

                    <span>Hi all, this is a minor question but am curious. I have beorg on my iPhone 6, and every time I start it it takes a number of seconds to sync, even if nothing has changed, and then a few more seconds to “settle down” Usually I hope to quickly add a note, and then move on, so it has some slight friction for usage. Especially when I close and reopen to add another thing — same long wait though nothing has changed. Any thoughts? My org files are not particularly large.

For me, history is a way of connecting various pieces of evidence from the past, both diachronically (connecting similar items over time) and synchronically (connecting different items from the same time), to find patterns and to draw conclusions.  A Zettelkasten would therefore seem an ideal tool for making these connections and helping to draw the relevant conclusions.  However, the way I work doesn&#x27;t seem to fit the Zettelkasten &#x27;method&#x27; described in this forum, especially in relation to reading notes.
The first stage of my work is to collect the evidence, usually from various different primary sources.  This usually involves noting the evidence verbatim.  I may summarise it later, but I need to work from the original evidence…</span>

                    <span>I use pass to store all my passwords. I&#x27;ve started setting up gnus, and I&#x27;ve got it working, though I don&#x27;t want to have to manually write down my passwords in ~/.authinfo. This isn&#x27;t a security issue -- I know I could encrypt it and use ~/.authinfo.gpg -- it&#x27;s a convenience thing. I don&#x27;t want to have to manually change the settings as well as updating my pass database every time I change my passwords (quite often).
 So, is there a way to have gnus read in my pass?
 Come to that, I used to use neomutt, which didn&#x27;t need ~/.authinfo, and all other information (usernames, smtp ports, etc.) could be stored in the config. Could I do this with gnus too and get rid of one more file altogether?
 TIA!

                    <span>Hey there,
 I often do this for work aka these two commands in an &#x27;ansi-term&#x27; session, but have to manually type them, hit enter, and wait for connections for both separate commands:
 gcloud compute ssh --project (name of 1st box) (name of 2nd box)
 ssh (alias for end point box)
 ​
 I&#x27;m being a bit vague because yeah, its for work. 
 But, can someone please help me figure out how I can add Tramp to this combination? Also, how could I configure it to a keyboard macro as well?
 ​
 I&#x27;ve used Tramp to remotely edit my website as if it were local, and I absolutely love it. Wanted to do the same thing and blow some coworkers minds about how you can do this. Reason being is that I can install anything on these endpoint boxes, so I figured maybe Tramp might come to the rescue for this situation.
 ​
 Thanks!

absolute line numbers on the left margin
 relative line numbers on the right margin
 line numbers on all buffers, i.e on new/empty ones as well
 this whole thing switched on by default at boot
  
Now, thanks to this great post on StackOverflow, I achieved points 1 and 2, but 3 I am absolutely unable to get and for 4, I can do it with Meta/Alt-x then linum-mode but not on startup. Kindly help for 3 and 4.

                    <span>Greetings Emacsians! I, emacs noob, am back with additional questions. I am configuring emacs to be my personal calendar and task management system. I really like the &quot;M-x org-agenda a&quot;
 view&#x27;s information, but I don&#x27;t like its formatting.
 First and foremost, long lines look terrible. I have &quot;word wrap visual line mode&quot; activated, which wraps lines in all org files. I also have the &quot;adaptive-wrap&quot; packaged installed and active, and that makes the text wrapping in normal org mode files look much better since indenting is respected. However, this package seems to have no effect on the org agenda views. 
 Q: How can I force org agenda views to also wrap nicely such that indentation is respected? (i.e. like &quot;adaptive-wrap&quot; does for ordinary org mode files?)
 Separately, there are two other aspects of the org agenda view formatting I&#x27;d like to change (including them here since they are also related to org agenda view formatting even though they are otherwise separate issues).
 (1) Since the todo&#x27;s are pulled from multiple files with different filename lengths, the &quot;todo&quot; keywords and descriptions of the todos are not aligned, and this makes the view look visually chaotic. Is there a way to tell the agenda daily/weekly view not to include the filename of each todo?
 (2) There is no extra vertical space between one todo and the next which makes it visually difficult to see where one todo ends and the next one begins. Is there a way to specify that a small amount of vertical margin beneath every todo?

                    <span>I like using light or dark desktop themes depending on the external environment, I prefer dark themes at night and light during day.
 When changing the Gnome theme (I usually switch between &#x27;Adwaita&#x27; and &#x27;Adwaita Dark&#x27;), the Emacs frame decorations get updated accordingly (using 28.0 with pgtk), but the Emacs theme does not change.
 The configuration below sets up a DBus handler that is triggered when the Gnome GTK theme changes, and it sets the appropriate Modus theme.
 (use-package dbus) (use-package modus-themes :after (dbus) :config (defun set-modus-theme-from-gtk () &quot;Set modus theme by checking whether GTK theme is dark.&quot; (let ((gtk-theme (downcase (call-process-string &quot;gsettings&quot; &quot;get&quot; &quot;org.gnome.desktop.interface&quot; &quot;gtk-theme&quot;)))) (if (or (string-match-p &quot;dark&quot; gtk-theme) (string-match-p &quot;black&quot; gtk-theme)) (modus-themes-load-vivendi) (modus-themes-load-operandi)))) (defun gtk-theme-changed (path _ _) &quot;DBus handler to detect when the GTK theme has changed.&quot; (when (string-equal path &quot;/org/gnome/desktop/interface/gtk-theme&quot;) (set-modus-theme-from-gtk))) (dbus-register-signal :session &quot;ca.desrt.dconf&quot; &quot;/ca/desrt/dconf/Writer/user&quot; &quot;ca.desrt.dconf.Writer&quot; &quot;Notify&quot; #&#x27;gtk-theme-changed) (set-modus-theme-from-gtk)) (defun call-process-string (program &amp;rest args) &quot;Call process&#x60;PROGRAM&#x27; with &#x60;ARGS&#x27; and return the output as string.&quot; (with-temp-buffer (apply #&#x27;call-process program nil t nil args) (buffer-string)))

                    <span>Hey guys, I&#x27;m pretty inexperienced with ELisp, so if you could help me out that would be great.
 I&#x27;m trying to create a function that I can call with a key binding that will prompt me for a buffer (I&#x27;m thinking (counsel-ibuffer) style), and open the buffer as a new split next to my current buffer. Since the native emacs split functions only take dimensions as arguments (so far as I can tell) and I use evil mode, here is what I have:
  (defun other-buff-to-split () (interactive) (evil-split-buffer &#x27;(counsel-ibuffer))) 
 If you guys know of any way to get this working, please let me know. Thank you!

                    <span>I know Emacs can automatically decrypt .gpg file when I open it in dired. However, when I open a .gpg file, the mini buffer stuck at &quot;decrypting 0%&quot;, and doesn&#x27;t prompt me for the passphase no matter how long I wait.
 If I go to the shell and manually use gpg command to decrypt a file, and I enter my passphase in the shell, the passphase is cached for a certain time. When the passphase is cached, I can now decrypt the .gpg file by opening it in dired, and this seems to be the only way that I can successfully decrypt a file automatically. It is not only annoying but stupid.
 Why is Emacs not prompting for anything when it needs my passphase? Am I missing any configurations to make it works?
 I am using Emacs 28.0.5 with native compilation.
 Edit: I am using Arch and Exwm and I use startx to initialize Emacs. I just noticed that, when I quit Emacs, I saw the tty shell was prompting for passphase, I have no way to enter my passphase there when I am in GUI mode, what am I supposed to do?

                    <span>I seem to not be able to stop trying to tweak my lsp configuration regarding which features it uses, and which ones are disabled. Out of the box, it seems very busy. I&#x27;ve found this guide on enabling/disabling features which is quite helpful in understanding what everything is and how to toggle each piece. Nonetheless, i found that I just keep tweaking it; the lsp user interface just seems to always be in my way in some sense, or I end up disabling something I want later. (I&#x27;m using Doom, fyi.)
 I&#x27;m hoping to crowdsource a solution to my continual tweaking. Which combo of lsp features to you find are best for getting helpful info, and otherwise staying out of the way?

                    <span>Is anyone using this? Anyone like it or not like it?
 Seems like a possible alternative to using org-mode for todo lists, but I can only find a few mentions of it online.
 I think I like the structure it imposes, because sometimes org-mode&#x27;s many features and flexibility can be distracting. 
 Is it harder to integrate with other parts of Emacs?

                    <span>Is it possible to customize the agenda view that is shown when clicking on a tag? Ideally grouping using org-super-agenda.
 If this is possible is it then possible to have custom views / groupings based on a parent tag? For example if the tag that is clicked on is part of the “people” parent tag, do X otherwise do Y.

At the moment I&#x27;m just publishing them to git, but GitHub doesn&#x27;t render graphs, latex, etc 
 I would like to have GitHub automatically publish something like this: https://tecosaur.github.io/emacs-config/config.html#intro (table of contents, folding, on a GitHub.io domain). Is it possible to utilize GitHub CI to automatically 
  
Add all org files in the repository 
 Convert/format it as html (similar to tecosaurs format)
 Publish it

 https://github.com/makingthematrix/scalaonandroid/tree/main/calculator3
 From here you can download the APK file and install it on your phone with &#x60;adb&#x60; and a USB cable. I don&#x27;t think it makes sense to register this app on F-Droid or, gods have mercy, Google Play Store. In the future, I will do it with a more complex app I have in plans, but for now, &#x60;adb install&#x60; is the way to go). Or you can copy the whole repo and build the app yourselves.
 Here&#x27;s how it looks like:
 Scala 3 Calculator
 This remarkable achievement of razor-edge tech and top-notch UX wouldn&#x27;t be possible without all the brilliant people working on Scala 3, GraalVM, Gluon, JavaFX, and scala-maven-plugin. Me, I&#x27;m just putting the puzzles together.
 That being said, Scala 3 support still needs some love. There are issues, mostly around JVM/Scala compatibility (Java modules *coff* *coff*) . Now I will spend some time describing what I found about them the best I could - and nagging the above-mentioned brilliant people to take a look. But, all in all, I think we&#x27;re really doing great. I didn&#x27;t expect the migration to be so easy. Just as earlier I didn&#x27;t expect all these different pieces would so easily fall into their places and a Scala app on Android would just work. I feel... grateful. And also super happy - hence the tone of this entry.
 Cheers 😊

 Procedural pixel-art campfire
 I&#x27;ve written up a little tutorial on how to make a procedural pixel art fire shader in Indigo (Scala game engine).

 If you&#x27;d rather jump straight into the code, there is a GitHub repo that accompanies the how-to guide here:

 Has anybody here figured out how to get Tutanota to work with Emacs?

                    <span>I&#x27;m really interested in having completion and validation when editing my kubernetes manifest files.
 But can&#x27;t figure out how to get working lsp and yaml on emacs
 I followed the official guide, using npm to install the yaml lsp server and enabling the lsp mode for yaml files.
 FIRST PROBLEM: if I use the combination keys (C-M-i) I used to run company-complete, in yaml mode it runs the ispell-complete-word and I can&#x27;t understand why
 SECOND PROBLEM: when I run lsp-yaml-set-buffer-schema or lsp-yaml-select-buffer-schema and I select a json schema, I get the following error in lsp-resolve-value(set-from-style) function
 (void-variable set-from-style)
 ​
 Did somebody figure out how to get working lsp and yaml on Emacs? You can even apply json schema for some CRD, like the ones managed by Istio?

                    <span>Hi, I&#x27;m not sure if I asked it correctly but what I mean is I have a buffer with this text: 
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 (&quot;test&quot; 0 4 (font-lock-face org-level-1))
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 (which is the output of (propertize &quot;test&quot; &#x27;font-lock-face &#x27;org-level-1) btw)
 and I want to insert processed (faces applied to &quot;test&quot;) version of that text. But my try:
  (insert (with-current-buffer (get-buffer &quot;test&quot;) (buffer-substring-no-properties (point-min) (point-max)))) 
 inserts the exact same of buffer content.
 I want to insert it as (insert (propertize &quot;test&quot; &#x27;font-lock-face &#x27;org-level-1)) do.
 How can I achieve this?
 Background info: I want to show my daily agenda in the start screen (dashboard) but it takes time, so I&#x27;m trying to do this in emacsclient asynchronously.

                    <span>I tried to set split screen divider-width but it seems it stays that way even when there&#x27;s no split screen, leaving me with a divider that makes no sense.
 (setq default-frame-alist (append (list &#x27;(right-divider-width . 20) &#x27;(bottom-divider-width . 2)))) 
 Is there any way to set divider-width only when there&#x27;s a split screen present, otherwise make it nil?

                    <span>Functions from packages are reported as natively compiled, but my &quot;.el&quot; files are not.
 EmacsWiki: GCC Emacs said:
  
When a byte-compiled Elisp module is loaded, it gets queued for native compilation. Once native compilation has finished, the native-compiled definitions automatically replace the byte-compiled versions.
  
In my config:
 (setq native-comp-deferred-compilation t) (byte-recompile-file file nil 0 &#x27;load) 
 But functions in file are just byte-compiled, even after a looong time. I have seen emacs-lisp-native-compile-and-load, but isn&#x27;t it usable for active buffers only?

                    <span>So I&#x27;m using org-mode to write my notes and occasionally I insert a latex code block when org-mode itself isn&#x27;t enough. In those situations I use org-edit-special which pops me into a latex buffer with the contents of the code block, but because auctex doesnt see the usepackage headers that are available on export, it doesn&#x27;t load any of the cool macros or environments I have set up for completion. Does anyone have a workaround for this?
 Edit:
 Here&#x27;s something that works for now:
 elisp (add-hook &#x27;org-src-mode-hook (defun org-src-setup-auctex () (when (eq major-mode &#x27;latex-mode) (apply #&#x27;TeX-run-style-hooks (mapcar #&#x27;cadr org-latex-packages-alist)))))

                    <span>Problem
 If I have a list and I hit return, I want it to add a new item to the list (instead of adding notes to said item). M-return has the functionality I want, but I want it to be mapped to return.
 Basically, I want to swap M-return and return in org-mode.
 What I&#x27;ve tried
 I have tried a handful of things, which have all failed.

                    <span>Hi all, I&#x27;ve got a newbie question. I have a table with 3 columns. The middle column contains some fairly long description. Now I&#x27;ve added an additional column. The end result is that my table became too wide for me. Is there a way to (manually) split the second column over 2 lines? For instance my position is on the middle of the second column. Then I use some function and the rest of the column goes to a new inserted line. Thanks in advance for your help.

                    <span>Sometimes the component is not getting re-rendered immediately after calling H.modify. I&#x27;m currently calling H.liftAff $ delay $ Milliseconds 0.0 right after, as that seems to flush the state changes and cause a re-render. Is there a more elegant way to solve this?

                    <span>Is there a way to define a &quot;super type&quot; in Scala? It seems like types can not implement traits. What I want to do is something like this example, where I basically I have this trait:
 type ScrollBar &#x3D; ... type Window &#x3D; ... trait Widget[A] { def CreateScrollBar[B]() : ScrollBar def CreateWindow[B]() : Window } 
 And some type that implement it using ad hoc polymorphism:
 implicit val pmWidget : Widget[PMWidget] &#x3D; new Widget[PMWidget] { def CreateScrollBar[PMScrollBar](): ScrollBar &#x3D; ... def CreateWindow[PMWindow](): Window &#x3D; ... } 
 But I want both ScrollBar and Window to be of a specific type, referent to my PMWidget:
 type MotifScrollBar &#x3D; ... type MotifWindow &#x3D; ... type MotifWidget &#x3D; (MotifScrollBar, MotifWindow) 
 Is there a way to do this using type declarations? I thought about something like:
 type ScrollBar[A] &#x3D; A type Window[A] &#x3D; A 
 But if I implement it like this (using ints just to simplify):
 type MotifScrollBar &#x3D; Int type MotifWindow &#x3D; Int implicit val pmWidget : Widget[MotifWidget] &#x3D; new Widget[MotifWidget] { def CreateScrollBar[MotifScrollBar](): ScrollBar[MotifScrollBar] &#x3D; 0 // type mismatch here def CreateWindow[MotifWindow](): Window[MotifWindow] &#x3D; 0 // type mismatch here } 
 I&#x27;m getting type mismatches where I indicated. Is there some workaround?

                    <span>Hi Zettelkasten friends,
I&#x27;ve been processing papers on psychology lately (on retrieval practice and reading comprehension) but I&#x27;m having trouble implementing the concept of &quot;layers of evidence&quot; as described in https://zettelkasten.de/posts/layers-of-evidence/.
In the post, @sfast said: (my emphasis for context)

  
The next layer of evidence is the interpretation of data patterns. The phenomenological layer meant you describe what you saw. Here, you interpret why you saw it.
Now the concept of causality can come into play. You can explain the correlation above by saying: Drowning people in swimming pools generates amplifiers for the nuclear power plants in the U.S, and that’s why when more people drown in swimming pools, more energy is generated in nuclear power plants.

publish my moldable-emacs code (very early release actually, just for the brave users)
 sort my ideas about the vision of the mode
 show how to explore JSON with it
  
Maybe this will be interesting to you too!
 (By the way, I shared earlier how to use this to list all code duplication in a source code buffer.)

                    <span>Hello!
 As in the title; I have forked general.el to add a few autoloaded keywords of my own, by using the :general keyword use-package functions as a template. However, this bit of code, originally used for :general, is not working (read &quot;not being autoloaded&quot;):
 emacs-lisp (defun use-package-handler/:gone (name _keyword args rest state) &quot;Use-package handler for :gone.&quot; (use-package-concat (use-package-process-keywords name rest state) &#x60;(,@(mapcar (lambda (arglist) ;; Note: prefix commands are not valid functions (if (or (functionp (car arglist)) (macrop (car arglist))) &#x60;(,@arglist :package &#x27;,name) &#x60;(general-def (:keymaps &#x27;(global aiern-insert-state-map aiern-normal-state-map)) ,@arglist :package &#x27;,name))) (plist-get args :arglists))))) 
 The part I have changed is the general-def bit, by adding (:keymaps &#x27;(global aiern-insert-state-map aiern-normal-state-map)). When demanding the package, it works fine. Am I missing anything here? I&#x27;ve also copied the use-package-autoloads/:general and use-package-handler/:general functions as well, which are exactly the same, and renaming them appropriately.
 Thank you kindly for the help!

                    <span>I have an issue where my .dir-locals are getting bigger and bigger, namely due to my current projects using prettier in quite a few different major modes. But also due to specific eglot setups. Enabling prettier and eglot for the relevant major-mode would work in these projects, but would start becoming annoying in the others.
 In trying to move most of the logic to my Emacs configuration and have less duplicates in each of my project roots, I tried the following:
 ;; path/to/my/project/.dir-locals.el ((nil . ((me/eglot-p . t) (me/prettier-p . t)))) ;; dotemacs.el (use-package prettier :preface (defvar-local me/prettier-p nil &quot;Should prettier be enabled?&quot;) :hook (web-mode . me/prettier-mode-maybe) :config (put &#x27;me/prettier-p &#x27;safe-local-variable #&#x27;booleanp)) (defun me/prettier-mode-maybe () &quot;Enable &#x60;prettier-mode&#x27; when the prettier executable is found locally.&quot; (when me/prettier-p (prettier-mode))) 
 The issue with that is that dir-local variables are taken into account after web-mode-hook has kicked in, even with nil when no major-mode is specified. So me/prettier-p is always nil in me/prettier-mode-maybe.
 A second attempt, ignoring dir-local variables altogether, looked like this:
 (defun me/prettier-mode-maybe () &quot;Enable &#x60;prettier-mode&#x27; when the prettier executable is found locally.&quot; (when-let ((command (shell-command-to-string &quot;npm list -p prettier&quot;)) (prettier-p (length&gt; (string-trim-right command) 0))) (prettier-mode))) 
 Which is obviously too slow to be acceptable.
 What are your preferred methods to avoid having to copy the same .dir-locals.el every time you start a similar project or even reinstall your machine(s)? That was actually my case btw: I realized while reinstalling my machine how much stuff I had to copy around after cloning all my repositories.

 I have three problems that I cannot fix, if possible, can you help?
  
Close Emacs win LWin+Q

 Open shell with &#x60; (tilde key below esc) and if already open, close with &#x60; (tilde key below esc)
 What I tried:

 When I create multiple windows (ctrl+x 3, ctrl+x 2) I find it difficult to navigate to the third, fourth or fifth window. Is there a solution?
 Thank you! :)

                    <span>Has someone here made this switch? Relatively new to working with email on emacs, but I have previously set up gnus on my primary machine to send/receive mail from my gmail account. 
 I&#x27;ve setup mu4e on another machine, but I would like to use it on the gnus machine. Is there any way I can do this without having to setup offlineimap again? I don&#x27;t think that gnus actually stores emails locally so perhaps that&#x27;s not possible...

                    <span>I run into a problem of ediff-files hanging. How to figure out the root cause? 
 When I performed ediff between two files, after providing file B, the emacs hanged, without displaying the ediff buffers, but the status area shows &quot;processing difference regions ... done&quot;. 
 The emacs process has to be aborted through task manager. C-g would not work, neither SPC q 
 The emacs version is Emacs 27.1. 
 The emacs-config of tecosaur (https://github.com/tecosaur/emacs-config) is used with the recent Doom. 
 Here is a screenshot showing where it hanged and the high CPU utilization of the emacs process. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2638417/122454243-05707c00-cf60-11eb-8bb7-93c39339811d.png) 
 I tried ediff-buffers has the same problem.(edited)
 I really like emacs-config that I want to make it work. Thanks in advance for helps!

                    <span>In my Org QL project, I maintain a notes file to track ideas, bugs, etc, similar to the way GitHub issues and milestones can be used. After modifying entries for a while–including setting priorities, to-do/done status, etc–the outline tends to get a bit jumbled. Org has the built-in org-sort command, but it must be run manually, and it only supports one sorting method at a time. It quickly becomes tedious, and it&#x27;s impractical to use regularly.

                    <span>I love running cmus in M-x-term bin/bash in Emacs. However, recently, the error in the subject line has surfaced. And my terminal won&#x27;t display properly. It remains black (the background color of my theme), and the error: &quot;error in process filter: invalid face: unspecified&quot; appears to be the problem. Not only cannot I not access cmus, I can&#x27;t access anything.
 However, I have no idea what caused this, where to fix it, and how to fix it. Can anyone help? I&#x27;ve looked around, but can&#x27;t find a good answer.
 Also, when I run emacs -Q, the terminal DOES seem to work fine.

                    <span>Have you ever had a technical question about GHC you didn&#x27;t get a good answer for?
 Tomorrow, Saturday June 19, 17:00 Zurich time, there will be a GHC ask-me-anything panel discussion.
 It will be live-streamed on YouTube on the ZuriHac channel.
 We will have Simon Peyton-Jones and Ben Gamari on the panel as GHC developers, and we need you to ask them questions!
 You can ask your questions:
  
Live via the ZuriHac Discord, channel #ghc-panel-discussion
 Live via the libera.chat IRC channel #ghc; prefix your question with nh2: ZuriHac GHC AMA question:
 Here any time (I will collect the questons until 1 hour before the event)
  
The questions will read to the panelists during the event.
 We&#x27;d like to get technical questions about GHC, e.g. “how does class instance lookup work?”, not so much personal questions like “how long have you worked on GHC?”.
  
ZuriHac is the world&#x27;s largest Haskell Hackathon. It is free to join, and this year it is remote, so you can join simply by registering on https://zfoh.ch/zurihac2021/ Registering will send you the Discord invite, in case you want to ask your questions there.

                    <span>What is Hideout?
  
Hideout is a self-hosted service that makes private, persistent chat rooms possible. It requires no installation or account creation. Unlike disposable chat, a Hideout room preserves privacy without expiring.
 The GitHub repo contains a detailed introduction, and guides for hosting, building, and contributing: https://github.com/techmindful/hideout
 A video demo can be watched here: https://vimeo.com/564494164.
 A demo instance is running at hideout-demo.com. Uptime is expected to be unstable. Do not trust it for your own private conversations.
 Language stack is Haskell/Elm. Haskell, Elm, and the privacy community need more killer apps! Hideout tries to be as pretty and feature-rich as possible, so that when people opt for privacy, they won&#x27;t be getting a lackluster alternative.

A data declaration introduces one or more type constructors and one or more value constructors for each type constructor.
  
Out of curiosity, in what syntax can &quot;more&quot; type constructors be defined in &quot;a&quot; data declaration?

                    <span>Hello everyone,
 Chordify is hiring again! This post might look familiar to you if you&#x27;ve been around here for a while. That&#x27;s because I posted about a vacancy we had back in October. Since then, we&#x27;ve hired two new developers, but we&#x27;re still expanding!
 Chordify is a music platform that you can use to automatically detect the chords in any song you like. This way we help musicians to play all of their favourite music in an easy and intuitive way. You can try it at https://chordify.net
 Now, the backend for our website and apps, that are used by millions of people worldwide, is written in Haskell! We serve the user using primarily Servant, Persistent and Esqueleto. We also have a custom Redis caching layer and use an advanced Cloud Haskell setup to distribute our chord analysis computations.
 We are quickly becoming an autonomous workforce, meaning there is pretty much no hierarchy, and we are looking to expand our fast-growing team with a pro-active, independent and creative functional programmer to further improve Chordify. You&#x27;d get the opportunity to work with advanced type systems to power a website that serves millions.
 More information and a form to apply can be found at https://jobs.chordify.net. If you have any questions, feel free to ask them in this thread, or reach out to me at [rik@chordify.net](mailto:rik@chordify.net).
 We strive for diversity in our team, and encourage people of all backgrounds and genders to apply.
 One more thing, this is explicitly NOT a remote job. We expect our new colleague to come work with us at our (new!) office in Utrecht, The Netherlands.

                    <span>Hello reddit!
 I rely heavily on org-capture / org-roam-capture to sort my notes.
 Problem
 Until recently I had a working setup for my capture templates, but at the moment everytime I want to capture a file I get prompted to specify a path to save the capture in – which the template already should have done.
 It doesn&#x27;t matter whether I specify a full path or not – but I dont&#x27;t see the error in my config (except org-capture works without my config quite well)
 Config
 (setq org-directory &quot;~/org/&quot; org-roam-directory &quot;~/org/&quot;) (setq org-capture-templates &#x27;( (&quot;t&quot; &quot;Aufgabe&quot; entry (file+headline &quot;~/org/gtd/inbox.org&quot; &quot;Tasks to sort&quot;) &quot;* TODO %?\n %i\n %a&quot;) (&quot;n&quot; &quot;Notiz&quot; entry (file+headline &quot;~/org/gtd/inbox.org&quot; &quot;Notes to sort&quot;) &quot;* %?\n %i\n %a&quot;) ;; templates for the org-capture extension in Fi…</span>

 Is there an easy way to do this? Thanks for any tips.

                    <span>Just that, what library do you recommend for connecting to Cassandra?
 Thanks for your feedback.

                    <span>Hello, can anyone explain this error and what causes it ?
 https://preview.redd.it/9oh0fk41xz571.png?width&#x3D;1197&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;5a1aa459472c5be0b35bd2125908d6909a04c7c1
 partitionFlow .map(new PopularityFlowProcessFunction()) .windowAll(TumblingProcessingTimeWindows.of(Time.seconds(5))) .process(new ProcessAllWindowFunction[(String, Int), Map[String, Double], TimeWindow] { override def process(context: Context, elements: Iterable[(String, Int)], out: Collector[Map[String, Double]]): Unit &#x3D; { val counts: Int &#x3D; elements.size val result: Map[String, Double] &#x3D; elements .groupBy((in: (String, Int)) &#x3D;&gt; in._1) .map((elem: (String, Iterable[(String, Int)])) &#x3D;&gt; (elem._1, elem._2.reduce((v1: (String, Int), v2: (String, Int)) &#x3D;&gt; v1._2 + v2._2))) .map((elem: (String, Int)) &#x3D;&gt; (elem._1, (elem._2 / counts).toDouble)) out.collect(result) } }) 
 Code looks like this. This mapping looks quite clear to me and I cant understand why is there type misamatching.

                    <span>Hi All, I am reading a book that talks about parallel programming and starts implementing a method for adding list of elements. He say&#x27;s we need a container to store the result i.e, myresult[ aggSum ] . My question is Why do we need to store the result ( aggSum ) inside myResult ( container ), when we can represent the sum of elements using aggSum. If he says Optional[aggSum] / Either[aggSum] I would understand but he wants to store it in a container. So what exactly is a container ?, why is it&#x27;s purpose ?, does it has to do anything with generics.

                    <span>Something about @Artem&#x27;s question &quot;How do you organize and refer to your final work?&quot; got me thinking that I should share a workflow process. I&#x27;m calling this workflow &#x27;File Transclusion&#x27; to dress it up in fancy pants terms.
This uses two short and straightforward Keyboard Maestro macros. One to place the file in the /media directory and then forms the link, placing it in the clipboard for pasting, and the second calls the file and opens it in its default application. This all works beautifully with my Two Window Workflow keeping the target note in focus while reviewing the attachment alongside in a separate window. Simple is as simple does!
This video shows this process in action. The triggers are hard to grasp and hard to display. The trigger for the &quot;Form Media Links&quot; macro is ⌃⌥⇧⌘M whi…</span>

                    <span>Greetings, emacsians. I&#x27;m trying to set up org mode for personal task management and have come across the issue that apparently org mode list items can&#x27;t be todo items (only checkmarked items) and that only headings can actually be org mode todos. This is quite a disappointment as I enjoy the automatic numbering and nicely formatted nestability available for lists and also the agenda views of todo items, and I would very much like to use them together.
 Are there any packages which fix this dilemma? Or any elisp way to do this? Or are miracles real and is there a way to actually do this in normal org mode? Any of these would be much appreciated!
 Thanks!

                    <span>i have work on windows, and i prepare to use emacs from remote ubuntu machine over ssh.
 for some reason when ever i write the file path /ssh:name@ip:path, emacs hangs! i always ssh from emacs into another linux machine, i wonder why it hangs?! is there a better way?
 i do normally access the machine from the terminal, but /ssh:some_name@192.168.5.40:d:\note do take forever!

                    <span>Hello emacsians! I am an emacs noob customizing my config for the first time. Every emacs tutorial seems to call for installing either Ivy or Helm, however few are able to describe why they are necessary without referring to use cases and jargon that I either can&#x27;t relate to or don&#x27;t understand (my use cases for now involve task management, calendar management, and writing with only a small secondary emphasis on coding).
 I&#x27;ve opted not to go with Helm for now based on some complaints about performance, but the question remains of whether or not to install Ivy. So, for those of you who have experienced both vanilla emacs and Ivy emacs, what are the features (if any) that Ivy provides that you just can&#x27;t live without? Also, what are the worst things about Ivy?
 Thanks!

                    <span>I don&#x27;t know whether it is the suitable place to ask.
 I am using notmuch in Emacs, whenever I sent an email and sync the mailbox, my sent email shown as an unread email in my notmuch emacs client. This is very annoying.
 I am hosting my own Email server using dovecot and postfix. I am not sure whether this is a server side issue or client side issue. I knew it may not be caused by notmuch or Emacs, but I had no issue when using mu4e.
 Is this normal? What can I do to fix?

                    <span>Hi,
 I was wondering what options do we have in org-mode to save metadata on web links.
 I have counted 6500 https?:// links in all my notes and I would like to categorize at least some of them, in time.
 I don&#x27;t want to use titles for them, but I know that only titles have properties, or drawers.
 Right now my pseudo random convention is:
 
 This is a list of useful links:
 Wow, this article is so nice:
 https://example.com/whatever
 &gt; summary line 1
 &gt; summary line 2
 Written by the same author as the previous:
 https://foo.bar.com/stuff
 &gt; summary line
 &gt; summary line 2
 
 I would like to add metadata such as:
  
some tags, or categories for the links (eg: technical, art, spiritual)
 if it&#x27;s a git repo mention the programming language
 if it&#x27;s an article mention the author&#x27;s name
 if I save it offline, take a note about that
 different fields that I don&#x27;t know yet
  
Does anyone use anything like that? Maybe there&#x27;s a library that does something similar?
 Thank you
 edit: fix formatting

                    <span>I&#x27;m an IDE user (JetBrains currently, Visual Studio when I used to write C#) with basic Vim knowledge, using primarily Java and JS with some TS. I&#x27;m getting tired of the less-than-useful vim support in the IDE space, as well as general inflexibility in setting up workflows. I&#x27;ve been looking into emacs (spacemacs) as a daily-driver, and I like almost everything about it. However, I&#x27;m not sure what I&#x27;ll do with a certain part of my workflow that relies on refactoring support.
 This applies less to new features, and more to maintenance work on legacy(ish) code, which is honestly a lot of what I do. I&#x27;ve come to heavily rely on Kent Beck&#x27;s &quot;make the hard change easy&quot; advice, combined with Arlo Belshee&#x27;s read by refactoring. I like that I can use chains of known-safe IDE refactorings to rapidly explore and change the structure of a body of code before I even understand what it&#x27;s doing, and know that I&#x27;m not changing the semantics in the process.
 Seems like a decent portion of my go-to tools are supported in JS with js2-refactor, but not all. (Haven&#x27;t looked at whether it works with TS yet, and Tide may also be able to fill some holes even when applied to plain-JS.) On the other hand meghanada has been a bit disappointing in the refactoring department. Rust, if I ever work with that, looks to have an absolutely phenomenal language server.
 In addition to my two primaries, I&#x27;d like to be confident in branching out into, say, Go, Kotlin, or Swift, and I see about as much refactoring support for each of those as what meghanada has for Java; that is, nearly nothing.
 What do experienced emacs-ians do for these tasks? Do former IDE users among you not miss automated refactorings? Do you have emacs-native workflows that reliably work for, say, &quot;extract/inline variable/function/parameter&quot;?

                    <span>Hello, I am beginner learning Haskell and Cabal toolchain/workflow. Currently, I am compiling simple Haskell code with C-wrapper into foreign native shared library on Linux. To make the toolchain commands and package loading/(future) dependencies easier to manage, I am doing it with Cabal. I found a reference in this site (among others):
 http://www.vex.net/~trebla/haskell/so.xhtml
 At first, I missed key point:
 &quot;The Haskell code is to be listed under other-modules.&quot;
 I did not set the other-modules field and my build wasnt working. Now it works. But I wanted to ask why the name of the field was chosen as to other-modules, since it actually makes the connection between Haskell code and the C code wrapper? Without having the clue that &quot;it doesnt work without it,&quot; I would never try to search for something like that ...
 Let me know if this is not the correct place to ask this question and where would a better place for that be.

                    <span>I&#x27;m looking for a lib that would allow me to build up a markdown doc using some DSL out of primitives (Blocks, Inlines, etc) and then simply convert it to a &#x60;Text&#x60; representation (i.e. render into text).
 This seems like such an easy thing to do, I&#x27;ve googled for potential solutions to this however and I&#x27;m having a real hard time figuring out how to do this with current libs available on hackage.
 I&#x27;ve looked at &#x60;cmark&#x60; &#x60;mmark&#x60;, even &#x60;pandoc&#x60; to no avail. It seems to me that libs like &#x60;mmark&#x60; are designed to only parse markdown documents, ensure conformity to standards, and render to html.
 I thought &#x60;pandoc&#x60; would be my saving grace (which I reluctantly tried to use since it&#x27;s such a large dependency), their &#x60;Block&#x60; DSL seems fine, but even &#x60;pandoc&#x60; does not have something like &#x60;render :: Pandoc -&gt; Text&#x60;. It does have &#x60;writeMarkdown :: PandocMonad m &#x3D;&gt; WriterOptions -&gt; Pandoc -&gt; m Text&#x60; but i really want to have a pure rendering function without all this &#x60;PandocMonad&#x60; complication (which seems superfluous if I want to render into a simple &#x60;Text&#x60; doc).
 (https://hackage.haskell.org/package/pandoc-2.14.0.2/docs/Text-Pandoc-Writers-Markdown.html) 
 Anyone has a suggestion?

                    <span>I have a Haskell project that I&#x27;ve been working on over the last few years.
 One thing I absolutely love about Haskell is that its so easy to refactor with confidence, for example renaming and changing types, and the compiler flags any issues early on.
 What I would like to do now is to consolidate the names of parameters. So for example, I started with a function for working with indices and counts of elements.
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 indicesRemaining :: Cnt -&gt; Idx -&gt; [Idx]
 indicesRemaining cnt idx &#x3D; 
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 and say I&#x27;ve renamed the types to be clearer, using a global find-replace:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 indicesRemaining :: BlockCnt -&gt; BlockIdx -&gt; [BlockIdx]
 indicesRemaining cnt idx &#x3D; 
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 this is great, but I&#x27;d like to also update cnt and idx, to be blkCnt and blkIdx, for example. I can do in manually, but I&#x27;ve done a load of refactorings, so have a load of these.
 What I am looking for is a tool that can run over my code-base, and spurt out a list of types, and all the different variables names used by that type. So, if I have the following code:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; indicesRemaining :: BlockCnt -&gt; BlockIdx -&gt; [BlockIdx]
 indicesRemaining blkCnt blkIdx &#x3D; 
 indexWithinCnt :: BlockCnt -&gt; BlockIdx -&gt; Bool
 indexWithinCnt cntMax idx &#x3D; 
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Then, I am looking for something like the following output:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; BlockCnt : blkCnt, cntMax
 BlockIdx : blkIdx, idx
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 And I can then go through and manually review cases where lots of different names exist for the same thing.
 Is anyone aware whether something like this already exists? If not, I was wondering if HIE would be a good tools to build something like this on top of??
 Best wishes, and thanks in advance.
 Mike

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been playing around with the ComonadCofree typeclass from free and I stumbled across this cute little function:
 explore :: (ComonadCofree f w, MonadFree f m) &#x3D;&gt; (w a -&gt; m b -&gt; m b) -&gt; w a -&gt; m b explore f &#x3D; wrap . fmap (\w -&gt; f w (explore f w)) . unwrap 
 I&#x27;ve been calling it explore because it behaves as a kind of fold over a cofree comonad into a free monad: the first argument to f is the part of the comonadic &quot;environment&quot; that&#x27;s getting &quot;explored&quot; in this step, and the second argument is the future monadic &quot;exploration&quot; that covers the &quot;rest of the environment&quot;.
 Is this a thing? I haven&#x27;t been able to find anything on Hackage with exactly this functionality, but I&#x27;m afraid I don&#x27;t quite have the categorical vocabulary to easily tell if it&#x27;s a special case of a definition in adju…</span>

                    <span>Hi All,
 Hoping you can help. I use a bunch of files as part of org - specifically dailies and unique files that are from org-roams concepts. I add todo items to all (but mostly the dailies). I&#x27;m finding that some of my files are not being added to org-agenda automatically even though I&#x27;m using the config below. Am I doing something wrong here?
  (setq org-agenda-files (apply &#x27;append (mapcar (lambda (directory) (directory-files-recursively directory org-agenda-file-regexp)) &#x27;(&quot;/Users/ochaa/Code/org/&quot;))))

 I&#x27;m getting this &quot;simple date&quot; from (org-read-date), which I would&#x27;ve thought would give various formats. Basically, I&#x27;d like to have a date as exemplified in the title, and be able to determine which day of the week it falls on (i.e. Thursday, Friday, whatever).

                    <span>Hi! I&#x27;m mostly a Java guy, but with the new functional bits in Java I found Scala people many times have already developed good practices for things we are still struggling with, so I&#x27;m asking here.
 Recently there is a trend in my workplace to replace null-friendly values with Optional, so (simplified case, you get the idea)
 NamedObject obj &#x3D; ..... if(obj &#x3D;&#x3D; null){ return &quot;no object, so no name&quot; } else { return obj.name(); } 
 becomes
 Optiona opt &#x3D; .... return opt.map(NamedObject::name).orElse(&quot;no object, so no name&quot;) 
 I like that, but I don&#x27;t know how to handle logging. When I have
 NamedObject obj &#x3D; ..... if(obj &#x3D;&#x3D; null){ logger.warn(&quot;there was no object&quot;) return &quot;no object, so no name&quot; } else { logger.debug(&quot;using actual name of the object&quot;) return obj.name(); } 
 What would be the proper way to keep the logging functionality in a more functional way?

                    <span>I am trying to use SQL JDBC Driver in my project . I ran a spark job locally and I can see that the code is working fine.
 When I try to make a fat JAR of the code (using SBT-Assembly) and run it , I get an error saying that some method in SQL JDBC Driver module is not found (methodNotFound Exception).
 I checked the JAR file and as far as I can see the class file that provides the method in question is present in the JAR. 
 I have been breaking my head over this. Please help

                    <span>Hi, I am trying to configure notmuch for using with emacs.
 Is it possible to tell notmuch/emacs to take into account the Content-Type and Content-Transfer-Encoding to translate the raw email content and show characters with accents instead. For example &quot;Programação&quot; instead of &quot;ProgramaÃ§Ã£o&quot; ?

                    <span>A bit off-topic but someone might know; I&#x27;m working with jupyter notebook files (ipynb) which are basically json files. Git diff is very noisy so there&#x27;s nbdime which works great in the CLI. Is there a way to have Magit aware of its integration with git diff?

                    <span>Hi everyone,
 I&#x27;m trying to use languagetool with Emacs to correct both grammar and syntax while I write in French and English. 
 I&#x27;ve tried this package but for some reason, it doesn&#x27;t work, it just exits with an error code, whatever the language. 
 Did someone manage to have this working with multiple languages by any chance ? 
 Thanks

                    <span>Is there any way to do this? I&#x27;d like all my org mode files to be part of an &quot;org project&quot;, regardless of their locations. I use projectile, ibuffer, ibuffer-projectile, and (obviously) org-mode.
 At the moment I&#x27;ve got:
 (setq org-directory &quot;~/.emacs.d/config/org/&quot;) (setq ibuffer-saved-filter-groups (quote [...] (&quot;orgproject&quot; (or (name . &quot;^\\*Org Agenda\\*$&quot;) (mode . org-mode))) 
 which I thought would do it, but it doesn&#x27;t. I expected all buffers with org-mode active would be listed within an &quot;orgproject&quot; group in ibuffer, and files that are in the org-directory are in that group, but files that are in other directories, even though they&#x27;re open and in org-agenda-files, just go into a general group in ibuffer.

Is there a text base web browser that can let me browse youtube but with the text only(not youtube specific, but the web page with tone of javaish thing?)? Because I’m just install gnu guix with exwm yesterday. have no idea what browser I can use. eww just give me a search bar and the rest is just blank.

                    <span>I am trying to use shakle to tame the pop ups that I have (in combination with popper). One case I have is AUCTeX which displays a list of errors if the document fails to compile. Clicking on an error brings up a new window which shows details of the error.
 I wanted to set it so that the list of errors appear at the bottom and then the error description appears at the right of the error list. I tried the following
  (setq shackle-rules &#x27;((&quot;*TeX errors*&quot; :select t :align below :size 0.2) (&quot;*TeX Help*&quot; :select t :align right :size 0.5))) 
 Now, if I have a window displaying the latex file, the list of errors appears at the bottom as expected, but then clicking on an error adds a vertical window spanning the whole interface (both the latex buffer and the error list buffer) instead of splitting the window which displays &quot;TeX errors&quot;. 
 Is there a way to get my desired window splitting?

                    <span>Hey, I want to configure the ivy-rich-display-transformers-list variable from the ivy-rich package. More precisely, I just want to remove the (ivy-rich-switch-buffer-project (:width 0.18 :face success)) part of it, that shows to which project a buffer belongs when switching buffers. Redefining the entire variable without this bit clutters my config a lot since this variable has a lot of content. Is there a few to just remove that bit from the original value of the variable? I tried to do it using my limited elisp, but I couldn&#x27;t do it even in a semi-elegant way. Any tips there? Cheers!

 I tried setting it in many sized, but all of them turns out like this
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; (use-package doom-modeline

 :custom ((doom-modeline-height 25))) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 And i have all-the-icons installed, and did run all-the-icons-install-fonts as well. Any solutions?

                    <span>I learned about M-x auto-insert from this blog post: Lesser known functionalities in core Emacs, and it made me wonder if something similar exists for inserting the file local variable comments at the end of a file?
 I can never remember the syntax, and I don&#x27;t use it often enough to learn it, so it would be most helpful if I could go M-x insert-file-local-variable or something.
 Ok, so this is where Emacs is great:
 After I remembered that it is called &quot;file local variables&quot; I did M-x apropos file-local and found... add-file-local-variable which does exact what I wanted.
 So the answer is: Yes!

 Don&#x27;t feel constrained in regards to what you post, just keep your post vaguely, generally on the topic of emacs.

                    <span>I am writing an Emacs Lisp package&#x27;s documentation with Org mode. Currently, I am manually exporting the document to the Texinfo format, but I sometimes forget to do this.
 Is there a way to automate this, beyond just using after-save-hook? 
  
Could this be done by Emacs when installing the package?
 Could this be done by Github after I push to the repo?
 Are there existing packages that have automated this step?
  
Thank you.

                    <span>As in here. I couldn&#x27;t figure out a way to do it with Data.TASequence.ConsList. I want to maintain type-aligned-ness in my data structure, but since type information only includes the types of the beginning and the end, I suspect it might be hard to write a function with the right type signature like so:
 split :: ConsList a z -&gt; ConsList a b -&gt; ConsList b z
 or even just:
 tail :: ConsList a z -&gt; ConsList b z
 Alternatively, is this possible using free monads?

                    <span>I am new to both but the documentation for Elm seems to complement what I am learning in the Haskell book Programming from First Principles. 
 Are functional programs similar to each other in the way that imperative languages are to each other?
 My guess is yes but I&#x27;d like to hear detailed explanations from functional veterans.

                    <span>I have just finished the first article or a substantial post if you like , where Zettelkasten did help me to gather ideas, combine them and produce something valuable (on how to choose the statistical significance level for your AB-tests and what effect does the choice have).
I happily published it and.. what do you, guys, usually do with the articles of yours then?
The final article definitely does contain some valuable knowledge (valuable to me certainly). If I have found something like this on the internets, I would probably compose several zettles out of it and saved to the local storage for references (I tend to not just link to the web, but also store referred things locally so they don&#x27;t disappear).
But in this particular case, zettels the article was based on do exist already, there&#x27;s nothing new to extract. What do you usually do with the work of yours?
- Do you still add it to your Zettelkasten as a giant Zettel?
- Or do you store it and make a dummy zettel just so that you have a link to this reference in ZK?
- Or do you review your existing zettels that contributed to the article and add a reference to the final target?

- Or something else?</span>

                    <span>So here&#x27;s the setup. I&#x27;ve got two projects. 
 f:\project-base
 f:\project-base\specific-case
 I cannot change the layout of these projects; they&#x27;re not under my control.
 It&#x27;s legitimate to want to compile project-base on its own. However, most of the time I want to compile specific-case.
 Both project-base and specific-case have .dir-locals.el files, and I&#x27;m using the files to define relative paths to tools and the like. I&#x27;ve defined an override variable that I can set within a hydra called project--path-override. However, if I invoke my hydra while visiting a buffer that&#x27;s in project-base, it uses the .dir-locals.el from that directory. That&#x27;s kind of as I expect, but if my override is set, I&#x27;d like to figure out a way to use the locals from the override directory.
 Even if I invoke the hydra and set the default-directory to the project--path-override and call (hack-dir-local-variables-non-file-buffer), the local variables from project-base are still set.
 I don&#x27;t really want to have to defvar all of these configuration variables somewhere and update them every time I switch project directories; being free of that management is exactly why I&#x27;m using .dir-locals.el in the first place. 
 I also thought that I might be able to create a fake buffer as part of invoking the hydra, but that seems like a needless mess of its own. 
 Anyone have a more manageable solution? I can always switch back to a file in specific-case, but I often forget to do that and launch a compile in the wrong directory first. Plus, I&#x27;m doing most of my work in project-base, so I end up having to visit random files that I actually don&#x27;t care about in specific-case just to get the vars to be set right. (I could also modify the .dir-locals.el in project-base to match the one in specific-case, but this falls apart if I ever try to do anything in specific-case2.)

                    <span>Figured I&#x27;d ask here before wasting a bunch of time trying to figure this one out on my own, since Googling and C-h i haven&#x27;t turned up easy solutions yet.
 When I write docstrings in my Lisp code, I like the source to be auto-filled so that line breaks appear in sensible places, but I don&#x27;t like those auto-filled newlines to appear in the runtime versions of those docstrings (since the line width may vary between my editor and whatever is printing the docstring). To that effect, I&#x27;ve been using auto-fill-mode to insert newlines as appropriate, and then manually putting backslash characters at the end of each broken lines. This is undesirable for a few reasons, including that it means auto-fill makes some lines longer than will fit once I&#x27;ve added a space and a backslash.
 Is there any way to get fill-paragraph to insert these backslashes for me?

 I tried to employ tramp on Emacs of windows through putty.(Emacs 27.2 on windows)

 I set tramp method as:

 ​
 What&#x27;s wrong with my usage of plink against tramp?

                    <span>one day, i configured two variables instead of one. &quot;it&#x27;s just one variable&quot;, i said to myself. another day i wrote a function. &quot;what gives, everybody does one or two when they&#x27;re young&quot; i said. then i wrote my first minor mode. i thought, what&#x27;s life without risks? #yolo, after all. then, before i know, i was writing elisp packages, compiling Emacs from git every week. i even tried EXWM at one point, and that was when i grasped the grim reality: i was addicted, consumed, never to be fully restored. i needed help nobody can give, care nobody can take. i had fallen into an abyss, and it is now but a matter of time before i hit the ground.
 mothers, fathers, elder siblings. listen to your little fellows when they come to you, and say &quot;my friends are trying something&quot;, or if they say &quot;when i grow up, i want to customise my text editor&quot;. i beg you, deliver them from this.. this... evil. or else, you may have to watch them edit-last-kbd-macro, with your hands tied, and heart broken. i was young, alone, and misguided, but you&#x27;re adults and you can understand. listen to this lost soul!

                    <span>There are very few things I like about working in LibreOffice, but one of them is the ability to select a sentence with a triple mouse click, or a paragraph with a quadruple click. I guess this is similar to using &quot;expand-selection&quot;, but I wonder if it&#x27;s possible to mimic the LibreOffice behaviour. Any ideas?

                    <span>I would like to compile gruvbox theme to single elisp file without any external dependency, such as auto-themer. So I can configure it once and load it like this, before any other code in my init.el file. I try to speed up load time. I already found very old version of this theme in repo history, but it doesn&#x27;t have all necessary color changes, as latest one have.

                    <span>Hi, 
 I&#x27;m using mbsync and mu4e with a very large IMAP tree. It takes ages to update. On the other hand, thunderbird very quickly updates the inboxes. I suspect that thunderbird has more frequent checks (polling the IMAP server for new messages) for inboxes compared to other folders. Is something similar possible in mysync ? Right now, the delay between reception on the server and mu4e updating is just too long. 
 Cheers

                    <span>Hi all !
 I&#x27;m looking for a solution to switch between tabs (tab-bar) using ivy counsel. Like bookmarks can visibly be integrated into the list of possible completion in counsel-switch-buffer and was wondering if we could add also a list of tabs for switching to them ? Anybody tried to do something similar ?

                    <span>Hi all,
 A super noob question but I&#x27;ve been digging into theming (as one does) and wanted to know how to tell if a theme is a &quot;color theme&quot; or a &quot;custom theme&quot;? I&#x27;m inclined to go with the &quot;color theme&quot; variant as it seems to be super easy to reset to the original state. Also I am only wanting color changes and not interface changes (yet).
 As an example monokai for emacs.
 Thanks!

                    <span>Hi :) I&#x27;m slightly confused and perhaps some of you can help me. Last year it seemed like Helm might end up being archived eventually: https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm/issues/2386
 Now he seems to be back but I couldn&#x27;t find any announcements or similar. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, though! I&#x27;m extremely happy that he&#x27;s back and helm is maintained but I&#x27;m curious what changed and if I just missed some announcement 🙂

                    <span>Hi, When I type and latex formula and toggle org-latex-preview, the rest of the line got the different background. The reverse happens when I just type a symbol like \pi and toggle org-toggle-pretty entities, symbol got a different background. 
 Here is a demo: https://ibb.co/BzNbmmf
 How to make everything same color?
 Thank you!

                    <span>Hi all, I have a new notation for rendering function application and composition at the type level. It may make some Haskell concepts clearer and may be useful for expressing other things such as complicated logical combinators
 The change is simple, just write the function result type on a 3-D plate and have the function argument type orbit it--hence the term orbit diagram. It&#x27;s rendered in orthographic perspective. Something about the extra dimension and the clear difference between domain and codomain make it easier to see what&#x27;s going on when function types get complicated. In particular it helped me grasp the Yoneda lemma and continuation-passing style better
 More info in the readme and some examples can be found in the following repo:

                    <span>I want to get better at the language, and the way to achieve that (that makes the most sense to me) is to apply for a job to be trained. So I&#x27;ve been job hunting for Haskell positions. 
 Naturally, I got rejected from most of the applications. I&#x27;m expecting to get rejected in all, tbh. Getting rejected doesn&#x27;t bother me though since I&#x27;m pretty new to Haskell anyway. This is pretty much the only expected outcome.
 Anyway, I&#x27;m more concerned with how I can get my first step through an internship. It (internship) appears to be non-existent in the Haskell industry, which it makes it difficult to get some really good hands-on training with the proper learning environment. So with that, it seems like internship is pretty much impossible. I noticed a common expectation among the rejection messages that I&#x27;m expected to have more experience with the language. But getting this experience is rather difficult, and I don&#x27;t really see a clear path to obtain a decent enough experience with it.
 I&#x27;m wondering: 
  
Do personal projects hold any weight in the deliberation process?
 Is contributing to Haskell OSS the only/better way for people to validate that I know something?
 Do I just work for free?
 How do I know what I&#x27;m doing isn&#x27;t a bad approach without anyone there to program with or to act as a mentor? I&#x27;m pretty much alone in self-learning. I tried streaming but it&#x27;s sometimes very distracting, and really daunting.
  
This post isn&#x27;t meant to gather pity from others, please don&#x27;t pity me! I just want to know what I should focus on doing exactly to get a much better chance next time, since this entire thing feels like a chicken and egg situation. If you&#x27;re a business owner, or an employee in a company that uses Haskell in your company, any insight would be much appreciated!
 Thank you

                    <span>AsciiDoc is a plain-text
writing format that tries to combine the readability and intuitiveness of
Markdown with the rigorous requirements of technical authoring and publishing.
It offers power and flexibility without resorting to HTML or tool-specific
extensions for essential syntax such as tables, description lists, footnotes,
or features like automatically generating a table of contents.
This post presents a new AsciiDoc parser and converter in Haskell, called
asciidoc-hs. It has been developed
with the support of a Tweag Open Source Fellowship, and is BSD licensed. It
aims to be the first AsciiDoc processor that can be directly used as a Pandoc
front-end1. It is still far from complete
in terms of AsciiDoc syntax and features, but it hopefully establishes a solid
foundation to build up…</span>

                    <span>Hey there,
 So I use &#x27;Swiper&#x27; but have found that it chugs like crazy on a huge log file (ex: Takes a minute to process a query if its a specific date in a log file).
 I currently use Helm and Company in my config.
 I mention this because I tried employing this workaround in this GitHub post, but it uses Ivy unfortunately:
 https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper/issues/416
 ​
 This is the workaround:
 (global-set-key &quot;\C-s&quot; &#x27;ora-swiper)
 ​
 (defun ora-swiper ()
 (interactive)
 (if (and (buffer-file-name)
 (not (ignore-errors
 (file-remote-p (buffer-file-name))))
 (if (eq major-mode &#x27;org-mode)
 (&gt; (buffer-size) 60000)
 (&gt; (buffer-size) 300000)))
 (progn
 (save-buffer)
 (counsel-grep))
 (swiper--ivy (swiper--candidates))))
 ​
 Any ideas on how to avoid conflicts and what I could use instead? It appears from the workaround the &#x27;counsel-grep&#x27; is the way to go though (which I believe is the front-end for &#x27;ripgrep&#x27;).
 ​
 I&#x27;m assuming I would have to find Helm&#x27;s version of &#x27;swiper--ivy (swiper--candidates)&#x27; instead, but wanted to confirm this.
 ​
 Or should I somehow figure out how to grep the entire file for a search query, and redirect it to a new temporary buffer instead?

                    <span>Hi, 
 Repost with a more descriptive header after suggestion from github-alphapapa. :)
 I am a bit lost and need some help to get nudged in the right direction. 
 Using Doom Emacs and Org mode with Org Roam.
 I&#x27;ve set up a set of org-roam-capture-templates. When I try to create a new file, by entering a filename that does not exist, with Org-roam-find-file (SPC n r f), I am prompted with the Capture templates. 
 Before I set up Capture templates, a new file would be created when I entered a filename that did not exist.
 What I want is for the file to be created, as it did before I set up Capture templates.
 I&#x27;ve tried Googling and reading in the manual, but I must be missing it.
 Does anyone know what I can read up on and provide a link, or maybe let me know what I&#x27;ve missed? If you let me know what I&#x27;ve missed, I would be very grateful if you could tip me on what I should have read in order to figure it out myself.
 Thanks in advance!

                    <span>I am running into a weird issue with Emacs recently. I am declaring directory-local variable in a .dir-locals.el, e.g., 
 ((nil . ((pyvenv-workon . &quot;fancy-python-env&quot;)))) 
 When I open a file in the same directory as my .dir-locals.el for the first, emacs used to ask me whether to mark the newly declared variable as safe. But recently, I must have messed something up in emacs config because it longer asks me, but simply prints a warning message:
 Ignoring unsafe file local variable: pyvenv-workon 
 Any way I can revert to the previous behavior of Emacs regarding local variables?

                    <span>In Emacs Lisp, is there a built in system or third party package that helps you trace variables?
 I’m thinking of two ways I might want to do this. 
  
Like trace-function, but for variables i.e. producing a log of updates to a variable
 With a “watch list” buffer like IDEs usually have that updates defined variables or expressions when the variables change
  
I looked through the manual and searched a bit and have not really found anything. This seems like such obvious functionality though so I feel like I must have just missed it. Thought I’d ask here before rolling my own. 
 How are people tracing variables in Elisp?

                    <span>I have a somewhat ugly library I wrote for personal use that sends out emails in bulk when I&#x27;ve finished a task (in this case, grading student papers). Right now I use high-level functions to compose an email in a message-mode buffer via mu4e. But it seems like it would be smarter to just assemble the email as a string (or maybe in a hidden buffer) and then send it using sendmail-program. Has anyone done this kind of thing, and is it hard? I can keep using mu4e if it&#x27;s the best option, but it&#x27;s somewhat slow and I&#x27;d like to reduce the latency if possible. thanks!

                    <span>Applying cl-prettyprint in a function with lines ending in &quot;\n&quot;
 (insert &quot;| Title |Description |\n&quot;) (insert &quot;|  |  |\n&quot;) (insert &quot;|--|--|\n&quot;) 
 results in them converted to 
 (insert &quot;| Title |Description | &quot;) (insert &quot;|  |  | &quot;) (insert &quot;|--|--| &quot;) 
 Is this supposed to be normal behaviour?
 Is there some way to write the linefeeds which will prevent this from happening?

                    <span>Edit: I fixed it. It was the package powerline, which modifies the way the minibuffer looks. I just disabled it.
 I&#x27;ve upgraded to 27.2 (Windows). My minibuffer has trippled in size (vertically). 
 I&#x27;ve tried this to no avail:
 (setq resize-mini-windows nil) 
 I specifically get my emacs windows binaries from here if it matters: https://vigou3.gitlab.io/emacs-modified-windows/
 Anyone know how to fix this minibuffer problem?

                    <span>I am currently trying to figure out which library I shall use for the following scenario:
  
application will query a REST service that serves XML (preferred) or JSON
 that XML links to other endpoints that might get queried depending on user-interaction
 the served XML changes infrequently, usually less than once every 2h
  
Because the data gets changed relatively seldomly and I don&#x27;t want to query too much (rate-limits) I want to cache the responses.
 Is anyone doing something similar? What library can you recommend?
  
Currently I am thinking about the following options:
  
hedis: seems a good suit but I will need to figure out Redis
 acid-state or TCache: seem the next best suit?
 beam-sqlite: seems sub-optimal as I don&#x27;t really need persistence but I am familiar with it
  
What options/libraries am I overlooking? Preferably, I would like a more light-weight solution and avoiding pulling in too many dependencies.

                    <span>I think we should write as follows:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; [alpha, beta, gamma]
 &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&gt;
 [ alpha , beta , gamma ] &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 First, it is the friendliest with diff tools. Second, those commas separate the expressions and also separate the lines. Last, it is symmetrical.

                    <span>I am happy to announce that I have released my new library - rrb-vector. It provides an implemention of the RRB-Vector data structure, which can be used as an alternative to Data.Sequence.Seq a (from the containers package).
 It supports very fast indexing/updating and iteration (faster than for Seq a), while other operations, like concatenation, append, prepend, take, drop, etc. are also quite efficient. Most of the operations have a complexity of O(log n), but since the logarithms are base 16, that behaves more like O(1) in most cases.
 For more information, see the documentation on Hackage. I&#x27;d be happy for your feedback!

                    <span>This is something I&#x27;ve been trying to do for a while: have an all-day event (like a vacation, or a holiday) marked in a different color than the other events on the agenda so it stands out and easy to find later (good use-case example for me: marking sick days so I can later write them out on our monthly reports). 
 It&#x27;s a bit long, but it contains a lot of different bits of information I hope you&#x27;d find useful. Enjoy!

                    <span>I have two diaries I have written in org-mode, and both of them have entries in top-level headlines, where the next line is an inactive timestamp, like:
 * This is an top-level headline :headlines:orgmode:reddit: [2021-06-14 Mon 13:19] Diary entry goes here. Lots of multiline text. 
 Originally, these diary entries were in reverse chronological order. At some point, I forgot and started adding new entries at the bottom of the document. At this point, the change in order is about halfway through the document. I know I could start moving individual headlines up to the top, one by one, with M-S-up/down, but there are hundreds of entries, and I&#x27;d rather do one command that sorts the entire document.
 Is there an org-mode command that will sort all of the headlines in the document based on the inactive timestamp? Preferably with the options of either chronological or reverse chronological order?

                    <span>For Python I know the open-source library great_expectations. Since we use Spark with Scala, I&#x27;d like to know what my options are for libraries that do something similar in Scala. Thanks.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve looked at various templating engines and Scala.js frameworks/APIs, Twirl etc., but all of them appear to be either purely client-side or server-side. Does anything like this exist on the JVM? 
 In some ways it feels like using a template engine, but the end-user experience is much nicer, because data is streamed from the server and everything is written on/for the backend. Almost, like a hybrid between, say, Twirl and Scala.JS/Laminar, except that client-server communication appears to be entirely transparent to the developer.

                    <span>Hi all!   I have just discovered Zettelkasten via Sonke Ahrens&#x27;s book (How to take smart notes).  I have downloaded ZKN3, and have noticed all &#x27;how to&#x27; videos on youtube are all in German.  Can anyone provide me with any links in English to help me get started?
Many thanks</span>

                    <span>This post could just as easily have gone in the Workflows category, but I ultimately thought it would live better here.
I have been debating about the use of so-called &quot;literature notes&quot; for a while now (actually, since I first learned of them). The definition seemed a bit nebulous. Reading Ahrens&#x27;s book, I got the impression that literature notes were more or less bibliographic entries. They had references to some pages along with keywords and key ideas, but were mostly used for reference. And, being so, they were stored. They were permanent.
Then, reading here, I got the impression from Christian and many others that literature notes were literally notes taken on the literature (or in a notebook): marginalia, brief comments, reminders, etc. Their goal under this view is to be processed a…</span>

                    <span>At least it&#x27;s not evil-mode!
 This is a joke of course. Centaur-tabs is a great package, and I can see it becoming a nifty part of my workflow, but can&#x27;t help think about how buffer-focused emacs is, and yet, tabs are a pretty standard feature in every editor and browser now. I think the tab-bar is a great visual indicator of the open buffers. And DOOM seems to have some nice integrations for it. 
 Thanks for coming to my TED talk.
 Edit - yes, I&#x27;ve leaned into the buffer-centric workflow for a year or more now but tab-bar mode or whatever it is that centaur-tabs offers works for me. https://xkcd.com/1172/

                    <span>I left Linux over a decade ago for OSX. I started using Emacs about 10 years ago.
 I started fooling around with Linux the other day (Pop OS). I just assumed that installing Emacs via &#x27;apt&#x27; would provide me with Emacs 27.x... No dice.
 To keep up to date on Emacs are people really building from source? Is there a package repo that keeps an up to date version?
 If I&#x27;m going to build it myself are there any options I should consider. It&#x27;s a bit embarrassing that I&#x27;m so used to the install and go experience I&#x27;ve been getting with Emacs on the Mac.
 Edit: Turns out it was org-tempo and org-indent-mode, both of which I believe I added for Emacs 27... I can&#x27;t remember if I upgraded to 27 for a specific reason or not on OS X, so I can forget ahead with 26 for now with those disabled.
 Thanks all.

                    <span>dyncloze is an emacs module (offered via Melpa) for testing yourself on language learning. The core idea is that you can take any piece of text in emacs, and form &quot;clozes&quot; (an Anki terminology), that erase the work in question and let you guess what it should be. For example, you can test, in English &quot;in&quot; vs. &quot;on&quot;, and every location of those words will be replaced by a cloze, denoted by &quot;[ ]&quot; and you are led through each of them and asked to guess each one. At the end, it tells you how well you did.
 In version 0.1, we started with the ability just to test two or more words against each other. With this version, 0.2 (just submitted, not yet updated on Melpa), we add the ability to use regex&#x27;s for testing. That opens the ability to do more useful testing, at least with European languages that have a lot of word variants and word-ending grammatical bits.
 I&#x27;ve added two example files, one for Spanish, one for Portuguese to demonstrate. You can load them up and try out functions such as dyncloze-es-ser-estar, which will let you guess every variant of ser and estar (&quot;eras&quot;, &quot;fui&quot;, &quot;está&quot;, &quot;estaba&quot;, etc.), but you just choose which of the verbs it belongs to: ser or estar. There&#x27;s a similar function that lets you choose between perfect and imperfect tenses.
 If you&#x27;d like to contribute, please open pull requests for the language you are studying with more examples (or fix up an issues with the ones I have).

                    <span>I&#x27;m running Emacs (from Homebrew) in iTerm2(build 3.4.8) on Mac OS Big Sur(11.4), When trying universal negative key C-M-- in Emacs it said &quot;C-M-_ is undefined&quot;, not sure how to make this work since this is quite important key chord to maintain the tempo.
 ​
 It seems that only M-- works, C-- is C-_ which is undo command instead.
 Any ideas? Thanks a lot.

                    <span>Does anyone have the feeling that text in emacs (GUI) doesn&#x27;t look as good as vscode? There&#x27;s something about them or the color theme that looks slightly grainy and not as crisp.

 To give more context, I want to run my tests inside the docker environment and debugger (pdb) with a correct project mapping (so my local path can point to the remote path when debugging and viceversa)
 Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!

                    <span>Hello! I present to you my first emacs package - atp. It&#x27;s intended as a component for writing text editing commands and augmenting modal editing modes. Its main feature is the ability to automatically recognize and highlight things at point and apply commands to highlighted things or active region.
 I started working on this package because I was lookig for a new approach that would help me save a couple of keystrokes on each common task such as copying and pasting text, evaluation of lisp expressions and shell-commands, changing letter case, etc.
 For a year I used a wonderful package &quot;expand-region&quot; for that purpose. Despite it being very smart and useful, it requires 2 actions to select an object under the point. First, the user must navigate to the desired location, and then call er/expand-region to select an object. I thought that the second step was redundant and decided to write a package that will work without it.
 At this moment atp is unstable because it was written in a hurry and my knowledge of elisp and emacs internals isn&#x27;t great. I just wanted to write something usable as soon as I could to check the viability of the chosen approach. Here is a repo and a video that demonstrates how atp works in the context of a tiny modal editing mode.

                    <span>Summary: So a few weeks ago I noticed a simple pattern when I was doing some IO (Maybe a) stuff.
 maybeSomething  return Nothing Just a -&gt; fmap Just $ do moreIOStuff a 
 I found a way of combining &gt;&gt;&#x3D; and traverse so I could just do this instead
 ioStuff &gt;$&gt;&#x3D; \a -&gt; do moreIOStuff a 
 which saves at least a little boilerplate code, but I spent way too much time finding useless patterns (because of my curiosity and I couldn&#x27;t find any of these functions on hoogle) and making the rest of this post.

 So, I was doing that and other similar patterns that involved 2 Functors and using at least 1 as a Monad, but I didn&#x27;t want to use Monad Transformers because I wasn&#x27;t transforming both the IO and Maybe la…</span>

                    <span>Is there a path (and the will) to give Functor a superclass? This excludes Functor F if F has a nominal role

 With this deriving Traversable-like type classes and Distributive becomes possible, as well as type classes with lenses.
 As a reference MonadTrans just got a QuantifiedConstraint superclass
 class (forall m. Monad m &#x3D;&gt; Monad (trans m)) &#x3D;&gt; MonadTrans trans 
 But this will be more challenging, it really depends on if this is something the community wants.

 Should I be concerned with strictness at this point? For example, should I worry about sharing and practice writing code accordingly or be concerned with optimization only when it actually becomes a performance issue?

                    <span>I&#x27;m trying to set up a system in org-mode to manage my family&#x27;s daily chores. I figured org-habit would be the best starting point, but I have a few ideas I&#x27;m not sure how to implement because I&#x27;m pretty new.
 First, I want to assign the same chore (TODO item) to different family members on different days. Say, Mom does the dishes on Monday, I do them Tuesday, one of the children does them Wednesday, etc...
 Second, I want to understand how to build a break down in org-agenda to view the whole chore list for a day, week, etc, or by individual.
 Any links to read or suggestions would be a big help, thanks!

                    <span>Hi all,
 The construction of my aggregate is side-effectful. I need to go to the DB, check for some invariants, then decide if I can construct it or not.
 While with side effect-free construction, I&#x27;d just create a smart constructor in a companion objects. For example:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;scala case class Aggregate(...)
 object Aggregate { def create(...): Either[Error, Aggregate] &#x3D; ??? } &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Since now my creation is side effectful, I consider a few options:
 Option #1 - separate class for the factory
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;scala case class Aggregate(...)
 class AggregateFactory[F[_]](repository: Repository[F]) { def create(...): F[Either[Error, Aggregate]] &#x3D; ??? } &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Then I&#x27;d just pass AggregateFactory around where needed.
 Option #2 - curried smart constructor
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;scala case class Aggregate(...)
 object Aggregate { def create[F[_]](repository: Repository[F])(...): F[Either[Error, Aggregate]] &#x3D; ??? } &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 and then I could pass around just the partially applied create function, e.g.
 scala def factory[F[_]]: ... &#x3D;&gt; F[Either[Error, Aggregate]] &#x3D; Aggregate.create(repository)(_) 
 What do you think is the most idiomatic approach to the side-effectful construction?

                    <span>This is a quirk I ran into recently, and am wondering if someone can provide some insight about it.
 I have an abstract trait with a type param that represents some intermediate representation (IR) that can be converted to the type param:
  trait IR[O] { def toOutput: O } 
 I have a concrete implementation of this trait:
  case class StringIR(data: String) extends IR[(Int, String)] { def toOutput: (Int, String) &#x3D; (data.length, data) } 
 Then I want to define a circe Encoder for the IR trait, assuming the O already has an Encoder.
 This is the first way I implemented it:
  implicit def encoder[O : Encoder, R  Encoder[O].apply(r.toOutput) } 
 But when I try to get an implicit Encoder for StringIR it results in a compiler error:
  diverging implicit expansion for type io.circe.Encoder[StringIR] starting with lazy value currencyEncoder in object Encoder 
 An interesting thing I noticed is that the error doesn&#x27;t always mention the currencyEncoder. Sometimes it&#x27;s other provided encoders.
 So then I implemented the encoder like this:
  implicit def encoder[O : Encoder, R  Encoder[O].apply(r.toOutput) } 
 The only difference is that I&#x27;m using Encoder[R with IR[O]] instead of Encoder[R]. 
 Here&#x27;s a Scastie with a working example: https://scastie.scala-lang.org/alexklibisz/VvnYuNiGS5SN7R5GwV5cHg/25 
 It seems like the implicit resolution doesn&#x27;t know that an Encoder[R with IR[O]] is the same as an Encoder[R]. I know I used Circe here, but I don&#x27;t see how it would be any different for any old type class. Is there any more precise explanation for this?

I use straight.el&#x27;s integration with use-package for managing all my packages. I do this by setting:
 (setq straight-use-package-by-default t) 
 I want to use ebib and biblio together. So, per the ebib manual, I stuck this in my config:
 (use-package ebib-biblio :after (ebib biblio) :bind (:map biblio-selection-mode-map (&quot;e&quot; . ebib-biblio-selection-import))) 
 This didn&#x27;t work. I got a warning that the package ebib-biblio could not be found. I realised that this was because I was using the straight version of use-package, which (only?) looks for packages in the repos, when in this case ebib-biblio is distributes as part of ebib. This didn&#x27;t produce any warnings:
 (use-package ebib-biblio :straight nil ; explicitly override use-package/straight integration :after (ebib biblio) :bi…</span>

                    <span>I have been using emacs for an year now mostly for Clojure development with little bit of golang and python here and there. When i started using emacs here i convinced myself that - it makes me more productive by allowing me to do everything from keyboard - multi language support with packages - highly customisable with thousands of packages and config. - suited for clojure development. - org mode 
 But lately i have been thinking if i was wrong or if my assumptions still holds true, today ides like vs code provide all the above features in a fast modern looking ide.
 So does the question of Emacs vs Modern IDEs boils down to asthetic choice between modern vs classic/vintage or is there any real advantage in using Emacs today.

                    <span>Please take a look at the screenshots of bashtop (example). I&#x27;d say it is one of those terminal applications that have a great user interface.
 What if we can have these for emacs? Well, we have something similar. For example, bui and tui.el. However, afaik the first one only supports multiple columns, in contrast to bashtop where multiple windows of arbitrary size are supported. The second one does not have a screenshot, but it seems a bit promising too.
 TLDR I hope to have/make a general UI for emacs. Any hints?

                    <span>Hi all, 
 As there seems to be a demand for practical Haskell examples/applications, I decided to create a video series to show an example of how such an application could be developed. In this case I chose to show how to process streamed binary satellite data and build a Haskell application for this. This starts with basic things like network connections, conduits, goes over logging, config file handling, command line parsing to parsing the binary ground- and space-protocols involved, threading (for parallel processing chains), STM and finally displaying the results in a graphical user interface (with GTK). 
 This also can serve as an introduction to the AURIS mission control system I am writing in Haskell (on ZuriHac and MuniHac there was some demand for more explanations as the project is a bit intimidating and requires some domain knowledge). So I thought I could combine this and provide some insight into this domain, while showing how such an application could work in Haskell. 
 Each video builds on its predecessor. The current ones are: 
  
Video 1: Introduction and Project Setup 
 Video 2: Network Connections and Conduits 
 Video 3: Configuration Files 
 Video 4: Command Line Arguments 
 Video 5: Parsing the Transport Protocol Layer 
 Video 6: Parsing the TM Transfer Layer 
 Video 7: CRC Check, Interfacing C++, Property Tests 
 Video 8: Logging and the RIO Monad
 
 Further ones are planned, but not yet available.
 I might be going quickly sometimes (as I wanted to focus on certain areas and the videos are already quite long), so if there is a demand for more detailed explanations of certain things, let me know.
 The video series as a Youtube playlist:

                    <span>Compilers for languages such as Rust have seen great success in giving each compiler error a unique error code such as E0119. The code can easily be looked up in official documentation and referred to in forums, StackOverflow, etc.. There is work underway which could lead to the same functionality in GHC.
 I wondered whether there&#x27;s a particularly strong reason for numeric error codes as opposed to human readable identifiers. For example, would conflicting_trait_implementations be a more useful error code than E0119? None of the reasons given in the discussion for avoiding readable error codes rang true for me, and, surprisingly to me, no one at all supported readable error codes.
 Are my instincts completely out of tune on this issue, or would readable error codes have some benefit over numeric ones?

                    <span>As a preface, I am using GHC 8.10.4, and I&#x27;ve read a few posts about hang ups with this version of GHC. My main build tool is Stack so using stack build --fast works just fine, while running stack build (using -O2) does causes the hang up. Some of the suggested comments from the similar posts say to sprinkle in some {- OPTIONS_GHC -O1 -} on the offending files to allow it compile. However, I can&#x27;t seem to find the right one to use it on. 
 My question is: How do I debug this compiler issue? My terminal always hangs up after it prints [ 9 of 17] Compiling Display. Is this the offending file? Or is it something that comes after? 
 Are there any options I can pass to the compiler to get some more verbose output to diagnose the issue?
 Thanks
 EDIT: I&#x27;ve done some brief testing as per /u/manpacket suggested. Display.hs seems to be the offending file. 
 The testing is by no means robust and is simply using stack clean &amp;&amp; stack build each time. The left hand side indicates which instance definitions have had their undefined definition returned to normal. 
 The timings are as follows:
 all undefined - 18.8s storeLoc - 18.9s storeLoc/OperandType - 18.5s storeLoc/OperandType/Operand - 22.7s storeLoc/OperandType/OpCode - 31.8s storeLoc/OperandType/Instruction - 18.8s storeLoc/OperandType/Instruction/CPUState - 43.2s storeLoc/OperandType/CPUState - 42.8s 
 It seems as though the issue stems from the repeated use of ?
 The github repo is here if you want to take a look.

Both of these authors (N and G) made/make prolific use of not only notecards but also non-linear forms of writing their books, that is, jumping around and writing only what they feel like writing about at that time.

                    <span>Hello, long-time observer and new poster here.
So, I have been intrigued by the ideas of both Zettelkasten and commonplace books for a while now, and I am trying to find a synthesis that fits my needs. First, I will give some definitions and differences according to my understanding.
A Zettelkasten is a place to not just store thoughts from other people, but to process them in your own words. The key thing here is linking the notes together to make an idea-generating resource. This can be accomplished with tags and with more direct internal links. Another important aspect is that the notes in the Zettelkasten, zettels, are atomic; that is, they are focused on one thing and one thing only. To summarize (at the risk of simplifying): A Zettelkasten is a network of interconnected, atomic ideas…</span>

                    <span>I want to rename some files on a disk which are linked to an org file. And I am wondering maybe somebody have some custom interactive function for such task/workflow.
 The link to a file look like this:
  [[file:~/Dropbox/SomeFolder/Images/some-long-file-name-min-193x300.png]] 
 The perfect workflow for me would be like so:
  
Place cursor on the link
 press M-x my-rename-file 
 type a new name in a prompt
 get renamed file on the disk and updated link in org file (something like in example below).

                    <span>Hi folks,
 Spent a couple of days now looking at various options for typescript development. Specifically, I&#x27;m interested in some refactoring workflows (extraction, renaming etc).
 There&#x27;s js2-refactor. It relies on js2-mode which appears to be..quirky? It&#x27;s using it&#x27;s own internal linter which doesn&#x27;t seem to support all of the latest TypeScript features.
 I&#x27;m now looking at LSP-mode with typescript, but there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any support for refactoring.
 How are you coding typescript with emacs? Is there robust refactoring support?
 Thanks!

                    <span>With web-mode, I want comment style in .tsx to use // for typescript code (instead of /* */)
 I got that to work with 
 (setq-default web-mode-comment-formats &#x27;((&quot;java&quot; . &quot;/*&quot;) (&quot;javascript&quot; . &quot;//&quot;) (&quot;jsx&quot; . &quot;//&quot;) (&quot;tsx&quot; . &quot;//&quot;) (&quot;php&quot; . &quot;/*&quot;))) 
 but for JSX elements, I still want it to use {/*  */} - 
 for example, if I have a &#x60;.tsx&#x60; file with 
  function()  
 I still want 
  {/* function() *}  
 but it currently does 
  // function()  
 This // causes compilation errors. How do I get around this?

                    <span>Hi there,
 I&#x27;m now learning transient and trying to achieve the following:
 I want to show my main transient, with couple of commands (these are called suffix commands from what I understand)I want &quot;command a&quot; (let&#x27;s say with binding a) to do either
  
DWIM - ie just run some function (here is where I have the problem, I cannot make it show again the main transient window)
 Show a transient with extra options about this command
  
And in both cases I want to then fallback to the &quot;root&quot; transient again, displaying all the commands.
 I implemented this action as another prefix command (sub-prefix as it appears on transient&#x27;s terminology) by providing a body to the transient command 
 (interactive &quot;P&quot;) (if arg (progn ;; when this happens (called wit ha prefix-arg) ;; I can set opts and run th…</span>

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been reading some discussions recently about the security of the Melpa repository, on Reddit and not. 
 The official faq also recommends to install only packages that we can trust.
 I don&#x27;t know how much of this is still relevant, but I was wondering if any of you for programming use Emacs vanilla as it is without third party packages or do you limit yourself to some of them and which ones would you recommend? 
 I&#x27;m asking especially to those who don&#x27;t have time to always review every update and have to weigh the risks.
 Thanks!

                    <span>I&#x27;ve installed lsp-mode and am having trouble getting code completion working for PHP.
 I tried https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/page/lsp-php/ and that worked the first time it was called each editing session and then not afterwards.
 I tried https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/page/lsp-intelephense/ and that didn&#x27;t work at all.
 I tried https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/page/lsp-serenata/ and that also did not work at all, but the information as to how to set up emacs to work with it seems lacking (how is emacs supposed to know it should even be calling it?) so I might not have it set up correctly.
 Has anyone with experience of using this for PHP development got any ideas?

                    <span>I am a new user of emacs. I recently learned about emacs client-server model. So I am in doubt that my understanding might be wrong about this system. So I will try to explain what this client-server model is in terms of emacs and I seek suggestions from this community about the validity of my understanding.
 So client-server model is basically used for utilizing the same running instance of emacs instead of opening up a new session everytime. How emacs does this is it creates a emacs server instance which keeps running in the background . Now if I want to to do something with emacs by using that single instance running in the background I will do so by emacsclient binary. For example if I want to open a file in gui frame (emacsclient -c filename) emacsclient will direct the emacs server to do so. I can create many instances of emacsclient which will use the same emacs server instance that is running in the background. By doing so I can do things in one session. Avoid the time cost of starting up a whole new session and open files quickly. There are different switches for emacsclient and emacs server which one can utilize to use different features provided by both of them. 
 Thats it. This is my current understanding of emacs client-server model and how to use it.

                    <span>Hello:)
 Looking for a good and useful tutorial about optics and lenses. I found some but most of them are some code snippets that a) do not work OoB in GHCI and b) are just some code snippets and no code to read, write off or some exercises with examples.
 Any hint is much appreciated. Thanks:)

                    <span>I&#x27;m an iOS developer by trade, and I feel like learning Haskell and FP has helped me think more about pureness (or being honest).
 I recently finished the Haskell book (the purple one) and would like to learn more, possibly through actually building something. 
 What would be a good next step? Do you guys have any recommendations?
 I feel like I need to learn more theory. Also, I&#x27;m still confused about transformers, natural transformation, to name a few.

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(3 min)</span>
                    <span>Recently I read the ACM Queue article titled &quot;Schrodinger&#x27;s code&quot; concerning undefined behaviors in C so I started to wonder if Haskell has them and how many.
 So quickly I found that obviously Haskell does have them here and there. There are a bunch of unsafe functions, and FFI, etc.
 What baffles me, however, is that C compilers work on the assumption that paths contain UBs are not reachable so the compilers can aggressively remove code paths and optimize code. I personally think this means (if Haskell did the same) all code paths containing bottom values are removed. This actually makes sense in a non-strict language, because the semantics of the remaining parts remain unchanged.
 Therefore, I&#x27;m asking here the question, how well do bottom values relate to UBs (or LLVM undef?) My knowledge about Haskell is still limited so maybe this similarity is just superficial and there&#x27;s no serious conclusion can be drawn here.
 Another question is: will GHC actually do the same kind of optimizations? If yes, how are they justified? If no, why not? I once encountered &gt; (my intent was exactly making it loop). But for other scenarios the bottom values seem to be preserved, and they are even used to cancel tasks (async exceptions).
 edit: The last question is baffling me. If the bottom value can be somehow &quot;caught&quot; like exceptions, are they really bottom values?

                    <span>Okay r/Haskell this is going to take some staging so please bear with me.
 I&#x27;ve endeavoured to write a little Haskell chess web service that works like this: it receives a pair of an FEN string -- a string that fully describes the state of a chess position -- and an UCI string -- a string that describes a chess move -- and returns an SVG representation of the position, highlighting the last position as described by the UCI string.
 Even though Haskell has the excellent https://hackage.haskell.org/package/chessIO, it lacks features of the amazing https://python-chess.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html, especially the coveted exports to .SVG! So I am trying to fill the gap by consuming the Python library as a child process of my Haskell program: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; {-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}

                    <span>Hi,
 The ordered list functionality is great. Is there a way to make the sublist bullets letters rather than numbers, e.g.
 1\. First list item.
 a. first child item (these lines should actually be indented but I don&#x27;t know how to do this in reddit)
 b. second child item
 ​
 Instead of what orgmode currently does, which is:
 1\. First list item.
  
first child item
 second child item
  
​
 Thanks.

                    <span>Hi guys,
 I’ve just setup my first org-mode file and in it I have a hierarchy of headings as follows: Area -&gt; Project -&gt; Task
 Each of the levels above have unique keywords. 
 Now when it comes to agenda views is it possible to only show tasks whose parent (project) has a particular TODO keyword as well as having a particular keyword themselves. 
 For example only show “NEXT” tasks for “CURRENT” projects?
 I’m sure that there must be a way to do this, but my searches have been fruitless - I’m guessing that I’m not using the correct terminology. 
 Thanks in advance!

                    <span>I already have org-journal set up in a way that works for me. Here&#x27;s what I have:
 (setq org-journal-dir (concat org-directory &quot;/Journal/&quot;)) (setq org-journal-file-format &quot;%Y-%m&quot;) (setq org-journal-file-type &#x27;monthly) 
 So I get a new journal file every month. My question is, how would I create an org-capture template to achieve this same behavior?

 I&#x27;m a complete noob and am trying to customize the faces of my TODO keywords. I&#x27;ve dug around and can easily find out how to do this for when you have 1 sequence of TODO keywords, however I&#x27;m struggling when it comes to multiple.
 Here is a snippet from my init.el file for reference:
 (setq org-todo-keywords &#x27;((sequence &quot;AOFR&quot; &quot;|&quot; &quot;AOFR.DONE&quot; &quot;AOFR.CANCELLED&quot;) (sequence &quot;PROJ.URG&quot; &quot;PROJ.PER&quot; &quot;PROJ.CUR&quot; &quot;PROJ.FLW&quot; &quot;PROJ.FUT&quot; &quot;PROJ.SDM&quot; &quot;|&quot; &quot;PROJ.DONE&quot; &quot;PROJ.CANC&quot;) (sequence &quot;NEXT&quot; &quot;WAITING&quot; &quot;LATER&quot; &quot;SOMEDAY&quot; &quot;|&quot; &quot;DONE&quot; &quot;CANCELLED&quot;))) (setq org-todo-keyword-faces &#x27;((&quot;AOFR&quot; . &quot;gray&quot;)))

                    <span>Hi.
 I rewrote my scala2 full-fledged demo app to scala3 improving many aspects including DI, stateful and stateless tests, and more.
 I&#x27;d like to get feedback on what could be done better and of course I hope it could be useful for newer members of Scala community.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve just started using ebib and it&#x27;s awesome. I&#x27;m blown away by it. But there&#x27;s one tiny cosmetic thing I&#x27;d like to fix. I work with resources which often have latex symbols for accents and diacritics in their titles in bibtex files. For example &#x60;The Nya\&#x3D;{y}asu\&#x3D;{\d{t}}ras of Gau\d{t}ama&#x27;.
 I would like these to appear &#x27;correctly&#x27; (rendered) in ebib&#x27;s index window. Could I somehow render the latex to unicode or something, and display that correctly?
 If so, should I? Would this be preferable to just editting the titles to use proper unicode (which is supported by biblatex, and is feasible as there aren&#x27;t too many)? I just want to know if anyone can think of pros/cons either way?
 Thanks.

                    <span>Hi,
 One of the things I miss from living in a shell in a terminal emulator is the history.
 Now, the shell history was never perfect for me, while I loved being able to go back a year and find some obscure cURL/compilation command that I never noted down, I hated that there wasn&#x27;t any nice metadata (working directory) associated with the commands.
 I was wondering if there&#x27;s any emacs equivalent, that will keep history for any shell command functions (there&#x27;s a lot, given that there are project/dired variants), but perhaps for more clever uses that I haven&#x27;t thought of (eshell?)
 My question is: Does this thing already exist before I think about it myself, I think a pluggable framework would be the best approach probably.

                    <span>Hey,
 I installed pdf-tools from Melpa with the command M-x package-install RET pdf-tools RET, and I believe it was successful.
 I then tried to open a PDF with &quot;emacs some.pdf&quot;. It indicates pdf-tools has been launched but it does not show an image of the PDF. It shows the underlying PDF code, I believe.
 I am using Termux, a terminal emulator app. Is this because pdf-tools only works in a GUI environment, in Linux? Or is there something else I should do to make it work?
 Thanks very much.

                    <span>Hi!
 I have been looking for a way to move as efficiently as I do in vim in emacs. In vim, I usually use the relative line numberings to do my movements. This causes issues with folded items in org-mode. Let me illustrate.
 I have the following org file:
 1 I want to 1 2 * Jump over 3 ** this 4 * to here 5 * without overshoot 
 To go to where I want, I&#x27;d do 4j in vim, and C-u 4 C-n in emacs. However, when I fold &quot;Jump over&quot;, I get differing line numberings.
 In vim:
 1 I want to 1 2 +-- 2 lines: * Jump over ......... 3 * to here 4 * without overshoot 
 But in emacs:
 1 I want to 1 2 * Jump over... 4 * to here 5 * without overshoot 
 In vim, 3j takes me where I want. In emacs, C-u 4 C-n, as hinted by the numbering, results in overshoot.
 From my search (e.g. here https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/6i8nu3/question_for_evilmode_users_folding_and_relative/) the vim behavior has not been possible in emacs. Is this still the case?
 This type of movement is very fundamental for my workflow, especially when programming with my voice (being able to say &quot;one four dip just&quot; to delete 14 lines down, for example).
 Is there any way to achieve equally efficient vertical movement in emacs?

                    <span>To give some context:
 I wanted to create a custom function to insert picture with a pre-filled directory.
 First, I ran counsel-describe-bindings to see what C-c C-l invokes. When I found out it is the org-insert-link function, I tried to look at its documentation via counsel-describe-function. My initial guess was that you can invoke it via a prefix. But no luck.
 After some Googling around, I found out that you need to use the read-file-name function. However, when I tried to find this function in the org-insert-link source code, it is not there. So my question is how can I make this connection?
 Do I have to just try my luck and search for something remotely relatable to what I&#x27;m looking for?

                    <span>I have a feeling that Jupyter notebooks in nowadays remind me org-mode in Emacs.
 Both can be used:
 for text notes;
 for structuring text with markdown;
 for keeping tasks in TODO lists;
 for managing projects (sort of).
 If you have tried both, can you add your thoughts on this comparison?

                    <span>Lately I&#x27;ve been test driving Fedora Silverblue, an emerging distribution where the root filesystem is read-only and everything is done with Flatpaks and containers. So far it&#x27;s pretty cool.
 If you aren&#x27;t familiar with toolbox it&#x27;s a nice wrapper around Podman that makes working with ad-hoc containers super easy.
 I have emacs in a flatpak and a toolbox with my C development environment installed. My goal was to hook them together so that I could use Eglot to develop C programs like I normally do.
 There&#x27;s the docker-tramp project but this didn&#x27;t work right for me... not sure what the issue was. The wonderful emacs wiki has a page on Tramp and Docker with some example code. So, I took it and modified it to use toolbox:
 (push (cons &quot;toolbox&quot; &#x27;((tramp-login-program &quot;flatpak-spawn --host toolbox&quot;) (tramp-login-args ((&quot;enter&quot; &quot;-c&quot;) (&quot;%h&quot;))) (tramp-remote-shell &quot;/bin/sh&quot;) (tramp-remote-shell-args (&quot;-i&quot;) (&quot;-c&quot;)))) tramp-methods) 
 Now I can C-x C-f /toolbox:fedora-toolbox-34: and open any file from inside the toolbox environment. I installed ccls in the toolbox and then Eglot was up and running. How about vterm-toggle? Like a charm... dropped me directly into a shell. Super cool.
 It seems like a few flaming hoops to jump through, and it&#x27;s not a wrong assessment either. But when it&#x27;s all working it&#x27;s completely transparent and quite amazing, considering that Emacs and the development tools are running in different containers. Neat!

                    <span>Hey there,
 Just started a new job doing support for a cybersecurity firm, and there is a ton of log searching involved.
 Basically, I&#x27;ll have to rip through logs to figure out what certain parameters exist in a client&#x27;s environment based upon a support packet that they send.
 This involves Docker, Ansible, Python 3, CentOS, etc.
 My last job involved examining logs sometimes but not all the time, so naturally I used Emacs via Swiper. I never did really get to the point where I felt comfortable looking through logs though. I would often use &quot;Ediff&quot; to compare two files, and take screenshots for Zendesk, but nothing too fancy.
 This time around though, its a bit more involved so I&#x27;m asking for some Emacs Wizards to help me find some suitable new packages to pump my config with.
 This being noted, I have to use GCP (Google Cloud Provider) to then SSH into a related sandbox environment. On that note, can Tramp be used in that scenario to make those two hops (aka to a GCP box, and then to an ssh box?)
 ​
 For the main topic though, does anyone have any good ideas on any packages that are great at grepping through a bunch of logs, and also how to re-direct anything that&#x27;s found into separate files? 
 ​
 So far though, I&#x27;ve been able to connect through &#x27;ansi-term&#x27; just fine but would love to somehow take that same terminal connection and do some more crazy Emacs stuff with it. 
 ​
 Very curious to see what people have in mind. The only thing I could think of is to maybe use Sunrise Commander instead of Dired :)

                    <span>Python is 100 MB, Chocolatey needs 362 MB for msys64 but bootstrap-haskell-1.0.1 needs for msys64 2.51 GB and the code in GHC is more difficult to patch and add features than re-write tools. Haskell lost its logical appeal with its simplicity long time ago but the speed of GHC continuos growth is on colission with logic.

                    <span>Hi folks,
 I am running into the problem of internationalizing my Haskell application. Do you know any good approaches or libraries to use? I only found libraries like i18n or hgettext, both of which seem quite dated.

 in one of my project, I need to do some manipulation and transformation of Haskell source code files and AFAIK ghc-exactprint is the right tool for that. Unfortunately I have zero experience with this one, there seems not to be any more detailed documentation/tutorial examples. What is the best way how to learn this library? Can you recommend any sources?
 Thank you.

                    <span>Hi,
 I currently maintain my SQL notes (for example) in a .txt file. (Yes, I&#x27;m on Windows).
 For this, I manually maintain a TOC on top of the file. Actually this is more like an index, because it is sorted alphabetically. Each title is followed by some sort of unique code, that links to the actual note further in the same .txt file. When I need to lookup something, I lookup the topic in the TOC, select the unique code it and then do a find for that code. This is indeed a primitive system, but it works with any text editor.
 But lately I discovered (Doom) emacs and org-mode and I want to move my notes to emacs. I&#x27;d like to auto generate the TOC and sort it alphabetically. I found the package toc-org but as far as can see the TOC is not sorted. 
 How do you keep notes and navigate to in org mode ? (I&#x27;m a newbie so this could be a silly question)
 Thanks for your input !

                    <span>quickCheck :: forall prop. Testable prop &#x3D;&gt; prop -&gt; Effect Unit 
 The type Result is an instance of the Testable class, so properties retuning a Result can be tested by quickCheck.
 I have a property that I would like to test, but it happens to return an Effect Result instead of a pure Result, mainly because it does some debug logging to the console.
 someProperty :: String -&gt; Effect Result 
 It is possible to test this property using quickCheck anyway?

                    <span>I was playing a bit with ZIO Stream and encountered few situation I&#x27;d like to clear up. Let&#x27;s say we have:
 val text &#x3D; &quot;A B A B A &quot; Stream .repeatEffectWith(ZIO.succeed(text), Schedule.recurs(1)) .tap(putStrLn(_)) .transduce(ZTransducer.splitOn(&quot; &quot;)) .tap(putStrLn(_)) .groupByKey(identity) { case (word, stream) &#x3D;&gt; stream .tap(x &#x3D;&gt; putStrLn(&quot;aggStreamBefore &quot; + x)) .scan((0, word)){case (acc, _) &#x3D;&gt; (acc._1 + 1, word)} .tap(x &#x3D;&gt; putStrLn(&quot;aggStreamAfter &quot; + x.toString)) } .tap(x &#x3D;&gt; putStrLn(x.toString + &quot;\n&quot;)) .runCollect .flatMap(chunk &#x3D;&gt; putStrLn(chunk.mkString(&quot;, &quot;))) .exitCode 
 ​
 A B A B A A B A B A aggStreamAfter (0,A) aggStreamAfter (0,B) (0,A) (0,B) aggStreamBefore A aggStreamBefore B A B A B A A B A B A aggStreamAfter (1,A) (1,A) aggStreamBefore A aggStreamAfter (2,A) (2,A) aggStreamBefore A aggStreamAfter (3,A) (3,A) aggStreamBefore A aggStreamAfter (4,A) (4,A) aggStreamBefore A aggStreamAfter (5,A) (5,A) aggStreamBefore A aggStreamAfter (6,A) (6,A) aggStreamAfter (1,B) (1,B) aggStreamBefore B aggStreamAfter (2,B) (2,B) aggStreamBefore B aggStreamAfter (3,B) (3,B) aggStreamBefore B aggStreamAfter (4,B) (4,B) (0,A), (0,B), (1,A), (2,A), (3,A), (4,A), (5,A), (6,A), (1,B), (2,B), (3,B), (4,B) 
  
Why do we see zero-size chunks? 
 Why are aggStreamBefore and aggStreamAfter out of order?
 Why do we see fewer aggStreamBefore operations than aggStreamAfter ?
 groupByKey is supposed tu run different groups on different fibers, but results don&#x27;t seem to be intermingled...
 Why didn&#x27;t the stream use the first A B A B A sequence, but started pulling another one?
 Bonus question - does FS2 have groupBy / groupByKey? I found some leftovers, but nothing besides that.

                    <span>I&#x27;m tinkering with &quot;full stack&quot;. As far as possible, I&#x27;d like things type safe, as a big fan of how much work the compiler does on my behalf. I&#x27;m some distance from guru-dom, so I&#x27;m half pattern matching things I&#x27;ve pieced together over time. So far, I&#x27;ve got:
 - Cask on the back (no complicated effect frameworks for me!)
 - Laminar on the front
 Where I&#x27;m struggling, is joining them up. The idiom I&#x27;m following separates the definition of the API from it&#x27;s implementation,.
 trait TodoApi {def listAll: Future[Either[String, Seq[Todos]]]} 
 But this can fail in two ways
  
Network
 Json parsing
  
I wanted to use upickle and sttp. Both look simple enough, and should both work back and frontend ... helpful for me to learn fewer frameworks.
 def listAll1: Future[Response[Either[String,Try[Seq[Todos]]]]] &#x3D; { basicRequest.get(uri&quot;$ApiHost/todo&quot;) .mapResponseRight(r &#x3D;&gt; Try(read[Seq[Todos]](r))).send() } 
 But look at the method signature! So okay...
 object ToDoApiImpl extends TodoApi { def flattenFutureEitherTry[A](a: Future[Response[Either[String,Try[A]]]]) : Future[Either[String, A]] &#x3D; { for (fut  Left(value) case Right(value) &#x3D;&gt; { val something &#x3D; value.toEither something.left.map(_.toString()) } } } } } override def listAll: Future[Either[String,Seq[Todos]]] &#x3D; flattenFutureEitherTry(listAll1) } 
 Somehow, this feels... not right. It took me quite some time poking that with a sharp stick to get it to compile. And my eyeballs hurt :-(.
 Does anyone have suggestions for something more idiomatic / easier? I get that networking isn&#x27;t fun, but is this as good as it gets? Suggestions welcomed...

I&#x27;m debating between http4s + cats effect, http4s + zio, and zio-http (https://github.com/dream11/zio-http). I&#x27;m having a hard time figuring out which stack has the strongest (safest?) future especially with scala 3 out. Cats Effect 3 looks amazing, but so does the zio ecosystem.

                    <span>This is a companion zettel to my video below.
You get all my stuttering and stammering all on the first take. I&#x27;m trying not to obsess about production quality an try and focus more on the content. This is the zettel as it appears in my zettelkasten with the links and formating. I removed the YAML frontmatter as it was distracting in the format.
Format
If using the UUID for linking the zettel title and the file name does not have to be the same.

Why titling a note is a superpower.
I&#x27;m calling titling a superpower from now on.

vomit them onto the page, not worrying about spelling, grammar, appropriateness, titling, format, or anything that might slow and blunt the capture phase
add a tag putting the note in a group that is visited at every editing session. In this example, I&#x27;ll use &quot;greenhouse&quot; as the metaphor. This will be the tag for all the zettel I&#x27;m developing, not yet ready for deployment into the main garden.

                    <span>I have (face-attribute &#x27;default :background) in my init file as part of a larger function in order to dynamically get the background color. It works fine when starting Emacs normally but I get unspecified-bg when starting as daemon.
 I assume this is because there&#x27;s no actual frame when the daemon is started. What&#x27;s the best way to get the background color of the theme in that situation?
 Thanks

                    <span>So I recently switched to emacs from gvim at work. The buffer managing and file browsing in emacs is much better than in gvim so I don&#x27;t need to open lots of different gvim windows through the console which is great. However I do find some things missing. And I am trying to make them work, so I decided to come here for help. So here is my list of things I am trying to set.
 1) I want the whole line that the cursor is on to be highlighted - I tried using hl-line-mode and global-hl-line-mode I also tried to set it in the .emacs file however it still has no effect.
 2) line numbers for all files - if I enable linum-mode in a buffer it works. However it doesn&#x27;t seem to work if I add it to my .emacs file.
 3) Opening big files - I often have to work with huge files &gt; 500mb, sometimes reaching a…</span>

                    <span>Subj. I swear it used to work? Basically upon launching, emacs adjusts to whatever monitor is set as the main one and becomes blurry if you drag it to another monitor. The issue exists on both 27.2 (downloaded from GNU ftp) and compiled master from like 10 days ago or so. Also, emacs only ever launches on the main monitor, it doesn&#x27;t remember the last monitor it was used on as most other apps.
 Is there a way to make at least scaling work properly again? I don&#x27;t think emacs ever remembered the monitor it was last open on. Pls don&#x27;t suggest wsl emacs, I need native one 
 UPD: I just realized that emacs.exe (the one that opens both window and a terminal) is blurry on one monitor and good on the other one, and runemacs.exe is vise versa - it&#x27;s blurry on the monitor where emacs.exe is not blurry, and it&#x27;s crystal clear on the monitor where emacs.exe is blurry.

                    <span>Since I started using Emacs, whenever I try to edit an org-level face (M-x customize-group RET org-appearance RET), after saving and applying the change I always get the error: simbol&#x27;s function definition is void: nil.
 This happens even after a clean installation of Emacs or after creating a new init.el
 Do you have any idea why I get this error?
 I&#x27;m running Emacs 27.2

 The existing Flairs on r/emacs are * GNU Emacs * XEmacs
 In my opinion, these are no longer relevant. A better list of flairs may be needed. They could be based on bindings, or starter-kits or anything else that the community feels ok with.

 man -k ^systemd | nl |tail 
 Unfortunately, there&#x27;s no such a manual page in windows, both M-x man ls or M-x woman ls report error
 Can&#x27;t find the ls manpage. 
 Is it possible to get a linux manual docs installed in Emacs of windows version?

                    <span>I have codelldb and cpptools debuggers working but I have no luck with lldb or the gdb-lldb integration. Why am I trying ? I just want to get a good stable dap-mode debugging experience to complement the stellar lsp. 
 The link at the top of page here, references the github repo : https://github.com/WebFreak001/code-debug which isnt the same thing as installed by vscode or by running dap-gdb-lldb-setup . Indeed this link points to a codebase using .ts files in different locations to the VSCode extension installed .js files. (I did set up the dap program/path variables to use the .ts files but that didnt work)
 (Side note : Debian doesnt ship with lldb-mi which is required for the lldb portion to work so I compiled that from source but still no joy. )
 Anway, before I go any further, does anyone have the &quot;Native&quot; working with gdb or lldb to debug C++? If so, then I can chalk it up to me doing something wrong and try to correct it and will provide more details.

                    <span>Hi everyone, I’m vim guy; I also learn emacs last couple months. I love emacs too as they have their own advance.
 Currently I set up my working flow as exwm, vim8, tmux. I use regular emacs.
 I have one annoying thing with exwm. Emacs always grab important key stroke before sending it to my tmux, like ctrl-c..
 I do set up c-q to tell exwm next key will be send directly to other applications with exwm-input-send-next-key.
 I don’t like to double my type with c-q c-c in terminal upon canceling a command. 
 I was wondering how do you guys address this annoyance.

When a completion prompt opens up there is no option selected by default anymore (I have to hit tab), and if I hit enter at any point instead of just inserting the current option a newline is sent.
 Note that I am using evil and evil collection in case that&#x27;s relevant. Anyone got any hunches as to what might be wrong?

                    <span>I’m using emacs with native comp and libjansson. Lsp-doctor also sees no problem. Then why all Python language servers are unusable for me? I’ve turned off auto completion and tried to use elpy in its place, but it’s still many seconds of delay in between Key presses.
 This is the result of the profiler, after me just pressing down for a few seconds, waiting a few seconds, and then the cursor jumping a few page down.

                    <span>I would like to have pipe symbol as my cursor in insert mode and vertical bar in normal mode. In gnu readline I just need to set vi-cmd-mode-string and vi-insert-mode-string to the correct terminal control sequence to get the desired cursor shape in normal and insert mode respectively. Does haskeline provide any such variables ? Or is there any other method to do this?
 I have also found that adding one of these lines to ~/.ghci changes the cursor shape according to the escape sequence provided
 :set prompt &quot;%s&gt; \ESC[6 q\STX&quot; -- (pipe cursor) or :set prompt &quot;%s&gt; \ESC[2 q\STX&quot; -- (vertical bar)

                    <span>Hi everyone
 I&#x27;m sort of a Haskell noob, and I&#x27;m writing my thesis in Haskell. This is the first &quot;real&quot; project I&#x27;ve ever done so please bear with me if I sound stupid.
 Anyway, I&#x27;m almost at the end of the project. I have a function that opens a file, does some things to it, and then returns a result. I&#x27;m working with about 500000 files, so I thought I&#x27;d add parallelism to speed it up. I read some about parallelism in Haskell but still don&#x27;t understand it very well. However, that&#x27;s not important.
 My original sequential routine looks like this:
 openGetListResults :: [String] -&gt; IO String openGetListResults [] &#x3D; do return &quot;&quot; openGetListResults (p:rest) &#x3D; do resP  IO [String] pOpenExecuteListPrograms l &#x3D; do list &lt;- P.mapM openGetProgramResult l return list 
 I know the return types are different but that doesn&#x27;t really matter right now. The parallel version also works fine.
 I compiled the program with -threaded and -O2. I ran it with +RTS -N -s for both versions and got the following results.
 For the parallel version:
 Parallel version
 For the sequential version
 sequential version
 So the parallel version is way faster. However, it did not start any sparks. My understanding from Haskell parallelism is that sparks are like mini threads, so if it&#x27;s doing parallel work, it should be using sparks no?
 Could anyone explain what is happening here? Thank you so much, hope this kind of question is allowed.

 I am trying to convert the org mode manual from org to epub format with pandoc:
 pandoc -s -o org-manual.epub org-manual.org
 In the final result however code and verbatim are converted like this:
 {{{kbd}} {{{kbd(M-x list-packages)}}
 instead of:
 M-x list-packages
 Do you have any idea why I get this?

 However, as you can see on the left hand side its still flat. Is there a way to add padding to the left side so it looks cleaner&quot;?

                    <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;ve been struggling with capturing web pages with org-roam on Firefox: it doesn&#x27;t respect any template (so goes in the root folder)
 I added the bookmark with the following:
 javascript:location.href &#x3D; &#x27;org-protocol://roam-ref?r&#x3D;i&amp;ref&#x3D;&#x27; + encodeURIComponent(location.href) + &#x27;&amp;title&#x3D;&#x27; + encodeURIComponent(document.title) + &#x27;&amp;body&#x3D;&#x27; + encodeURIComponent(window.getSelection()) 
 And my template is : 
 (setq org-roam-capture-templates ... (&quot;i&quot; &quot;internet&quot; plain (function org-roam-capture--get-point) :file-name &quot;float/%-${slug}&quot; :head &quot;#+title: ${title}\n#+roam_key: ${ref}%?&quot; :unnarrowed t) .... ) 
 I would like to be able to use the extension ; https://github.com/sprig/org-capture-extension but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s possible, I like having the ability to select text and capture it directly in emacs.
 thanks;

                    <span>Hi Org mode community.
 I use variable-pitch-mode for my org files. As a lot of people I configured my org mode in order to have some fixed-pitch in the table so that they are well aligned. This worked like a charm since today where I&#x27;ve inserted an org-ref citation inside a table. You can see below that the citation is made with some variable-pitch and that the table become not well aligned.

                    <span>Hi all,
 In the last years I learnt Elm and Idris and now I am evaluating Purescript for the somewhat complex long project of creating a minimalistic programming language with its respective IDE and compiler. I would like to know your general opinions in how does compare PS with Elm and Idris for complex projects, specially whether it is worth for the mid long run (for example a small SPA might be done faster and easier with Elm).
 In one hand I felt Elm does an awesome job at the time of reducing the boilerplate and go to the point, however Evan’s focus is not always to keep a consistent programming language and I am afraid I would lack some abstractions at some point.
 Regarding Idris, it is totally the opposite direction from Elm, the compiler is immature and Idris 2 is just not ready. I like from dependent types that we can make a type dependent on a single attribute such as Matrixes with its dimensions and let the compiler verify that at compile time, however all that becomes messy when trying something beyond trivial examples. I believe that by using higher order types with purescript that’s possible as well, but I couldn’t find yet a working example (perhaps I should just try).
 Last but not least, a big missing in all the ML family is somewhat logic programming (or prolog dialect), so being not many kanrens for any of those I would believe all three are even in this aspect.

                    <span>Hi guys I’m new to scala and looking for a solution to a common interview question as part of my learning excersizes: Given a list of integers which represent a stock price changing throughout the day write a function that returns the best index to buy and sell at. 
 I’m looking for very idiomatic and readable solutions using functional programming techniques.
 Thanks!

                    <span>I have a Scala app which works as expected when run from within the project&#x27;s directory:
 &gt; sbt run 
 I&#x27;d like to be able to distribute the &quot;build&quot; and run it elsewhere.
 To do so, I ran the following from within the project&#x27;s directory
 project&gt; sbt compile ... [success] Total time: 1 s, completed Jun 9, 2021 11:10:49 AM project&gt; sbt package ... [success] Total time: 1 s, completed Jun 9, 2021 11:11:31 AM 
 I copied these files and folders:
 project&gt; cp ./target/scala/*.jar ~/app/target/scala-2.12 project&gt; cp -r ./project/build.properties ~/app/project/ 
 When I try to run the application, I get an error:
 app&gt; sbt run [info] Loading project definition from ~/app/project [info] Updating ProjectRef(uri(&quot;file:~/app/project/&quot;), &quot;app-build&quot;)... [info] Done updating. [info] Set current project to app (in build file:~/app/) [info] Updating ... [info] Done updating. [info] Packaging ~/app/target/scala-2.12/app_2.12-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar ... [info] Done packaging. [error] java.lang.RuntimeException: No main class detected. [error] at scala.sys.package$.error(package.scala:26) [error] (Compile / bgRun) No main class detected. [error] Total time: 1 s, completed Jun 9, 2021 11:06:49 AM 
 It appears that sbt creates a second JAR (app_2.12-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar) for some reason.
 Which file or files am I missing?

                    <span>Hi, I have been trying to use sbt-assembly to build a jar for my project. I got an error ,I googled and found that I need to have a merge strategy to mitigate the error
 I added a merge strategy 
 assemblyMergeStrategy / assembly :&#x3D; { case PathList(&quot;META-INF&quot;, xs @ _*) &#x3D;&gt; MergeStrategy.discard case x &#x3D;&gt; MergeStrategy.first }
 It throws a build error saying that missing parameter type for expanded function. The argument types of an anonymous function must be fully known Expected Type was : sbt.File
 I googled a lot and I haven&#x27;t been able to find a solution for this. kindly help !!

                    <span>It seems like it&#x27;s not hard for recruiters to find a Scala developer (or really any language or seniority level) with sites like LinkedIn and whatnot allowing easy search for candidates. But, I seem to have difficulty finding recruiters?
 Recruiters seems to always be headhunting for a big company. Has anyone worked with a recruiter who isn&#x27;t a company&#x27;s internal headhunter? Just someone who is matching candidates with jobs, at whichever company the job may be? If so please share! Feel free to DM if you feel awkward about sharing a name or anything like that. I hope I can connect with some recruiters. Who are these mystical people and where do I find them? Are there sites like LinkedIn but where one can find recruiters instead of potential employees? Thanks!!

                    <span>Hello there fellow devs,
 I want to share a small library I just published with you. Its called delegate-macro.
 It is a macro annotation to automatically delegate/proxy the implementation of an interface to a dependency. It has been super helpful to me when I have had to implement the &quot;delegate pattern&quot; for an interface with dozens of methods.Maybe you will also find it useful.
 I developed against Scala 2.
 edit:
 As u/agilesteel kindly pointed out below, unlike Scala2, Scala 3 has constructs to allow for this behaviour natively. 
 Repo: https://github.com/cmhteixeira/delegate-macro
 Any feedback welcome,

                    <span>I&#x27;m not an elisp expert, but I have played with it a bit and really like to just go to *scratch*, type in some elisp, and then hit C-J and it will evaluate the s-expression and insert the result on the line below. This is so simple and flexible, and I finally understand why a traditional elisp REPL is called inferior-mode (or something like that).
 Anyways, I want to do the same thing with racket, but racket-mode doesn&#x27;t seem to support this. Does anyone know if there is a way?

                    <span>I&#x27;m trying to get line numbers to display as relative when in insert mode and normally when in normal mode. I used the following to achieve that:
  (add-hook! &#x27;evil-normal-state-entry-hook (setq display-line-numbers &#x27;relative)) (add-hook! &#x27;evil-insert-state-entry-hook (setq display-line-numbers t)) 
 But now it shows relative line numbers everywhere like the start screen and neotree. How can I only run this hook if in an editor (i.e. code)?

                    <span>I finally started to command Nyxt with Emacs! I plan to do a lot of awesome things with that. 
 For now I managed to mix engine-mode and Nyxt to search the web in a keystroke :)

                    <span>Hi folks,
 ​
 I&#x27;ve got a mixed-language org-mode file that I use for pre-processing some data, and in the name of reproducibility (and portability), I&#x27;d like to be able to also run this pre-processing from outside of Emacs. My first thought was to add the &#x60;:tangle&#x60; argument to every code-chunk, then add a bash language chunk somewhere, set it up so that it fires off all of the tangle outputs in the correct order, and then instruct users to run the tangle output of said bash chunk.
 ​
 I don&#x27;t like the degree of intervention that this requires though, since I imagine this will get annoying to maintain as I add more and more chunks to this file. Wondering if anybody has any wisdom on how to accomplish this.

                    <span>So one the best thing in vim is that i can do a 
 :LspInstall  
 And it will install the server, but i can&#x27;t find an emacs mode to automate this task.
 Help please!!!!
 EDIT: I know that we can do 
 lsp-install-server 
 But I can&#x27;t do it with a lot of servers lime: pyright, lua, javascript....

 Is there something like this available?

 I use bbatsov/prelude - my issue doesn&#x27;t seem to be specifically about that, though. I am not on debian but on nixos, thus the logs below are confusing to me. My emacs version is 27.1.
 I did

                    <span>I tried this function to get to rerun the same command (even when I visit another file in a different project in the same workspace). The problem is that it somehow actually starts running the command in the new folder instead of the old:
  (defun rust-run-buffer () (interactive) (save-buffer) (if (get-buffer &quot;*compilation*&quot;) (progn (message &quot;repeat&quot;) (switch-to-buffer-other-window &quot;*compilation*&quot;) (cargo-process-repeat)) (message &quot;start new&quot;) (cargo-process--start &quot;Runr&quot; &quot;cargo run&quot;))) 
 Given structure:
  folder_a/src/main.rs folder_b/src/main.rs 
 Any ideas?

                    <span>As the title said. I do not want to see the &quot;80 column marker&quot; ...the internet is littered with that kind of information.
 What is missing or I haven&#x27;t found so, &quot;80 column hard restriction&quot; ...means , when I do type till 80 chanracter it will autometically move to next line.
 Can you people , shed some light , probably with some &quot;actual code snippet&quot;. That would be nice.
 I am running 27.1 precisely.

                    <span>I&#x27;m trying to use an org-mode table with elisp formula containing a literal string like $s. But the $s seems to be interpreted as an org-mode constant. 
 Is there a nice way to &quot;escape&quot; this kind of behaviour?
 simple example
 Works
 #+begin_src elisp (format &quot;(%2$s - %1$s) / %1$s&quot; &quot;x_1&quot; &quot;x_2&quot;) #+end_src #+RESULTS: : (x_2 - x_1) / x_1 
 Problem
 | fails | #ERROR | | works | (x_2 - x_1) / x_1 | #+TBLFM: @1$2&#x3D;&#x27;(format &quot;(%2$s - %1$s) / %1$s&quot; &quot;x_1&quot; &quot;x_2&quot;)::@2$2&#x3D;&#x27;(format &quot;(%s - %s) / %s&quot; &quot;x_2&quot; &quot;x_1&quot; &quot;x_1&quot;) 
 simpler example
 Works
 #+begin_src elisp (format &quot;$s&quot;) #+end_src #+RESULTS: : $s 
 Problem
 | fails | #UNDEFINED_NAME | #+TBLFM: @1$2&#x3D;&#x27;(format &quot;$s&quot;) 
 It seems that $s is trying to be expanded as a constant (even though it is in quotation marks - which could be useful in some cases, but causes problems here).

I cant afford to go lower in compensation and I am increasingly enjoying the language. For context, as above stated, I am primarily a typescript backend developer

 Looking forward to grow with this workgroup.

Process Backman, Fredrik, et al. Anxious People. Atria Books, 2020. Superhumorious thread using &quot;Stockholmer&#x27;s&quot; as a metaphor for others.
Finish reading and process Plotnik, Arthur. The Elements of Expression: Putting Thoughts into Words. [2nd ed.], Rev. and Expanded ed, Cleis Press, 2012. - So good it&#x27;s worth the second reading.
Finish reading and process Hazuka, Tom, and Dinty W. Moore, editors. Flash Nonfiction Funny: 71 Very Humorous, Very True, Very Short Stories. First edition, Woodhall Press, 2018.
Work on &quot;Mentions&quot; service. I&#x27;m a bit stuck figuring out to format regex in Automator, but it&#x27;ll come together, or it won&#x27;t.

                    <span>I need to get some info from a list of files and kill the buffer after the files are processed, but only on those which were not open before.
 The code uses (kill-buffer buffer) when processing is done and if the file is already open I get a prompt, but I don&#x27;t want that to happen because the script is supposed to be non-interactive and should avoid killing existing buffer.
 How do I check if the file is already open to avoid killing its buffer?

                    <span>Hello everyone!
 I&#x27;m trying to change the background color for the gui version and would like it to use the same theme as my terminal (Alacritty).
 To do this I added:
 (set-background-color &quot;#030c11&quot;)
 Keep in mind that I have only recently started using emacs and I don&#x27;t know lisp much.
 Now when I open Emacs in my terminal (emacs -nw) the background color is not the intended one (#030c11) but the default one of the wombat theme which is grey. Emacs gui on the other hand displays my custom theme correctly.
 To work around this problem and have both versions with the same theme I configured my init.el in the following way:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 (load-theme &#x27;wombat)
 (add-to-list &#x27;default-frame-alist &#x27;(background-color . &quot;0x030c11&quot;))
 (add-to-list &#x27;default-frame-alist &#x27;(foreground-color . &quot;0xd3d0c8&quot;))
 (set-background-color &quot;#030c11&quot;)
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 I don&#x27;t know why but it&#x27;s the only way to display the same background. After opening the gui version, the flip side of this is the following error reported below the mode line: undefined color: &quot;undefined&quot;. It&#x27;s not so annoying and it disappears after the first input but I&#x27;d like to fix it.
 Do you know how can I solve the theme conflict between the two versions or how to remove the error message as a work-around?
 My init.el: https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/jMDvYrTwNK/
 Thanks in advance!

                    <span>How can I map Super and Hyper to Windows and Menu keys in Emacs, when using the Linux Framebuffer Console ?
 I know the keycodes. So the loadkeys part under Linux is ok. 
 I followed the articles on EmacsWiki. It helped me setup the various keys that otherwise are not available. (loadkeys in Linux then input-decode-modmap in Emacs)
 But Super and Hyper are modifiers, not full key sequences. So I don&#x27;t know what to do next. 
 There is something about C-x@ in Emacs but I can&#x27;t find definitive information about that. 
 Any help appreciated
 Notes: * I am not talking about X terminals. * I am not asking about GUI version. * This is about emacs -nw on Linux tty console.

                    <span>Occasionally I want to tangle to files that are numbered like
  
01-sometask.sh
 02-someothertask.sh
  
etc. For example, if I&#x27;m organizing my dotfiles in a literate config, I might want a set of scripts that are executed in order. 
 It would be nice to be able to reorder headings and have the tangled files reflect the heading order. That is, if I move the heading for 02-someothertask.sh above the one for 01-sometask.sh, I want the output tangled files to now be 01-someothertask.sh and 02-sometask.sh.
 Has anyone encountered this and come up with a good solution for it?

                    <span>Sorry to post again about this in such a short interval, but I&#x27;m hiring another Haskell dev for my team at Standard Chartered bank, this time in Singapore or Hong Kong.
 My team sits in front office and has about 20 Haskell devs (well, technically Mu, our in-house variant). We work in close collaboration with trading, sales, and structuring to build diverse software, from desktop GUI applications to server-side financial analytics reports and services. The current roles are at a relatively junior level -- 2 to 5 years industrial experience expected, or a relevant PhD.
 Feel free to reach out to me directly if you&#x27;re interested and have any questions, but applications should go via the links below. To apply to the Singapore role go here: https://scb.taleo.net/careersection/ex/jobdetail.ftl?job&#x3D;2100014272
 Or for Hong Kong: https://scb.taleo.net/careersection/ex/jobdetail.ftl?job&#x3D;2100014571
 And the London role I posted before is still open: https://scb.taleo.net/careersection/ex/jobdetail.ftl?job&#x3D;2100012204
 Standard Chartered supports (practically fully) remote working, but only from the country of payroll. We will cover visa and relocation costs for successful applicants.

                    <span>Hi 
 on my fp course we will be using threadscope, but i can&#x27;t install it with neither stack nor cabal. I have installed gtk2 but still i get errors :
 on stack :
 cairo &gt; Configuring cairo-0.13.8.1... cairo &gt; setup.exe: Missing dependencies on foreign libraries: cairo &gt; * Missing (or bad) C libraries: z, cairo cairo &gt; This problem can usually be solved by installing the system packages that cairo &gt; provide these libraries (you may need the &quot;-dev&quot; versions). If the libraries cairo &gt; are already installed but in a non-standard location then you can use the cairo &gt; the library files do exist, it may contain errors that are caught by the C cairo &gt; compiler at the preprocessing stage. In this case you can re-run configure cairo &gt; with the verbosity flag -v3 to see the error messages. cairo &gt; glib &gt; Configuring glib-0.13.8.1... glib &gt; setup.exe: Missing dependencies on foreign libraries: glib &gt; * Missing (or bad) C libraries: gobject-2.0, glib-2.0, intl glib &gt; This problem can usually be solved by installing the system packages that glib &gt; provide these libraries (you may need the &quot;-dev&quot; versions). If the libraries glib &gt; are already installed but in a non-standard location then you can use the glib &gt; flags --extra-include-dirs&#x3D; and --extra-lib-dirs&#x3D; to specify where they are.If glib &gt; the library files do exist, it may contain errors that are caught by the C glib &gt; compiler at the preprocessing stage. In this case you can re-run configure glib &gt; with the verbosity flag -v3 to see the error messages. 
 same on cabal.
 i don&#x27;t really know what else to do, readme don&#x27;t give a lot of troubleshooting steps, wiki is even worst.

                    <span>How would you convert between a ByteString and Word64? Here&#x27;s what I have:
 bsToWord64 :: B.ByteString -&gt; Maybe Word64 bsToWord64 bs &#x3D; let nb &#x3D; B.length bs f x b &#x3D; (x &#x60;shiftL&#x60; 8) .|. fromIntegral b in if nb &#x3D;&#x3D; 8 then Just (B.foldl&#x27; f 0 bs) else Nothing word64ToBS :: Word64 -&gt; B.ByteString word64ToBS &#x3D; B.pack . go 0 [] where go 8 bs _ &#x3D; bs go n bs x &#x3D; go (n + 1) (fromIntegral (x .&amp;. 0xff) : bs) (x &#x60;shiftR&#x60; 8) 
 Is there a more efficient way to do this? ByteString uses arrays of bytes, so are there any low-level tricks that could be used?

                    <span>Over the last year both my cognitive load increased and my team did too. I started tracking a lot more stuff in org. I mentioned in a few threads here about how i have properties that tracks replies and that works out great. 
 A coworker is non-technical, but wants to clear things out regardless of the status. Getting them to use emacs will be beyond painful. We have a few SOPs and and excel file that we track. The person likes to take the shop as a grain of salt and customizes it. A hurdle my supervisor is dealing with. I have to fix the excel file a few times a month due to errors, so I fear the same if a spin up a new one.
 Any thoughts about what I can suggest?

 I gave a talk at Scalacon about debugging and observing scala code. It&#x27;s a summary of a year&#x27;s worth of work and many blog posts. 
 The video won&#x27;t be pubically available for a while, but I&#x27;ve written up a blog post:
 https://tersesystems.com/blog/2021/06/06/debugging-and-observing-your-scala-code/
 and I&#x27;ll have the slides up shortly.

 I&#x27;m wondering, did anybody pass it ? If so how was your experience with that: Do you think it bring value to your CV? Maybe you have been interviewing person with this certificate?
 Thank you!

                    <span>A common pattern you&#x27;ll see in Scala libraries is applicably combining n-elements, each with a different type, to a Product or Tuple. For example:
 ​
 def combine[A, B, C](element1: A, element2: B)(combinator: (A, B) &#x3D;&gt; C) &#x3D; ... def combine[A, B, C, D](element1: A, element2: B, element3: C)(combinator: (A, B, C) &#x3D;&gt; D) &#x3D; ... def combine[A, B, C, D, E](element1: A, element2: B, element3: C, element4: D)(combinator: (A, B, C, D) &#x3D;&gt; CE &#x3D; ...&#x60;&#x60;&#x60; 
 Is there some syntax sugar/technique to simplify this in Scala 3? Perhaps with Type Lambdas?

                    <span>I recently read the following article by Mike Schmitz, which I found had enough resonance with discussions on this forum to share here:
https://thesweetsetup.com/the-art-of-note-making/
If anyone does read through it and his examples, or if anyone has read some of the &quot;Linking your Thinking&quot; materials, do you consider his term &quot;Map of Content&quot; to be the same (or perhaps similar but not exactly the same) as the way the term &quot;Structure Note&quot; is often used in this forum?
I like the distinction Mike Schmitz makes between:
Things I may need to reference
Tasks I will need to do
Ideas I want to develop
and also his comments on deciding what goes into his ZK versus what does not.</span>

                    <span>Background
My research area is machine learning. My first zettel was 02/23/2020 and most of them focus on my research area or research in general. Throughout my life I have read many books, but I remember little about them. For instance, I say books like &quot;The Double Helix&quot; or &quot;The Art of Learning&quot; made a big impact on me, but outside of a few anecdotes, I remember nothing. More than that, I have no notes to go back and refer to.  My plan this year was to change this and systematically process any book I read.
The first book happened to be &quot;Team of Rivals&quot;. My first zettel was on 02/06/2021. At the time I had approximately 430 zettels.
The Process
I know little about Lincoln or the Civil War outside of what I remember from high school. Everything was new and everything seemed notable. As I …</span>

                    <span>Hi everyone, I&#x27;m using python mode to code and I have this problem:
 I have 3 windows, A B and C.
 A displays the buffer of my code in Python mode. B displays the buffer of the console python. C displays the buffer of an org document.
 When I C-c C-c in A, (execute the code in the console) C now displays the code. So the final situation is :
 A and C display the buffer of my code in Python mode. B displays the buffer of the console python.
 I don&#x27;t have anything special for python mode in my config, just a hook to open lsp mode...
 Ty for reading !

                    <span>Duplicate of https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/gfq4dk/how_can_i_change_companybox_background_and/
 I setup company-mode and it&#x27;s background color was similar to my theme&#x27;s color. So I wanted to change the background. I installed company-box with :
 (use-package company-box
 :hook (company-mode . company-box-mode))
 But when I did that company mode changed it&#x27;s color to white.

 ​
 I tried all the methods but couldn&#x27;t figure out a way to change it&#x27;s background color. None of the answers worked for me.
 I also want to change font and it&#x27;s color.

                    <span>Hi, 
 This one is for the users of org-super-agenda. I have some views defined as follows:
 (use-package! org-super-agenda :after org-agenda :init (setq org-agenda-custom-commands &#x27;( (&quot;T&quot; &quot;triage&quot; ((todo &quot;&quot; ((org-agenda-overriding-header &quot;&quot;) (org-super-agenda-groups &#x27;((:name &quot;Triaged tasks&quot; :tag &quot;triage&quot; :order 0) (:name &quot;Confirmed&quot; :discard (:anything t) :order 1))))))) (&quot;A&quot; &quot;agenda&quot; ((agenda &quot;&quot; ((org-super-agenda-groups &#x27;((:name &quot;Closed&quot; :log t :order 5) (:name &quot;Deadlines&quot; :deadline future :order 3) (:name &quot;Agenda&quot; :time-grid t :order 0) (:name &quot;Chores/Habits&quot; :habit t :order 4) (:name &quot;Important tasks&quot; :priority &quot;A&quot; :order 1) (:name &quot;Other tasks&quot; :priority&lt;&#x3D; &quot;B&quot; :order 2))))))))) :config (org-super-agenda-mode)) 
 The first is to see tasks which are tagged :triage:, and the second for my agenda. The &quot;agenda&quot; view works very well. However, here&#x27;s the issue. In the &quot;triage&quot; view, I can only see one task! If I mark that as done, I see another one. I don&#x27;t understand why I can only see one task at a time. Any idea why? Any tips/suggestions are greatly appreciated. Cheers !

                    <span>In this section, they said that we can use dap-compilation property inside launch.json to compile project before debug it. This is my launch.json:
 { &quot;configurations&quot;: [ { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;lldb-vscode&quot;, &quot;request&quot;: &quot;launch&quot;, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Test dap-lldb&quot;, &quot;program&quot;: &quot;${workspaceFolder}/main&quot;, &quot;cwd&quot;: &quot;${workspaceFolder}&quot;, &quot;dap-compilation&quot;: &quot;clang -g -o main.o main.c&quot;, &quot;args&quot;: [], &quot;externalConsole&quot;: true, &quot;stopAtEntry&quot;: true, &quot;MIMode&quot;: &quot;lldb&quot;, } ] } 
 But whenever i start dap-debug, compilation step won&#x27;t happen. Any idea?

                    <span>I am an evil user. I was dissatisfied with evils jumping mechanism because I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to control what commands set jump points, and therefore couldn&#x27;t get my jumping to feel predictable. I thought I would share what I have come up with because it is working very nicely for me. 
 Please check out better-jumper.
 (use-package better-jumper :custom ; this is the key to avoiding conflict with evils jumping stuff (better-jumper-use-evil-jump-advice nil) :config (better-jumper-mode 1) ; this lets me toggle between two points. (adapted from evil-jump-backward-swap) (evil-define-motion better-jumper-toggle (count) (let ((pnt (point))) (better-jumper-jump-backward) (better-jumper-set-jump pnt))) ; this is the key here. This advice makes it so you only set a jump point ; if you move more than one line with whatever command you call. For example ; if you add this advice around evil-next-line, you will set a jump point ; if you do 10 j, but not if you just hit j. I did not write this code, I ; I found it a while back and updated it to work with better-jumper. (defun my-jump-advice (oldfun &amp;rest args) (let ((old-pos (point))) (apply oldfun args) (when (&gt; (abs (- (line-number-at-pos old-pos) (line-number-at-pos (point)))) 1) (save-excursion (goto-char old-pos) (better-jumper-set-jump))))) ; jump scenarios (advice-add &#x27;evil-next-line :around #&#x27;my-jump-advice) (advice-add &#x27;evil-previous-line :around #&#x27;my-jump-advice) (advice-add &#x27;helm-swoop :around #&#x27;my-jump-advice) (advice-add &#x27;evil-goto-definition :around #&#x27;my-jump-advice) (advice-add &#x27;evil-goto-mark :around #&#x27;my-jump-advice)) ; ... whenever you want a new jump scenario just use the above pattern. 
 From here just add keybindings for better-jumper-toggle, better-jumper-jump-forward, and better-jumper-jump-backward.
 If you have ways to improve this let me know.
 Hopefully somebody can get some use out of this.

                    <span>Hi, I&#x27;m very much an Emacs noob so please excuse my basic understanding of this. Not a computer science guy, but also trying to learn Linux at the same time.
 I&#x27;m trying to configure Emacs for python development. All of the lsp and development environment tools are installed and working fine, my question is about code execution. 
 I want to write to bash (Konsole?) and ask it to interpret the .py file. I know I can use M-x shell, but I have seen online that this invokes a &quot;subshell&quot; within Emacs. My worry is that any python I run through this subshell is limited to a single CPU as Emacs is not multithreaded, and my python project needs all of the compute resource available. 
 Does that concern even make sense? Should I looks towards using M-x term instead? Apologies if not enough info, would be happy to clarify anything you want to know, just not sure what&#x27;s relevant.
 tl;dr 
 Can I execute python files while in Emacs without having the execution be limited to a single CPU due to Emacs&#x27; lack of multithreading?

                    <span>I wonder if there is a simple solution to have a UI to navigate packages information with straight.el. It is mentioned in the README from straight that
  
any UI is provided by the user&#x27;s completing-read framework
  
I would love to see examples of it ! (or build it myself)
 ​
 I tried something myself using marginalia and the metadata provided by package.el. I added this to to my init to associate the recipe keyword with package annotation :
 (add-to-list &#x27;marginalia-prompt-categories &#x27;(&quot;\\&quot; . package)) 
 But I also have to (package-initialize) somewhere in my init since marginalia-annotate-package relies on package-alist and package-archive-contents. 
 ​
 Of course its a far from ideal solution. It doesn&#x27;t work for all recipes, relies on package.el and doesn&#x27;t inform about the current status of installed packages. For a proper solution, I think one could reuse part of the mechanism package.el uses to get packages information like package-load-descriptor, combine it with information from straight and finally add information provided by git for each repo.
 ​
 Does anyone know about packages or obscure init files that go in this direction ?

                    <span>When adding a line to my emacs config, I usually test it by manually moving to the end of the line, then running eval-last-sexp. This gets kind of annoying with multi-line commands; is there an alternative that lets me eval the largest sexp at point? In other words, if I run (setq test-variable (expand-file-name &quot;~/asdf&quot;)) with the point at &quot;asdf&quot;, it should select the entire setq command.
 Thanks!

                    <span>I tried to setup dap for my c/c++ project. So i created a bare minimal c test project that i compiled it like this:
 clang -o main main.c 
 I installed dap and lsp like this in my init.el:
  (setq dap-lldb-debug-program &#x27;(&quot;/usr/bin/lldb-vscode&quot;)) (straight-use-package &#x27;dap-mode) (use-package lsp-mode :init ;; set prefix for lsp-command-keymap (few alternatives - &quot;C-l&quot;, &quot;C-c l&quot;) (setq lsp-keymap-prefix &quot;C-c l&quot;) (setq dap-auto-configure-features &#x27;(sessions locals controls tooltip)) (setq dap-print-io t) :hook ((c-mode . lsp) (lsp-mode . lsp-enable-which-key-integration)) :hook ((c++-mode . lsp) (lsp-mode . lsp-enable-which-key-integration)) :straight (lsp-mode :type git :host github :repo &quot;emacs-lsp/lsp-mode&quot;) :bind (:map global-map (&quot;C-c d&quot; . dap-debug)) :config (require &#x27;dap-lldb)) (require &#x27;lsp-mode) (setq lsp-ui-doc-enable t) (straight-use-package &#x27;lsp-ui) 
 I set breakpoints in lines: 5, 11, 13 of sample project. Also created a file called: launch.json.
 And also generated a file called compile_commands.json with this command:
 clang++ -MJ main.o.json -Wall -std&#x3D;c++11 -o main.o -c main.c 
 And start debugging with dap-debug and select my own configuration template(Test dap-lldb).
 The application runs without stopping at breakpoints.(Though it generates weird output) I just see the output message that print numbers.
 Am i missing some configurations?
 Edit: I&#x27;ve noticed that when start lsp_server and dap_server, some files generate automatically. like: *clangd::stderr* Or *Flaymake log*

                    <span>Apologize for the cuss word. That&#x27;s it. I am not going to delve into the details but let me say one thing &quot;hunk internal region&quot;. The fact that it updates the buffer after staging selective hunk region is mindblowing. How much care that the author has put into this. Fucking love it.
 For those who want get a handle on this beast, thoroughly read this: https://emacsair.me/2017/09/01/magit-walk-through/

                    <span>I found a post by Sacha Chua about how she used Org to manage her grocery lists, and I want to do something sort of similar. I have an org file with recipes as headings, and immediately beneath each heading is the ingredients list as a table, followed by a list of instructions. I want to go through each week and pick an arbitrary number of recipes to cook by toggling a todo state on the heading. I want to write a function to concatenate all of the ingredients tables from the recipes I select for the week. I think I want to do something like this:
 (org-element-map (org-element-parse-buffer &#x27;element) &#x27;table (lambda (table) (when (string&#x3D; (org-element-property :status table) &quot;MAKE&quot;) ...code to concat table...))) 
 The missing piece with this idea is that I don&#x27;t want to set a table property manually, but I also don&#x27;t know how to set a property on a table based on the parent heading&#x27;s todo state. Todo state triggers weren&#x27;t meant for this it seems. I&#x27;m reading the documentation of course, but it&#x27;s a little slow-going and I&#x27;m not that familiar with all of Org&#x27;s built-in functions that might help with something like this. And this might not even be a great approach! So does anyone have recommendations on things to investigate or an alternative approach?

                    <span>Hi,
 First, I&#x27;m far from a soccer fan and most probably won&#x27;t watch a single game within the upcoming weeks.
 However, for small-talk and event organization reasons, it&#x27;s handy to have the games on my agenda.
 I converted the game schedule to Org mode format, assuming two hours per game. Since there might be a few Orgers out there who could profit from this task, you might want to check out https://pad.graz.social/p/EUROrg2020 and even maintain the schedule after the group stage where there are placeholders for now. The pad is writeable to everybody.
 If somebody should mess up pad content somehow, please use the timeslider button on the upper right corner (the fifth icon from right) to get back to the previous versions.
 Have fun

                    <span>For me, .scala is a really clunky and long extension. .sc is already recognized by VS Code as Scala source, and it will soon be recognized as a Scala mimetype in shared-mime-info for Unix-based operating systems. Anyone else think we should try to popularize this change? How can we do so?

 I want to add user accounts, and since I have some experience using silhouette.rocks I was considering switching the backend to Play, but if I chose not to use Play, are there other widely used authentication libraries that work with akka-http but don&#x27;t require Play? It&#x27;s a react/NextJS frontend.

                    <span>In the past, scientists have developed a number of impressive theories. In the case of Luhmann, we have a detailed picture of one of the crucial tools he used, this tool has been made very explicit to a degree that anyone can use it, and this tool is largely uncoupled from the individual knowledge and the cognitive skills of its users. For other scientific breakthroughs, some of them perhaps even more impressive than Luhmann&#x27;s theories, we seem to know little about what methods led to these breakthroughs.
I wonder what we could develop from this perspective - what, if any, explicit, transferable methods and tools can we extract from the works of physicists, philosophers or mathematicians? How can we combine these tools with practices from the ZK universe?
As far as I know, most breakthrough ideas in science and elsewhere were made without the use of a ZK - so people have used other ways to create great ideas, and it would be foolish to narrow our view on ZK-based work only.
To me, in most of the forum discussions we have a dominant focus on &quot;literature-driven&quot; ZK work - people read, write zettels, enrich them with their own thoughts and link them to other zettels. On the other hand I suspect that a huge part of people&#x27;s crucial relevant work in life is &quot;problem-driven&quot;. I&#x27;m convinced that many writers in this forum use their ZKs for this purpose, but postings about how to start thinking about a topic, how to formulate problems, how to ask questions, how to generate ideas, how to discard approaches in the ZK framework seem to me underrepresented, given their importance for creative work.</span>

                    <span>Hi guys! I&#x27;m new here! I recently stumbled upon The Archive and immediately fell in love with its simplicity and great writing experience.  Although I&#x27;m quite happy with my workflow on my iMac I&#x27;m having a hard time making a good workflow for creating zettels on my iPad. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m looking for help.
I&#x27;ve been trying to populate some front matter on a new note using this iOS shortcut for iAWriter: https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/05a688e941954398aafab768f75966fc. The shortcut adds a filename following the convention used by The Archive and adds title, date, and tags. The problem is that it works sometimes while fails most of the time for no apparent reason.
As you can see image 1 (sucessful-shortcut.png) shows how it looks when the shortcut properly works, and image 2 (fail-shortcut.png) shows when it fails.



Do you have any insight into what&#x27;s happening? If you use iA Writer, is there another way to add a front matter to a new note on iPad (other than manually)?
A simple workflow is really important for me to work with The Archive and iA Writer on the iPad, so if you have figured this out I&#x27;d love to learn from you. Thank you, André.</span>

Some of my random thoughts
Reading print is more time efficient in itself.
Saving time via the habit of reading digitally comes from more efficient workflows surrounding the pure reading (e.g. extracting your highlights all at once)
The faster you read the better is your comprehension if the reading speed comes natural and you don&#x27;t overpush yourself by some (not working) speed reading techniques oder overestimating your abilities.</span>

                    <span>Hello, all! I&#x27;ve recently started using org-mode as the place where I write.
 I was just wondering if anyone knows of a way to turn &quot;---&quot; whenever I write it in an org file into an em-dash automatically (—). It&#x27;s a small thing but I&#x27;d appreciate it if anyone knows how to do this! Thank you.

                    <span>When I edit some files after installing flycheck I get tooltips and messages which require additions to the code like this:
 ;;; package --- Summary ;;; Commentary: ;;; Code: ;;; package-xxx.el ends here 
 Besides the obvious benefit in generating some automatic documentation for functions, in what other areas is it useful?
 I just installed it to see what it brings to elisp code.
 I can see some of them will be useful with some automatic help generating systems.
 What else is there?

                    <span>So, I used native-comp branch awhile back and while it mostly worked - I had some trouble with org-super-agenda and hydra modes.
 Now as I understand, the branch is merged into emacs master. So I compiled it today morning and it mostly works but I think some minor modes are broken because of emacs version changes (through no fault of native-comp).

 Is there a Emacs-27 branch with native-comp, that I can use without using emacs from master branch?

                    <span>I&#x27;m trying to expand out my elisp skills to something outside of just a snippet, and while elisp is fairly straight forward, I find myself often overwhelmed by the amount of functions and modes I need to understand to write a new minor mode.
 I want to write a minor mode that does gradient highlighting on characters in org and nov mode (each character is a step on a gradient transition like https://www.beelinereader.com) efficiently. 
 How might you seasoned elisp-ers go about this? Is font-lock mode the right way to do it? Should I consider another way? Are there any guides you might recommend that would help me out on this journey?

                    <span>I recently read up on Derived Modes, but upon looking at the list of basic modes, I found no non-text-modes.
 Upon checking the parents of image-mode and pdf-view-mode I found that the latter used special-mode as parent while the former had none, which confused me even more.

 It seems that dired-mode is active when editing a file from the filesystem.
 Are there any other such modes?

                    <span>Last year I started using Spacemacs on evil mode because it was recommended not because I have been using vim or something, then around February this year I moved to original Emacs because I faced some issues on Spacemacs and I would almost always find a fix for Emacs but not Spacemacs, the transition phase didn&#x27;t last very long as I learned how to make Emacs feel almost like Spacemacs.
 Lately I&#x27;ve noticed that I would have to use some of the Emacs keybinding even on evil mode and this is really annoying me, I was thinking that maybe if I learned Emacs keybindings it would&#x27;ve been much better.
 So my question is as the title says, and if anyone has good resources for learning Emacs keybindings for in case I end up going that way I would be very grateful.

                    <span>So, just want to share my use case here.
 context: writing research papers.
 use case:
  
I have a notes.tex with literature review.
 when I start writing I often put lots of comments about relating ideas and reference sources.
 In those comments I started putting buttons to the notes file where the relevant information is.
  
It works like a org-link but for tex files.
 Hyperbole stores a .hypb with the linking information.
 Any other ideas or alternatives?

 My problem is have some advices on some org functions which may not work with the latest versions and I will have to revert to the current one until I can patch them.
 If things don&#x27;t work is it a simple matter changing the load-path to the older version or reinstalling it in the package-list-packages page?

                    <span>HNix is a Nix (pure lazy language) interpreter/tooling in Haskell. So it is a field&amp;case of pure-to-pure, lazy-to-lazy language creation. HNix is created with fancy design paradigms (design introduction): as recursion schemes (since Nix is a recursive language) &amp; Abstracting Definitional Interpreters.

                    <span>I&#x27;m using org-mode to create and mantain my anki cards collection using anki-editor (https://github.com/louietan/anki-editor/) (seems to be orphaned, unfortunately)
 I like to insert images in my anki cards with org-download (https://github.com/abo-abo/org-download/). The behavior by default in doom-emacs is 
 org-download-method &#x27;attach 
 When I push the notes from my org file to anki, the images are correctly uploaded to the anki notes, that&#x27;s great. But when I update the cards and repush the notes the links are broken and the images are not shown anymore on anki.
 So my question is: given that I have thousands of cards with images with :attachment links, is there any easy way to migrate them to :file links? 
 I guess I could make a script to update the links, but if anything is already done, that&#x27;d be awsome.

                    <span>I am close to completing my second FP in Scala course from Martin Odersky.
 Remaining in the Coursera specialization is Parallel Programming, Spark, and a Capstone project.
 After I complete the specialization, I am wondering what to focus on next.
 I think I will take this course which will uses Akka.
 If I learn Akka through this course, should I then learn a Typelevel framework/ library like Cats? Or is it better to just focus on Akka? I know this depends on the employer, but unsure where to focus my energy after learning base Scala.

                    <span>Hi,
 This is a pre-job post for an independently motivated, highly technical, and theoretical person or team to build a non-production or research implementation of the Ethereum proof of stake system (also known as eth2) in Scala 3.
 For context, I&#x27;m an Ethereum community member and investor. Recently, a world expert in Ethereum&#x27;s proof of stake told me that it would be valuable if an independent party were to develop a non-production implementation of the eth2 spec to be used as a quality control mechanism against the four production clients that are live today.
 Please see the eth2 specs repo https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs
 As you can see from the specs repo, this would be a large and complicated project and also require ongoing work to keep your implementation up-to-date with …</span>

                    <span>Hi all, looking for some good resources to learn SBT simple build tool. I have seen few videos and read few chapters in SBT in action but can’t get a clear picture or author introduces concepts without introduction. Any suggestions would be appreciated

 I think the link explains the trouble. The compiler can&#x27;t find implicit Writer for Thing, which makes sense, but I can&#x27;t have Thing derive Writer since it&#x27;s just a trait. What&#x27;s the correct approach to solve this for Scala 3?

                    <span>Here is how this all got started.
I was struck by an idea, &quot;What if...?&quot; not fully formed but enough to continue to bounce back and forth between my ears. The idea originally was, &quot;Wouldn&#x27;t be interesting to know how many times a person was mentioned in my archive?&quot; Then it quickly morphed with, &quot;What if there was more than one person I&#x27;d like to know how many times they were mentioned? What if I wanted this list to be keep up to date, tracking progress over time?&quot; And it has spread like head lice ever since.
You poor souls get to be the ones exposed to my attempts at learning to code. This is an experiment and my humble attempt at coding.
This all started with a personal itch. No! Not the kind of itch soothed with an ointment. It was the kind of itch that metaphorically is the spark that …</span>

                    <span>Hey all,
I recently created a theme for The Archive to suit my personal needs and I thought I&#x27;d publish it, in case somebody else finds it handy too:

I&#x27;d describe it as minimalist, high-contrast and equally suited for writing and coding (I store many code snippets in my Zettelkasten).
You can find it on Github: https://github.com/stephanbogner/the-coding-writer-theme
I also stumbled upon the &quot;The Archive Userland Themes&quot;-repository, so if there is any interest to add my theme to that, that would be cool too 
Let me know what you think!</span>

                    <span>Over the past year or so since discovering the Zettelkasten method, I have been doing my best to read more and to try and capture ideas that interest me. I&#x27;ve explored different mediums trying to find one that fit and for the most part have enjoyed the journey.
But, there continues to be one lingering concern... that I am just collecting and not making any real use of my notes.
I do my best to take quick notes while reading, putting them into my own words before adding these ideas to my slip box and expanding on them... but even after that, it still feels like I am just creating collection of other people ideas.
This leads me to ask two questions. First, what are some strategies that you use to combat this? And, second is this sort of feeling fairly common as your system grows?</span>

                    <span>So my company runs its own JIRA servers internally. I&#x27;ve been trying to get Org-JIRA to work today with no luck. I&#x27;ve looked at the solutions that other people used, but none of it has worked out for me yet. 
 (Namely: https://github.com/ahungry/org-jira/issues/21 and https://github.com/ahungry/org-jira/issues/186)
 I&#x27;ve noticed that if I use the constructed curl command with my username and password manually, I get what I *think* is a valid response. Otherwise, I see this X-AUSERNAME: anonymous in the messages. I tried creating a .authinfo file, but it changes nothing. Org-JIRA only asked my for my credentials once and never again.
 Internally, I use either a login/password or SSO to log in, but it doesn&#x27;t look like our system has the same API token functionality that the Atlassian site does. I tried finding the cloud.session.token to use with the authorization workaround, but nothing that I did surfaced it. I&#x27;m not really a web guy, so I was just making some stabs in the dark.
 This is all on Windows; I&#x27;m not sure to what extent that makes a difference, but I&#x27;ve seen problems with that in the last few days in other packages. 
 Anyone else have anything else I can try?

                    <span>In my job I edit a lot of text files. Gvim has a lot of options that make editing text really fast. Like yyp to copy a line and paste it or * to automatically search for the word under the cursor. 
 I often end up with a lot of vim windows open that create a clutter. I also have a lot of projects to work on and I need some place to keep my notes for these and organize my tasks. I hear that managing such things with emacs should be easy with orgmode and that it should be able to match the text editing provided by vim.
 However most of the things I find are related to installing packages from the internet. At work I don&#x27;t have the ability to install anything. For vim pluging i am able to copy the plugin and create the files manually. Is this possible to do in emacs? 
 Also any tips for switching to emacs? I feel a lot slower with emacs to switch and edit file even though I find things like file browsing directly from emacs is much nicer than what is in gvim.
 So can the vanilla emacs match gvim in terms of text editing, and are there any features which are possible in gvim but not in emacs?

                    <span>I am on a computer I just recently started using more but pulled my init file from a different setup I&#x27;ve used a couple of times and somehow I think my Swiper install got erased and after installing it again it isn&#x27;t working. I don&#x27;t remember having this issue with the other two instances of Emacs I&#x27;ve set up, anyone have any idea? This is the error I am getting but I also feel like I didn&#x27;t edit my init file and I have used swiper on this computer earlier this week command-execute: Wrong type argument: commandp, swiper. The only thing I did recently was follow this setup because my keyring was wrong, which still isn&#x27;t working. Should I just get rid of this install and try again from scratch?

 (Context: I am defining several similar &quot;style dispatchers&quot; for orderless. My actual functions are a bit more complicated than this, but have a common structure.)
 I would like define a macro to build these functions for me. The naive thing to try is this:
 (defmacro build-it-1 (name symbol) &#x60;(defun ,name (x) &#x60;(,symbol . ,(+ 1 x)))) 
 But this gives
 (macroexpand &#x27;(build-it-1 foo1 sym1)) (defalias &#x27;foo1 #&#x27;(lambda (x) &#x60;(,symbol \, (+ 1 x)))) 
 Oh, so the &quot;inner&quot; backquote control ,symbol and there is nothing to expand there.
 (But the \, is weird. What happened to my cons cell?)
 So, let&#x27;s try this for the sake of the symbol:
 (defmacro build-it-2 (name symbol) &#x60;(defun ,name (x) ,&#x60;(symbol . ,(+ 1 x)))) (macroexpand &#x27;(build-it-2 foo1 sym1)) *** Debugger entered--Lisp error: (void-variable x) 
 OK. Now the symbol x is unquoted by the comma we just moved, so, uh, maybe this?
 (defmacro build-it-3 (name symbol) &#x60;(defun ,name (x) ,&#x60;(symbol . ,(+ 1 &#x27;x)))) (macroexpand &#x27;(build-it-3 foo1 sym1)) *** Debugger entered--Lisp error: (wrong-type-argument number-or-marker-p x) 
 Hmm. Elisp didn&#x27;t like that.
 I suspect that it is possible to do what I want with some combination of comma, backquote, and quote. I&#x27;ve tried (more or less at random) various strings like ,&#x60;(+ 1 x) and &#x27;,&#x60;(+ 1 x) but I can&#x27;t get what I want.
 What am I doing wrong?

                    <span>Sometimes I&#x27;d like to open a file in some chosen external application.
 For that I created Mediator, a very simple package which provides a simple open-with menu for Emacs.
 It can be used with Embark or with Ivy (including &#x60;all-the-icons-ivy-rich&#x60; support) actions.

                    <span>I use evil-mode virtually all the time and I use the key combination v$ to select the text to the end of line, but the $ key includes the line feeds so when I paste the text a new line is forced.
 My work around is to use the left arrow v$← to work around that but that feels like one key too many.
 Is there some other built-in for that, or is it Elisp time or macro time? I haven&#x27;t got into macros yet.

                    <span>desktop-save-mode had caused me issues before because of different ways of starting Emacs :- command line &quot;emacs&quot;, as a service (&quot;systemctl --user enable Emacs&quot;) with the system starting it, as emacsclient (emacsclient -c ) or even from your own startup with something like &quot;emacs --daemon&quot;. Anyway, this little snippet &quot;works for me&quot; and might be of interest to others. All self-contained in a use-package form. If starting as a daemon do the desktop read after the first frame is created, else do it immediately after emacs-startup-hook is triggered. The only thing that scuppered me a little was not checking the supplied emacs.service systemd config - it hardcodes the Emacs path, starting the wrong Emacs version and causing straight.el to recompile everything on startup : solution to that is copying /usr/lib/systemd/user/emacs.service to ~/.config/systemd/user and altering the paths to your own Emacs version (Debian paths there).
 The settings of desktop-save and desktop-path in combination with needing a desktop-read call are, on observation, what caused much confusion out there in google land. 
 Maybe not news to many, but I thought I&#x27;d share the snippet as googling showed it&#x27;s still an issue for some.
 ​
  (use-package emacs :custom (desktop-path &#x27;(&quot;~/.emacs.d/var/desktop&quot;)) (desktop-save t) :init (defun rgr/restore-desktop() (when (fboundp &#x27;alert) (alert (message (format &quot;loading desktop from %s&quot; desktop-path)))) ;;I include the run-with-timer despite being able to get this to work without as it&#x27;s a timing ;;issue and a little delay does no one any harm (run-at-time &quot;1&quot; nil (lambda() (desktop-read) (desktop-save-mode 1)))) (add-hook &#x27;emacs-startup-hook (lambda() (if (daemonp) (add-hook &#x27;server-after-make-frame-hook &#x27;rgr/restore-desktop) (rgr/restore-desktop)))))

                    <span>When you pick up a toad or a grasshopper they pee or vomit resp. It&#x27;s their defense mechanism to make themselves less appealing. Likewise Haskell, when you pick it up starts oozing mathematics. Most put it right back down. Here&#x27;s a quote from a brilliant blogger here who is describing &#x60;head&#x60; and how it must accommodate the empty list:
  
If we have a list, we might very well want to get the first element in it. And indeed, the operation of “getting the first element of a list” isn’t impossible in Haskell, it just requires a little extra ceremony.
  
&quot;Extra ceremony,&quot; indeed. So between Bird and de Moor&#x27;s Algebra of Programming and these one-off blog posts is a scavenger hunt for the math behind Haskell. Certainly a beginner doesn&#x27;t need any math to bust through one of the many starter tuto…</span>

How can I do?

                    <span>I went through some litterature and there they talk about overloading. 
 From what I understand Haskell does not support this in the most general sense, I can&#x27;t declare two functions of the same name. I can only do such a thing if I declare a typeclass, correct? Then I can in that class declare a function that can take a multitude of different parameters, depending on what I&#x27;d want? 
 Some clarity on this would be greatly appreciated! :)

                    <span>Hey everyone. I&#x27;m assembling a new team of engineers for working on a new long-term project in the payments area. We believe that Haskell may give us an edge in terms of maintainability and developer efficiency so I&#x27;m keen to meet anyone who is wanting to take a new position to work with Haskell in their day job.
 The project is almost entirely greenfield, so new hires will have a great deal of agency in steering how the tech stack will be shaped.
 We&#x27;re open to having remote employees. We sponsor visas and help with relocation too.
 I&#x27;m happy to answer any questions about the role here, but if you want to apply for the position, please use our page.
 About the company
 We are a leading, fast-growing Nordic fashion and beauty e-commerce company. You can find our headquarters in Malmö, Sweden, but we also have a few physical retail stores in the Copenhagen area. We also have development teams in Aarhus, Copenhagen, Vilnius, and Poznan. We are also running a fully automated warehouse in Ängelholm, Sweden.

                    <span>Total noob here but very dissatisfied with python as a language, dipped toe in clojure and Common Lisp waters but not doing it for me. Then I saw haskells partial application: let a &#x3D; (1 +) and my mind was blown. Watched a few presentations and I’m convinced this is the language to learn. I gotta learn this language. It appears it’s not really a ‘step 1 &#x3D; toy example first’ kinda language instead i need to study up and grasp a lot before using Haskell in real life problems. So any advice ahead of my journey to learn Haskell? I just realise there are so many expert haskellers here would love any advice that makes the journey as useful as possible. Do you think I should start with some basic tutorials then project Euler (or something similar)? Or better getter some great big book and reading all the theory first?

                    <span>Dear Orgers... :)
 In the org manual, &quot;7.5.3 Capturing column view&quot;, in https://orgmode.org/manual/Capturing-column-view.html#Capturing-column-view says:
  
Since column view is just an overlay over a buffer, it cannot be exported or printed directly. If you want to capture a column view, use a ‘columnview’ dynamic block (see Dynamic Blocks). The frame of this block looks like this: 
 #+BEGIN: columnview :hlines 1 :id &quot;label&quot; 
 #+END: 
 This dynamic block has the following parameters: 
 ‘:id’ - This is the most important parameter. Column view is a feature that is often localized to a certain (sub)tree, and the capture block might be at a different location in the file. To identify the tree whose view to capture, you can use four values: 
 -- ‘local’ - Use the tree in which the capture block is located. 
 -- ‘global’ - Make a global view, including all headings in the file. 
 -- ‘file:FILENAME’ Run column view at the top of the FILENAME file. 
 -- ‘LABEL’ - Call column view in the tree that has an ‘ID’ property with the value LABEL. You can use M-x org-id-copy to create a globally unique ID for the current entry and copy it to the kill-ring.
  
Since the option for ‘LABEL’ says, &quot;Call column view in the tree that has an ‘ID’ property...&quot;, my question is: how do you capture a column view that is in the same file, but another tree?
 For example
  
chapter 
 subtitle
 another subtitle that tries to capture the tree with logs
 
 another chapter 
 tree with logs (that can be seen as column-view)
 
  
As always, thank you very much for your generous help, time and attention... :)
 Best regards...

 (eval-after-load &quot;evil-mode&quot; &#x27;(progn (define-key evil-mode-map (kbd &quot;C-f&quot;) nil))) 
 And set the C-f:
 (global-set-key (kbd &quot;C-f&quot;) &#x27;isearch-forward) 
 But C-f still bound to emacs setting:(the output of C-h,k)
  
(evil-scroll-page-down COUNT)

                    <span>Sorry for a weird title, I couldn&#x27;t think of a way to word it neatly. 
 Anyways, I have been using company-mode for a while now, and it has worked perfectly for me. I recently switched to using evil mode and now when I type, the company mode box pops up, but it doesn&#x27;t automatically put the cursor there. Instead I have to manually scroll down with C-n to get the a selection to the company mode box.
 I of course thought that it was an issue with evil mode, but nothing looks wrong to me. 
 Any suggestions of what could be the issue or any possible solution?

                    <span>Is there a hook for dired-do-shell-command so that the dired buffer can be refreshed automatically? I think this is a very common use case. 
 If there is no hook for this, is there another way to do this?

                    <span>I have set &quot;down-mouse&quot; to enable god mode and &quot;mouse&quot; to disable when I release the mouse key. This allow me to conviently toggle control using my laptop mouse. Its is a bit of a hack. I want to do the same for meta but with another mouse button but cannot understand how god mode works to do this on my own. An overview would understand what is going on and how it is able to do what it does.

                    <span>I write files to SSH shares and I automatically create the destination directories if they don&#x27;t exist. 
 The problem is if the share is not connected the files are created on the local hard disk instead of the network.
 Does Emacs have an option to check if a directory points to network share or a local directory?
 On Linux checking /etc/mtab is a possibility but I prefer something higher level that will work on Windows too.

                    <span>I&#x27;m trying to see if org-ref might work for me when writing in emacs. In a current project, I want to be able to write long-form citations of the type that one frequently sees in humanities texts. What I mean are footnotes that may include multiple citations, and some additional analysis. Here&#x27;s a random example:
 ​

 So what you have is a footnote with a citation in it, but also some text. Can you do this with org-ref?

 Guys, 
 What are your others bindings which you loved it while editing texts/programming?,
 may be not mentioned in emacs docs but actually highly productive (not evil).
 Thanks for getting me know . :)

                    <span>I put Emacs and Visual Studio side by side on my 4k Monitor and for some reason Visual Studio Code looks better from a color perspective. 
 Why is this so? and can I do anything to fix this? or is this just my imagination but some colors on visual studio code just look sharper and darker.

                    <span>Greetings,
 ​
 I installed google-translate library (https://hackage.haskell.org/package/google-translate)and i need help using it.
  
When i compile it i get these errors
  
​
 https://preview.redd.it/ka7psbf0f3371.png?width&#x3D;659&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;9b18bb562c9a5fb75bcb6aa0137b850c70f00b29
 Also, i should mention that in link that i provided it shows one more import
 import Network.HTTP.Client.TLS 
 that i had to remove cause it was throwing this error
 ​
 https://preview.redd.it/e8a28vtdf3371.png?width&#x3D;556&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;9eae177e7942bd119773b1f8cdc1c69e0c7b2f69
 My question is how do i get this API-key that is required?
 (Im using cabal to run this, if it means anything)
 ​
 EDIT:

 I forgot to include code, i also fixed some of the errors but i currently have &quot;pattern match failure..&quot; in line 13 (columns 11-57, which would be the whole line before &quot;&lt;-&quot; part) and still nost sure about this api thing in line 15

 Has anyone installed haste on a recent environment ? (of course cabal update &amp;&amp; cabal install haste-compiler fails on ghc 8.10+) Any advice to use haste while keeping ghcup ?

                    <span>I apologize for this beginner question, I am very new to Haskell.
 Goal
 Follow the exercises from http://learn.hfm.io/fractals.html inside a Jupyter Notebook (running on Windows and WSL2) so that I can see the output live without having to manually open any images.
 What I did so far:
  
Followed Installation steps for Linux: https://github.com/gibiansky/IHaskell:

                    <span>I am happy to announce the 1.0 release of TTC (Textual Type Classes).
 The library provides the following functionality:
  
The Textual type class is used to convert between common textual data types. It can be used to write functions that accept or return values of any of these textual data types.
 
The Render type class is used to render a value as text. Avoid bugs by only using Show for debugging/development purposes.
 
The Parse type class is used to parse a value from text. Unlike Read, it has support for error messages.
 
Validate constants at compile-time using Parse instances.

                    <span>I started this before Christmas, and finished it a couple of months back, but only just finished adding all the fish into it that we wanted (actually, we are due to get another 5 or 10 neon tetras for my eldest’s birthday, but it’s full at that point).

The algae has taken hold though, so going to need to do a cleanup job unless I can get some adult shrimp that will do a better job than the oto’s i bought for cleanup purposes…</span>

                    <span>First some context:
As I understand Luhmann workflow...
He put every interesting thoughts he have as a permanent note without worrying too much. (Like a skeptic tank)
His notes are really short (generally 1 to 3 sentences).
I see nobody else using the Zettelkasten in this way. Lot of people create longer notes and try to synthesize before putting the ideas into the system.
Last but not least: the system is created for academic research in mind.
My frictions:
1) When I think and want to create new notes... having to search existing notes in the Zettelkasten stops my thinking flow.
I am wondering if it’s not better to just create note without connection when I think... and only then look at the possible connections. But that will create a lot of duplicates.
Or thinking more deeply before putting the note and find the connections. (But I feel I don’t leverage the Zettelkasten fully by this way)
2) When I want to create a new content... going to the Zettelkasten kills my creative flow. As I am not creating academic content (but marketing content)... The most important in the content isn’t the information, but the emotion (you can only put emotion in a content with your first brain in a specific mood)
Because of this 2 things... I am wondering if a Zettelkasten is the best tool for me.
And if it is... I am wondering why only luhmann work in a very atomic way without bothering of the quality of the note. And why mainy people create longer note with digital zettelkasten.
My question:
I deliberately don’t ask a specific question because at this point, I don’t really know what is the good question to ask myself.
Maybe: How to determine the best way of organizing the process and scope of permanent notes ?
Thanks for reading.

I am playing with the Zettelkasten principles since 1-2 years now.  I am an entrepreneur interested in productivity, pkm and marketing.
I am a native french speaker and will try my best to write in good english.
I will be happy to share my insights with you.

                    <span>I keep finding myself in the situation of wanting to put a citation to a statement but I can&#x27;t never remember where I read this piece of information. In some places, this is unacceptable so I have to improve. I&#x27;m an mainly interested in improving links to help me find a reference statements I want to make.
I was initially in awe of the concept of ZK but now I&#x27;m not so sure. I tend to think in pictures but this is all about text. I find that in order to link then you need to know the destination of whatever you want to link to. Yet, if I know the reference then I already have the link in my mind.</span>

                    <span>Hi, I’m very new to emacs and have been using org-mode to keep up with tasks at work. I have some pretty lengthy task descriptions and was wondering if I have something like
 * Task ** TODO This is the first line and this is the second line. 
 if it is possible to change both lines to green when I change the TODO to DONE. The syntax highlighting does not seem to carry over. If I add ** to the second line and change the TODO to DONE, it also does not seem to change it. I have searched online, but cannot find an answer. 
 Thanks in advance!

                    <span>I need something like Treemacs or Neotree (sticky buffer on the side) that shows recently visited buffers. Basically, (projectile-recentf) content in a fixed buffer.
 Anyone knows if something like that exists already?

                    <span>While I actively use SAMPA / Greek / TeX and even played with rfc1345 input method I cannot find input method for emoji.
 That stops me from becoming fluent nodejs software developer.
 Probably I&#x27;m mistaken in idea that emoji are represented by UTF-8 codepoints. Correct me if I&#x27;m wrong, because some environments (like GitHub .md or hipsters&#x27; web-chats) could render :smile: or ;) instead of UTF-8 symbol... In that case I don&#x27;t need -input-method but emoji trainer program ))

                    <span>I am using deft with my org-mode, and it has this annoying feature to kill whitespaces at the end of title lines.
 The problem is it constantly saves and remove the wihtespaces while I am typing, is there a way to disable it?

All I need is to be able to serve a directory as an HTTP server and have it auto-reload in my browser when I save any of the js, html, css, etc files in the directory.
 I would try to make sense of this myself, but I&#x27;m not quite proficient enough in Emacs yet.

                    <span>Is there a trick to store a gnus org-link when I C-c C-c in a message-mode buffer? The gnus links seem to look like gnus:$METHOD:$GROUP#$MESSAGEID, but I suppose message id doesn&#x27;t exist before the message is sent? (I&#x27;m doing Gcc: &quot;nnimap+fm:Sent Items&quot; which I guess means a copy is saved locally as I send it.)

                    <span>Hi,
 can you give me an advice about how I can copy a text from a buffer with so-long mode ?

                    <span>Hi, 
 I am wondering if some mu4e-users here might have suggestions about doing attachments. I have been looking at https://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/mu4e/Dired.html, but I&#x27;m wondering if there are better ways (e.g., pre-existing packages) to do this which I might be overlooking. 
 Cheers

                    <span>This is a thread for smaller, miscellaneous items that might not warrant a full post. 
 Don&#x27;t feel constrained in regards to what you post, just keep your post vaguely, generally on the topic of emacs.

                    <span>I am an emacs beginner, and trying to do some C++ programming in emacs. I am having a lot of trouble to get tabs to work in emacs like I would expect them to work like in Sublime Text.
 This is how my code looks in emacs:
 std::cout &quot;; std::getline(std::cin, source); Object* expr &#x3D; read(source); Object* evaluated_expr &#x3D; eval(expr, global_environment); std::cout  &quot;; std::getline(std::cin, source); Object* expr &#x3D; read(source); Object* evaluated_expr &#x3D; eval(expr, global_environment); std::cout &lt;&lt; print(evaluated_expr) &lt;&lt; std::endl; } return 0; 
 emacs seems to be inserting only one tab for even indentation that goes more than a level deep, and that is pretty frustrating to work with. I would rather emacs insert n tabs for n levels of indentation. How am I supposed to change this behavior?

                    <span>I&#x27;m trying to create a Mac installer for a project that uses the SDL2 library and a couple of extension libs.
 Currently when I build, things are linking against the libraries installed on my system via homebrew in /usr/local/opt/. However, when I package these libraries with my program they are not recognized as safe to run on others&#x27; systems, so in order to run my program a user has to go through a launch, crash, allow library to be run cycle for each of the libs I link against until everything is allowed. This is obviously a no-go from a user friendliness perspective.
 I figured if I could link against the Mac frameworks for the libs that they should be signed (as they&#x27;ve been released as frameworks) and the user would only have to go through this allow process for just my app executable (until I get it signed). However, I&#x27;m not sure how to link against the frameworks.
 I tried repointing the executable to the framework dylibs using the install_name_tool, but the versions differ between the homebrew and framework versions of the libs, which made my app not run -- I&#x27;ve since thought better of trying to use this method in case there were incompatibilities between the entry points of the lib versions.
 My next thought was that I would have to link to the frameworks at build-time, but adding the -framework ghc option when I run stack build doesn&#x27;t seem to have any effect -- it still points to the homebrew versions. Maybe the Haskell bindings are set to point at the homebrew versions only?
 This is the first user-facing application I&#x27;ve developed on Mac, so I&#x27;m in a bit over my head. I&#x27;d like to have the standard DMG/drag-the-app-into-Applications installer for the app, as I don&#x27;t know that homebrew would be the friendliest install method for my target audience.
 Any help or suggestions are appreciated!

                    <span>Hi all,
 I just released a new chapter focusing on IO in my online course Foundations of FP in Scala https://www.fp-tower.com/courses/foundations
  
Includes 16 videos, around 4.5 hours in total.
 Lots of exercises, including a very realistic one where we implement a search flight aggregator similar to skyscanner
 We’ll cover features such as by-name parameters, lazy evaluation, dependency injection, and concurrency.
 We’ll study the differences between IO and Future extensively. 
 This chapter is a perfect introduction to cats-effect, Monix and ZIO.
  
Let me know if you have any questions!

                    <span>If I have a generic type that could only be one of two types: Apples and Pears, how can I use a unique method from each of those traits generically?
 trait Apples { def aaa: Int } trait Pears { def ppp: Int } def foo[T](x: T): Int &#x3D; { // x.aaa OR x.ppp } 
 I know there must be a nice way of doing this in Scala. Also, is this called a polymorphic method?

Hey guys. I created zettel notes after i couldn&#x27;t find any app for zettelkasten on android.
As of now zettel notes supports:
Full Markdown
Note Linking
Multiple repositories with default text and date format for each
Extract note from within note
#tags
@authors
Share text from any app to create new note
Sort Notes by last modified, words, frequency of note opening, title, date
Do let me know, what you all think about zettel notes.</span>

                    <span>I&#x27;m a very keyboard-centric person, however sometimes I still like to use the mouse to scroll down certain files in emacs (usually docs and the like). Plus, I don&#x27;t really like scrolling line by line, so I&#x27;ve been trying to have emacs scroll smoothly.
 Sadly, I&#x27;ve found the emacs smooth scrolling experience to be janky at best: no matter what workarounds I use (I&#x27;ve tried several, including all of those listed on the emacswiki page as well as good-scroll.el), smooth scrolling feels sluggish, not fluid, and often unresponsive.
 I wonder what the root cause for this is. Most of the explanations I&#x27;ve read revolve around emacs&#x27; lack of animation support. For example, the github page of smooth-scroll.el states the following:
  
Scrolling sometimes pauses or stutters. It&#x27;s unclear exactly why, but one factor is that Emacs lacks animation support. Emacs has timers for updating the screen contents, which is enough for playing simple animated GIF files, but not enough for video playback or frame-perfect smooth scrolling.
  
My question is the following: what would it take to fix it? I know that emacs is very old, and some features might just be outside of its capabilities (at least for now). Is smooth scrolling support one such feature?
 I understand that emacs wasn&#x27;t made with smooth scrolling in mind, and I don&#x27;t mean to criticize and/or diminish the amazing work that went into it. I&#x27;m extremely happy with my emacs experience--smooth scrolling would just be the icing on the cake.
 Thank you in advance!

                    <span>I&#x27;ve recently started using vertico, marginalia and embark together, and it&#x27;s been great. I like that they&#x27;re relatively light weight.
 I&#x27;ve used helm for a long time, and it&#x27;s honestly very good, but I&#x27;m mostly only using it for its locate functionality now. I use everything search on windows, which in combination with the .dir-locals.el lets me set a search instance depending on the directory I start the search from. I know about projectile, of course, but it&#x27;s slower and more finicky than everything. (With everything, I can set up a search that spans many directories on many drives and make it a named instance, and then just query the named instance in the arguments.)
 Helm&#x27;s locate is the only decent and maintained way to do this that I&#x27;ve found. Scrounging up random .el files from EmacsWiki doesn&#x27;t really work for me.
 If there isn&#x27;t, no big deal. I&#x27;ll keep helm updated.

                    <span>Hi, I&#x27;m still fairly new to Emacs, I use Doom Emacs and I wanted to rebind some evil keybindings. I tend not to use t very often so I wanted to rebind it to evil-snipe-s/S so I can have evil-substitute. I did something like this in my config.el:
 (evil-global-set-key &#x27;normal &quot;t&quot; &#x27;evil-snipe-s)
 (evil-global-set-key &#x27;normal &quot;s&quot; &#x27;evil-substitute)
 (evil-global-set-key &#x27;normal &quot;T&quot; &#x27;evil-snipe-S)
 evil-snipe-s/S seems to work, but evil-substitute does not, pressing s still invokes evil-snipe-s, I imagine I might need to remove the old key binding in order to do that, but I don&#x27;t know how

                    <span>I wrote a blog article on migrating from Thunderbird to GNOME Evolutuion for email and calendar management. While this is not particular on-topic for here, I also took the chance and documented my method to link to emails from Org mode and generate those links in the first place. You might be interested in this use-case.

                    <span>This may well be obvious to those of you conversant with lisp, but...
 How do I get ibuffer to show me both sets of groups (the &quot;saved filter groups&quot; and also those from projectile via ibuffer-projectile). Both ibuffer-projectile:
 (add-hook &#x27;ibuffer-hook (lambda () (ibuffer-projectile-set-filter-groups))) 
 and what I previously had:
 (setq ibuffer-saved-filter-groups (quote ((&quot;default&quot; (&quot;org&quot; (or (name . &quot;^\\*Org Agenda\\*$&quot;) (mode . org-mode))) (&quot;emacs&quot; (or (name . &quot;^\\*Compile-Log\\*$&quot;) (name . &quot;^\\*scratch\\*$&quot;) (name . &quot;^\\*Messages\\*$&quot;))) )))) (add-hook &#x27;ibuffer-mode-hook (lambda () (message &quot;.emacs hook&quot;) (ibuffer-auto-mode 1) (ibuffer-switch-to-saved-filter-groups &quot;default&quot;))) 
 work fine, but I can&#x27;t get the results to combine. It seems I can have one or the other. The ibuffer-projectile documentation suggests that using ibuffer-projectile-generate-filter-groups is key, but I don&#x27;t get the projectile groups when I use that.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve finally gotten around to work on some updates for this package. The new version is on melpa, but I won&#x27;t put it on melpa-stable yet until it has been tested by more people. Noteworthy new features are:
  
the package now filters remote content from html emails to address issues with tracking in emails. This is currently quite naive, but users can customize filters. Any feedback / help from somebody who understands email tracking better than I do is appreciated.
 the new dispatcher view method determines how to show emails based on a set of customizable rules (e.g., you could use this to show remote content for trusted email addresses)
 you can now temporarily redisplay the current email using a different viewing method. For instance, to switch from filtering remote content for an email to showing remote content.

 mu4e showing unread messages even though none exists
 I also check bin,spam and all the other folders on gmail but I simply do not have any unread mails. This is not a major issue but it is kinda annoying.

                    <span>A friend of mine complained about the un-pythonesque syntax of c++, so I&#x27;ve made a small minor mode that replaces braces with :. The indentation is provided by clang-format/aggressive-indent-mode. Braces are automatically shown upon editing nearby the :. It is pretty unpractical to work this way :P. The code is pretty abysmal ^^.

                    <span>Hi all, I&#x27;ve been working on bespoke-themes, which started out as a fork of Nicolas Rougier’s amazing work on elegant-emacs and nano-emacs. It sports a similar vibe, though some of the base colors are different and it is slightly less minimal and &quot;opinionated&quot; than nano-emacs. It also has the benefit of being (I hope) easily incorporated into one&#x27;s existing emacs as a theme, rather than the more &quot;distro&quot; style of nano-emacs (which is a great project, but maybe not for everyone). I&#x27;m hoping to submit it to MELPA before too long. Long story short though, I&#x27;m looking for advice on the following:
  
Organization of the theme files
 Elisp (I&#x27;m not any sort of programmer) 
 Whether I should break the mode line out into its own repo
 Any useful tips on colors (that you hate/like it is one thing -- I&#x27;m more curious about tips concerning visibility or contrast, etc.)
 Stuff to do before I submit it to MELPA (especially anything not covered by the README)
  
Thanks!

                    <span>Haskell beginner here: Is it good practice to mix both let and where bindings in a function definition?
 For example (with short being a short function and reallyLongFunc being a really long function):
 foo x &#x3D; let short y &#x3D; y * 2 in if odd x then short x else reallyLongFunc x where reallyLongFunc z &#x3D; z + 2 
 Using let at the top and where at the bottom allows me to arrange the function definitions next to where they are used, and allows large function definitions to not interrupt the logical flow of the program. However, I could also understand that it might be bad practice to use both let and where, because I have not seen this done anywhere, and it might be mixing expression and declaration styles.
 What do you think?

                    <span>Hello. I’m a professional Golang developer. I previous worked with Java for 10 years and Python for a few years as well.
 I tried to learn Haskell back in 2016 with the book “Real World Haskell. But I found the book to be really dry and frankly boring. It was a struggle to get through. And after about 8 chapters I saw very little “real world”.
 I find that most education material seems to run all examples in the repl. And that is just off putting to me. Especially when I see “real world” apps and I can’t understand what’s going on.
 Also I find that too many tutorials focus way too much on math problems. And that’s cool. But how do I get from math problems to building entire apps. To me there doesn’t seem to be any real progression.
 I know plenty of languages and I found I learn better by trying to build real things. Yet I find most Haskell tutorials and education shy away from showing real world applications. And reading source code is confusing since it’s hard to distinguish between built in functions and user defined functions.
 Anyway is there a middle ground between these heavily mathematical examples. And actual real world application. There seems to be a lot of ceremony in real world Haskell apps.
 I do enjoy the Haskell type system. And I like it’s expressiveness. I wish I could enjoy it like others do. I just have never got that “aha” moment because it’s hard to just jump in and get dirty with the language.
 Any suggestions?

                    <span>I&#x27;m writing a small wrapper package for the MLIR C API -- I&#x27;d like the bindings to be similar to the ones exported by [llvm-hs](https://github.com/llvm-hs/llvm-hs). However, I&#x27;m relatively new to the FFI (and Haskell in general), so I&#x27;m running into various build issues.
 I&#x27;m looking for someone with a bit of experience to chat with about the package: https://github.com/femtomc/mlir-hs
 In particular, I&#x27;m getting linking failures when I build now -- so I&#x27;m trying to communicate the correct information to &#x60;stack&#x60; so that it can find the C headers, etc. 
 Other random questions: is it possible to bundle this up so that Nix can manage the LLVM/MLIR dependency/versioning? If yes -- and someone is aware of reading material, I&#x27;d love to take a look and learn how to do this.

                    <span>I&#x27;m embedding images in org-mode using org-download, which saves the captured image that is in the clipboard, inserts the path as text in the org file, and then display the image inline. This works fine. [[file:.images/morepathstuff:/2021-04-12_04-44-34_screenshot.png]]
 But I can&#x27;t copy the image out, without drawing a rectangle around the image with a screen capture tool like flameshot. I can only copy the emacs image file path as shown above.
 How can I copy the image itself into the clipboard, and not just the emacs image file path? 
  
I&#x27;m do not want to use a file manager, find the image, and copy it, as file names are often long and un-intelligble, and I can have many images in one directory.
 I guess the preferred method would be some elisp function where I highlight an inline image (to select/highlight the path), and then it copies that path, interprets that path, finds the image, and copies the image itself into my clipboard. But I don&#x27;t think that exists yet.

For example, my first level headers are set to a height of 1.25 but when I type &#x27;TODO&#x27; in, it uses the standard size for that word. I&#x27;m not sure what I need to inherit.
 I&#x27;m using Doom Emacs and have only just switched from (neo)vim so don&#x27;t really know what I&#x27;m doing yet
 Edit: I noticed that if I do not add any custom formatting to todo&#x27;s with org-todo-keyword-faces this is default behaviour, but I can&#x27;t get it to work for customized faces.

 Example:
 * foo ** bar *** baz| 
 Where | is point, then the minibuffer shows &quot;foo/bar/baz&quot;.
 That gets annoying for long paths because the minibuffer resizes to fit multiple lines and such.

                    <span>Hi, any nvim users arround here? I was wondering if any of you tried using treesitter with scala. 
 Looks like a lot of other languages are getting awesome functionality with it, but scala doesn&#x27;t seem to be supported out of the box.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve written a book using org-mode and I&#x27;m trying to export as an HTML/website, similar to this example. That was written using R and Bookdown, but since it all ends up as CSS/HTML, I don&#x27;t see why the same thing can&#x27;t be replicated with org-mode. 
 I&#x27;ve been trying to use org-publish to do this, but I&#x27;m running into a couple of issues. 
  
I can&#x27;t seem to replicate the book structure of the above example -- it all comes out as one single long HTML file. I&#x27;m using separate files for each chapter, and then a main.org file where each chapter is included via #+INCLUDE statements. What is the best way to achieve this? In other words, I want a front page with a TOC, and then each chapter to be a separate page and to have previous and next links for navigation.
 
I&#x27;ve been using the org-ref package to cross-reference figures/tables/sections in the book, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to work across multiple files. E.g. if I am in chapter 4 and I want to reference something in chapter 2 (using the label: and ref: keywords respectively), org-ref doesn&#x27;t seem to recognize it. Any way around this?
 
Lastly, I&#x27;d very much appreciate any examples of books like this being made in org-mode and exported as HMTL/websites, for inspiration. Or &quot;book-themed&quot; CSS templates that can be implemented painlessly. The only one I&#x27;m aware of is the org-mode manual itself, but aesthetically it is very far from what I&#x27;m looking for.

                    <span>I have been testing Doom Emacs for last couple of days to maybe make the move to it. I am not a Vim user so my preferred method will be regular emacs bindings.
 What I am doing now is switching to emacs keybindings with C-z and then edit normally but when I am in an org file if I press TAB the headline gets moved to the right instead of folding or unfolding. 
 Anybody experiencing this?

                    <span>I&#x27;ve recently moved from Straight to package.el for package management (long story), and have been reading-up on how package.el actually works, I took some notes and figured I&#x27;d share. I&#x27;m surprised that so few configs I see on GitHub take into account the subtleties of how package.el works, particularly in how it interacts with Use Package.
 I think all of the below is correct, but if I&#x27;m missing or am wrong about anything please tell me in the comments and I&#x27;ll correct the text.
 Unsurprisingly, all of this is well documented in (info &quot;(elisp) Startup Summary&quot;) and (info &quot;(emacs) Packages&quot;) so I&#x27;m not writing anything groundbreaking here, just summarizing available information.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been using straight.el for a while now and am very happy with it. However, emacs being emacs I thought I&#x27;d try an alternative in borg. 
 There are three installation routes documented :- 
 1) as a secondary package manager
 2) using a seeded bootstrap
 3) using your own &quot;from scratch&quot; bootstrap
 ​
 I followed 3) since 2) meant cloning into my .emacs.d which is already a git repo and I didn&#x27;t want to potentially screw that over. Anyway, some trial and error I have emacs starting up with borg and I have 5 or 6 things assimiliated in to .emacs.d/lib.
 But is it correct that things not in there are loaded from ~/.emacs.d/elpa? I ask this because I&#x27;m not sure how this is then different from &quot;using borg as a secondary package manager&quot;. package-install still works installing to the elpa directory. This seems to make sense as there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a way to auto magically auto assimilate (but being very new to this, there might be one I overlooked).

                    <span>I think it would be great if the Emacs documentation was more accessible on mobile devices, either for those long journeys when you need something interesting to read, or at night in bed when you want to do some light reading (heh).
 Idea 1: Treat each manual like an Ebook
 The easiest way to do this would be to convert the source Tex files used to generate the online documentation into an indexed EPUB format, using pandoc or other.
 We could then rely on existing Ebook readers to handle the formatting issues, bookmarking, and search queries.
 Edit -- /u/alraban points out that there exists already an epub resource:
 http://epub-manuals.ourproject.org/blog/gnu-emacs-lisp-reference-manual/
 Idea 2: Treat it like a Bible App
 Bible apps are awesome, they come with the all advantages of Ebook readers (formatting, bookmarking, annotation) with the added bonus that they bundle all related material under a single app.
 Given the diversity of Emacs-specific material in GNU this could be a great way to contain several different manuals, over several different versions of documentation (with optional &#x27;diff&#x27; highlights), all in one place.
 There are a few FOSS bible app templates on github, but I&#x27;m not that versed in android development anymore so this is likely something I cannot do without a lot of effort. 
 Is there anyone in this sub who is versed in Android development and would be willing to evangelize the Emacs documentation on mobile? I&#x27;d be happy to chip in a few dozen coffee funds

                    <span>I usually keep
  
one emacs instance for general notetaking and capturing, agenda and etc.
 one emacs instance for every project that I work (usually limited to 2, I am trying out projectile, but still prefer separate projects hacked away in separate emacs instances)
 one for org-noter for reading pdfs - one instance per pdf
  
I love the integrated computing environment idea, making everything seamlessly work together, I am still honing my config to achieve that, but for the moment separate instances workflow helps me get things done.
 I am thinking of exploiting chemacs in combination with .desktop files to launch emacs to specific tasks, but is there a better way to do this?
 EDIT:
 as u/sjchy pointed out,
 Visually differentiating workspace is vital for me. I didn&#x27;t mention this in the OP. but I use leuven theme for general notetaking and solarized for projects and tango-dark for org-noter at the moment.

                    <span>i wanted to make ansi-term appear at the bottom of the frame so i tried doing
  (display-buffer-alist &#x27;((&quot;\\*ansi-term\\*&quot; (display-buffer-in-side-window) (side . bottom) (slot . -1) (window-height . 0.3))) )) 
 but it doesn&#x27;t work.
 the same works well with eshell or shell
  (display-buffer-alist &#x27;((&quot;\\*e?shell\\*&quot; (display-buffer-in-side-window) (side . bottom) (slot . -1) (window-height . 0.3))) )) 
 what i am doing wrong here ?
 your help is appreciated.
 EDIT: solved
 apparently ansi-term and term uses pop-to-buffer instead of switch-to-buffer so to make them obey display-buffer-alist need to set
  (setq switch-to-buffer-obey-display-actions t)

                    <span>I will try to illustrate my buffer and cursor (point) as follows: 
 [T]he letter with the brackets around it is where the cursor is at 
 I start with this line, in a very narrow Emacs window. Note, it is a single line in the file, but two lines visually, because my editor is very narrow (for testing purposes).
 [T]his is a long line, it wraps. 
 Run evil-end-of-line ($):
 This is a long line, it wraps[.] 
 Run evil-previous-visual-line (gk):
 [] This is a long line, it wraps. 
 The problem here is that it didn&#x27;t go to the previous visual line.
 However, evil-previous-visual-line (gk) does sometimes work. Consider:
 [T]his is a long line, it wraps. 
 Run evil-end-of-line ($):
 This is a long line, it wraps[.] 
 Run evil-backward-char (h), then run evil-forward-char (l):
 This is a long line, it wraps[.] 
 Now run evil-previous-visual-line (gk):
 This is[ ]a long line, it wraps. 
 Now evil-previous-line works as expected.
 This problem seems to come from mixing regular commands and visual line mode aware commands. Going directly from a non visual line aware command to a visual line aware command causes problems. But if I do evil-forward-char in between, everything works.
 Any suggestions on how I can fix this?

                    <span>So i have this assignment where i have to code a game called &quot;Nim&quot; where two players take turns removing objects from distinct heaps or piles, and the player that gets to remove the last object wins. I&#x27;ve already coded a function for doing a specific move, i.e : play [1,2,3,4] (3,2) &#x3D; [1,2,1,4]. [1,2,3,4] would be the number of objects on each tile, and (3,2) would be removing 2 objects from the third tile. I also coded a function that gives a list of all the posible plays on a specific board position, i.e: possiblePlays [1,2,3] &#x3D; [(1,1), (2,2),(2,1),(3,3), (3,2), (3,1)] The problem i&#x27;m having is that now i have to code a function that tells me if a board position (like [1,2,3,4]) is &quot;winnable&quot;: a board position is winnable if a play exists that can lead to the other player getting a not winnable board position. i.e: isItWinnable [] &#x3D; False (because you can&#x27;t make another move, so you lose) isItWinnable [1] &#x3D; True (because you get to remove the last object). I think these could be the base cases, but i&#x27;m having a lot of trouble thinking the recursion. I&#x27;m sorry for the long post and the messy english, it&#x27;s not my native language and i had to translate everything from spanish. If anyone has any ideas or tips it would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.

 I basically have this code, the purpose of it is to find out if the structure I created is Correct. Basically the &quot;Stein&quot; has inside it all the other elements that are supposed to be above it. The &quot;Dach&quot; is the Roof and so it cannot take anything else above it. The correctness of the Structure is determined by the length of all the elements above a &quot;Stein&quot;. So if it were that the total length of all elements above the &quot;Stein&quot; is smaller or equal to the Length of that &quot;Stein&quot; the Structure is considered Correct and true is given out. But I have no clue how I should continue from this point onwards. I have no clue how to verify the Length of all the structures above a &quot;Stein&quot; in such a way that still only Boolean comes out in the end.
 Edit: I did manage to come up with somewhat of a hacky solution to it which I am not really a fan of.
 correct :: Legu -&gt; Bool correct x &#x3D; 0  if le &gt;&#x3D; sum l &amp;&amp; sum l &gt;&#x3D; 0 then le else -le) const x 
 Is there a more elegant way with which to do this, I am particularly not a fan of the fact I am simply giving out a negative number if the structure is not correct.

 How can i tell Obelisk that i am inside a project folder? I am new to Haskell/Obelisk, i was always used to the comfort of an IDE which can specificially open a project instead of a folder.

 Does anyone study old Haskell projects on Github and try to build executables?
 ​
 I am looking into an old project which was abandoned seven years ago. The current version of the Stack tool fails. Someone gave me a hint I should try Stack v1.9.3 . But how do I get a Windows executable?
 Has anyone blogged about the problem?
 Thanks, Hubert.

                    <span>Hey! I’ve been around the cs subreddits for a bit, and as a high schooler, I often find that I have a difficultly connecting with the others in the various cs subreddits. This is mainly to due the fact that most of the people in those subreddits such as r/programming or r/compsci are adults. Because of this, I created r/cshighschoolers: a place where highschoolers can come together and ask questions, show accomplishments, and discuss classes regarding computer science, programming, and coding! If this seems interesting to you, and you would like to help out a brand new subreddit grow, then come check us out and subscribe! We are also looking for MODS to further help the subreddit. Thanks!

                    <span>I&#x27;m trying to use #+FILETAGS to tag the top-level entries of a file, without having the tag be inherited by every headline in the file.
 Using org-tags-exclude-from-inheritance appears to not be working for #+FILETAGS. Could that be considered a bug?

                    <span>Is anyone using org-babel to write some C++?
 I&#x27;m doing some series on C++ literate programming for numerical analysis and would like to create a session like workflow to avoid big code blocks.
 I tried to use :tangle and :includes header arguments but run in some inconveniences:
  
:tangle does not work if I try to save the file in a sub directory. OK, I can live with having all my files in a single directory.
 :includes when I try to include a file it only recognizes if I provide the absolute path. Which is also annoying.
  
Does anyone has experience with any of that?

                    <span>Hello! I am wanting to switch away from using VS Code as my primary text editor, to using emacs. I know that there are Vim keybindings for Emacs, but was curious if I should learn one before the other. Ultimately I want to know and use both, but was wondering if there would be a benefit from learning one before the other.
 And, so I can be the first one to say it: 
 &quot;Just learn both&quot;
 - Yes, that&#x27;s the plan. I want to know if it would be beneficial to learn one before the other.
 &quot;That&#x27;s comparing le apples to le oranges&quot;
 - Yes, I am referring specifically to the text editor part of Emacs, and Vim, not Emacs as a whole to Vim
 &quot;Emacs isn&#x27;t a text editor dummy&quot;
 - Yes, I know. I&#x27;m talking specifically about the text editor of Emacs, not Emacs as a whole.

 Surprisingly, using the nix build instructions from this snippet:
 https://gist.github.com/mjlbach/179cf58e1b6f5afcb9a99d4aaf54f549#gistcomment-3664894
 , I&#x27;m finally able to get emacsGcc working in my nixos machine running on a raspberry pi 4,
 when I open emacs, everything seems to load up fine, and emacs feels much more snappier, but the issue that I&#x27;m having now is with modes, for example: when I open an html file setup with (direnv+nix-direnv+emacs-direnv), the isolated environment does not load, and whenever I manually execute: M-x html-mode, emacs throws these 2 errors in emacs&#x27;s messages buffer?
 Note: I enabled debugger, and on emacsGcc startup initialization, the debugger is not triggered, which is good, but these 2 errors still show up at the beginning of the messages buffer:
 Eager macro-expansion failure: (wrong-number-of-arguments (3 . 4) 2) [2 times]
 Error loading autoloads: (wrong-number-of-arguments (3 . 4) 2)
 This 3rd error shows up whenever I try to manually activate a specific mode:
 Error running timer: (wrong-number-of-arguments (3 . 4) 2)
 Also, in the async-native-compile-log buffer, I can see the different modes for my project being compiled, but even after the compilation of one of the modes that I need is completed, whenever I try to activate that mode, the same 2 errors from above are thrown?
 Any tips on how to fix this?
 I&#x27;m pretty sure that there&#x27;s an easy fix, but I&#x27;m new to emacsGcc, so there&#x27;s probably some things that I&#x27;m missing to get emacsGcc up and running.
 Thanks in advance for the help!

                    <span>Consult is a collection of useful navigation and search commands based on completing-read, compatible with various completion UIs. Marginalia enhances completion commands with informative annotations in the minibuffer.
 Both packages have been submitted to GNU ELPA recently and became available there today. Hopefully some of the enhancements of these packages can be imported into Emacs proper, for example improved annotation functions, some of the completion commands or API improvements. 
 A while ago, the completing-read API has been enhanced with the group-function metadata, which allows completion UIs to group the set of candidates. This feature started as a Consult extension, which is used by the multi source consult-buffer command. Support for the group-function has been added to the default completion UI and merged into Emacs master.

                    <span>Hi all!
 Just a little question to see if anyone can help me.
 Imagine I have an item with a classic TODO state
 * TODO Buy the milk
 Now, I have another TODO state called TODAY, and I change the state of this item to
 * TODAY Buy the milk
 How can I do to schedule or reschedule (if there exists already a date) to today&#x27;s date automatically after changing to the TODAY state?
 Is there a built-in function for that?
 Thanks for the help.

                    <span>I use emacs to read a lot of PDFs, using the excellent pdf-tools package.
 But (like emacs users everywhere), I was not happy with a couple aspects of the default behavior.
 In particular, I use pdf-occur a lot, but the default behavior of display-buffer is to split my PDF frame vertically into two windows with the top window showing a too-small-to-read view of the PDF and the bottom window showing the list of occurrences.
 Maybe there is a better way, but this is what I did (which I share in case it helps someone else).
  (add-to-list display-buffer-alist &#x27;(&quot;^\\*PDF-Occur\\*$&quot; (display-buffer-pop-up-frame) (pop-up-frame-parameters . (auto-hide-function . delete-frame)))) 
 This causes the *PDF-Occur* buffer to be displayed in a newly-created (&quot;pop-up&quot;) frame instead of splitting the frame with the PDF document into two windows. (The auto-hide-function causes that frame to be deleted when one &quot;quits&quot; the window in that new frame. That is, when you press q in that buffer, the newly-created frame is deleted.)
 However, there is a secondary problem. When you select the occurence you care about in the *PDF-Occur* buffer and press RETURN, it splits that frame vertically and displays the PDF in the lower-half of that frame (again, in a too-small-to-read format).
 I fixed that by adding a function to the hook for the *PDF-Occur* buffer&#x27;s mode like this:
 &#x60;&#x60; (defun my-pdf-occur-buffer-mode-hook () &quot;CauseRETURN&#x27; in this buffer to use the window already displaying the PDF and return focus there.&quot; (make-local-variable &#x27;display-buffer-alist) (setq display-buffer-alist (cons &#x27;(&quot;.*\.pdf$&quot; (display-buffer-reuse-window) (reusable-frames . t)) (default-value &#x27;display-buffer-alist))))
 (add-hook &#x27;pdf-occur-buffer-mode-hook #&#x27;my-pdf-occur-buffer-mode-hook) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Of course, I&#x27;m happy to learn if you have critiques of how I did this—or about any of this.

                    <span>Hi everyone, I&#x27;ve wanted to play around with emacs 28 without putting my current stable (emacs 27) install in jeopardy. This is possible with chemacs2. 
 I followed the README but I&#x27;ll add that one should also delete their package-quickstart.el and other similar files that use hard-coded paths, before moving everything around. 
 Once you have your usual emacs in .emacs.default, you can for example create an empty .emacs.future (or any other name), and set it as a profile in .emacs-profiles.el. 
 Next, you can download emacs and build from source with native compilation if you&#x27;d like. Do not make install, rather we&#x27;ll use the path to the newly built executable. 
 Since chemacs2 keeps everything emacs as calls to the default directory, you won&#x27;t have to change much. 
 What you can do now, is alias to the more recent emacs executable with the future profile. For example, I put the emacs repo in ~/emacs. Meaning that I can do :
 alias ef&#x3D;&quot;/my/home/emacs/src/emacs --with-profile future&quot; 
 To use a different profile with the built from source executable. 
 Thanks to that I have two different versions of emacs with different init files, living together.

 Still wip, I am not good at elisp and any feedbacks or pr are welcome!

 Specifically, is it possible to write this function?
 forallConstraint :: forall kp kq (c :: kq -&gt; Constraint) (t :: kp -&gt; kq) r. (forall (a :: kp). Dict (c (t a))) -&gt; ((forall (a :: kp). c (t a)) &#x3D;&gt; r) -&gt; r forallConstraint &#x3D; ???

 I&#x27;m currently writing a parser using megaparsec which produces the following output:
 data FileElement &#x3D; SyntaxStmt SyntaxStatement | PackageSpec PackageSpecification | ImportStmt ImportStatement | OptionDef OptionDefinition | MsgDef MessageDefinition | EnumDef EnumDefinition | ServiceDef ServiceDefinition deriving (Show, Eq) type File &#x3D; [FileElement] 
 it goes on with more nested substructures.
 Now I realized that I need to record the location in the document for every entity.
 What would be the best way of integrating this into the AST? I would like to avoid changing the AST itself, but have the location information as some sort of &quot;annotation&quot; to the nodes, or just general ideas for that matter.
 I really appreciate your help and happy haskelling.

                    <span>I am a Haskell beginner who made a backtracking sudoku solver, but I am unsure about the quality of the code I wrote. I have come here looking for feedback, but if this is not the right subreddit, please refer me to the correct place. 
 I am mainly looking to get rid of rookie mistakes, not looking for some amazing heuristic to make my sudoku solver 200x faster. 
 It feels to me like there should be improvements I could make to the solve function, but I don&#x27;t really know how or what to improve. 
 The code: https://gist.github.com/lennertcl/548d412def010744594503a17f95f864
 Edit: gist instead of code directly

                    <span>I want to export my agenda as html and/or text but I want the uid(property entry) per entry in the agenda. Any idea on how to set that up?

                    <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;m an absolute noob when it comes to emacs and org-mode. I&#x27;ve been watching a tonne of videos and reading through the manual.
 One thing that I&#x27;m wondering about is whether to use tags or custom properties for adding people to a task? The idea would be that if a task has a status of WAITING that I&#x27;d want to add the associated person to that task. Then when having a meeting with that person I&#x27;d be able to pull up a list of all the tasks that are associated with that person.
 In my current system (in Notion) I actually have a page per person, so that I can write some notes about them, such as favorite food etc. In that setup the tagging of a person to a task and the person&#x27;s info page is one in the same (2 tables that are linked). I&#x27;m wondering what the best way to setup this kind of functionality in org-mode would be?
 TL;DR: Tag or properties for adding people to tasks?
 Thanks in advance!

                    <span>Does anyone know how to include the email address when exported to pdf using LaTeX?
 I tried this from the org site.
 Org Export Settings
 but didn&#x27;t work. Also, I tried Org Export Backend Reference which has an option :with-email which I don&#x27;t know how to set up. I tried adding it in org-export-options-alist but it is throwing an error while exporting.
 UPDATE:
 I am trying to define my own latex class. Below is the snippet of the code.
 (add-to-list &#x27;org-latex-classes
 &#x27;(&quot;ethz&quot;
 ...
 \\makeatletter
 \\renewcommand{\\maketitle}{%
 \\begingroup\\parindent0pt
 \\Small{Aum Tat Sat!}\\par\\bigskip
 \\Huge{\\bfseries\\@title}\\par
 \\LARGE{\\@subtitle}\\par\\bigskip
 \\small{\\@author} \\vspace{1ex}
 \\small{\\@email} \\par
 \\normalsize\\@date\\par\\bigskip
 \\endgroup\\@afterindentfalse\\@afterheading}
 \\makeatother
 ... ))
 I want the email to appear along with the author (if possible, including affiliation). It is exporting everything but email. Sorry for the space, because copy and paste are assuming every line is a new paragraph. 
 NOTE: I asked this question in Stack Overflow, and one person told me to use macro {{{email}}. It is accepting the email but not displaying it properly.

                    <span>The initial state constructor of a Halogen component has the type initialState :: forall input. input -&gt; State. However, I would like the initial state to depend on some browser state (namely the fragment of the URL). Is it possible to construct the initial state in the Effect Monad somehow?

                    <span>hello, i am a java programmer learning elisp, and i heard the best way to learn is to study the source code, so here we go, i learned enough elisp to understand docker-mode package, which is maintained by spotify and i use for work sometimes.
 the purpose of this post is two folds: 
  
help others who is learning elisp. It&#x27;s easy to get started, but confusing at times just b/c there are so many unfamiliar concepts, both from emacs and from lisp. I surely wish someone else had written some deep-dive to help me ramp up faster. Thanks to everyone who helped me during my elisp learning. 
 I am planning to read in depth at least one small and common package per week. If you found this helpful, please recommend me with other small packages (&lt;1000 lines) that&#x27;s fun to use, fun to read. Thanks!

                    <span>Emacs offers CUA-mode out of the box to address users expectations for normal C-c (copy), C-v (paste), C-z (undo) commands. Indeed, this is often an issue that comes up when I am teaching newcomers Emacs. So, why don&#x27;t I hear about this being used more? Why don&#x27;t I use it? Why was one of my joys in adopting EXWM the ability to use emacs shortcuts INSTEAD of CUA in other progams? Essentially I went the opposite direction.
 Even for those years when I was learning emacs, no part of me ever longed to regain the key bindings that were used everywhere else, and that is strange in retrospect. Was it because learning new keybindings was part of the emacs experience? Or because CUA bindings are already only relevant to Windows users and not Mac keybords? Was it because there is something qualitatively different about killing, yanking, and emacs&#x27; undo style than the copy-paste-undo of everything else? I admit, whenever I am forced into non-emacs programs, I do long for the kill ring.
 What do you think? Why is CUA-Mode so rarely brought up as a first step (and therefore rarely brought up at all)?

                    <span>Hey guys, I&#x27;m new to emacs and scheme. I just installed geiser, the chicken-repl starts up well in emacs (M-x run-chicken or M-x run-geiser RET chicken) and code entered directly in the repl executes properly, but when I try to execute code in from a buffer, I get this error:
 retort-syntax
 Error: unbound variable: geiser#geiser-eval
 https://preview.redd.it/z8s7kq63z3271.png?width&#x3D;745&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;047d35c68a73566daddfc47e531a6920e23d4ce5
 I noticed that the code sent to chicken is this: (geiser#geiser-eval (quote #f) (quote (print &quot;Chicken Test&quot;)) which is like a wrapper around my original code and might be what produces the error, but i&#x27;m not sure if thats the case or how to fix it.
 ​
 Here is my init.el file, I haven&#x27;t installed much except MELPA, geiser and a material theme

 Would really appreciate it if someone could help me out or point me in the right direction... thanks.

                    <span>I had the hard time to teach emacsclient (emacs terminal frame) to change the working directory, to make it possible to open a new terminal tab at the changed directory path.
 Steps:
 * open emacsclient at the home user&#x27;s folder
 * navigate to a new folder using dired and open a random file
 * set a path to the file&#x27;s directory path (not clear how to do this)
 * open a new terminal tab (I use tilix)
 * the new tab should be opened at the directory from step 3 not the home directory from the step 1
 Any suggestions?

                    <span>Hello r/emacs.
 ​
 I have recently set up a neat feature for Emacs that I wanted to share with you. I am going to give you a short description of what this is supposed to be here, but for more details, and the required code snippets you can check my github repository where I also host my dotfiles.
 ​
 So, if you are tiling window manager user, you have probably heard of scratchpads. If you haven&#x27;t, they are floating windows with predefined dimensions which are automatically hidden when they lose focus. Why is this useful you may ask? Well, I personally dislike leaving Emacs, especially when I want to write a large piece of text. But there are some things (mostly when I am doing something on the web, such as creating this reddit post) which I can&#x27;t directly do in Emacs. This project tries to solve this project.
 ​
 I have basically set up my window manager of choice (qtile, but I do plan to try and make this for other window managers such as i3) to create a scratchpad of Emacs which opens in a placeholder file and an emacs command which when ran, copies the whole buffer to the clipboard and then deletes it from the file so it can be used again. This allows me to write everything in Emacs, in a small floating window which is visible whenever I need it and then hides itself when unneeded, using a placeholder file which is always empty and waiting for text to fill it. The setup is honestly very handy and I really like it, as the alternatives are somewhat annoying to use imo. 
 ​
 For more details, check the aforementioned git repo. I hope you will enjoy it. I personally really like the idea and as I couldn&#x27;t find anyone who has done something similar, I thought I should share this here so you guys can see the idea and adopt it if you like. I will gladly answer any of your questions about this and try to persuade you that its got a reasonable use-case.

                    <span>Hey guys,
 I&#x27;m new to Emacs and I&#x27;m a copywriter - I write 3-5k words per day. I&#x27;m thinking about quitting libreoffice writer and switching to a keyboard-centric writing experience. I really like Emacs so far!
 The only concern I have is: Can I do these things with Emacs... And how easy is it to do these things:
 -bold a word or a sentence
 -italics
 -align a paragraph to center
 -export to .docx (most of my clients need that format, not a personal preference)
 ​
 Can emacs help me write text and accomplish these 4 things (just as easily or easier than with L.O. Writer)? 
 ​
 I admit, I&#x27;m a complete novice when it comes to this. When I tried searching online about these features I found some advanced tutorials on something called latex or pandoc or some other advanced programs. I&#x27;m really not a programmer, all I need is these 4 features in order to ditch LibreOffice writer. Can emacs help me with these things?
 Thank you

                    <span>Hi everyone, 
 I built from source today and installed emacs, I also tried to clean my emacs install and re-install it but it doesn&#x27;t fix my issue. I didn&#x27;t have that issue previously when I built from source a month ago. 
 Basically, emacs freezes completely only in some cases. I&#x27;d say that most of my usage does not provoke the freeze but for two cases (that I found). 
  
deft, anytime I open it it completely freezes emacs.
 
stan-mode when I try to edit a file. Opening the file works fine but if I try to edit anything, it freezes and I have to kill emacs.
 
 I tried package-reinstall, to no avail. 
 Other modes like org-mode or any other language I&#x27;m using or could think of, does work (Racket, Java, Python, Julia, SQL), etc. 
 I can&#x27;t seem to get an error anywhere and when emacs freezes I have to kill it. If anyone has an idea I&#x27;d be grateful.

                    <span>Hi, im in a bit of a pickle, one half of me wants to use emacs-mac (great gestures, works well with yabai, better battery life) while the other half wants to use emacs-plus (native comp is fast)
 Is there a way to build emacs-mac with emacs28, and use it with native comp, so I can get the best of both worlds? If not, would anyone know when emacs-mac is going to move to emacs28?

                    <span>I would like to model software APIs in a best-practice-functional-programming manner. I am wondering how professionals typically go about this problem. What are existing best practices, and so forth.
 More specifically, for my current project, I want to model several geometric primitives (e.g., circle, sphere, triangle) such that I can effectively reason about them and use effective type-checking. I will render them with different backends, and will handle that elsewhere (e.g., JavaScript), but I want to be sure I am effectively modeling the geometric types.
 I&#x27;d like to use Haskell.
 The obvious way to go about this would be to begin writing data types in Haskell and potentially use that to generate other code via Template Haskell. Is there a flaw with this approach? I&#x27;ve considered using XML, or using Haskell to generate XML as an intermediate, but I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s necessary or flawed in some way.
 In general, I&#x27;d also like to use whatever approach I develop to model systems in the future. I&#x27;m not sure what the best way of going about it is. I&#x27;m wondering if anyone has any experience with this, or can point me to some references, so that I don&#x27;t begin coding something that is doomed to be suboptimal for reasons known to those who know. Thank you.

 wanted to share with you an article that the compilers team in Imagine.ai wrote about the inner workings of the Imagine compiler and why we chose Haskell for the code generation.
 Hope you like it, if you have questions feel free to reach out.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been trying to see what solutions are out there but couldn&#x27;t really find any that I liked. What I want to do is to use the task management part of org mode remote (internet). There are solutions to sync files and then use different re-implementations of org mode on different devices but I want emacs to be the heart of it and not use re-implementations.
 What I&#x27;m thinking is something where I can send a command to the server where I have emacs and get a response with a subset of commands like :
  
List tasks (agenda)
 Mark task as done (maybe based on uid)
 Add things to inbox (to be processed when I&#x27;m at a computer)
  
I&#x27;m considering something like using email (could be similar to how http://www.gamerz.net/pbmserv/ works) or having an xmpp bot or something similar. Anyone who has done anything similar or seen any projects like this?

                    <span>As a beginner, I am getting comfortable with scala &#x27;s core api. As I expand into application development, there are requirements for making http request, db queries and stuff like that. Now, when I look at libraries providing such functionalities - there are references to cats, monix, zio. Are cats, zio equivalence of each other ? are these required for application development? Or is it for purists only? How should a beginner look expanding understanding of scala ?

 Are there any resources/ or anyone can eli5 ?

                    <span>I&#x27;ve only begun incorporating zettelkasten into my daily life recently, but I&#x27;m a long-time user of spaced repetition and credit it with much of the success I had reaching fluency in Japanese a few years back. At least in my experience thus far, zettelkasten works well alongside the practice of spaced repetition, but I was recently struck by a possibly fruitful way to integrate the core spaced repetition concept into zettelkasten itself.

                    <span>Lately I&#x27;ve found Bloom&#x27;s Taxonomy interesting — Bloom apparently did it to save time in making annual examinations (according to my source, at least) and consequently, it led to a &quot;common language&quot; for education.
When asked what&#x27;s &quot;the most important thing they want students to gain after each class,&quot; teachers will always say that they want students to &quot;really understand&quot; the lecture. But as Krathwohl (2002) put it, this is an ambiguous term; they haven&#x27;t articulated what it means when a student &quot;really understands.&quot;
And without a common definition of how well students understand the material, making exams that test understanding would produce large variability.
How do you even know when students &quot;really understand&quot; something?
So what Bloom&#x27;s Taxonomy did was give a comprehensive set of c…</span>

                    <span>Hi. So, I made this thing awhile back originally in the context of developing a programming language which used a lot of Unicode math symbols (basically forcing variable-width fonts) and significant whitespace. Now I use it for all of my personal note files, and it seems like other people might find it useful so I&#x27;m releasing it.
 https://github.com/tenbillionwords/spaceship-mode
 ​
 spaceship-mode
 What this basically does is:
  
spaceship-mode makes spaces at the start of a line have their width automatically adjusted to align with previous text as they would in a fixed-width font. Example pictured.
 tabble-mode is an implementation of elastic tabstops.
  
Together these make it possible in principle to do every kind of alignment I have ever seen being useful in an actual programming or plaintext-note-taking situation.
 Using spaceship-mode absolutely requires adhering to the convention of using tabs for indentation and spaces for alignment. Unfortunately, that means these modes work very badly with stock Emacs, yet I am not providing any kind of user-interface features such as commands to help use and maintain the indentation conventions, or any keybindings at all. It wouldn&#x27;t do to just quickly slap something together, because Emacs&#x27; assumption of fixed-width fonts is fairly deeply entrenched in its design, and peeps have very different preferences and methods for dealing with indentation in general. (And I&#x27;m not providing my own full setup because...reasons.) So if you want to get this working well, you&#x27;ll have to do some work to integrate it into your own system. The “Example Setup” in the readme may give some indication of how to start doing this.
 P.S. Thanks to the r/emacs folks who originally helped me figure out how to do this!

                    <span>All,
 I&#x27;m now using emacs and mu4e for quite few months and I have one remaining concern which is formatting when replying to emails.
 Let&#x27;s take the following example as my original email:
  
This is the emails chain. This paragraph runs on several lines and is recognized as is on the original email. All of that matches line 1. But when replying to this email, there&#x27;s now (random?) line breaks inserted here and there. 
 empty line #1 
 The next paragraph starts here.
  
​
 When I reply to this email, the cited text will have (random?) line breaks insertion and all empty lines will be doubled (i.e. one additional empty line will be created for each original empty line). So I end up with something like this:
  
My response to you. 
 Best, 
 RedGuilou 
 --citation follows this line (read-only)-- 
 This is the emails chain. This paragraph runs on several lines and is recognized as is on the original email. All of that matches line 1. But when replying to this email, 
 there&#x27;s now (random?) line breaks inserted here and there. 
 empty line #1 
 empty line #2 
 The next paragraph starts here.
  
​
 This does not look very professional when replying to my clients and it&#x27;s boring to correct the formatting on every single email (especially when the emails chain is quite long).
 I&#x27;m using org mode to write my emails in case that matters. Any clues on what to investigate to solve this issue would be greatly appreciated.
 Thanks !

                    <span>Hi, everyone. I&#x27;m curious if anyone has managed to cook up an Org Agenda view which allows for easy viewing and interaction with TODO items and subitems from the agenda view?
 Ex:
 * TODO top-level thing [0/1] ** This is a sub-item / requirement for top-level 
 output Ex:
 ...: [time].... TODO top-level thing [0/1] ...: [time] .... TODO This is a sub-item / ... 
 I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s probably a way to do this sort of thing with org-super-agenda or some fancy org-ql thing but before I run down that trail perhaps someone has a workable partial or full solution?
 Thx!
 Unrelated note: If you haven&#x27;t tried &quot;Edit with Emacs&quot; browser extension you really should. Fantastic!

 if i am running Emacs without a daemon it doesn&#x27;t automatically fill the selected candidate. i have to hit tab or C-l to complete the selected candidate.
 without Emacs daemon
 ​
 generally this isn&#x27;t a problem for me because i always start a daemon but i just want to know what causing this does this have something to do with capf ? or is there anything wrong with my config ?.
 i am fairly new to emacs

                    <span>Hello,
 I need some help.
 I am looking for a better way of working in a node.js / typescript environment. I want to start with creating a dirty repl. This is a huge project and it has a large amount of dependencies, with many many layers.
 One idea I had is to create a REST endpoint within the app on my computer only, that will eval all code sent with the GET request and respond either with {success: result} or {error: message}.
 Now I created a custom keybind, that sends the code that I selected in emacs with a GET request to that endpoint and that works beautifully.
 Here is where I am stuck though, if there was an error (because I am evaluating js code of thisGreatFunction(unsetVariable) {doSomethingWith(usetVarbable)} because unsetVariable and the function doSomethingWith are obviously not defined). This is also where it gets dirty.
 My next thought was to push back on the user in emacs with the error message and let him open a new buffer where he can change the js code sent, ideally also caching the previous responses so he can build a reportoire of code that loads needed sets of dependencies quickly.
 Any ideas on how to make this sort of interactivity happen?

                    <span>Something that I think there should be a shortcut for, but I am not even sure what to google for (at least above question goes towards a visual line, which I am not interested in).
 Assume that I have the following line:
 This is an overview about something 
 Now I&#x27;ve written that line of arbitrary length and want to put a line of dashes below it, like this:
 This is an overview about something ----------------------------------- 
 I obviously can type a lot of minuses/dashes, but that feels wrong. I was thinking about C-u  dash and getting the point, but that also feels like doing it wrong.
 Does anyone have a good hint on how to create a line full of dashes of the same length of the previous line?

My team sits in front office and has about 20 Haskell devs (well, technically Mu, our in-house variant). There are many other Haskell teams at Standard Chartered and you may have seen other hiring announcements recently, but these are distinct positions. Do reach out to me directly if you&#x27;re interested and have any questions, but applications should go via our website: https://scb.taleo.net/careersection/ex/jobdetail.ftl?job&#x3D;2100012204&amp;lang&#x3D;en&amp;HRS_SUBSOURCE_ID&#x3D;1804

                    <span>I&#x27;m a Haskell newbie. I&#x27;ve tried to get into Haskell development several times, since I love the language, but I&#x27;ve always had issues with tooling.
 My preferred editor is VS Code on Windows, and the Haskell extension seems to provide most features I need.
 Unfortunately, I also have a small hard drive (256 GB) which is mostly occupied. When I used Stack or Haskell Platform in the past, the size of my user directory often reached 20-30 GB due to installed versions of compilers and dependencies, which is too much. I&#x27;ve never had this issue with other languages (rustup or npm only ever take a couple GBs on my PC despite heavy usage).
 Since this is probably unavoidable, I need a way to install GHC, Cabal, Haskell Language Server and all other tools in a completely isolated and portable directory, so that I can just delete or move them away from my PC until needed, while leaving global user directories intact.
 The most obvious solution would probably be Docker, but I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s supported on Windows 10 Home.
 Is there a way to configure both Cabal and Haskell Language Server in a completely portable/non-intrusive manner?
 Thanks!

                    <span>Is there a way to get scala source code from a jar? I inherited a job which runs a scala jar, however the source seems to be missing from git. I&#x27;m using Intellij. Would appreciate your help!

                    <span>Does Scala 3 have configurable derivation? By configurable derivation I mean passing configuration for the typeclass derivation in the derives clause, eg:
 case class Person(name: String, age: Int) derives Decoder(_.toLowerCase) 
 In this scenario the hypothetical Decoder typeclass would apply the toLowerCase function to the json fields. Other examples could be cutoff limits, nestness limits, etc.
 Or in other words can the derived method receive arguments that are not using clauses?

                    <span>Hey, good people of Scala! 👋
 I have the following challenge. I would like to open vim from my Scala CLI application... 
 I would like to achieve similar functionality as can be seen when you use git - it opens your editor of choice when committing stuff; allows you to do the editions there and let the user exit vim; then the git picks up and proceeds with its things.
 However, that has proven to be way more tricky than I initially thought. 😅
 How should I approach this; can u please point me in the right direction,... Are there any libs that I could use to handle this; if so which? Can this thing be also &quot;ported&quot; to things like GraalVM if want to package this as native-image at some point?
 A silly example that I&#x27;ve made that uses scala.sys.process; where I thought I should start...
  def editor &#x3D; sys.env.getOrElse(&quot;EDITOR&quot;, &quot;vim&quot;) def spawnEditor(editor: String) &#x3D; { val r &#x3D; Seq(editor, &quot;/tmp/test.md&quot;).!! r } 
 Thanks for your help and have a nice day!

                    <span>Hi everyone.
I began using ZK several months ago and encountered a following conundrum.
I divide notes into two generic classes: core notes and inbox. Inbox consists of notes I might need to work upon in the future.  My inbox keeps growing much faster in volume than my core notes. There&#x27;re three main sources of its growth.
Firstly, I regularly read professional feeds with a wide range of information that I have no time to integrate right now. Mostly this is a specific momentarily info that might be unavailable in the future (or simply hard to find) so saving it seems pretty important to me.
On the one hand, this inbox propagation seems natural to me - I find that diving into that knowledge dump from time to time turns out pretty useful. And the power of weak connections works with notes as much as with people.
Maybe somebody wants to comment on this? Have you been in a similar situation?</span>

                    <span>Hi Zettelkasten friends,
How do you process research that&#x27;s based on shaky assumptions? By &quot;shaky&quot; I mean that in the middle of reading, you figured that the authors were either assuming that a specific concept is true, or are implying that the specific concept applies to their study&#x27;s context.
So for example, a lot of other studies are based on Zeigarnik Effect, but other studies on the same concept have failed to replicate the phenomenon. Or implying that the &quot;need for cognitive closure&quot; applies to the &quot;task&quot; context, even when the cited paper refers to closure in the context of beliefs.
Their results would fit nicely into their assumptions and hypotheses, but the assumptions themselves don&#x27;t hold up based on the other papers.
So if you were in my place, do you think the experiments woul…</span>

                    <span>It looks like Yaml mode isn&#x27;t supported any longer. I saw a mention of an lsp mode.
 Does anyone have any recommendations for working with yaml (I wish the answer could be &quot;don&#x27;t&quot; because I hate it...)?
 Yaml mode is providing some features but it doesn&#x27;t have the syntax highlighting I&#x27;d like, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be indentation aware, which makes reformatting files a pain.
 For example, it&#x27;d be nice if mark-sexp worked to mark by indentation level.

                    <span>Given that I use Lisp often, I want to swap square brackets with parentheses. I tried this with:
 (define-key key-translation-map (kbd &quot;[&quot;) (kbd &quot;(&quot;)) (define-key key-translation-map (kbd &quot;]&quot;) (kbd &quot;)&quot;)) (define-key key-translation-map (kbd &quot;(&quot;) (kbd &quot;[&quot;)) (define-key key-translation-map (kbd &quot;)&quot;) (kbd &quot;]&quot;)) 
 But the swap doesn&#x27;t work in key chords e.g. M-(. How do I translate keys at the lowest level?

                    <span>I had a line using diredfl, to give me the permission line visual I wanted. However, I had to go back to my code and re-evaluate the use-package line every session or else I just had font coloring instead. A character inspection revealed that it was indeed applying diredfl faces, but apparently just the default ones, not the ones I was defining. Here was my not-working-until-reeval line:
 Not working invocation (custom)
 (use-package diredfl :demand t :config (add-hook &#x27;dired-mode-hook &#x27;diredfl-mode) :custom (diredfl-dir-name &#x27;((t (:foreground &quot;#3679D8&quot; :box (:line-width 2 :color &quot;grey75&quot; :style released-button))))) (diredfl-dir-priv &#x27;((t (:foreground &quot;#3679D8&quot; :underline t)))) (diredfl-exec-priv &#x27;((t (:background &quot;#79D836&quot; :foreground &quot;black&quot;)))) (diredfl-read-priv &#x27;((t (:background &quot;#D8B941&quot; :foreground &quot;black&quot;)))) (diredfl-write-priv &#x27;((t (:background &quot;#D83441&quot; :foreground &quot;black&quot;))))) 
 Working invocation (custom-face)
 Notice the only difference is that I&#x27;m using custom-face, which enables removing the quote from the face definitions. So the question is, why does this fix the problem? What is :custom failing to do (timing wise) that :custom-face is managing?
 (use-package diredfl :demand t :config (add-hook &#x27;dired-mode-hook &#x27;diredfl-mode) :custom-face (diredfl-dir-name ((t (:foreground &quot;#3679D8&quot; :box (:line-width 2 :color &quot;grey75&quot; :style released-button))))) (diredfl-dir-priv ((t (:foreground &quot;#3679D8&quot; :underline t)))) (diredfl-exec-priv ((t (:background &quot;#79D836&quot; :foreground &quot;black&quot;)))) (diredfl-read-priv ((t (:background &quot;#D8B941&quot; :foreground &quot;black&quot;)))) (diredfl-write-priv ((t (:background &quot;#D83441&quot; :foreground &quot;black&quot;)))))

                    <span>I&#x27;m working on a game development project using literate programming in org-babel. The problem I&#x27;m having is the following.
 Say I have a table called &quot;sprites&quot; that defines positional indexes into a sprite sheet:
 #+NAME: sprites | Name | Row | Col | |--------+-----------| | Bob | 2 | 3 | | Joe | 5 | 6 | 
 That gets passed into a block of C++ code as a variable and used for rendering. So far so good. But now I want to use that data to show the sprites in the org document itself. I have a macro that takes an integer index and links to the sprite image (presliced from the sprite sheet for simplicity):
 #+MACRO: sprite [[ ./path/to/sprite-$1.png ]] 
 This gets called like:
 {{{sprite(123)}}} 
 Which works fine. But can I make a macro that takes two arguments and multiplies them (row * width + col) together, like so:
 {{{sprite(2,3)}}} 
 ... and links the sprite for Bob? Or am I limited to simple text replacement? If macros aren&#x27;t the right tool for this, what is?
 And one step further, can I somehow just do:
 {{{sprite(Bob)}}} 
 ?

                    <span>Hi, I use xah-fly-keys&#x27;s modal editing package.
 and I have these key bindings over this package:
 &quot;{&quot; &quot;}&quot; &quot;V&quot; &quot;N&quot; &quot;O&quot; &quot;E&quot; &quot;S&quot; &quot;C-s&quot; &quot;C-a&quot; &quot;C-f&quot; &quot;C-y&quot; &quot;C-;&quot; &quot;C-e&quot; &quot;C-r&quot; &quot;C-o&quot; 
 does any of these keybindings conflict with any mode or do they override anything ?I&#x27;m worried because I don&#x27;t know if I should use &#x60;C-xyz&#x60; for my keybindings...Cause some packages like multiple cursor use &#x60;C-&#x27;&#x60;, does that mean I can&#x27;t use &#x60;C-punctuations&#x60; at all?Are we even allowed to use &#x60;C-xyz&#x60; as our keybindings? or &#x60;C-,./()&#x27;{};\&#x60;? or even &#x60;Upper case letters...&#x60;?

                    <span>So, I was using emacs with evil-mode and the qwertz keyboard layout. Stock keybinds, all good. Until now. I learnt the keyboard layout k.o,y and now need to rebind everything. Everything. I took a look at gereral.el, but am sill unsure on how I would go about this rather large operation. Does anyone here have any tips on how I would go on about this?

                    <span>There are numerous libs/hacks for showing the Elisp docstring for the symbol at point, but none really worked for me : if you know of one that really does it then please let me know. Anyway, I had to debug something yesterday and so was using my own solution that I knocked up a few weeks ago in order to learn some Elisp. It&#x27;s a bit &quot;overkill&quot; in that it supports 3 different &quot;display the docstring&quot; front ends, but it defaults to posframe (which works now BTW) and I find it really, really useful. Just enable el-docstring-sap-mode and you&#x27;re away. I even documented it.... I did one years ago, but this is a refresh. it doesnt do anything clever - the &quot;links&quot; in the pop are non operational...
 ​
 Note: you need to clone it, add it to path etc or just use straight.el. I wont rehash how to do all that, GIYF.

                    <span>I have a large Hydra for smartparens navigation/actions, and because I want to restrict the height of the Hydra window to preserve space for the main window, the Hydra hints get cut off at the right edge of the screen. So I created a second Hydra and linked Hydra #1 and Hydra #2 together via designated keys (as explained here). 
 The problem is that I’ve memorized many of the bindings associated with both Hydra #1 and Hydra #2, and I want to use all bindings at any time, regardless of whether Hydra #1 or Hydra #2 is showing. This means I have to add every binding relevant to smartparens to BOTH defhydra definitions. This takes up a lot of space in my init.el, and it’s not as simple as copy-pasting because I don’t want hints that show up in Hydra #1 to show up in Hydra #2 (and vice versa), so I have to change the string hints to nil or change nil to string hints as appropriate. 
 I’ve partially solved this last problem by having Hydra #2 inherit the bindings of Hydra #1 with the following:
 (set-keymap-parent hydra-smartparens2/keymap hydra-smartparens1/keymap) 
 However, I can’t simultaneously have Hydra #1 inherit Hydra #2&#x27;s bindings, as this creates the error cyclic keymap inheritance. Thus, unless I’m missing something (and I hope I am), some copy-pasting from Hydra #2 to Hydra #1 is still necessary.
 It would be great if I could have a single Hydra for smartparens that possessed a height limit and could be scrolled to see the hints that get cut off, like which-key allows. Different displays vary greatly in the horizontal screen real estate they allow. Should I check out hercules.el, or is there an obvious solution I’m missing? 
 P.S. I’m not complaining about Hydra, it is a genius package!

                    <span>My company, Groq, is hiring up to two positions working with Haskell. My team develops an assembler tool for our novel computer architecture. Our chips are completely deterministic, but don&#x27;t have a program counter or support for procedure calls. Our assembler provides these conventional hardware features for our higher-level compiler and API.
 What we&#x27;re looking for:
  
Haskell experience, professional preferred or experienced amateur (we&#x27;re not using anything too fancy, so if unsure, please apply)
 Experience with compilers (parsing, ASTs, object code formats)
 Comfortable with systems-level programming (we deal with lots of bits)
 Skilled at GHC profiling and knowledgeable about Haskell performance
 Experience with code generation
 Excellent debugging skills
 ML or linear algebra experi…</span>

 Writing to announce a new functional UI programming paradigm and implementation for Haskell. Features a declarative programming model, rendering polymorphism, no FRP constructs, single source of truth, and convenient composition of components via lenses.
 She sure is a Shpadoinkle website (written as statically generated Shpadoinkle)
 Full support for
  
single-page applications (routing with Servant!)
 static site generation
 server-side rendering
 time travel debugging (maturing)
 live reloads with GHCID
 growing widgets library with common types for UI baked in. 
  
Actively maintained by Platonic Systems.
 This work was originally motivated by a desire to capture the lessons I have learned from a decade of working with different UI technologies. As well as a desire to have the benefits of The Elm Architecture without compromising on compositionally, or being forced to use a nerfed language (Elm). Shpadoinkle drops through the abstract floor to uncover the simplicity in the substructure of UI programming. While systems like Reflex offer a recursively Monadic structure, and Elm offers merely Functorial structure, Shpadoinkle is not even a Covariant Functor.

                    <span>Hello there,
 Is there anyway I can create a generator in Scalacheck that allows me to get not only distinct values but also the list with the exact size I send generate and not less
 Gen.listOfN allows duplicates, and although Gen.containerOfN[Set, String] allows me to get only distinct values, it can then generate less values that the N I pass to the method.
 I writed this method, but it&#x27;s a little &quot;hack&quot;, since it would be great if this worked with returning a Generator and not the List already
 ​
  def createDistinctList[A](i: Int, gen: Gen[A]): List[A] &#x3D; def createDistinctListAux(i: Int, gen: Gen[A], res: List[A]): List[A] &#x3D; i match case 0 &#x3D;&gt; res case _ &#x3D;&gt; { val generated &#x3D; for { value &lt;- gen } yield value val x &#x3D; generated.sample.get val newI &#x3D; if x &#x3D;&#x3D; None || res.contains(x) then i else i - 1 val newRes &#x3D; if x &#x3D;&#x3D; None || res.contains(x) then res else res :+ x createDistinctListAux(newI, gen, newRes) } createDistinctListAux(i, gen, Nil) 
 I tried with res.contains(generated) and returning a generator of list, but it didn&#x27;t work, it only worked this way.
 Any help is appreciated, thank you.
 (Scala 3 btw)

                    <span>Hello everyone. I&#x27;m coming out of my cave again to write a long post recommending a book: They Say/I Say by Gerald Graff and Cathy Birkenstein. I think it could be useful to many people here, especially those who are unsure about what they should include in a Zettel. It helped me get a better idea of how to structure a single note in a way that&#x27;s useful to me (i.e. for academic research in the humanities and social sciences broadly, and philosophy in particular, with the goal of producing academic papers and other nonfiction writing). But I think it could be useful to anyone reading or writing argumentative non-fiction. At best I think it could help combat a somewhat relativistic tendency I&#x27;ve noticed in online ZK/PKM communities.

                    <span>Every time I run embark-export, Embark gives me an Embark Collect buffer. For instance, if I use consult-ripgrep and then use embark-export on the results so that I can use wgrep, I get an Embark Collect buffer. I can&#x27;t get an Embark Export Grep buffer at all. I&#x27;m using the sample configs for Embark and Embark-Consult on Emacs 27.2 on macOS 11.4 with the latest packages as of 5/26. Any suggestions on how to fix this?

                    <span>I am stumped by some strange behavior in the org mode clock. I use the clock timer (C-x C-i) to time myself when working in different files, and it has always worked a treat. But recently I cleaned up the structure of my org folder, which had lots of subfolders for different clients. I moved all of these folders from /org into a new folder, /org/archive, to give myself a nice clean place to work. Now, however, when I try to start the clock timer, emacs refuses and instead shows me this:
 Use M-x make-directory RET RET to create the directory and its parents [165 times] apply: Setting current directory: No such file or directory, /home/me/org/client-folder/ 
 Where client-folder is the name of a client. I&#x27;m guessing that it&#x27;s trying to check all of my existing files for dangling, unclosed timers, but I don&#x27;t need it to do that. 
 I tried deleting the org-clock-save.el file in my emacs directory, which the program then recreated, but this is empty. 
 What&#x27;s telling emacs to look for files in their old directories, and how can I make it stop, or at least redirect it to the new directory path?

                    <span>I get the feeling many people don&#x27;t like the default binding of C-z to suspend-frame. I certainly don&#x27;t use it, and (put &#x27;suspend-frame &#x27;disabled t) in my configuration. But I feel I&#x27;m wasting a great keybinding by not binding something else there and am looking for inspiration. What do you use C-z for?

                    <span>Hi,
 If I do C-x right or C-x b I can switch the buffer shown in the current window. I have a layout where one frame can have some windows with some buffer. I want to separate all the buffers started in the current frame from other frames so I cant open a buffer from hobby project in a frame I am working on my emacs files. So it should not be possible to switch to a buffer started in another frame.
 Also like *Messages* shouldnt be possible to switch to. Maybe theese should be in a separate frame to separate them from others. Then I could still access them if I wanted to.
 My idea is that I want to have a frame for each project that I am working and it should only be possible to switch to the relevant buffers.
 If anything is unclear, please ask me :)
 Thank you

                    <span>I like to have imenu-list open while I am programming in Python to have an outline of my file and a list of functions/classes that I can quickly access (side question: are there better packages for this functionality?).
 However, when I open that list then switch the buffer to a different non-python file that I don&#x27;t need such a list for, I have to manually close that window only to open it back when I switch back to my Python buffer. 
 I am wondering if there&#x27;s a way to designate a particular window as a &quot;child&quot; of the buffer. So that everytime I switch to that buffer the window is automatically created and then destroyed when I switch away from the &quot;parent&quot; buffer. 
 I could probably code it myself by advising set-buffer, splitting the window if the buffer is a python-buffer and closing it if the old buffer is a python one. But I am wondering if there are better solutions out there.

                    <span>Hi All
 Long time lurker and first-time (I think?) poster. Anyways, I implemented the Lamport one-time signature scheme a while back in Haskell and wanted to share.
 https://github.com/difelicemichael/lamport-haskell
 It also includes a module solely for the purposes of illustrating the dangers of key-reuse in this signature scheme.
 ​
 As with anything cryptography related, it&#x27;s always best not to reinvent the wheel, so it goes without saying that the module is not production-ready / suitable. Still though, couldn&#x27;t resist the urge to share, comments / criticisms are welcome (and encouraged!).

                    <span>The idea of a book that goes from zero to a working product is very intriguing to me. Building a CI also seems like a domain where I wouldn&#x27;t mind a bit more insight.
 I will almost definitely read it, unless someone says it is filled with bad practice and bad advice.

                    <span>HI All
 I have been using Emacs for Org Mode on an old mac from some time now. I have bought a Macbook pro and have installed Emacs.
 I have a Dropbox account where I have placed my .emacs.d folder and its contents in, including the init.el and the *.org files I use for the GTD system.
 On the Macbook, I have entered the following code in the init.el file so that my settings and files will be usable on the macbook and the experience will be the same as on my Mac desktop.
 I have setup the following code in the init.el file on my latop
 (setq user-init-file &quot;~/Dropbox/.emacs.d/&quot;)
 However when loading emcacs it just loads vanilla emacs.
 Also, when i use Dired to navigate to the dropbox location where i have some .org files located, if I try open a file it fails stating:
 &quot;File exists, but cannot be read&quot;
 ​
 Any guidance appreciated.

                    <span>I&#x27;m looking for a library that allows me to write effects in a similar way I do it with Monix or ZIO, but I can&#x27;t seem to find one.
 I&#x27;ve found something similar to the IO monad in RxJava, with the Single data type, but once I name RxJava, people assume I&#x27;m looking for a streams library and start suggesting stuff I&#x27;m not looking for.
 I&#x27;m looking for a library that allows me to build effects easily. From futures, completion stages, callbacks, etc. Also I&#x27;m looking if it has operators to zip effects in parallel or ideally, a fiber based concurrency model.
 I&#x27;m not looking for a streams library, not looking for libraries for distributed computing.
