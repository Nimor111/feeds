                    <span>When responding to an email, flyspell or works as expected to indicate spelling mistakes with the squiggly underline. This is the case in responding to text messages in mu4e-compose or to html messages in org-msg. However, when I compose a new email in either text or html (with mu4e-compose org-msg) I am unable to get the squiggly lines marking mistakes, even though flyspell and my dictionary appear to be enabled. I am using mu4e in doom emacs. 
 Any assistance in fixing my setup to make this work properly would be greatly appreciated.

                    <span>Hello everyone!
 One more theme related quesition :)
 I am using custom theme (monotropic) and want to change color variable, say fg-light &quot;#808080&quot; to fg-light &quot;#333&quot;. 
 I assumed it will be easy, but seems like it&#x27;s not the case. When googling i found 2 methods:
  
patching old theme file https://stackoverflow.com/a/12886580
 
using custom-set-faces on the theme and saving them to init file (comment to the above link answer)
 
 Both seem not clean / tidy. I would like smng like color-theme-install-frame-params here https://superuser.com/a/482031, but it&#x27;s custon function only for color theme.
 Is there a good way to do it?

                    <span>I have an issue with full screen settings after startup. I have in my init.el settings:
 (add-to-list &#x27;default-frame-alist &#x27;(fullscreen . maximized)) 
 Also tried also from emacsclient with -c -F &quot;&#x27;(fullscreen . maximized)&quot; flags but also won&#x27;t affect.
 My emacs version: GNU Emacs 29.0.50 (build 1, x86_64-pc-linux-gnu, GTK+ Version 3.24.31, cairo version 1.16.0) of 2022-01-01 and I use Emacs on KDE.
 I found workaround included in Plasma Desktop which enforce on app to run in full screen but it causes another problem.
 Does anyone faced this problem and found solution?

                    <span>I use EXWM, so this is a rather disrupting event. It&#x27;s been happening to me at random times over the past few weeks. I&#x27;m not sure how to debug this, but I would like to find out.

                    <span>Hi,
 Recently, I came up of an idea that we can practice natural language (for me, it&#x27;s English) speaking using subtitle files, as they already have timestamps along with subtitle texts, so that we can loop over specific parts of a video file easily by taking advantage of those timestamps, instead of setting the start time and end time of the playback manually and then looping over it.
 And then I thought of a package, subed, which jumped into my eyes when I was wandering around Sacha Chua&#x27;s blog (kudos to @sachac). And I found it was perfect for this idea after playing with it for ~10 minutes.
 Here are the steps: 1. Open a subtitle file, say foo.srt, subed will automatically open the accompany video file having the name foo.mp4/foo.mk4/foo.avi etc using mpv. 2. Then in the subtitle buffer, only these three key bindings will do the job: 1. C-c C-l toggles looping over the current subtitle By default, there is an extra second before and after the time span, as specified in the config subed-loop-seconds-before &amp; subed-loop-seconds-after. 2. M-n moves the point to the next subtitle, and it automatically seek the playback to the corresponding timeline. 3. M-p moves the point to the previous subtitle and seek the playback to the right position of the timeline.
 Although the package is designed to be used to edit subtitles efficiently, it could also shine in language speaking/shadowing.
 If you&#x27;re also learning foreign languages, I believe this workflow can help you.✌

                    <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;m using emacs daily and mostly. Only thing left is emails and my carddav/caldav data which is hosted on a self hosted nextcloud instance. I setup emails and it worked perfectly but without carddav data it&#x27;s useless for me. I need to see/add contact data from emails. In addition to that I tried to sync my caldav data but it wasn&#x27;t good enough to keep my workflow. I tried org-caldav btw. Anyone have good experience on these before? 
 Thanks

                    <span>Dear Community,
 I&#x27;m trying to get a compacted view of the java classes in my project, something similar to the screenshot in the lsp-java Git repo (or the package explorer in Eclipse), instead of having a tree list with a hierarchy with all the folders. Ideally I would like to see whether a Java class has errors or not in that tree view. Do you know how?
 thanks!

                    <span>After reading Lar&#x27;s blog post on Emacs an Emojis: https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/2021/10/28/emacs-emojis-a-%e2%9d%a4%ef%b8%8f-story/
 I was hoping that Emacs would finally support coloured emojis on Windows. However, when I compile Emacs myself off of master (29.0.5), with cairo installed using ming/pacman, and the --with-cairo flag set the ./configure output still shows that Emacs can&#x27;t detect cairo (or can&#x27;t use it in Windows). I&#x27;m curious if anyone else has figured out how to get Emacs to render color emojis on Windows or if that&#x27;s something that&#x27;s not supported yet?
 Maybe I&#x27;ll be blessed an /u/eli-zaretskii can weight in.

                    <span>Is it possible to display images in the margins of an org mode file without modifying the text? I have tried adding text properties and using insert-image, but they modify the text height to the point where the marginal images might as well be inline, as I can&#x27;t see both the text and the image.
 My use case is essentially that I&#x27;d like to have &quot;concept art&quot; in the margins of an org-mode note for creative writing, similar to how a lot of webpages are designed.

 Is there a way to always search for files in the same folder so I don´t have to go to the images folder before I can link the file?
 In other words, start in the preferred folder as I run the function.

                    <span>Hi guys. I&#x27;m putting together a curated index of high quality source code at goodsourcecode.org. The goal is to create a really nice collection of exemplary source code, searchable by language and concept tags, that developers can use to understand how different ideas are implemented in practice, and how those implementations interact with other components.
 If anyone has any examples of good Haskell source code, please share!
 The more detail the better. What makes the suggested source code good? This will inform what tags are used for indexing.

 Our team is fully remote with some people close to our London office in the City working from there on occasion. The choice is yours.
 We are looking for Haskell Engineers to join us!
 You will work as part of the team developing our core platform called Brossa. We have built a cool DSL to rapidly and robustly model insurance contracts and a platform around it that enables capturing and processing risks in a highly automated fashion. Once an insurance product is defined in our DSL and this definition is uploaded to our platform it can receive risks via our API. …</span>

                    <span>I would like to capture have a capture for a future meeting. I need two time-stamps for my ideal work-flow. 
 (1) A time-stamp in the headline or as part of a date-tree so that I can review my meetings (and the notes I took during the meeting) in chronological order. Really the big reason for this time-stamp is so that, when I am searching for meetings using consult-org-agenda I can distringuish multiple meetings all with headline &quot;meeting with person X&quot;. 
 (2) I also need an active time-stamp so the meeting show ups in my agenda on the correct day. 
 These timestamps should be identical and should be set by prompting for a date during capture. 
 ​
 I would very much appreciate ideas on how to do this. I have seen the :time-promp option in the org-manual but not sure how to syncronize that with an active time-stamp (e.g., how to not be prompted for the date twice). Alternatively, if anyone has a better workflow or better idea I am very open to that as well. 
 Thank you!

                    <span>Someone have any idea about how to &quot;pretty-print&quot; org files content in terminal?. Something like &#x60;cat command &#x60; but that supports orgmode structure.

                    <span>Hi there...what kind of knowledge of scala is required for mid level dev jobs in Europe/UK. I&#x27;ve been in my current role for just over 2 years (3 years total IT industry). Have experience creating endpoints using Akka/Doobie/Cats(IO) with multiple sql calls and manipulating the data accordingly for a UI, but wouldn&#x27;t be very confident if I was asked to build an API from scratch. Are there particular areas I should skill up on... don&#x27;t want to be an embarrassment in an interview. Thanks

                    <span>After bouncing around, testing different tools and software in my Zettelkasten workflow, I have finally settled on the combination of The Archive and Obsidian.
The simplicity of The Archive really helps in my writing and making connections within my Zettelkasten. But sometimes I want a visual of my Zettelkasten and some added functionality to interact with my notes. This is where Obsidian comes in. Not to mention the mobile app as well on iOS makes entering things quickly, on the go, a breeze.
Does anyone else use these two brilliant applications in their workflow? Do you have any tips or tricks in using them together?</span>

                    <span>I&#x27;m trying to create a function to get the candidates of ivy completion like ivy-occurs but with only the candidates, not the occurs stuff (links, actions, etc ...)
 I tried the following:
 (defun qwarctick/ivy-to-buffer () &quot;Stop completion and put the current candidates into a new buffer.&quot; (interactive) (if (not (window-minibuffer-p)) (user-error &quot;No completion session is active&quot;) (let (($buff_tmp &quot;ivy-tmp-BUFFER&quot;) (cands ivy--old-cands)) (with-current-buffer $buff_tmp (unless cands (let ((coll (ivy-state-collection ivy-last))) (when (arrayp coll) (setq coll (all-completions &quot;&quot; coll (ivy-state-predicate ivy-last)))) (setq cands (ivy--filter (ivy-state-text ivy-last) coll)))) (insert (format &quot;%s&quot; cands)) (message &quot;%s&quot; coll) (ivy-exit-with-action ()))))) 
 The problem with this function is that it displays the candidates from a previous call of ivy. I don&#x27;t know how to find the current candidates

I am using sclang (programming language) and I would like to show all commands and key binds of these in a new buffer so I can include it in a document writing about this specific mode and Emacs.

                    <span>Hello everyone
 I am using monotropic theme and it makes modeline invisible (white) for non active buffers, i like it but would like to make small adjustment - to make modified element visible.
 I can easily do that for buffer id
 (custom-theme-set-faces
 &#x27;monotropic
 &#x27;(mode-line-buffer-id ((t (:foreground &quot;#111111&quot;))))
 )
 But it does not work for mode-line-modified, seems like cause it&#x27;s not the face...
 I also learnt that i can specifically set color only for non active buffer situation, with :distant-foreground, but my problem is how to &quot;select&quot; modified element... Do i need to define it somehow to be able to select it?

                    <span>Hi everyone,
 I find myself writing more C/C++ with Emacs, the experience is good overall but it&#x27;s a bit of a pain to write the documentation by hand, I&#x27;m wondering how everyone else is doing it?
 Is there a way to autogen doxygen doc for C/C++? At least templates with the parameters types and return type? I do this with tide in Emacs with Typescript for example and it&#x27;s pretty useful. 
 Thanks.

 I just installed Emacs under Windows and I&#x27;m running the gui version via WSLg. Unlike most other apps, Emacs is not picking up my theme (set in various GTK config files, via lxappearance and gnome-tweaks). Any easy way to change the window title border?

                    <span>Hi,
 I am trying to generate a log of how the day was spent chronologically.
 Even with :step day or :block today, clocktable report give me an aggregate of time spent per task - but if I spend 1h on task A, then 20 min on task B, and then went back on task A, I can&#x27;t find a way to generate a report that will basically reflect the order of the day.
 Any idea or suggestion which direction I could take for this?
 thanks!

                    <span>I&#x27;m looking for language as close to type theory as possible, but that also easily targets browser, and has proper advanced feature support (webrtc, indexeddb) in libs, so that i can skip straight to app logic.
 I like Agda, but i&#x27;m not ready to wrap all browser features myself yet. Haskell or Idris don&#x27;t seem to have easy to start web-app ecosystem, either. I was told that Elm doesn&#x27;t have anything (?) for that beyond accessing js API, which i&#x27;m trying to avoid. As js-first and fairly mature language, i wonder if PureScript is a good choice?
 PS: i have basic js knowledge, but have a strong distaste for it and lack substantial for-browser coding. I tried PureScript a while ago, but didn&#x27;t go beyond toying around, so i know i&#x27;m fine with the language, the question is only about environment/libs

                    <span>I am very happy to announce PureConf - the first conference focused on the theory and practice of building web applications with PureScript, our favourite programming language!
 The conference is being organised in collaboration with Juspay and HasGeek, and will feature a full day of great talks by invited speakers! It will be held entirely online, and all the talks will (eventually) be made available for free access.
 The schedule is still being put together, and we&#x27;ll release more details in the coming weeks. Please follow the PureConf conference page for updates.
 The conference is very modestly priced at 99 INR, or about 1.3 USD. While we have to charge a ticket price for various reasons, we have kept the ticket price very low to keep it accessible for everyone.
 Please feel free to contact me [ajnsit at google&#x27;s email service] for any questions / feedback!
 See you all there!

                    <span>So I see that Lightbend is investing heavily in Akka (and Akka Serverless). I also noticed the hype around Akka for .Net. However, my experience with Akka has been one of a somewhat struggle and I am curious to know if things have changed in the last few years.
 My (only) attempt with Akka was 3-4 years ago when I wrote a web-service based on it. I remember how some things that would have been trivial if carried out with Future/Cats-effect/ZIO required quite a lot of coding in Akka. Two examples that I can think of:
 Concurrent requests:
 Some requests to the service required gathering information from several different actors asynchronously before returning a response. This required me to follow the &quot;Aggregator Pattern&quot;: Sending the requests to the relevant actors and then changing context to accumulate (and keep track of) the responses . If I wanted to add an optional timeout I also had to set a timer with a Timeout message and cancel it once all responses arrived. It felt to me like this could have been more easily carried out with a Future.sequence(...) (if timeout is not necessary) or with parTraverse(...)/foreachPar(...) (Cats-effect/ZIO) with an optional .timeout(...) setting.
 Asynchronous execution:
 I many cases I found out that some synchronous tasks took longer than I initially thought, hurting my actor&#x27;s responsiveness. However - if I decided to make those tasks asynchronous I had to write a new actor specifically for them. Compare this with wrapping a synchronous piece of code with a Future/IO/ZIO and it seems like a lot of boiler-plate for a relatively-simple refactor.
 What&#x27;s common to both of those cases is the sense that I had to personally take care of behaviors that could/should have been abstracted away for me... 
 I was wondering if programming in Akka still feels so low-level...

                    <span>Effect systems like Polysemy provide the programmer with a flexible way to keep the business logic of a program as
flexible as possible by separating the definition of effects and their interpretation.
This is useful for many reasons, but especially for testing and mocking.
For example, instead of using an interpreter that runs a task over the network, one can swap it for an in-memory
implementation when running tests. This allows to test features in isolation.
To achieve this goal, effects should clearly convey functionality without exposing their implementation.
In many cases, this means exposing interpreters involving low-level constructs, such as IO, StateT or exceptions, only at the
outermost levels of the application.
However, for some kinds of effects, it can be hard to design an ex…</span>

                    <span>There are so many topics already on Zettel IDs that it&#x27;s difficult to know where to post further comment, but since my suggestion is quite simple I thought it best to start a new thread.
It started like this: The timestamp format 202201041342 is hard-wired into The Archive. I find 220104-1342 to be easier to grasp (as well as shorter). There are probably almost as many preferences for how to format an ID as there are users. It seems to me that a default ID option field,  perhaps using date tokens, would fit quite naturally into Advanced Prefs, and could make a lot of users happy.</span>

                    <span>EDIT: After disabling the ligatures module in my doom emacs config altogether, turns out everything runs smooth again. While the auto-composition-mode is no longer guilty, my problem is still that ligatures have a very bad performance. I guess ligatures having bad performance in emacs are known, because they&#x27;re mentioned in the doom FAQ.
 I recently installed emacs (doom) on a new manjaro installation and since I started using it I&#x27;ve been noticing that moving on a buffer and inserting text feels very laggy, and after a couple of minutes that becomes increasingly noticeable to the point where it&#x27;s really hard to type, taking up to a couple of seconds to see the input being written on the screen.
 So I decided to investigate further into this, and tried disabling minor modes one by one, until I noticed the problem went away when I disabled the auto-composition-mode. I repeated the experiment disabling only that mode, just to be sure it wasn&#x27;t because of some other mode that I failed to notice.
 I was wondering if there&#x27;s something I could do about the performance of this mode. I know I could just disable it globally, but I would like to keep it enabled so the ligatures don&#x27;t go away. I am using Fira Code.
 I&#x27;m using Emacs 29.0.5 (installed through the package emacs-git on AUR), with Harfbuzz.
 All help is very appreciated. Let me know if you need any more info.

                    <span>TLDR: it seems that there is no simple way how to check for changes not staged for commit and untracked files with Magit with use of elisp command (outside of the Magit GUI).
 Hi,
 I&#x27;ve made this simple function to commit and push all changes within some particular git repository from emacs, but there is a problem in case I run it twice (or when there is nothing to commit), because then there is nothing to commit, git-commit returns 1 which is treated as an error. It&#x27;s not really an issue, but if that happens, I don&#x27;t know if some real error happened or if it&#x27;s just this.
 So I am wondering if somebody knows of any way how I could check if there are any changes to commit (whether there is any way of asking magit if there are any changes in git repository), so that I could run the commands only when there are some changes to commit.
 Code:
 (defun gitsync() &quot;synces git repository&quot; (interactive) (message &quot;Synchronizing git repository...&quot;) (let ((default-directory &quot;/path/to/git/repo/&quot;)) (magit-call-git &quot;add&quot; &quot;-A&quot; &quot;.&quot;) (magit-call-git &quot;commit&quot; &quot;-a&quot; &quot;-m&quot; &quot;\&quot;commit msg\&quot;&quot;) (magit-call-git &quot;push&quot;)) (message &quot;Synchronizing git repository... done&quot;)) 
 Edit: clarification

                    <span>I am curious about how to install python packages from inside emacs while in an active pyvenv virtual environment. I have tried to activate the virtual environment from command line with the activate binary in the /bin dir of the venv, and then reload the pyvenv environment in emacs, but then auto complete does not seem to find the new installed packaged.

 I run it, type something, it passes that to the command and then displays the results. Now, I&#x27;d like to take those results and further refine them with regular old helm completing-read. Is that something that&#x27;s supported natively?

 (map! :leader (:prefix-map (&quot;n&quot; . &quot;notes&quot;) (:prefix-map (&quot;r&quot; . &quot;roam&quot;) :desc &quot;Insert immediately&quot; &quot;m&quot; #&#x27;my/org-roam-node-insert-immediate)))

                    <span>package-quickstart is a newer feature for use-package (a few years old I think)
 Based on this old reddit post it concatenates all your use-packages into a single file so that they can load faster. 
 But I haven&#x27;t seen much info on how to integrate them, or how they work together.
 This here is what I&#x27;ve done, as you can see, but I&#x27;m a newb and I&#x27;m not sure if this is correct, but it seems to work for me, so I&#x27;m just looking for some confirmation, or correction.

                    <span>Years ago, before my cake day on reddit, I was writing my Ph.D. thesis using LaTeX and Emacs as editor. One of my most common writing mistakes was to repetitively use words (say, word x appearing more than once in a 100 word radius, where it can be avoided). Looking for automated detection tools, I noticed a lack thereof, so I wrote my own (teaching myself elisp in the process). Just stumbled upon it today again and thought it might be of interest in r/emacs. https://github.com/ioah86/repetition_error_finder
 There are likely some bugs, but I hope people will find it useful as I did back then. Have fun 😀

 Have you tried browsing web using a keyboard? If you haven&#x27;t yet, I suggest you give it a try. This idea is implemented as a plugin for all the major browsers. For Emacs, you can use emacs-webkit.

 myLength [] &#x3D; 0 myLength (x:xs) | xs &#x3D;&#x3D; [] &#x3D; 1 | otherwise &#x3D; 1 + myLength xs 
 which offers this as the type definition when I ask it with :t
 myLength :: (Num p, Eq a) &#x3D;&gt; [a] -&gt; p 
 Adding to the code works. But then my own guess at writing my own definition didn&#x27;t work, namely,
 myLength :: [a] -&gt; Int 
 saying
 No instance for (Eq a) arising from a use of ‘&#x3D;&#x3D;’ Possible fix: add (Eq a) to the context of the type signature for: myLength :: forall a. [a] -&gt; Int 
 But if I change my code to
 myLength [] &#x3D; 0 myLength (x:xs) | null xs &#x3D; 1 | otherwise &#x3D; 1 + myLength xs 
 myLength :: [a] -&gt; Int seems to work. What under the hood is going on here? null has the type definition null :: Foldable t &#x3D;&gt; t a -&gt; Bool How does that change the situation, making my supposedly wrong definition right?

                    <span>I&#x27;m making a game engine right now, and something I&#x27;m considering is a scripting system which is relatively isolated from the rest of the game. I was considering creating something like a sandboxed form of IO, but the fact that unsafePerformIO exists the level of isolation I want is not really feasible. I&#x27;d definitely appreciate if I could, say, dynamically compile and link these scripts for maximum performance, and have the scripting language just be Haskell. A core principal of this engine is that you may have multiple instances of a game being managed by the same process (for example, a server and client being run simultaneously, multiple servers, some of which might have different scripts, etc). A script could contain anything from a map file to a custom game mode, to say, admin commands, and I want these to have as much isolation from raw IO as I can.

                    <span>I haven&#x27;t seen this mentioned here yet. I&#x27;m not affiliated with the project in anyway, but I find it interesting. I discovered it recently when looking to see what verification tools exist these days for Haskell. I haven&#x27;t had an excuse to use it yet.
 The tool itself can be found here: https://github.com/agda/agda2hs
 This paper appears to introduce the tool: http://resolver.tudelft.nl/uuid:989e34ff-c81f-43ba-a851-59dca559ab90
 And there&#x27;s another 4 papers that go through verification tasks for some Haskell libraries. I see sequence, inductive Graphs, range-sets, and quadtrees. They all seem to be here: https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/search/agda2hs
 It looks like you program in a subset of Agda that corresponds to a subset of Haskell 2010. You can write proofs on the Agda side. A…</span>

                    <span>I was wondering whether it would be better to use a hand written recursive descent parser or write my own parser combinator library. What are the pros and cons of each?
 Thanks!

                    <span>Searching the internet for implementing Haskell in Android Studio, I found some GitHub projects (Frege, Froid) and some apps that look like they could run on previous versions of Android.
 Is there any update or relevant ways to use Haskell in android (currently compatible with Android Studio) or just a way to compile scripts and than use them with Java ?

 Could someone hint on how I can turn ORG into SXML? For example,
 to turn the following org
 * defy :LOGBOOK: :TIME: 2021-01-15 :SENTENCE: They’ll need a lot of teamwork, a little.. :END: abc def * gaggle :DATA: :TIME: 2021-01-16 :SENTENCE: Launched in 2009, Homestuck is a serial.. :END: 123 
 into SXML:
 (&quot;defy&quot; (@ (data (time &quot;2021-01-15&quot;) (sentence &quot;They&#x27;ll need a lot of teamwork, a little..&quot;))) (content (paragraph &quot;abc&quot;) (paragraph &quot;def&quot;))) (&quot;gaggle&quot; (@ (data (time &quot;2021-01-16&quot;) (sentence &quot;Launched in 2009, Homestuck is a serial..&quot;))) (content (paragraph &quot;123&quot;)))

                    <span>I&#x27;m trying to use emacs as a pdf viewer, but I found that some comments online that allege it supports embedded code execution like Adobe does which is a vector for security vulnerabilities. Can this be disabled in emacs or can pdfs be viewed in a sandbox mode as browsers do to protect against these issues?

                    <span>Hi,
 The other day I merged an extension to integrate dtache with consult. The dtache is the package for detachable shell commands. The functionality is opt in, and provided through the dtache-consult.el. 
 This allows users of consult to conveniently narrow the list of dtache sessions. For an overview of the functionality see https://niklaseklund.gitlab.io/blog/posts/dtache_consult/
 Credit should also be given to minad who provided feedback on the implementation.

I think I want to make a minor mode and customize individual contact blocks with defface the issue is though the documentation for it (and all Emacs stuff for that matter) is just a huge block of text and my brain simply doesn&#x27;t learn that way. Is there other resources for this that are formatted in a different way?

                    <span>I&#x27;d like to log ideas as they occur with a date | time | text..... where the text can span multiple lines. The key need is to be able to view this log by Date or Week or Month or Year, so it would eventually become some kind of notes database. I think org-mode may help but I&#x27;m a complete beginner and am unsure where to start. A great bonus would be to have a global shortcut that prompts for the text which would work at the OS level (I&#x27;m using Windows). Any tips on where to begin? Thanks!

 Is it possible to use the space bar as the meta key, e.g. space by itself inserts a space, but space-x behaves the same as M-x ?
 If so, can the configuration be portable between the two OS&#x27; ?

                    <span>Hello, The more I play the guitar again, and the more I recognise about Emacs, org-mode and roam, and the more ideas I get.... Along with the more questions ... Jens Larsen is a very popular jazz guitarist, and pedagogue, he has recorded hundreds of videos available on his website and on Youtube, all with the material to learn or perfect your jazz art on the guitar. My idea would be to retrieve the names of the videos with the links (this should be possible by fiddling with the developer mode of Firefox on the page where he sums up the videos he already shared). Then I would ‏‏‎ like to create one note per title: - the name of the video becomes the file name - the note only contains a property #+Link: with link. Given that there are more than 800 videos, I would like to automate the process, but I do not know how to proceed. Could you please show me the way, and tell me how to create a script/macro in order to do it? I have started taking notes about my newly starting journey with the jazz guitar in org-roam, and I would like to be able to link my notes to the videos, and to search with deft. Any improvement /suggestions on the workflow is welcome! Thanks in advance for your help

                    <span>Phrasing a descriptive title was hard.
 I use ChkTeX as a flymake backend for checking my (La)TeX documents. ChkTeX is good, but sometimes gets things wrong (or makes suggestions which are not appropriate). Recognising this, it also reads a config file, and recognises certain magic comments, which can ignore warnings, or define new warning rules (it&#x27;s a really amazing tool, check it out if you write TeX!).
 I recently had to write quite a few such magic comments, all in the same format, for ignoring different warnings (the comments are all very similar, just with a different diagnostic number in each). This quickly got boring, and this kind of programmatic text manipulation is exactly what emacs is good for. So I was about to write a set of functions like chktex-ignore-warning-at-pt and chktex-ignore-warning-at-pt-global (for writing to the config file).
 But then I thought that I can&#x27;t be the first person to want to do this, and stuff like this (interacting with error information in configurable ways) surely can&#x27;t be restricted to TeX. I thought there might something like a flymake-ignore-error-function variable, which I could set to my function, and there would be lots of flymake infrastructure for this -- but there isn&#x27;t. Is there any such infrastructure already in emacs for interacting with errors in this way (ignoring, ignoring globally, finding docs etc. Of course, the specifics would have to be implemented in each specific backend)? I&#x27;m asking mostly because -- though it would be easy for me to just write my own functions and forget about it -- it seems like a useful general capability and if it doesn&#x27;t exist yet, maybe it should? Would appreciate any thoughts.
 TIA.

                    <span>Setting org-catch-invisible-edits to non-nil works fine if you are pressing backspace to delete, aka you&#x27;re at the end of the invisible region. But if you are at the beginning of the invisible region - just before the ellipsis - then it happily deletes the invisible text.
 Also when you delete all newlines after the header, so the following text should be added to the header, it does get added to the header... but as a new invisible region. That ellipsis can&#x27;t be expanded with  for some reason.
 Adding new characters from the start of the invisible region is correctly prevented.
 I tried searching emacs&#x27; issue tracker but it either gives me unhelpful errors or just doesn&#x27;t do anything so I&#x27;m trying here instead.
 (emacs 27.2)
 edit: found a bug report from google. not sure if it&#x27;s being handled: https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-orgmode/2019-05/msg00133.html

 I am new to Haskell and I need to install QuickCheck, but when I do I get the following error.

 I reinstalled Haskell the way my professor told me to and my Package List is up to date. Can anyone help me fix this?
 Thanks in advance :)

                    <span>After reading https://graphitemaster.github.io/aau/ I&#x27;m feeling that using signed integers in Haskell makes even less sense than in imperative languages, but unsigned integers (Words) are almost never used. It feels strange for correctness oriented language. I&#x27;ve looked at functions in Data.List and 4 out of 5 functions taking integer parameters (replicate, take, drop, splitAt) are actually doing n&#x27; &#x3D; max n 0 with their argument, and only one ((!!)) throws an error with negative argument. In Data.Vector a ton of functions is taking integer parameters, and I&#x27;ve checked only the analogs of functions from Data.List and they behave the same (indexing throws, while other functions have this &quot;wrap to 0&quot; behavior for negative values).
 Isn&#x27;t it sweeping problems under the rug? Does this convention have other reason than historical one?
 On the related issue: what is the underflow and overflow semantics in (GHC) Haskell?

 I tried setting (add-hook &#x27;text-mode-hook &#x27;turn-on-visual-line-mode). That doesn&#x27;t work in ElDoc :D

                    <span>Starting &amp; stopping the profiler shows what functions ran &amp; sorts them by cpu/mem.
 Is it possible to show the elisp code/functions in the sequence that they are run in a separate buffer? And is it possible to do this in real-time?

                    <span>Does anyone know why (format-time-string &quot;%G&quot;) returns &quot;2021&quot; as output when it should return &quot;2022&quot;. 
 My system shows the correct date everywhere and even org-time-stamp points to the correct date. I wonder if it&#x27;s a bug in Emacs or something is messed up in my system.

                    <span>I noticed that Emacs sometimes creates files named something like #filename# in the same directory as the file I am editing. What are those and is it possible to disable their creation? I already have (setq create-lockfiles nil) in my config (and lock files are supposed to start with .# so I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s what they are).

                    <span>I&#x27;m using Emacs 27, and I&#x27;m using packages to load packages and customize to configure. How do I set up init.el so that Emacs will load a theme that is needed first, but then configure properly afterward?
 My example: Starting from scratch, I want to load monokai-theme from melpa and set it:
 (require &#x27;package) (add-to-list &#x27;package-archives &#x27;(&quot;melpa&quot; . &quot;https://melpa.org/packages/&quot;) t) (custom-set-variables &#x27;(custom-enabled-themes &#x27;(monokai)) &#x27;(custom-safe-themes &#x27;(&quot;d9646b131c4aa37f01f909fbdd5a9099389518eb68f25277ed19ba99adeb7279&quot; default)) &#x27;(package-selected-packages &#x27;(monokai-theme))) (custom-set-faces ) 
 If monokai-theme is already downloaded, this works fine. But I want to have emacs download the package automatically if not already present. I use the following block:
 (when (not package-archive-contents) (package-refresh-contents) (package-install-selected-packages) ) 
 If I add this below the customize variables, it installs monokai-theme but doesn&#x27;t load it. I need to restart emacs. If I add this above the customize variables, it doesn&#x27;t work because package-selected-packages is not loaded yet.
 There&#x27;s a catch-22 here since each piece needs the other to run first.
 I want to see if I can configure most things in customize, but maybe customize is not right for this job? Should I be using customize at all?

                    <span>Is there a mode to edit ics files in Emacs? I know I can open them as text files and edit them, but I am looking for a more convenient way that respects the structure and standard of an ics file and make inputting dates and times more human friendly.
 Perhaps in some form that resembles Google&#x27;s event editor.

                    <span>When I use counsel-rg, I get results back that reflect searching files on my filesystem that do not reflect changes made to open buffers. So if I search for something, I&#x27;ll get results back that might be in the wrong position, or referring to lines I may have deleted, etc. 
 Is there any way I can customize any project-wide swiper search like counsel-rg to search all files in a project, but prioritize open buffers over persistent files? Preferably without using projectile.

                    <span>I would like to temporarily insert the expanded snippet template in place because it would be easier for me to choose the snippet I want by seeing what it does. 
 Maybe this is possible already because I think I saw that in an EmacsConf talk and there is an ivy extension for it https://github.com/mkcms/ivy-yasnippet
 Any chance somebody knows how to set that up?

                    <span>So, long story short: I am defining the Show method for a data structure that I have created (hash table), but when doing so, I can&#x27;t put new lines as the only thing the show method does is print a string, and doesn&#x27;t work like putStr, which does undestarnd \n as a new line. The problem is I can&#x27;t use (or dunno how to) putStr in the show function as it returns an IO() and not a String. Surely there is a solution to this but I cant find it😭

 Here is the quote from Typeclassopedia:
  
Intuitively, it is this ability to use the output from previous computations to decide what computations to run next that makes Monad more powerful than Applicative

  #+NAME: test | hubba | bubba | | this should be &quot;bubba&quot;: | #ERROR | #+TBLFM: @2$2&#x3D;&#x27;(org-lookup-first &quot;hubba&quot;, @1$1..@&gt;$1, @1$2..@&gt;$2) 
 Many thanks!

                    <span>This is a post introducing the new changes of Iron v1.2.0.
 What is Iron ?
 Iron is a type constraints (or type refinement) library for Scala 3. It uses Dotty&#x27;s inline and opaque types to evaluate constraints at compile-time.
 Here is a simple example: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;scala def log(x: Double &gt; 0d): Refined[Double] &#x3D; x.map(Math.log)
 log(-1d) //Compile-time error &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Features of 1.2.0
 Release 1.2.0 brings two key features: an imperative-styled DSL and constraints relations/consequences.
 Imperative DSL
 Iron brings a new imperative-styled DSL directly inspired by Martin Odersky&#x27;s Representing Monad with Capabilities (HOPE 2021).
 Here is the &quot;imperative&quot; form of our log(x) method presented above: scala def log(x: Double &gt; 0d): Raw[Double] &#x3D; refined { Math.log(x) }  In this example, x is automatically unboxed via an implicit conversion only available inside refined and Math.log(x) is automatically boxed into a new Constrained.
 Capabilities work for other kind of monads. If you want to use capabilities in your project, I highly suggest you to watch the talk linked above.
 Consequences
 A consequence has basically a definition analoguous to logical implication &#x3D;&gt; (do not confuse it with Scala&#x27;s functions). It is used to convert a Constrained value to another Constrained.
 While a default implementation exists for all conversions, this new typeclass allows you to define specific relations (like transitivity, reflexivity etc...) that have two major benefits: - Check some conversions at compile-time where (for example, we know that a constrained value A / B can&#x27;t be converted to A / Not[B]). - Avoid unnecessary evaluations at runtime.
 Note that Consequences are not exclusive to mathematical/numerical values.
 That&#x27;s all for this release. For further information, check the release on Github.
 Happy new year!

                    <span>Does someone has a handy way to switch (and cycle like next-buffer would do) to buffer of the same mode ?
 I can craft some elisp but I would imagine it&#x27;s probably already done by someone or built in to emacs?
 looking quickly at switch-to-buffer function, should I just make my own function with a custom switch-to-*-buffer-skip which would check which mode I am on currently ?

 For example, where is the result of evaluating

                    <span>Hey people!
 In my previous GNU/Linux distribution I was using Emacs 28 but in the package repos of my current one (Void Linux), Emacs 28 is not there (https://voidlinux.org/packages/?arch&#x3D;x86_64&amp;q&#x3D;emacs).
 I miss some of its features. That&#x27;s why I would like to compile it from source. I know a lot of you guys do this: which is your criteria to chose a branch or tag from which to compile, from the Emacs repo? (https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/tree/master)
 I want to use the latest more or less stable version possible, not the most bleeding edge one possible. Since I don&#x27;t want to potentially run into errors on a daily basis or anything like that.
 Should I go for the latest tag possible, i.e. emacs-28.0.90? If I understand correctly, tags are meant to indicate each latest stable version, don&#x27;t they? Or should I go for the HEAD of any specific branch?
 Thanks a lot in advance!

                    <span>One of the things that amazes me about Haskell is the rabbit holes I&#x27;m ceaselessly cascading down. For example, what I thought was an innocent question turned out to be my latest rabbit hole, i.e. apparently Haskell doesn&#x27;t have real recursive types. Apparently, what I thought was a recursive type, e.g.
 data Peano &#x3D; Zero | Succ Peano 
 is not really a recursive type, although I&#x27;m not sure why. My previous question about what turned out to be the omega combinator brought up the true nature of Haskell recursive types and the mysterious newtype &quot;workaround&quot;. So this talks about a real natural number recursive type (as does my previous question)
 MyNat &#x3D; One :+: MyNat 
 MyList a &#x3D; One :+: (a :*: MyList a)
 I can&#x27;t truly fathom what&#x27;s being done/said here, e.g., no idea what is meant first paragraph in by a typed tagless-final interpreter. Simple blind acceptance, which is just hand-waving, isn&#x27;t my style. And the logic programming course it references is, well, my latest rabbit hole. Can somebody give me some intro material to this whole issue of what really is a recursive type. This all started, BTW, with trying to understand what a type equation meant. Can you guess how many pdfs and web pages I&#x27;ve opened since then? Fazit: Somebody (me?) needs to pull all these threads together into one big Haskell-Omni textbook. The existing beginner texts are too handwavy, IMHO. There&#x27;s a kiddie version of Haskell and a grownup&#x27;s version. The kiddie version is pretty much useless, again, IMHO, unless it&#x27;s to spur you on to the bigger stuff.

                    <span>I am still learning Haskell, previously using c++/Rust/Python. I am not an expert in any of those languages, however, I am really liking functional programming with Haskell. I am even learning how to do FP in c++. My question is for people that are more experienced with Haskell. Will I suffer trying to do what co-workers do with c++, in Haskell? Mind you, the majority of what we do is security related (RE, exploit dev, secure systems, etc)

                    <span>There&#x27;s this form of infinite loop
 (λx . xx)(λx . xx) 
 and this form
 (λx . xxx)(λx . xxx)(λx . xxx) 
 How could they be done as Haskell anonymous functions? I&#x27;ve got this in a similar vein perhaps
 let x &#x3D; a in let y &#x3D; λz.x in let x &#x3D; b in y x 
 But I&#x27;ve mixed in the parts I can&#x27;t fathom in Haskell, i.e., the λz.x and y x This isn&#x27;t it (\x -&gt; \x -&gt; x)
 which is, if I&#x27;m not mistaken (λxx . x); it just takes two inputs and returns the second; and this doesn&#x27;t seem to be allowed (\x -&gt; x x) so I&#x27;m stuck.

                    <span>When using the result of another code block i find i want to transform the value slightly before using it, in particular I want to trim off a newline. I have a feeling this ought to be a common case, but I can&#x27;t find any information on how to do it.
 For instance, in something like this, where bar refers to another (named) block and thus has a trailing newline.
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 +header: :var foo&#x3D;bar
 +begin_src http :pretty
 POST http://localhost:3000/api/${too}/run

                    <span>This change appears to have happened around September 2021. I could not find any official announcement, but I could have missed it.
 This just cost me fiveten minutes of my life (only because I have gotten used to it, having been broken multiple times now from main branch renames in various projects).
 I am here to complain and perhaps save some time for anyone else who contributes to Org mode or uses the source occasionally.
 If you&#x27;re still tracking master, you&#x27;re missing commits.

                    <span>I have a capture template that records a scheduled time when a TODO item is made, and then a deadline for when it is due, on the same item. Semantically this makes perfect sense; it is exactly what I want to do. However, my agenda for the day doesn&#x27;t distinguish between the two, so it can be confusing when I look for my daily TODO items. Is there a trick to getting the scheduled and deadline agenda entries to display differently on today&#x27;s agenda, or should a feature request be made?

                    <span>Hi, 
 Is there any way to use global-prettify-symbols-mode and not have it change all TODO keywords to checkboxes? When marked as DONE, the checkboxes turn into a &#x27;ticked&#x27; checkbox that I find very ugly. I am wondering if there is some variable I can set in the init which will get rid of this substitution while keeping the global mode on, as I do prettify a lot of other things.

                    <span>Hello everyone,
 I&#x27;ve been using emacs on my android tablet and love it,
 however i have some terminal related issues (mostly key bindings).
 Does anyone have experience with gui version (emacs-x), is it stable?
 Or should i stick to terminal and try to do bindings more terminal friendly?

                    <span>Sometimes when setting up a new package I get a weird error. Example
 I try to run:
 (use-package ivy) (&quot;C-x C-e&quot; to evaluate)
 Result:
 Error (use-package): Failed to install ivy: Wrong type argument: stringp, nil
 Error (use-package): Cannot load ivy
 Then, without (knowingly) changing anything it will start to work. I&#x27;m convinced emacs just wants to see me scramble to the internet. 
 Has anyone else seen this, or am I living in the twilight zone? Any insight would be appreciated.
 A bit of context:
 - This is in my congif.org file
 - I&#x27;m in server mode

                    <span>Hi everyone, just FYI: I&#x27;m a complete newbie, but here&#x27;s the problem.
 I added this lines to my init.el file:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 (use-package evil
 :ensure t ;; install if not already installed
 :init ;; start configuration
 (setq evil-want-integration t) ;; set to t by default
 (setq evil-want-keybinding nil)
 (setq evil-vsplit-window-right t)
 (setq evil-split-window-below t)
 (evil-mode))
 (use-package evil-collection
 :after evil
 :ensure t
 :config
 (evil-collection-init))
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 but when i evaluate the buffer, i get these errors in the warnings buffer:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Error (use-package): Failed to install evil: Package ‘evil-’ is unavailable
 Error (use-package): evil/:init: Symbol’s function definition is void: evil-mode
 Error (use-package): Cannot load evil
 Error (use-package): Failed to install evil-collection: Package ‘evil-collection-’ is unavailable
 Error (use-package): Failed to install evil: Package ‘evil-’ is unavailable
 Error (use-package): evil/:init: Symbol’s function definition is void: evil-mode
 Error (use-package): Cannot load evil
 Error (use-package): Failed to install evil-collection: Package ‘evil-collection-’ is unavailable
 ​
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; 
 what do i have to do to fix this?

                    <span>I have to work with some fairly large code-bases, so I want something that can handle that. The features I care about most are code-completion and code navigation (i.e., jumping to a symbol&#x27;s definition).
 Between clangd and ccls I can&#x27;t really decide which would be better for me? Most of the threads I&#x27;ve seen discussing the two are years old. 
 ​
 Which do you all prefer and why? Thanks!

                    <span>The doc for (setq-default indicate-empty-lines t) is confusing for me. C-h v indicate-empty-lines tells &quot;Visually indicate empty lines after the buffer end.&quot; But how can you have empty lines after the buffer end? There is nothing after the buffer end!
 Take a look at this screenshot: https://i.imgur.com/tzcDdYKl.png Line 10 is the last line of the buffer. There is nothing after Line 10. The fringe bitmap indicator shows the void (limbo?) after the end of the buffer. But the doc refers to this void (limbo lines) as &quot;empty lines&quot;. Why?
 Aren&#x27;t Lines 6-10 empty lines? Lines 6-10 are actual lines that contain nothing but \n. Aren&#x27;t these the empty lines - the blank lines?
 Isn&#x27;t everything after Line 10 limbo? visual representation of lines that don&#x27;t exist / end of buffer? Help me understand the Emacs terminology? Why lines that don&#x27;t exist are called &quot;empty lines&quot;?

                    <span>I&#x27;m on a Mac (El Capitan). With a little recent help from the emacs.stackexchange.com forum participants, I have written up a few Emacs functions to refresh the TD Ameritrade access token for its API, and to submit custom buy/sell orders for equities (although it could be for options trading too, but that&#x27;s not my cup of tea). At some point in the future, I hope to write Lisp code to stream TDA data using the API and make trading decisions from within Emacs. For the near foreseeable future, however, I&#x27;ll be relying upon watching the Thinkorswim desktop application to make decisions to buy/sell. Screen real estate is precious, as I need to see the charts, studies, order flow, etc.
 In a nutshell, I only need to tell Emacs: 50.35 RET and then perhaps 15 seconds later 51.25 RET. I have installed KeyboardMaestro, for systemwide keyboard shortcuts offering a variety of options, including executing scripts and so forth.
 I have two (2) Emacs options for order submission, either calling the curl executable, or running url-retrieve-synchronously.
 Any ideas regarding how to do this Emacs order entry quickly and save screen real estate would be greatly appreciated.
 BACKGROUND: There are certain custom orders available through TDA that cannot be executed programmatically from within Thinkorswim, but that should be possible through the API. Speed is the key as I am interested in momentum trades with high volatility.

                    <span>Hello there,
 I&#x27;m using the Emacs packages simpleclip to copy to clipboard, and shell-pop to open up a terminal in Emacs quickly with a keybinding.
 Anyways, I can copy text from the terminal to the clipboard, but whenever I try to past into the terminal, it throws the error:
 ​
 &#x60;Buffer is read-only: #&#x60;
 ​
 So how do I fix this issue? I use the emacs package use-package in my .emacs config, so I&#x27;m trying to figure out what lisp code is required to fix this issue, so that I can paste into the terminal in emacs.
 ​
 Thanks in advance for the help!

                    <span>So my wife gave me puzzle. In the same hour I thrown off everything about who did it and where to find tips and solutions (actually, I even doesn&#x27;t remember if I had this information) and took it apart without trying to remember. Then I waited for some time to forget everything and then I found that this puzzle is a bit more complex than I thought about it.
 So I decided to write some code (surely using Haskell) to solve it. And today I did it.
 Here is repository:
 https://github.com/DKurilo/crest-18-puzzle/
 But I have a question: is it possible to make it faster and not using so much memory?

                    <span>Sorry for the wall of text, but I&#x27;ve been reading a lot of guides and not really getting the answer I need. If anyone wants to help a complete newcomer, I could really use it.
 I&#x27;ve read some monad tutorials/lectures and I think I have a beginner&#x27;s understanding. Basically what I took away was &quot;without unsafePerformIO, which you should not use, Monad types like M a can&#x27;t be converted to a. Instead you compose your Monad functions with pure functions using operators like  or &gt;&gt;&#x3D;.&quot; I also think I understand this distinction between &quot;pure&quot; and &quot;monad&quot; functions helps the haskell compiler be extremely cool.
 That sounds really good, but I&#x27;m having trouble understanding how to structure an application around this. I&#x27;m trying to teach myself Haskell by writing an interactive fiction game. So far I have an RPG-style dice roller written, but it&#x27;s deterministic. I&#x27;m creating a seed from the system time inside of a do, using the &lt;- operator. I then use (basically) randomRs (_,_) (mkStdGen seed). Because I used do and I wasn&#x27;t sure what to do after that though, so I tried using unsafePerformIO and I&#x27;m almost certain this is why my dice roller rolls the same numbers every time.
 Do I have to make all my roll-processing functions and the entire skill system speak IO Int and pass up and down an updated stdGen? I am pretty sure the answer is &quot;no,&quot; since I can use bind to invoke pure functions. But if that&#x27;s true, I&#x27;m not sure how to apply that while designing a whole application.
 I guess what I&#x27;m unsure of is how to structure something larger than a few functions around all of this. Does anyone have any favorite guides or wisdom about the big-picture structure of an application written in Haskell?

                    <span>Hi,
 I have previously posted about my package dtache.el, which provides detachable shell commands to Emacs users. Today I merged the dtache-eshell.el library which provides the integration of dtache with eshell, previously dtache only supported M-x shell.
 You can read more about, and see some examples of dtache-eshell in action at https://niklaseklund.gitlab.io/blog/posts/dtache_eshell/, and if you are looking for the source code you will find it here https://gitlab.com/niklaseklund/dtache :)

                    <span>Emacs 3rd party dependencies and user home integration can be well managed using Nix. Posimacs is a published example.
 I&#x27;ve updated the example. It now uses nix flakes. The elisp files can be maintained as a dirty tree for happy hacking. Home manager is mainly used for the static aspects of user home integration rather than installing the elisp files read-only. I will be installing this on a Darwin machine sometime today.
 The Scheme
  
Straight for elisp packages &amp; lockfiles
 Home manager for dotfiles
 Nix expressions for distributing 3rd party deps
  
Forewarning, the Emacs lisp is not marketed as good. At anything. My git tree is dirty. I mainly use the vterm integration and Rust Analyzer.
 The Future
  
Emacs can maintain its own nix profile to have a self-contained set of 3rd party dependencies like language servers and dynamic modules independently of the user environment
 Emacs can generate a home manager module for programs like vterm that want home integration
 Emacs can maintain non-package elisp configuration expressions without resorting to rigid git managed structures or rapidly decaying patchworks lifted from literate org files scattered around
  
The mix of tooling is the main work output of this project so far. Appreciate pointing out any work related to the Future

 On my case was getting all those pesky &quot;~&quot; backup files on one place... I hated how those splattered all around.

                    <span>Thanks to Po Lu, Emacs&#x27;s pgtk port could use xwidgets to browse web pages. You don&#x27;t need to install any external packages, just compile the newest source code of Emacs (at least newer than this commit by Po Lu) with &quot;--with-pgtk&quot; together with &quot;--with-xwidgets&quot; flags. Then M-x xwidget-webkit-browse-url and enter a url, you could surf the Internet via Emacs!
 For people not familiar to this: pgtk port is the feature Emacs use pure GTK, which means it could run under pure Wayland. Xwidgets is a feature that allows Emacs to display GTK and NS widgets inside buffers. Xwidgets doesn&#x27;t support pgtk before, Po Lu made it support pgtk.

                    <span>EDIT: Never mind! The function I was looking for is M-x indent-relative. That solves my problem. I can combine that with return to make a custom function to do what I want.
 Writing a shell script, Emacs adds 4 tabs and 1 space. I don’t want this to happen. I want Emacs to go to the first character in the previous line. Emacs is going wild with auto-formatting. I want electricity. I like electricity. But I don’t like auto-formatting. That is, I don’t like tons of random tabs and spaces added for no reason.
 for in i in 1 2  
 I don’t want that. I want :
 for in i 1 2  
 M-x electric-indent-mode doesn’t work, because then I lose electricity, which is also problematic. I like electricity, but I don’t like auto-formatting. Turning off electricity isn’t good:
 for in i 1 2 do  
 I want the cursor to be aligned with the do, not at the beginning of the line. Does anyone know how to do this?

                    <span>Just saw that a few hours ago Org-transclusion 1.1.1 has been released and is available on ELPA.
 https://github.com/nobiot/org-transclusion
 A tip of the hat to Nobiot for writing this amazing package.
 I&#x27;d been waiting for the first release before integrating it into my workflow and now I&#x27;m out of excuses :).
 What a wonderful gift to the emacs community to end out a difficult (I would say horrible) year and end it with hope and optimism going into 2022.
 Thank you Nobiot! Happy New Year to all; wishing that your init.el file be bug free in the coming Year of The Tiger.

                    <span>I often need to use indent-region from indent.el to fix the indentation of code template I have from school. So I made this function :
 (defun indent-buffer () (interactive) (if (not (string&#x3D; major-mode &#x27;python-mode)) (indent-region (point-min) (point-max)) (message &quot;Not in python&quot;))) (global-set-key (kbd &quot;M-i&quot;) &#x27;indent-buffer) 
 It works well but I recently found out that the default indentation is only 2 space char. I would like to have it inserting 4 chars width TABS. I tried to look in the customization group of indent.el and even used kernel coding style emacs config, which works when I press  but doesn&#x27;t when using (indent-buffer).

                    <span>Hej fellow &#x27;macsers,
 TL;DR: Can you tell me which function emacs invokes to ask for auth data?
 I recently heard of mini-frame-mode and fell in love. While I see the need to have a vertical display for functions and variable descriptions (marginalia ftw!), I have always been irritated by a new buffer appearing &quot;out of nowhere&quot; on the bottom of my screen, moving the modeline etc.
 So, I have adjusted the looks of mini-frame-mode to my liking. Now, there is one piece missing: whenever I push to my git repository, mini-frame-mode opens to prompt me for my git auth data. I don&#x27;t want mini-frame-mode to handle this; instead, I want the password prompt to appear in the original mini buffer on the bottom.
 I know of the mini-frame-ignore-commands variable. However, I don&#x27;t know which program is evoked by emacs to ask me for the password. I tried skimming the Messages Buffer for it, but adding magit-process-username-prompt and magit-process-password-prompt to the list didn&#x27;t change anything, and I was unable to find a reference to another function in the packages&#x27; code.
 Thus: can you tell me which function emacs invokes to ask for auth data?
 Have a good day, folks :)

                    <span>While trying to make the switch back to emacs from vscode. I have this issue. I&#x27;ve created my own colorschemes in vscode with customized fonts per language tokens. 
 Where i can easily adjust font size, colors, or any attributes for tokens in a .json file, and by inspecting tokens in the editor with (Ctrl+Shift+P) (for Editor Tokens and Scopes in the Command Palette). I can specify in the json for any token category in the textmate grammar any font size, color, attribute etc.....
 Can the same be accomplished in emacs, and what resources/links should I be looking at to work on porting over my colorscheme for this?

                    <span>This is something I was thinking about for quite some while now. 
 I&#x27;m an undergrad student very interested in Haskell and functional programming in general. Doing some stuff in my spare time, however, isn&#x27;t quite satisfying and I want to learn more, especially how it would look to write actual production Haskell. 
 That is why I would like to apply for an internship or job in Haskell. But here comes the problem: 
 All job offers for Haskell programmers either require years of experience with Haskell in production and/or a PhD. 
 I think this is a problem because: 
  
If nobody offers a job for beginners to work with Haskell, how does the community want to get new people who have worked years in Haskell that don&#x27;t come from academia? 
 
How will there be more programmers writing Haskell in…</span>

                    <span>I have observed some strange GHC behavior while working on my $DAYJOB project that I&#x27;d like to report as an issue on the GHC bug tracker. To do so, I intend to prepare a minimal case that reproduces the issue on the compiler version that the GHC developers would most prefer. I&#x27;m having trouble doing that though:
 1) Which is the GHC version that would be the most useful for GHC developers? 8.10.7, the one the majority of the users currently use (me included)? 9.2.1 which is the latest stable release? Or GHC HEAD? 
 2) Unless the answer to (1) above is GHC 8.10.7, what&#x27;s the easiest way to obtain that GHC version, very preferably without polluting my system globally? I&#x27;ve built GHC HEAD using the great nix-shell provided by https://github.com/alpmestan/ghc.nix, which allowed me to build it without installing any system dependencies globally. But I can&#x27;t figure out how to run the resulting GHC, I have ./inplace/bin/runghc which I can use to interpret .hs files and I have ./inplace/bin/ghc-stage2, but that one results in a billion linker errors when I try to compile anything. I&#x27;ve also tried installing GHC versions via ghcup, but that one also fails because I think I&#x27;m supposed to install some system dependencies, but I really don&#x27;t like doing that if at all possible.
 It might be a good idea to update the report a bug page in the GHC wiki with this information. This subreddit is probably not the best place to ask these questions, but I&#x27;m also not sure where best to engage with the GHC developers.
 Thanks for any pointers!

                    <span>Hello haskellers,
 I know this question has been asked in the past, but I&#x27;m hoping to get a more modern answer :&#x27;)
 Are there any recommended resources for learning category theory and haskell?
 Some background info, I have a math undergrad degree, and I had fun with the pure math, proofs, theorems, etc. so I&#x27;d love to dive deeper into the formal math behind category theory.
 After graduating, I&#x27;ve had a few different roles before landing a software engineer position about 6 months ago... mainly working with JavaScript/TypeScript/node.js.
 I&#x27;ve also worked through the JavaScript Mostly Adequate Guide to FP, which further piqued my interest in FP, also learned some basic Clojure and used it for Advent of Code this year.
 Has anyone worked through the MIT course, Programming with Categories? Does this seem like a good place to start? Leafing through the textbook, it seems to strike a good balance between the formal math and introducing haskell basics. I was thinking of working through it, then work through a more in-depth haskell resource after (i.e. learn you a haskell or something).
 What did you use to learn category theory and/or haskell?
 Thanks in advance for your input!

                    <span>I&#x27;m working on my &quot;adulting.&quot; I&#x27;m reviewing and setting habits to help guide me in times of lower clarity. Looking at ideas for creating a tool for thinking, I came up with a tool that prompts me to refine the edits to zettel titles and &#x27;summary relevance.&#x27;
This &#x27;tool for thinking&#x27; results from a python program tied to Keyboard Maestro that prompts me to review titles and summaries of the last ten days of newly created zettel. As an anchor, it is tied to my practice of morning journaling. It reminds me and makes it convenient to examine each zettel title and the one-sentence &#x27;relevance&#x27; statement to see if it makes sense and stands up to scrutiny. This is added to the bottom of that template. (pictured below) Automatic, easy peasy, the cognitive load of the initiating behavior habit off-loaded to the computer. This is not an excuse for not editing the body of each zettel. A new zettel will be on the list for ten days. That means ten opportunities for giving the zettel some love.
I&#x27;m unsettled on the format. In its current form it is a bit hard to read. I will make changes for readability.
If you&#x27;re interested in how this is done, have questions about my use-case, or just want to chat let me know.
Below are pictured titles and a one-sentence summary/meaning of the zettel I&#x27;m working on. These are the ideas I&#x27;m currently wrestling with. They represent a ten-day window of new zettel.
This is generated with nothing held back. I would love to talk to you about anything on this list. If any of this is of interest to you, please start a thread here, DM me, or get in touch via email.</span>

                    <span>Hey all, what is the best way to save the entire window as highest resolution image file (not just each buffer). I think a screenshot will not provide the best available resolution on a Mac machine. I know htmlfontify-buffer but this is cumbersome as it saves one buffer each time.

                    <span>So the idea is that no matter what you&#x27;re doing the LSP server generates documentation and refactoring tools for whatever you&#x27;re looking at -- whether you&#x27;re surfing the web through emacs, looking at photos, talking to people, or writing code. And should also be able to plug this into other editors. One LSP server for everything. So far you can only try it out from within the docker container. Start pen, open a text file, python, elisp, etc. and run lsp. Anyway, I&#x27;m going to continue working on this into next year.

 Surf is the only browser that supports XEmbed protocol. So now you can use it in GNU Emacs to browse rich web.

                    <span>Hi all. Question about Emacs config.
 I use straight.el to manage packages. I also use use-package for configuration. I have use-package configured to use straight.el. I&#x27;m using the development version org-mode, which was fantastic, until Emacs 28 started shipping with v9.5, which is all I need. The built-in version seems to load much quicker than the one I have. (I&#x27;m not byte compiling my init files; maybe I should do that?) Is there a way to make use-package use the built-in version of org-mode even though I&#x27;ve got straight-use-package-by-default set to t?

                    <span>I was a bit surprised when find-file in an occur buffer sent me to another directory than that one of the file being trawled through.
 The following advice fixes that.It sets default-directory of the occur buffer to that one of the trawled file.
 (defun filesTZA-occur-default-directory (fun &amp;rest args) &quot;Set &#x60;default-directory&#x27; in occur buffer. FUN is called with ARGS.&quot; (let* ((dir default-directory) occur-buf (occur-hook (cons (lambda () (setq occur-buf (current-buffer))) occur-hook))) (prog1 (apply fun args) (when (buffer-live-p occur-buf) (with-current-buffer occur-buf (setq default-directory dir)))))) (advice-add &#x27;occur :around #&#x27;filesTZA-occur-default-directory)

                    <span>I use line-number-mode whenever I&#x27;m in a coding environment, but when writing prose in org-mode I obviously have no need for a running line number count. However, I still appreciate an indicator in the fringe that shows the beginning of each new line when I’m dealing with dense paragraphs. Is it possible to put a custom symbol in the fringe in place of where line numbers would be? Thanks for any help!

                    <span>I have a few packages on MELPA; can I submit those to ELPA and Non-GNU ELPA as well? Or should I choose one?
 What&#x27;s the community&#x27;s opinion on this?

                    <span>I&#x27;m just starting out with babel and can&#x27;t get the example code to run (http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/languages/ob-doc-gnuplot.html#sec-4) :
 #+begin_src gnuplot :exports code :file file.png reset set title &quot;Putting it All Together&quot; set xlabel &quot;X&quot; set xrange [-8:8] set xtics -8,2,8 set ylabel &quot;Y&quot; set yrange [-20:70] set ytics -20,10,70 f(x) &#x3D; x**2 g(x) &#x3D; x**3 h(x) &#x3D; 10*sqrt(abs(x)) plot f(x) w lp lw 1, g(x) w p lw 2, h(x) w l lw 3 #+end_src 
 This only produces the output: Cannot open load file: no such file or directory, gnuplot
 I have gnuplot installed and also included the following in my init.el file:
 (org-babel-do-load-languages &#x27;org-babel-load-languages &#x27;((emacs-lisp . t) (gnuplot .t) (python . t)))

                    <span>I work as a Positive Behaviour Support Practitioner with people with disabilities and complex needs. In this, the primary document that I create for all my clients is their Behaviour Support Plan (BSP).
 A BSP is a long and complex document: with many sections and sub-sections, various tables and prompts for me (which aren&#x27;t exported). All of which org-mode can achieve just beautifully. 
 As the BSP is such a critical clinical document - I spend a lot of time thinking about and tweaking this document. This may include changing wording in a heading, re-ordering sections, or creating/removing a section altogether.
 This is where my problem comes in. Having now made a change on my template, how do I go about propagating this change across all the existing BSPs I already have?

There are 4 different labs in Go lang I plan to redo in Scala (MapReduce, Raft, Fault-tolerant Key/Value Service, Sharded Key/Value Service). There is also a bunch of lectures available on YouTube: https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824/schedule.html. I would like to know if there is any interest in forming a study group to motivate each other to complete this course and work on the labs together.

                    <span>I want to use the org-capture-template to record my weight into a table. So I used the following to construct the template :
 (&quot;mw&quot; &quot;Weight&quot; table-line (file+headline &quot;~/Projects/Metrics.org&quot; &quot;Weight&quot;) 
 &quot;| %U | %^{Weight} | %^{Notes} |&quot; :kill-buffer t)
 However, when I use org capture, my tables end up being misaligned as shown below. How can I fix this alignment issue?

                    <span>When creating tasks using org-capture, I try to provide as much context as i can, so it might take 2-3 mins to create one task. this would make my agenda look messy because of these tasks with short clocked time. 
 ​
 I wonder if there&#x27;s an easy way to create a function/hook that removes the clock drawer if the clocked minute is less than a threshold, say 5 mins?
 ​
 There is something similar in org-mode already, when the variable org-clock-out-remove-zero-time-clocks is set to true, empty clock drawers are removed after org-clock-out.

                    <span>Recently I downloaded and installed the emacs from https://emacsformacosx.com/
  
As I install it the spacemacs configuration is by default configured.
 How can I remove it since lot of unwanted features already enabled which I don&#x27;t want.
 I was thinking of configuring the emacs from scratch for clojure development.
 Also I can see the lag while switching buffers and in execution while using spacemacs.

                    <span>Some time ago I could evaluate code blocks using #+begin_src sclang .... #+end_src in my org file. But not anymore. Highlight syntax is okay inside the block but when I execute with C - c C - c I get this: &quot;No org babel execute function for sclang&quot;. Sclang seems to be supported by Babel and Org (https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/languages/index.html) but since it was working there is no doubt sclang is supported anyways. I am also ensuring that a working installation of sclang is functional and on when executing the block. 
 I am also setting it to (require &#x27;sclang) before anything, so cannot think anything else. Executable of the lang is declared as well and functioning okay! 
 All in all, the language is working in its mode so there is nothing else that points a reason to investigate and also when trying other languages in such as js it works okay with results appearing as expected outside the source block.
 #+begin_src js console.log(&quot;hello&quot;) #+end_src #+RESULTS: : hello : undefined 
 I have activated sclang using this below:
 (org-babel-do-load-languages &#x27;org-babel-load-languages &#x27;((sclang . t)))

                    <span>I would like to add classes to HTML that is output from Org mode. For instance, if I used C, then the following Org:
 #+begin_src c int main(void) { return 0; } #end_src 
 Will produce HTML that has the following classes:
 
 int main ( void ) { return 0; } 
 
 However, I am interested in providing the same for “non-out-of-the-box” languages like Swift and Kotlin. There are “ob-“ modes for these languages, and when looking at it in Emacs, they are highlighted. However, I only get plain text.
 Note, I am doing something a bit strange: instead of using my usual Doom Emacs configuration for exporting, I have created a batch script that I…</span>

                    <span>Hi everyone,
 I sometimes use emacs in the terminal but emacs shortcuts and terminal shortcuts clash. 
 Is there a way to disable terminal shortcuts not to clash with Emacs or is there a terminal emulator I can use that supports non-GUI Emacs fully? 
 Thanks for the help.
 Edit : 
 I use urxvt on Manjaro, I have a problem with C- being sent to C-h and commands such as M-s not being recognized.

                    <span>I am trying to use the Super key in an input method. Specifically, I would like to press Super + a followed by apostrophe to get á, etc. The following:
 (quail-define-rules (&quot;s-a &#x27;&quot; [&quot;á&quot;]))

 (setq-default indicate-empty-lines t) 
 Where is this special glyph actually define? I mean I want to see this glyph defined somewhere in text format that I can copy and paste. I looked at C-h v fringe-indicator-alist but it simply shows this
 ((truncation left-arrow right-arrow) (continuation left-curly-arrow right-curly-arrow) (overlay-arrow . right-triangle) (up . up-arrow) (down . down-arrow) (top top-left-angle top-right-angle) (bottom bottom-left-angle bottom-right-angle top-right-angle top-left-angle) (top-bottom left-bracket right-bracket top-right-angle top-left-angle) (empty-line . empty-line) (unknown . question-mark)) 
 But where can I see the literal value of empty-line?

                    <span>I can&#x27;t seem to load doom with chemacs2. I tried to follow the steps and I want to test out different distros. I basically blew away my install and got regular emacs, witchmacs, and doom-emacs in a folder called ~/emacs/ then cloned chemacs2 per the instructions. My ~/.emacs-profiles.el looks like this:
 ((&quot;default&quot; . ((user-emacs-directory . &quot;~/emacs/default&quot;)))
 (&quot;doom&quot; . ((user-emacs-directory . &quot;~/emacs/doom-emacs&quot;)
 (env . ((&quot;DOOMDIR&quot; . &quot;~/doom.d&quot;)))))
 (&quot;witchmacs&quot; . ((user-emacs-directory . &quot;~/emacs/witchmacs&quot;))))
 line three I&#x27;m not sure about, but I think that&#x27;s what&#x27;s supposed to go there. I can load the default GNU emacs, and witchmacs, no problem. But when I try to run emacs --with-profile doom I get this:
 |Warning (initialization): An error occurred while loading&#x27; /Users/moshepaul/.emacs.d/init.el&#x27;: |File is missing: Cannot open load file, No such file or directory, core-modulesAnybody have an idea where I&#x27;m going wrong?

                    <span>If I split a window vertically or horizontally, so that I have the same window shown several times, when I do M-x helm-mini , it shows as many entries with that name as windows showing the buffer. I&#x27;ve checked with emacs -Q to ensure it is not my config file, and the same thing happens. But I can&#x27;t find any variable to alter this behavior. I&#x27;d like a single entry per buffer, even if it is shown in multiple windows.
 What am I missing here?

                    <span>Since I switched to the developer version of emacs, on my latest Ubuntu distribution, I cannot use the &quot;C-.&quot; (or &quot;ctrl .&quot;) keyboard shortcut anymore. As soon as I press it, a strange &quot;e&quot; box appears on the screen (see screenshot) and emacs hangs until I press ESC or &quot;C-.&quot; again.

 This does not happen if I start emacs in the terminal (emacs -nw)
 Is anyone else seeing this?
 How can one find out if this bug has been filed?

                    <span>As an example, I want to export a special block called #+begin_card that I want it to have a specific export configuration. Do I need to create a derived back-end? I know it is an easy process it&#x27;s just that I then need to call this new back-end instead of the html one.
 What if I have one export back-end for this card and another back-end for a mermaid.js export, how can I mix both back-ends as both change the same function? Can&#x27;t I just extend the html backend with more functions for other special blocks?

Maybe satisfies the type equation FX &#x3D; 1 + X, where the functor F takes a set to a point plus that set.
  
It sounds brilliant, but I don&#x27;t know what any of that means. (I have only a beginner&#x27;s understanding of what a functor is.) Where can I start learning?

                    <span>Hello everybody,
 I wanted to reach out to the reddit community about haskell salaries. The only other reddit thread on the topic I could find was from 8 years ago, so I was curious if things have changed in the past 8 years.
 According to the Stack Overflow 2021 Developer Survey, Haskell developers seem to make much less than some other &quot;functional&quot; languages (i.e. Clojure, F#, Elixir). Do you find this to be true in your experience?
 I&#x27;d also be interested to hear about haskell salaries in the US vs elsewhere.
 If you would like, feel free to share your salary here (for others to reference), but no pressure!
 Thanks in advance!

                    <span>I&#x27;ve started a translation from Common Lisp to Scala of Forbus and de Kleer&#x27;s tools from their Building Problem Solvers. At this point I have working versions of two of the more useful of their tools, the justification- and assumption-based truth maintenance systems (JTMS and ATMS).
 Truth maintenance systems track the relationships among possible beliefs, reasoning rules, incompatible/contradictory beliefs, and the conclusions we might draw from them. The JTMS stores a single context of which beliefs we might adopt; the ATMS tracks all of the various environments which might support the possible beliefs without contradiction. TMSes can guide search in reasoning engines, or can directly serve as models for program domains.
 The JTMS and ATMS code here are simple translations of F&amp;dK&#x27;s implementation, translated with minimal changes into Scala. Part of my motivation is to have a deeper look at their code, and I&#x27;ll likely add documentation in the next few weeks, and possibly additional tool translations.
 On Scaladex or Github. Enjoy.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve discovered iedit, which allows me to C-; over any string and edit all occurrences of it simultaneously, à la multiple-cursors. The default behaviour is that, by pressing C-; only once, it selects all occurences of the string in the whole buffer. Is there a way to expand the selection to each new match one at a time? For those familiar with, I&#x27;m basically trying to replicate Sublime Text&#x27;s functionality when you Ctrl/Cmd-D over any string.
 iedit documentation mentions that &quot;Many other work flows to highlight occurrences are possible, for example, (...) incremental selection&quot;, which sounds exactly like what I want. But looking through the documentation, available functions, and even the source code, I couldn&#x27;t find the answer.
 Thaks for any help.

                    <span>In css-mode, if I enable hs-minor-mode and start folding blocks with hs-toggle-hiding, I cannot unfold it with hs-toggle-hiding again. I can reproduce this in emacs -Q, just try folding this in css-mode with hs-toggle-hiding (after turning on hs-minor-mode):
 p { margin: 1rem 0; } 
 For reference, this is the definition of hs-toggle-hiding:
 (defun hs-toggle-hiding (&amp;optional e) &quot;Toggle hiding/showing of a block. See &#x60;hs-hide-block&#x27; and &#x60;hs-show-block&#x27;. Argument E should be the event that triggered this action.&quot; (interactive) (hs-life-goes-on (posn-set-point (event-end e)) (if (hs-already-hidden-p) (hs-show-block) (hs-hide-block)))) 
 This is happening because for some reason (posn-set-point (event-end nil)) (as e is nil when hs-toggle-hiding is run as a command) would move point to somewhere that makes hs-already-hidden-p always return nil.
 Currently I&#x27;m patching the function in my config by only running posn-set-point if e is non-nil:
 (when e (posn-set-point (event-end e))) 
 which fixes it.
  
I can&#x27;t imagine I&#x27;m the only person who has encountered this issue. Is this a known issue and has it perhaps been fixed in Emacs 28?

                    <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;m trying to set org-level-* height(font size) differently for each level(doom emacs, config.el):
 (after! org (set-face-attribute &#x27;org-level-1 nil :height 1.75)) 
 But it displays different height only on frame that uses window-system. I&#x27;m using OSX so ns
 , in this case.
 When I use frame on terminal(iTerm) it displays default height.
 I think it should work with iTerm since iTerm is also uses graphical display.
 But the result of (window-system)or (display-graphic-p) is nil
 Is it not possible to start emacs on terminal with window system?

                    <span>In 2022 I aim to become more accustomed with the Linux Kernal and to finally become fluent in the C programming language, with emacs as my environment for doing that. But there are so many fields open to us now. I&#x27;d love to hear what your plans are for next year and beyond..

                    <span>According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, the word is more suited for copy/cut (like in vi/vim) than paste (Emacs).
 Does anybody knows or have references for why this specific word was chosen?
 Is this some mistake carried through times?

                    <span>Hello, maybe this is too trivial to ask, but is this a method which only exists in other configurations of Emacs or comes in Emacs as well. I am using this language package which is not in MELPA yet, so I am installing it like below. Also, are there any issues that one has to be aware using this method of cloning packages like this. Again, sorry if this is too obvious to ask.

                    <span>Hi everyone,
 I&#x27;m currently switching python IDE to move to full emacs. I&#x27;m therefore trying to take with me the few things I really liked from my former python IDE (Spyder) and add all the new features that made me move to emacs.
 One important step for me is to replicate the Spyder Dark Theme within Emacs (because I like it, am used to it and am not really satisfied with other ones I tried so far). What I have, is the spec of the theme that you can see in the screenshot attached.
 Unfortunately now I am really stuck in how to proceed to convert those hex colors to an emacs custom theme, as a complete emacs newbie... Any help would be much appreciated!
 ​
 Have a nice holiday season!

                    <span>I don&#x27;t know if this is something that&#x27;s okay to post here, but I figure I&#x27;ll give it a shot. I wrote this C++ Yasnippet script a few months ago, and I use it basically every day.
 # -*- mode: snippet -*- # name: function # key: fn # contributor: conscat # -- ${3:$(map-void yas-text &quot;void &quot; &quot;auto &quot;)}${1:name}($2)${3:$(map-void yas-text &quot;&quot; &quot; -&gt; &quot;)}$3 { $0 } 
 The most interesting part is map-void, which I define like this:
 (defun map-void (check replace-t replace-f) (interactive) (if (string&#x3D; check &quot;&quot;) replace-t replace-f)) 
 Here&#x27;s what it does:
 I type fn, then press TAB. That expands into this (white space a little different). The | represents my cursor:
 void |func() {}
 I can type in a function name here. I press TAB again:
 void foo(|) {}
 Now I can type in a parameter list, and TAB again:
 void foo(int moo)| {}
 Now here&#x27;s the cool part. If I type in anything, a -&gt; is automatically inserted, and the void at the front becomes auto!
 auto foo(int moo) -&gt; boo|{}
 And then I TAB into the body of my function and type the rest. I know it&#x27;s not that crazy, but it&#x27;s the ability to just do these kind of neat hacks that makes me appreciate Emacs so much.

                    <span>Title basically. I installed emacs-mac. Running: emacs and emacsclient -t open it up in the terminal, as expected. Running /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs opens a gui.
 I expected emacsclient -c to open up a GUI attached to the emacs daemon. But that command too opens it up in the terminal.
 Thanks
 Edit (tl;dr): how do I open Emacs in GUI attached to the emacs daemon.

                    <span>Are there any packages that support bookmarks that can be saved to disk, stored per &quot;project&quot; (where a project is a projectile/ffip/vc-repository - for example).
 The bm package looks like it might be configurable per-project, although it would require some hacking to support that, and even more hacking to support it properly (to support multiple projects loaded in a single emacs session).
 Another limitation of bm is it only exposes bookmarks in open buffers, again, I can hack in support to show all stored bookmarks for the repository I&#x27;m working on, but this isn&#x27;t trivial - it may be simpler to use a package that already supports this.

 I&#x27;ve just published a new Blog Post on a classic implementation technique for lazy functional programming: combinatory logic based graph-reduction engine.
 The implementation is structured into three parts:
  
A λ-calculus parser from A Combinatory Compiler which was extended to cover a tiny functional language based on the untyped λ-calculus.
 A compiler from λ-calculus to combinatory logic combinators (S,K,I,B,C and Y) which is based on bracket-abstraction and some optimization rules.
 A graph-reducer. Combinator terms are allocated into a graph data-structure. Which is then reduced by applying combinator graph-reduction. The destructive inplace reduction of the graph is made possible by using STRef
 mutable references.

                    <span>Hello everyone, as a means to learn Haskell I&#x27;ve decided to write a very basic Web3 implementation in it, everything has been great so far but I&#x27;m having a really hard time trying to encode integers that are greater than 8 bytes because of the data types. I&#x27;ve come across some useful libraries but settled on using Data.Binary. Here&#x27;s an example of something I want to do in Elixir:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;elixir
 This just gives you a 32 bytes representation of that number
 &gt;
  
&gt;
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 On Haskell I&#x27;ve tried and it works with smaller numbers (Whatever fits into Int64), but with bigger ones:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;haskell
 B64.encode $ BL.toStrict $ runPut $ putInt64be 3214000000000000000000
 :61:48: warning: [-Woverflowed-literals]
 Literal 3214000000000000000000 is out of the Int range -9223372036854775808..9223372036854775807
 &quot;AAB4iX/DNTs&#x3D;&quot;
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Which does not give me the correct representation since the value is out of bounds (I think the number it sticks with is 4266531174538018816 (maxBound :: Int64) rather than the one I passed)
 ​
 So, I wanted to ask, what are my options to encode these numbers in the same way I can do on the first Elixir example? Is there a technique I&#x27;m missing?

                    <span>During last five years it was twice that I had to figure out how parse JSON in streaming fashion. I figured that I release a library, so I don&#x27;t have to figure it out again some years in the future. I suspect this library might be useful to others too, since it is likely that I am not the only who ran into such problem. In my particular situation use cases were:
  
Parse a very large JSON file, contents of which was one very big top level dictionary with millions of key value pairs. My requirement was that I needed to modify each individual key/value pair without affecting memory overheaad.
 Continuously parse an infinite stream of log entries from a service called logentries.com where each entry was formatted as JSON and delimited by a newline.
  
conduit-aeson is capable of handling both of these use cases and probably others as well. See haddock for examples and documentation. Here is one such example:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  
  
:set -XOverloadedStrings :set -XTypeApplications import Conduit let input &#x3D; &quot;{ \&quot;foo\&quot;: 1, \&quot;bar\&quot;: 2, \&quot;baz\&quot;: 3 }&quot; runConduit $ yield input .| conduitObject @String @Int .| printC (&quot;foo&quot;,1) (&quot;bar&quot;,2) (&quot;baz&quot;,3) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

                    <span>In a previous post How to count tags co-occurrences in a buffer and put them in a matrix I talked about a simple way to &quot;link&quot; to a sparse tree. 
 So, if you have a &quot;tagA&quot; and like to see where it appears in the buffer, just create a link as &#x27;tag-sparse:tag&#x27; and follow it. 
 Here it is the custom type link. :)
 #+begin_src emacs-lisp (org-add-link-type &quot;tag-sparse&quot; &#x27;em/sparse-tree-tag-link) (defun em/sparse-tree-tag-link (tag) &quot;Makes a sparse-tree from the linked tag.&quot; (org-occur tag)) #+end_src 
 That&#x27;s it. Short, simple and sweet. I hope someone finds it useful. :)

                    <span>Dear fellow Orgers...
 TLDR: how to count tags in a buffer and put them in a matrix where each cell counts the co-occurrences of both tags in a heading?
 The long story: thematic analysis is a quite common technique used to synthesize meaning in texts (those interested in a brief but good introduction, please peek https://www.scribbr.com/methodology/thematic-analysis/). In short, once done each idea in a text is marked by a tag, and then you can synthesize a text by it&#x27;s tags (of course, we can also group them, but that comes after) and different texts can be compared by it&#x27;s found tags.
 As we all know, emacs is a great operating system and comes not only with org-mode but also with a decent editor ;) so it was a logical idea to use both to do thematic analysis. And in the end, it seems t…</span>

                    <span>During the last months, me and my girlfriend moved our note taking, planning etc. from TiddlyWiki to Emacs OrgMode and so far we both like it. But there is one big thing im missing: &quot;dynamic aggregation&quot;.
 In TiddlyWiki I can automatically query and format many information throughout the Wiki. Easy tasks like displaying a table of all D&amp;D sessions is achievable with the column mode, but how about more complex aggreagations? For my studies, I created tiddlers for every subject including information for CP, semester, and category. In my overview, each semester is listed as seperate heading with the subjects being displayed by category as description lists and the CP summed up for each category. Please refer to the screenshot.
 In TiddlyWiki I can use filter expressions to select any tiddler (entry) from the wiki and extract data from it. This data can be transformed into arbitrary HTML, which is rendered when the article is visited. This query and transformation is done in the Wiki&#x27;s own syntax, which is a part of the reason I wanted to switch to Emacs.
 How would I recreate this in OrgMode? I&#x27;m okay with having all information in one file and don&#x27;t mind to learn elisp. What I would like to have is the information to be displayed inline (not in another buffer) and being able to use all or most of OrgModes usual formatting options.

                    <span>I stumbled on a certain feature some time ago, and completely forgot where I found it.
 But I remember what it does:
  
find every occurrence of some regex, say &quot;printf,&quot; recursively in a directory tree (call this the &quot;gather&quot; step)
 populate a buffer with every line matching that regex; edit in that buffer as if it were a file
 on &quot;save,&quot; have every modified line &quot;scattered&quot; back out to its original file
  
Anyone kind enough to point out a package that does this or something close to it?

                    <span>I am new to Haskell. My motivation for learning is mostly curiosity. I’ve heard that it’s a different way of thinking about problems and solutions and I am giving it a try. 
 I am also interested in building a simulation engine for game like Majesty (a medival game where all characters are autonomous). Would this be something that would make sense to do in Haskell? I’m not talking about the graphics or other components. As a noob it seems that each unit/node will carry a lot of state so maybe not. But I want to hear from someone who knows about Haskell

                    <span>I&#x27;m studying Haskell with &quot;Learn you a Haskell for Great Good!&quot;
 I&#x27;m at page 30, where there&#x27;s an example of an error message from ghci when running: read &quot;4&quot;
 I just noticed that if I run it in my ghci I get a totally different feedback: instead of the expected
 &quot;Ambiguous type variable &#x27;a&#x27; in the contstraint:...&quot;
 I get a totally different response:
 &quot;*** Exception: Prelude.read: no parse&quot;
 I&#x27;m not sure if this is expected or if it&#x27;s something related to my installation of Haskell.
 For the record: I installed Haskell (version 9.0.1) through stack.

                    <span>Hi, I am new to haskell so this might be a noob question.
 Let&#x27;s say I have a function
 haskell sequenceMaybe :: [Maybe a] -&gt; Maybe [a]  This allows me to do things like haskell sequenceMaybe [Just 1, Just 4]  where a is inferred to be Int. All is well
 But what if I have an array like haskell [Just 1, Just &quot;mystring&quot;]  is there a way to write a function that will abstract over all these types? I only need a function that return true if any of the Maybes is Nothing, or false otherwise. So I do not need any constraint on the inner type.
 Many thanks!

                    <span>Out of interest how many of you here are working on the cardano Blockchain given that only Haskell is the available language to develop with.
 Btw I&#x27;m a .net developer in my day job, if I were to get into development for cardano are there any useful readings or links you could provide. 
 I was going to look at the Haskell course on future learn. (I have developed with F# in my hobby projects)

                    <span>Hi all, I just used ghcup to update the GHC version to 9.2.1, which is the version that brings a lot of support for M1 processors if I understood correctly. Does this mean that the compiler already knows how to use ARM natively? 
 The reason I am asking is just because there tends to be a choice when downloading an installation file of Intel vs Apple Silicon. Thanks everyone!

                    <span>I can only assume that the official example of org-capture having a journal entry means that a fair few people use them as a journal entry. However, if I am writing my journal entry at 2 in the morning, it appears in the tree for the next day. Is there any way to modify the entry automatically (even if it means I have j for journal and another binding for &quot;journal but a day ago&quot;) ? I can wind up with nights as late as 5 AM, so it&#x27;s rough on keeping organized.

                    <span>I am trying to get emacs native compliation working, and keep running into the following error.
 {.example} error: Cannot find libgccjit library 
 I have tried installing emacs with native compliation a number of ways
  
 Downloading and compiling from emacs master branch
  Downloading and compiling emacs-ng from master branch
  Downloading from snap edge
  
all resulting in some variation of error being unable to find libgccjit, for example another one reads
 {.example} Error (use-package): projectile/:config: Cannot find libgccjit library Disable showing Disable logging Error (use-package): org-roam/:config: Cannot find libgccjit library Disable showing Disable logging 
 Running on pop~os~
 I thought that I may not have the right version of libgccjit installed, but it appears that I have versions for gcc 9, 10, and 11 installed (default gcc is v11)
 {.example} $&gt; find /usr/lib/gcc/ -type f -name &quot;*jit*&quot; /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/9/include/libgccjit.h /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/9/include/libgccjit++.h /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/10/include/libgccjit.h /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/10/include/libgccjit++.h /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/11/include/libgccjit.h /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/11/include/libgccjit++.h 
 I can succesfully compile and run the jit example from https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/jit/intro/tutorial01.html without issue.
 Any suggestions on what I need to do to get emacs to find the right libgccjit?
 Edit: Thank you, the problem has been resolved. I actually had some code in my init.el which was causing the problem.

 5.9.1-rt20avl1 #1 SMP PREEMPT_RT Sat Oct 31 12:21:58 EDT 2020 x86_64 GNU/Linux). I tried to install some favourite packages like evil, but I cannot seem to download from Melpa. I put

 I also tried
 (setq gnutls-algorithm-priority &quot;NORMAL:-VERS-TLS1.3&quot;) 
 ​
 as the first line in .emacs, did m-x package-initialize and m-x package-refresh-contents, still the same error.
 Any help is much appreciated.

                    <span>I really like helm&#x27;s fuzzy search for commands and buffers, but I cannot get it to work for files. Since this is such a well-known package, I assume the fault lies with me. Hopefully someone here knows what I am doing wrong.
 The situation: I am in my home directory. I want to add a note to the file ~/work/notes/todo.org.
 What I currently do: I enter &quot;wo C-j not C-j do &quot;, which is basically bash-style completion with C-j instead of the tab key and does not feel very helm-y.
 What the internet tells me to do: I have seen multiple posts of users claiming that I should be able to do this the helm way, e.g. entering &quot;todo&quot; first, then remembering the folder and narrowing with &quot;work&quot;. However, this does not work for me. Even if I remove all my custom init settings, helm-find-files just doesn&#x27;t do that.
 So what am I doing wrong? Is there a setting I need to enable?
 Other things I am aware of: I know there is also helm-find, but that a) is not fuzzy and b) takes upwards of 60 seconds (!) to find a file in my home directory even if I enter the complete file name, which is clearly not acceptable.There is also helm-projects-find-files, which seems to be for individual software projects and wants me to set up a project tree.
 I am aware that without some form of indexing, finding a file by name might just not be feasible. In that case, it would suffice if I could look for &quot;notes&quot;, find nothing, then add a space and &quot;work&quot; and helm would be smart enough to expand those directories in reverse order. It feels like that is what the helm project page advertises anyway, but it just doesn&#x27;t happen when I try it.
 Thanks in advance!

                    <span>Many IDE has so called &quot;project explorer&quot; which display the outline of the project, some of them also give you the symbols in each file so that you can have a overview of what each file does.
 I notice there is treemacs and lsp-treemacs which provide above mentioned functionality, but I&#x27;m not sure whether this is the traditional way of Emacs to grasp the outline of a new project.

                    <span>When I want to open a file, navigating a file system is probably the slowest. What usually works is looking in recently accessed files, be it recentf or just searching mini-buffer history.
 Finding file in a project usually works the best (Projectile), but it would probably work even better if it could just search the entire system.
 If I&#x27;m certain I have had this file open this session and haven&#x27;t killed it yet, I can try switching between buffers (C-x b), but that usually only works on short trips and is rarely ergonomic.
 So if I&#x27;m not sure if the buffer is still alive, and if what I&#x27;m looking it belongs in the same project as what I&#x27;m looking for. recentf and history don&#x27;t really land themselves well to exploratory navigation. 
 What we&#x27;re left with is find-file which looks and works amazingly with ivy, counsel, or even ido. But I often find myself frustrated, when changing a buffer takes more effort than you&#x27;d think it&#x27;d be necessary.
 Then I end up wishing I&#x27;d have mixed results, including recent files, input history, maybe project files, and so you could switch between them. ivy has different actions and that&#x27;s cool, but can it change the data source on the fly?

                    <span>How is this actually happening?
 data (,) a b &#x3D; (,) a b 
 At first sight, it seems circular. But then it works
 λ&gt; (,) 1 2 (1,2) 
 I found this, but then I don&#x27;t follow how Solo is/becomes (,). I understand that (,) is a product type since it&#x27;s definitely not a sum type of any sort. Can someone point me to some details on the whole product type theory, as well as how the (,) data type definition results in the two arguments being surrounded in parens and separated by a comma, and treated as a tuple.

                    <span>In my old neovim config, I used this line:
 autocmd FileType c nmap   :sv terminal bash -c &quot;gcc -o %:r % -lncurses &amp;&amp; ./%:r &amp;&amp; rm %:r&quot;
 To compile and run C files quickly, it first splits the current buffer and open a new terminal buffer in the new one where it compiles the file name and run the binary, after that it deletes the binary file from the directory.
 How can I make Emacs do something similar? I used &#x60;quickrun&#x60; package before, but opening a new shell window usually destroys my other windows organization, I&#x27;d like to use something like my vim workflow.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been using Emacs for maybe six months now on both my Windows and Linux machines for all my programming, word processing, and personal organization. Couldn&#x27;t be happier with my productivity, and the community is great! Tons of tutorials, terrific documentation on almost all the packages I need, and just generally cool, helpful folks. I&#x27;ve followed the community&#x27;s advice on a whole lot of matters, including keybindings: I read people saying that CUA bindings would interfere with the bindings of many Emacs packages, that made sense to me, so I&#x27;ve learned and ingrained Emacs bindings into my brain. It&#x27;s great! Until those terrible, dark times when...I need to leave Emacs.
 And discover that Emacs has trashed my muscle memory.
 Whenever I&#x27;m in a browser (can&#x27;t use EWW for everything...right??), I find myself constantly closing tabs when I meant to cut text. I save files when I mean to search. If I use another app for long enough, I eventually do adapt back to CUA, but if I&#x27;m rapidly switching back-and-forth between Emacs and anything else, I start making mistakes the moment I relax into autopilot.
 How do y&#x27;all handle this? Do you extend Emacs bindings out to the rest of your system (and does that work across platforms)? Do you suck it up and tread carefully outside Emacs? What do you do when you face an app that can&#x27;t be easily brought into the Emacs ecosystem?

                    <span>I have often been in the position of giving advice to a novice programmer on what text editor to adopt for their day-to-day programming. Needless to say, I always recommend Emacs.
 I estimate that I have given such recommendation to 30-40 people over the years.
 AFAIK, my success rate so far is 0.00%. 1
 I would like to improve this abysmal success rate.2
 Hence I would like to ask those of you who resisted adopting Emacs at first, but ultimately did so, what took you so long? What were the barriers?
 And to those who have a better success rate than 0.00% at getting others to adopt Emacs, what is your secret?
 1 What is even more bewildering, some of these programmers, who ended up choosing a different editor, have later told me that they wished that they could do with their editors the things that I can do with Emacs. (To hear them say such things one would think that they had had to settle for a less powerful editor, because Emacs had not been an option for them, somehow.)
 2 My motivation here is not mere proselitism. Some of the people in question are actually co-workers, and I just want them to be more productive. It pains me to see how unproductive they are on account of the editors they use.

                    <span>this has been driving a bit insane, when running emacs28+ pgtk with native-comp on wayland/sway I am getting a 80%/100% CPU usage when using emacs with the good-scroll package. When I stat emacs with no buffer open it already is as high as 70% on a CPU.
 After a lot of trial and errors from my config, I pinpointed to the good-scroll package which seems to behave weirdly on wayland or maybe it&#x27;s on pgtk or native-comp, i am not so sure. It does not show up when running on Xorg.
 just to make sure I am not insane I have made a video :

 will be reporting the bug to the project but I hope this could help others who has the same issue.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve long been a bit jealous of Mac users with the Choosy application that prompts the user for which browser they&#x27;d like to use every time they open a link. The only open source Linux alternative I&#x27;ve found is Braus, but I struggled to get it working. So, I let the matter drop - it wasn&#x27;t important enough to me at the time. 
 However, it&#x27;s starting to feel a bit more necessary in Emacs (for me). My entire life is in org files - both personal and professional. I tend to use separate browsers for work and personal use, so I&#x27;d love if anyone has clever solutions for this every time I open a link in Emacs. I should add, there are also times when I just want to use eww if I&#x27;m just looking up some documentation or static content. 
 I&#x27;m guessing I could either create some bindings for each browser function or I could manipulate the browser function to actually run a custom elisp function that opens a prompt. I&#x27;m just a bit curious if anyone else has felt the same way and if you have any insights you might be willing to share.

 how it happens: i added these lines in init.el to open shell in current window, then i do M-x shell in emacs and it shows this error. To remove this error, i commented these lines, but the error still shows.

                    <span>This ‏‏‎ is probably kinda off topic for this sub, but I&#x27;m encountering a really little minimal issue I want to report, but I don&#x27;t know how. If I try to file an issue on the emacs-helm github, I get this: An owner of this repository has limited the ability to open an issue to users that are collaborators on this repository. So how do I file issues? The issue might not even be with helm. The issue is when I run helm-make-projectile, it doesn&#x27;t register targets as targets if they are followed by a &#x27;\&#x27; character. Not a huge deal. Just wanted to make it known. Just don&#x27;t know how.

                    <span>Please bear with me, I&#x27;m only starting to learn haskell. (Note: My machine is a M1 Macbook Air)
 Recently, after following a guide and installing haskell and necessary stuff from here, I tried to compile a small program and found out that I needed to install LLVM, I did it and by trial-and-error I managed to get everything working, but though it works, if I run GHCi I get this message.

One of the two will be used. Which one is undefined. 
 *edit: just after posting this, when I launched GHCi again, this didn&#x27;t happen, but yesterday at first this took place, then it didn&#x27;t and today it did again
 Do you know what&#x27;s responsible for it? What should I do?

 Changelog: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/text-2.0/changelog
 Please give it a try. Here is a cabal.project template: https://gist.github.com/Bodigrim/9834568f075be36a1c65e7aaba6a15db
 This work would not be complete without a blazingly-fast UTF-8 validator, submitted by Koz Ross into bytestring-0.11.2.0, whose contributions were sourced via HF as an in-kind donation from MLabs. I would like to thank Emily Pillmore for encouraging me to take on this project, helping with the proposal and permissions. I&#x27;m grateful to my fellow text maintainers, who&#x27;ve been carefully reviewing my work in course of the last six months, as well as helpful and responsive maintainers of downstream packages and GHC developers. Thanks all, it was a pleasant journey!

It wasn&#x27;t very warmly received, unfortunately. So I thought about it a little more, and realized that the desugaring is totally broken in some cases.

                    <span>When providing a type to users, a library can also provide lenses for that type without actually depending on lens. This is because Lens is a type synonym, so you can simply write a function with the correct signature and export it, to be used like a Lens. And even though there is a wide variety of lens packages (lens, optics, microlens, etc.) such a function is likely to work with most of them.
 This is all preamble to my actual question: how can a library do the same for streams? There are a number of streaming libraries out there (conduit, pipes, streaming, streamly, etc.) and a hypothetical library author would might like to provide streams or stream combinators to users that are compatible with as many of them as possible, but don&#x27;t explicitly rely on those libraries. Does anyone have any information about what this could look like (assuming its even possible)?

                    <span>TL;DR: Game made with apecs and gloss crashes when trying to read input from Nintendo Switch.
 Inspired by this post, I am recreating the Unity 2D tutorial in Haskell using apecs and apecs-gloss. I am nearly done: The graphics are rendered correctly, the levels are generated appropriately, the player responds to keyboard input, etc.
 As an extra, I want to be able to control the game with the Nintendo Switch joy cons. I have successfully connected the joy cons and I&#x27;m reading the input in the stepping function (6th argument of play - called periodically) instead of the event handling function (5th argument), as the latter only recognizes keyboard and mouse input. Here is an excerpt of what I&#x27;m doing in the step function, the full details of handleSwitch can be seen here (essentially read input if the buttons are pressed when the stepping function is called, interpret the input and update the scene).
 stepGame :: Float -&gt; C.System&#x27; () stepGame dT &#x3D; do ... ASTM.forkSys (Switch.handleSwitch dT) ... 
 Unfortunately, the player may respond to the first few inputs but then the game crashes. I thought it was a race hazard so I wrapped handleSwitch in forkSys (creates a new thread for switch input) but the issue persists.
 Any ideas on what might be going wrong and how to fix this? Any help would be greatly appreciated!

                    <span>Hi all, First time experience running Haskell, I wanted to spend some time learning the fundamentals during these holidays break. 
 I installed the Stack installer for windows to a Win10 core i5 (late 2019) laptop with 8 gigs of ram. I then proceeded to create an &#x27;hello world&#x27; project - - stack downloaded GHC 8.10 and created a cabal file (very confused between cabal and stack differences but, I&#x27;ll go with the flow). 
 The machine behaves well with other programing platforms. however, with Haskell/stack it seems very slow... I&#x27;m running stack build and stack test and it takes up to 1 minute in both cases if there is any change to compile (without recompilation, still takes about 30 secs).
 Was just wondering if this slowness is expected? I remember using it on a Ubuntu machine and didn&#x27;t notice it being so slow. Maybe it has to do with the underlying C compiler arch?
 (edit: formatting)

                    <span>Scala Native 0.4.3-SNAPSHOT was released to Sonatype snapshots and it adds Scala 3 support for Scala Native. 
 The release is binary compatible with previous ones, but Scala 3 on its own does not fully source compatible - more info about that in https://github.com/scala-native/scala-native/pull/2480
 The full release is planned for the first weeks of January.

                    <span>A lot has been said already about dark vs. light. For the most part, I think it&#x27;s fair to say it&#x27;s a matter of personal preference. However, I was wondering more of folks who prefer low-contrast dark themes and find them easier on the eyes. 
 I use a slightly modified version of the [[https://depp.brause.cc/gotham-theme/][Gotham theme]]. I want to list a couple of the advantages, in order of importance to me: 
  
The low contrast is easier on my eyes, especially in low-light settings which I prefer to work most of the day. The cyan color of the text is about the right contrast against the black; full white on black feels like the light is &quot;drilling&quot; into my eyeballs, with a bit of a haze effect the more I read. On the other hand, white background with black letters is too bright, usually s…</span>

                    <span>I have it in my settings to use org-ids when storing links interactively and have org-id-link-to-org-use-id set to create-if-interactive. 
 This works great in all my files except the notes file that I have set up for org-ref. For whatever reason, capturing links using C-c l only captures the heading and the custom_id like so: file:~/path/to/org/file.org::#Custom_ID]] 
 If there are multiple types of identifiers in a header such as both a custom id and an org-id, how can I get it to choose the org-id, or at least get it to choose all the possible options so i can choose which one to use?

                    <span>Hi! :)
 I have updated my package, dtache, to version 0.2 today. In short the major improvements compared to 0.1 are:
  
Support for macOS users
 A single completion interface with support for (improved) annotations, out of the box
 The dtache-env is optional and not required for the package to work
 Better error handling
  
I made a short video going through the changes as well as showing how to use the package. The video can be seen as a continuation on the previous video about the package: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;De5oXdnY5hY
 The package can be found at: https://gitlab.com/niklaseklund/dtache

                    <span>I&#x27;am using ranger as my File Explorer and I am wondering if there is a way to get out the pigmentized text from Emacs. I think it makes sense to use our code editor as the core for pygments, so it would be an unified way to colorize all Code. Thanks!

                    <span>Today, in talking with a fellow developer they shared that they had recently switched from Atom to VS Code. I shared my departure from Atom and trying Vim, VS Code, and finally settling on Emacs.
 I shared Magit, Embark + WGrep, Hydra menus, Hammerspoon&#x27;s editWithEmacs, and finally some functions I&#x27;ve written to help automate common tasks in writing pull requests (conformant to our company&#x27;s Github PR template).
 I explained that while VS Code might be an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), I find Emacs to be an Integrated Computering Environment (ICE).
 I&#x27;m finding the more I use Emacs, the more I think about how I interact with files and text. I didn&#x27;t convert anyone from VS Code to Emacs, but then again were I &quot;only writing software&quot; I probably would be using VS Code.

                    <span>I’ve been using DOOM Emacs for about six months since ditching VSCode and I love it, even though I probably have no idea what I’m doing. I don’t quite understand how to debug the Elixir LSP features (I’m mostly an elixir dev) and I don’t really know elisp to this point. I’m probably doing a bunch of awful shit and not realizing how much I could make my life easier. Plug-ins are weird, the docs confuse me. I want to learn emacs for real, and the idea of hand-rolling a vanilla config is kind of overwhelming and crazy to me. How can I dive into the world of emacs in little, manageable doses without biting off way more than I can chew or getting in over my head so far I just walk away?

                    <span>Hello. Over the last couple of weeks I asked 2 questions on this sub and both the times I was asked which book I was reading and also that it may be outdated. 
 Q1
 Q2
 http://learnyouahaskell.com/ is a resource listed in the sidebar of this sub. Is this book really outdated? If so what other similar book would you recommend? I come from a mobile development background (Swift) and for whatever reason, the format of this book makes it very approachable for me.

                    <span>I&#x27;m using org-roam for taking most of my notes and I&#x27;m very happy with it. I heavily rely on tags to organize the notes and a feature that I wasn&#x27;t able to find in org-roam is the possibility to have a list of all the tags I created, so that I can select a tag from this list and obtain a list of files with that tag. I know I can use org-roam-node-find, type the name of a tag and filter the files with that tag. However, given the large amount of tags I&#x27;m using, it&#x27;s very hard to memorize all of them and I don&#x27;t always know the exact name of the tag I&#x27;m looking for. Therefore, having a complete list with all the tags would be very helpful for me. Do you know if there&#x27;s a way of having this feature in org-roam?

                    <span>I have an org file that has content like below:
  
:PROPERTIES:
 :ID: 6dc9fdfe-d24a-4eaf-8152-1f663ba70a2e
 :END:
 #+title: example 
 * Header
 [[attachment:filename]]
  
Here the file filename is in the folder that is named based on the ID value: .attach/6d/c9fdfe-d24a-4eaf-8152-1f663ba70a2e, and I can link to the file without any issue.
 After I run org-id-get-create for * Header, I had a new ID added for the header, and it becomes something like below
  
* Header
 :PROPERTIES:
 :ID: cd858afc-45ca-4f3d-bde8-a6f68c8acad0
 :END:
 [[attachment:filename]]
  
Now the attachment link to the file filename does not work any more, I have to move the file to a new folder for the new ID created, i.e., .attach/cd/858afc-45ca-4f3d-bde8-a6f68c8acad0.
 This is annoying and I just wonder if there is a way to let the header * Header to search attachment in its parent&#x27;s attachment folder as well? I tried to set org-attach-use-inheritance or set org-use-property-inheritance to t, but neither works.

                    <span>Dear friends,
I&#x27;m releasing phi-notes, an emacs package implementing a minor mode to work with a flavour of the Zettelkasten system I&#x27;ve been using for some years now.  It has the following characteristics:
Notes are identified by unique, sequential numbers (0001, 0002 etc.).
Notes may be linked using the wikilink syntax ([[0001]]).
Notes may have &quot;parent&quot; and &quot;descendant&quot; notes; they may also be linked to project notes.
Bibliographical annotation is supported with BibTeX references.
Notes may have tags (identified by #hashtags).
Notes have a YAML(ish) frontmatter to keep metadata and are (preferably, but not necessarily) written in Markdown.
The aim of this project is to develop features to ease the creation, navigation and linking of notes in one or multiple note repositories.
A sidebar functionality makes the minor-mode particularly useful for working with structure notes:

Other functionalities include: creating descendant notes, integration with helm, helm-ag and helm-bibtex; &quot;killing&quot; and &quot;yanking&quot; to notes, searching for tags and backlinks; navigation commands for visiting the parent, following links.
Some details of the implementation might be too personal, but the code may at least be useful as a starting point. I&#x27;m calling it a phi minor mode because this is how I named my system long ago.
More information and a setup guide are available on the GitHub project documentation.

                    <span>Hi
 I&#x27;ve just set up emacs on a new machine using a configuration file that I am using already without any particular issues. 
 On the new box, every time I start up emacs, there is always the request to define the &quot;fridge indicator&quot; and it presents me 2 options:
 &quot;Always&quot;
 &quot;Only When Focused&quot;
 Once I pick up one choice the buffer get closed but it is quite annoying.
 What could be the cause of it?
 Regards

                    <span>How would I modify the default org-roam capture template so that it stuffs %x or %L into a :ROAM_REFS: property in the file&#x27;s property drawer?
 All I can find are examples of inserting data into heading property drawers, but that&#x27;s not where org-roam-ref-add inserts them.

                    <span>I am trying to combine the package better-jumper into consult so I can browse my jump points with consults nice preview and search functionality. I have tried to use the existing consult commands as a template and have come up with the following code:
 (defun consult-better-jumper () (interactive) (consult--read (better-jumper--get-jump-list) :prompt &quot;Jump to: &quot; :annotate (consult--line-prefix) :category &#x27;consult-location :sort nil :require-match t :lookup #&#x27;consult--lookup-location :history &#x27;(:input consult--line-history) :add-history (thing-at-point &#x27;symbol) :state (consult--jump-state))) 
 When I run this with M-x consult-better-jumper I get the following error:
 cl--assertion-failed: Assertion failed: (or (functionp candidates) (obarrayp candidates) (hash-table-p candidates) (not candidates) (stringp (car candidates)) (and (consp (car candidates)) (stringp (caar candidates))) (and (consp (car candidates)) (symbolp (caar candidates)))) 
 Upon investigation this error clearly comes from consult--read
 I guess my question boils down to how I can turn the list returned from &#x60;better-jumper--get-jump-list) into a data structure that consult can understand?

                    <span>Just updated to 28.0.50. Prior I would comment a line of code (JavaScript) using M-;. Now my comments (//) are placed towards the end of a line.
 What I want to do is be able to comment a line of code with my cursor being anywhere on that line. Is this possible?
 Thank you.

                    <span>DISCLAIMER! Im not the author of Dirvish. I did a search for Dirvish in this SubReddit and nothing showed up. Not sure where else I&#x27;ve found it. I guess probably from sachachua.com blog if not from here.
  
This package empowers dired by giving it a modern UI in a unintrusive way. Emacs users deserve a file manager better than those popular ones on terminal such as ranger, vifm, lf since Emacs is not limited to a terminal.
 dirvish-minibuffer-preview.el is an extension for dirvish, it provides dirvish-minibuf-preview-mode, which is a feature to preview file when narrowing file/directory candidates using minibuffer.
 In dirvish, you can mark files across multiple dirvish buffers, and paste/move marked files/directory to current directory with one keystroke (dirvish-yank).
 The name dirvish is a tribute to vim-dirvish.

                    <span>Hello everyone!
 (my question is not 100% emacs related, posting it here cause there are lots of programmable keyboard users on the sub and discussion might be useful)
 I am new to keyboard layouts, could you help me with the following?
  
Layer toggles vs combos
  
Let say i want to have navigation on ijkl,
 I could toggle on / off navigation layer when modifier button is pressed
 or i can make combos: modifier+i &#x3D; up, modifier+j &#x3D; left, etc.
 Which approach is better and when each of them should be used?
 With first you have to be mentally aware about current “modes” you are in, with second you have to keep modifier button pressed.
  
Modifiers vs different keys to express degree of action.
  
Let say i have following 3 actions: (emacs related)
 delete char
 delete word
 delete line 
 I could make them
 Modifier1 + d, Modifier1 + w, Modifier1 + e
 Or i can make them
 Modifier1 + d, Modifier2 + d, Modifier3 + d
 Which approach is better / more logical? How would you do it and why?
  
What writer/programmer friendly layouts you can recommend for inspiration? (40% or 60%, not bigger). I am not interested to learn about letter layouts (qwerty, dvorak, etc) but more about positions / layering of universal keys (delete, backspace, enter, navigation, numbers, etc) I saw miryoku layout, is there smng else to learn from?
 
Are there other resources you can recommend related to above? 
 
 p.s. I have all modifiers under thumbs

                    <span>Looking for inspirations.
 I wonder how many people are still using ledger for their personal finance given there are a lot of online services with good phone apps.
 One of my goals in 2022 is to keep my finance in a good shape. I previously used ledger and org-capture to log transactions and reporting. but it&#x27;s a lot of work given the number of transactions per week. this is one of the reasons i give up. If i continue to use emacs/ledger, i need to simplify the workflow, maybe import from CSV and convert to ledger once a week/month or something. 
 ​
 another reason I gave up is that i have joint accounts, using emacs/ledger makes it harder to share.
 ​
 any comments on how you use Emacs or not use Emacs for personal finance would be greatly appreciated!

                    <span>I used to like the recursive subdirectory search and autocomplete feature of ido-mode. For example if I have a file ~/foo/bar/baz/qux.txt and I type C-x C-f ~/foo/qux, ido-mode automatically searches ~/foo/bar/baz/qux.txt and autocompletes it in the find-file minibuffer.
 But when I do the same thing with fido-mode, nothing happens. In fido-mode, I am required to type the complete path like C-x C-f ~/foo/bar/baz/qux and only then it autocompletes the path to ~/foo/bar/baz/qux.txt.
 It seems that ido-mode can search for filename matches recursively in subdirectories. How can I get the same result in fido-mode?

                    <span>Hello!
 When folding in org-mode, if I&#x27;m not on a heading, I use outline-up-heading to move to the parent heading of the content and fold the heading using org-cycle. However, in doing so, the cursor becomes trapped in the invisible region of the heading&#x27;s content, as shown by invisible-p (point), in such a way that, if I quickly change my mind and want to unfold the heading again, I can&#x27;t just org-cycle again; I have to manually move the cursor into a visible region of the header, like the beginning of the line, then org-cycle to unfold.
 So basically my question is: How do I move the cursor to a visible region after folding a heading, and not get stuck in an invisible region, and be forced to move the cursor manually?
 Thank you kindly for the help!
  
UPDATE: I&#x27;ve solved this using (while (invisible-p (point)) (backward-char)), but it seems a tad inefficient; is there a better way to do this?

                    <span>Initial message from the mighty Lars:
 https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2021-12/msg00463.html
 Lot&#x27;s of interest, judging from the epic threads that have ensued since then.
 There aren&#x27;t many programming languages or systems where you can just assume the existence of a built-in relational database. The IBM AS/400 was one such system from the 80s. Emacs could become one if the SQLite plan is executed.
 Looking forward to org-mode tables that are backed and fed from RDBMS tables.

                    <span>Has anyone ever overused monads and created bugs because of using them in an imperative style? If so, how did you get past that stage of your learning process? How can I try to use Monads more safely? This problem arose especially because of my use of the State monad.
 I feel like I went full circle with my FP understanding: Noob -&gt; Understands some -&gt; Understands Monads and has mind blown -&gt; Uses them -&gt; Blows up in face -&gt; is now scared -&gt; Noob

                    <span>hey everyone, I’m new here so idk if this has already been addressed in earlier posts but I’m a comp sci minor and I’m taking Haskell in the spring. I’ve taken python which I found decent and enjoyable but I’ve heard mixed reviews about Haskell. I’m taking another programming class but I know myself and once it starts getting harder I might fall behind since I heard Haskell is extremely hard to learn. 
 I have about a month before classes resume and would love to do something productive with my time. So I’m wondering if anyone knows any good platforms or sites that do a really good job at teaching Haskell.
 Thanks in advance.

                    <span>Hi all,
 I am going through Typeclassopedia, and currently got stuck at the first set of exercises in the Monad section, namely the 3rd one:
  
Implement Functor and Monad instances for Free f, defined as data Free f a &#x3D; Var a | Node (f (Free f a)) You may assume that f has a Functor instance. This is known as the free monad built from the functor f.
  
I got the Functor instance for Free f, but with my Monad instance I am getting this error when trying to load it into ghci:
 • Could not deduce (Applicative (Free f)) arising from the superclasses of an instance declaration from the context: Functor f bound by the instance declaration at Freemonad.hs:22:10-36 • In the instance declaration for ‘Monad (Free f)’ 
 My guess is that that&#x27;s due to this part in the monad definition in Control.Monad
  
class Applicative m &#x3D;&gt; Monad m where
  
which it seems like it wasn&#x27;t always there.
 So:
  
Is there some other way around it, or do I have to provide instance of Applicative for Free f first? Bonus question: should Typeclassopedia be updated to include this information?
 I can&#x27;t figure out how to implement Applicative for Free f, any hints?
  
In case it matters, here is my Monad instance, that I have convinced myself on paper that it should work
 instance Functor f &#x3D;&gt; Monad (Free f) where return &#x3D; Var (Var x) &gt;&gt;&#x3D; g &#x3D; g x (Node x) &gt;&gt;&#x3D; g &#x3D; Node $ (fmap.(flip (&gt;&gt;&#x3D;))) g x 
 but I have also tried implementation from this stackoverflow answer and got same error in ghci.

                    <span>I wrote a program in Emacs Lisp that turns a decimal number into a base-256 number. The numbers involved are very large, so here&#x27;s the logic of it, where base256 is an array of unicode characters, myNum is a number in the septenseptuagintacentillions, and output is an output variable initially set to nil:
  (while (&gt;&#x3D; myNum 1) (setq output (concat output (aref base256 (mod myNum 256)))) (setq myNum (truncate (/ myNum 256)))) 
 I want to rewrite it in Haskell, but I&#x27;m having some trouble. Obviously, I can&#x27;t use the same logic in Haskell, so here is what I have so far: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; -- Builds an array of integers by taking the modulus of each iteration of dividing a number by 256 buildNum num &#x3D; [mod x 256 | x &lt;- (iterate trunkDiv num)] where trunkDiv l &#x3D; truncate $ div l 256
 -- Create an array by accessing the item in my array of symbols that corresponds to a number in an array of integers mapNum nums syms &#x3D; [syms !! y | y &lt;- nums]
 main :: IO () main &#x3D; do putStrLn $ mapNum (buildNum myNum) base256 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; Now, as far as I can tell, what I need is to stop iterating when the truncated product of my number and 256 reaches 1, but I don&#x27;t know where to even begin looking for that information.
 Could anybody give me some pointers on getting this to work?

                    <span>Renovate is used widely to help manage dependencies. Since this week was a short week for us at Caribou, two of us spent some time starting the work to add Haskell support https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate/pull/13224. It needs help.
 If anyone is inclined to pick up where we left off, or start a brand new branch using some or all of what we did, please do! Please communicate your intent on the PR itself so if there are others who want to also work on it, you don&#x27;t have to duplicate their work.
 There&#x27;s another new tool in this same space, Stack Lint Extra Deps. The maintainer was kind enough to get on a phone call with us on Monday to discuss pros and cons of working on SLED vs Renovate, and the consensus is we&#x27;d all like to see Renovate support Haskell first. But Renovate is written in TypeScript and SLED is written in Haskell so if you&#x27;d like to help but don&#x27;t like/know TypeScript, SLED is a good candidate to hack on :D

                    <span>I’m little confused by these words, we can have a type A, which can be created by using sealed trait or use the types provided by scala type system like String ‘ Any , and unit and others. We can represent a list of numbers using List(1,2,3). So is list a kind ? Or is list a type constructor ?. we are not constructing any new type here using type constructor which is list or may be I really need to see from differ perspectives inorder to understand it. And moreover what is a higher kind Vs Kind. I’m learning advanced scala to understand how types and type level programming works . Please help me out understanding these words /vocabulary ? Thank you

                    <span>Dear Zettlers,
I wrote a small to medium-sized series on using the Zettelkasten to deal with fiction (both analysation and creating). To make the series more whole, I thought to give you the chance to ask any questions you have. I will publish the answers as the last installment of the series.
So, what are your questions?
Live long and prosper

                    <span>What are your favorite bits of advice?
 I just came across this one (from here) and I wonder how I ever did without it.
 (defadvice kill-line (before kill-line-autoreindent activate) &quot;Kill excess whitespace when joining lines. If the next line is joined to the current line, kill the extra indent whitespace in front of the next line.&quot; (when (and (eolp) (not (bolp))) (save-excursion (forward-char 1) (just-one-space 1)))) 
 Another great one that springs to mind is Radian&#x27;s find-file advice that automatically creates and deletes parent directories of new files.

 When opening a yaml file these modes are not enabled and all I get is the following message:

                    <span>Hello!
 Basically what the title says; how can I, for example, highlight a region with, say, shift-selection, and then use something like TAB on it to indent it? Or anything like that, really.
 Thank you kindly for the help!

                    <span>Happy to say that my initial goal to support Github, Gitlab &amp; Bitbucket is finally coming together. This PR https://github.com/wandersoncferreira/code-review/pull/156 includes basic bitbucket review workflow to the package.
 ​
 Before cutting the next release would be great to have more feedbacks on rough edges. I&#x27;m not a bitbucket user myself, then hard to spot details.
 ​
 Happy holiday season everyone!

                    <span>How do I? I&#x27;m very new and I&#x27;ve tried almost everything I can to add swift to doom emacs, yet it reads .swift files as fundamental. 
 I might not answer today, as it&#x27;s quite late for me now.

                    <span>I’m doing QuickCheck property testing, and I want to invert things a bit: Given some minimal valid example, randomly permute fields, to make sure they fail and confirm that all the checks are being run.
  
Is there any library/research to help with this?
 What would be the easiest approach?

                    <span>Over the pandemic (and for one training session before it started), we have used a different set of materials for the Haskell 101 and Haskell 102 classes at Google. Although Haskell is not an officially supported language, this material was still presented to over 200 participants.
 The materials are available at https://github.com/google/haskell-trainings and any feedback is much appreciated.

                    <span>I&#x27;m trying to learn how to use some ghc extensions with a simple multiplayer terminal based RPG and i would like to ask about creative ways to use extensions like TypeFamilies, KindSignatures, GADTs, DataKinds or TypeClasses to make some mechanic of RPG (like if an item is tradable so i can use functions that are related to selling and trading). 
 I thought about using DataKinds and KindSignatures to set if the Item can be used in trades and i thought about putting the class of a mage like if he is a Mage as a Phantom type. I dunno if it&#x27;s a dumb but i want to learn creative ways to enforce some properties.
 What are the cool mechanics that u can enforce using types in Haskell? :)

                    <span>Hello, i just started to be a good citizen and write some regression tests for my code.
 Considering i have some error-type and a function that might result in an error:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;haskell newtype Username &#x3D; Username{unUsername::Text} data UsernameError &#x3D; ErrorNameLength | ErrorNameIllegalCharacter
 -- smart constructor for username newUsername :: Text -&gt; Either LoginError Username newUsername name &#x3D; ... -- inspects argument and might return Left &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 in my HUnit test, how would I assert that e.g. newUsername with &quot;&quot; results in ErrorNameLength?
 My thoughts is to do it with pattern matching in do notation, relying on the MonadFail instance of IO. While this works, i see that HUnits assertion-functions allow to provide a descriptive error message in case of failure.
 Therefore I am questioning wether this would be the correct way.

                    <span>Initially i was suggested to write haskell code in Latex by Minted Package. But when i am compiling this code
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;\documentclass[12pt]{article}
 \usepackage{minted} \begin{document} \begin{minted}{haskell} --type Stack a &#x3D; [a] --push :: Stack a -&gt; a -&gt; Stack a --push xs x &#x3D; x:xs
 --pop :: Stack a -&gt; (a, Stack a) --pop [] &#x3D; error &quot;Empty List&quot; --pop (x:xs) &#x3D; (x, xs)
 data Stack a &#x3D; Stack [a] instance Show a &#x3D;&gt; Show (Stack a) where show (Stack [a]) &#x3D; show [a]
 push :: Stack a -&gt; a -&gt; Stack a push (Stack xs) x &#x3D; Stack (x:xs)
 pop :: Stack a -&gt; (a,Stack a) pop (Stack xs) | null xs &#x3D; error &quot;Empty List&quot; | otherwise &#x3D; (head xs, Stack xs)
 \end{minted} \end{document} &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 It was showing the error
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; line 3: Package minted Error: You must invoke LaTeX with the -shell-escape flag. \begin
 line 3: Emergency stop. \begin{document}
  : shell escape is disabled, so I can only detect \ifwindows. 
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Why it is happening and how to overcome it ?

                    <span>In my continued attempt to get mstksg&#x27;s AOC template working, I temporarily gave up on my MacOS attempt (thanks again /u/simonmic for the help so far!) and switched to my Linux box. After a long failure trying to use apt-get install haskell-platform and getting unfixable (by me) dependency errors, I switched to using ghcup (why do we even have haskell-platform if it&#x27;s not going to work?), and things seem to be compiling and running.
 But now I have some (hopefully basic) questions. - The &quot;Interactive&quot; section of the documentation says I should be able to import an AOC.Run.Interactive package. I do not see how to do this. Where / how do I run ghci to import this? I can see the Haskell file in src/AOC/Run/Interactive.hs, but import AOC.Run.Interactive fails with ghci run in either the top level or down in src. If I :l src/AOC/Run/Interactive.hs I get Illegal lambda-case (use LambdaCase), but I didn&#x27;t think that was the right thing in the first place. I assume I&#x27;m missing something simple and obvious here? - The &quot;Executable&quot; section of the documentation says I should be able to get a plain old runnable executable aoc-dev. How do I get this? Right now I&#x27;m using cabal run aoc-dev run 1 a for instance. (If I do build an executable, do I need to rebuild it when I change a day&#x27;s solution?)
 As always any help is most appreciated.

                    <span>I work in a small SW company merging with a bigger services company in the financial services industry in the EU. The new company uses Scala and many of its libraries including cats http4s fs2 affects and doobi amongst others. FP is known to us, but the scala stack looks to be super intimidating. How much should we expect to be ramping up until we get back to being productive? The code doesn&#x27;t look like any code we&#x27;ve ever seen and we thought we had seen a lot. Concerned that my team would lose motivation and leave. Grateful for your consideration !

                    <span>So, today I discovered that I can create web sites in Emacs! A cool website done in org mode is the distro.tube website. But now I am curious : how do I create that top bar with the contents? Is it just a normal org mode table? Another question: can you resize text in emacs to export to html?

                    <span>I have a master branch in my GIT repository, checked out in the local working directory master, and a downstream myproject branch checked out in myproject. These are routinely synchronized via automatically-generated poll requests. Within each there is a source/shared, source/common-services, and source/projects. Only within the myproject repository there is a subdirectory source/projects/myproject.
 Problem Statement: I want to edit the common code only within the master branch. How can I have Emacs default to read-only mode when opening files from myproject/source/shared and myproject/source/common-applications, but not from myproject/projects/myproject?
 FWIW, I am using treemacs and would love to find/create some sort of hook within that context.

                    <span>I&#x27;m using Doom Emacs and trying to find the correct location to add a template to my org capture templates which are set in org-capture-templates. 
 Currently I&#x27;ve added the following lines to config.el but I it seems the list is not created yet when I try to add to it:
 (add-to-list &#x27;org-capture-templates &#x27;(&quot;d&quot; &quot;Custom Task&quot; entry (file+headline +org-capture-project-custom-file &quot;Inbox&quot;) &quot;* TODO %?&quot; :empty-lines 1)) 
 The exact error is: Error in private config: config.el, (void-variable org-capture-templates)
 What is the correct location (or callback?) to add config to that variable?

So far i have tried &#x60;replace-string&#x60;, &#x60;replace-regexp&#x60; and &#x60;query-replace&#x60;. Any attempt says that there were 0 occurrences.

                    <span>Hello,
 I recently replaced my ssh-agent by gnupg (https://opensource.com/article/19/4/gpg-subkeys-ssh). This works fine outside of emacs (I can ssh server and it uses the gpg key). This part (replacing ssh-agent with gpg) especially does not work inside emacs, other parts (decrypting a file with gpg) work fine.
 This is all from withing emacs -nw -Q. This is all in the terminal, emacs not graphical.
 I am able to use emacs to edit an ecrypted .gpg file from within emacs, it asks for the password in the minibuffer and I can enter it: https://i.imgur.com/SON3tM6.png
 However I also use my gpg keys to access other computers through ssh (enable-ssh-support in ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf), and it seems emacs can&#x27;t handle it well. The prompt in this case is broken and it doesn&#x27;t detect my keystroke…</span>

                    <span>I&#x27;m working on a mode for reverse engineering, specifically a mode for viewing executables; because I dislike the slowness of Ghidra; IDA pro is paid and I dislike paid software; and there seems to be no reverse engineering tools for emacs.
 I have been getting familiar with emacs lisp (for ~3 days); I am even thinking about trying out common lisp. However I do not have a design in mind for a reverse engineering mode, which is what I am trying to figure out.
 What would be the mode layout? How would I display program information?

                    <span>I want to learn C and I need an IDE. Since we don&#x27;t have nice IDEs like Visual Studio on Linux and using Vim(the editor I usually use) as an IDE looks like a really stupid idea since bloating it with a bunch of plugins will make it slow and unpleasant to use, I am turning to Emacs which is more than a text editor(how much more I don&#x27;t know, I just know it isn&#x27;t just a text editor) and you can bloat it with plugins without really slowing it down much. I chose DOOM Emacs because I played with it half a year ago and liked the fact that it used the Vim key bindings by default, so I didn&#x27;t really have to re-learn how to edit text files, and the fact that it comes pre-configured in a nice way, saving me a lot of time.
 Anyway, what I want to ask is if I can turn Emacs into a nice C ID, and if it is possible, how do I do that. Thanks in advance.

                    <span>An opening for a Post Doctoral position on hardware acceleration of functional programming languages (specifically, Haskell), at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh.
 The role will involve developing a special purpose processor for Haskell, aimed at outperforming the throughput and energy performance of CPUs. The project is inspired by graph reduction machines like GRIN from the 1980s, and modern FPGA/ASIC protypes PilGRIM and Reduceron.
 Candidates should have a background in hardware design and FPGA programming. Hardware engineering experience should include circuit design, developing processor architectures, memory hierarchies and/or instruction sets. Candidates should have some understanding of functional programming. Programming language implementation experience is desirable, but not essential. The project has close industry ties with Xilinx in Ireland and QBayLogic in the Netherlands.
 It is a three year project, starting in May 2022.
 The HAFLANG project:
 https://haflang.github.io
 Job details and application form:
 https://enzj.fa.em3.oraclecloud.com/hcmUI/CandidateExperience/en/sites/CX/job/1716/
 The application deadline is 28th February 2022.
 Contact the project&#x27;s Principle Investigator, Rob Stewart ([R.Stewart@hw.ac.uk](mailto:R.Stewart@hw.ac.uk)), with inquiries.

                    <span>Asking this for u/Lucky-Lambda since he is a new user and has been waiting for days for moderators to approve his post:
 &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; QUOTE START &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;
 I am trying to test a Stack project that contains an exe, lib, and tests. We have tests for lib now (with lib listed under test &#x60;dependencies:&#x60;), and exe depends on lib in the same way, but there is an aspect of the exe I&#x27;d like to test.
 I have tried to use &#x60;verbatim&#x60; in my package.yaml to get hpack to pass along &#x60;build-tool-depends&#x60;:, which should allow me to reference a &#x60;project:executable&#x60;. I do see it does include it at the bottom of that &#x60;test-suite&#x60; in the generated Cabal output, but I still get a &#x60;Could not find module&#x60; in the test file itself (what I am importing there is listed in the &#x60;executable&#x60; section &#x60;other-modules:&#x60;) when running &#x60;stack test&#x60;.
 I have also tried referencing the exe in the new test with &#x60;build-tools:&#x60;. It makes it into the cabal file, but without the project name prefix I originally included, and does not seem to help either.
 Any possible things I am missing or should try instead? It generates a cabal file with what I thought should work, but it does not seem to be exposing the module I am trying to import from exe in the test. Thanks so much! 
 Versions: * Stack resolver: lts-18.15 * Cabal: Cabal-3.2.1.0 * Running on a M1 Mac 12.1 in a Rosetta terminal (should not be ARM related, as it builds/tests just fine without the above attempt, just giving for context)
 &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; QUOTE END &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;
 Remark from me (u/Martinsos): We also read that one solution is to move all the exe code to the lib and then exe just becomes an extremely thin wrapper. However, I love having this separation between exe and lib, on one hand to make sure that lib doesn&#x27;t in any way depend on exe, and also because external/hackage dependencies are nicely separated, so I would rather avoid that if there is a nicer way to do it.

                    <span>&quot;To join Num, a type must already be friends with Show and Eq.&quot;
 There wasn&#x27;t a followup given to this statement in the book I am reading and I am trying to wrap my head around it. It is easy to follow how a Num must be Eq, but why does it also have to be a Show. If anything I would imagine conforming to Read would be required. 
 So when you do 5 * (6::Double), internally do a read as Double for 5. 
 Is it that compiler does (read (show 5)::Double) * (6::Double)?

 We have over 400.000 lines of Haskell code running in production. We&#x27;re also using TypeScript (300 kloc), Flutter/Dart (28 kloc), Scala (30 kloc) and Objective-C (120 kloc). With Docker and our continuous integration pipeline we&#x27;d be able to release our code daily to excited customers that can&#x27;t believe how agile methods, static typing, tests and modern technology and architecture allow us to deliver solutions unbelievably fast. 
 We&#x27;re not Haskell programmers, system administrators, project managers or frontend designers. We&#x27;re not about one skill or technology. We&#x27;re hackers. We love building and under…</span>

                    <span>Hi, I&#x27;m learning Scala for work, and I like it, I am however trying to work out what the worksheets are for. I&#x27;m using IntelliJ, and it keeps taking the cursor focus off every few seconds while it evaluates what has been written. What are Worksheets actually used for? Is there a good use case that will make studies easier, or is it something that is not worth spending time on depending on IDE being used?

                    <span>Hi all, I&#x27;m trying to write a function that decides if a value is compile time known:
 import scala.quoted._ def toOptionImpl[T](using Quotes, FromExpr[T], Type[T])(expr: Expr[T]): Expr[Option[T]] &#x3D; if expr.value.isDefined then &#x27;{Some($expr)} else &#x27;{None} inline def toOption[T](inline expr: T) &#x3D; ${ toOptionImpl(&#x27;expr) } 
 toOptionImpl with toOption commented out compiles, otherwise:
 [error] 80 | inline def toOption[T](inline expr: T) &#x3D; ${ toOptionImpl(&#x27;expr) } [error] | ^ [error] |ambiguous implicit arguments: both object StringContextFromExpr in object FromExpr and given instance IntFromExpr in object FromExpr match type quoted.FromExpr[T] of parameter x$2 of method toOptionImpl 
 The same functions specialised to e.g. Int work. How to fix it? Thanks in advance :)

                    <span>A couple of weeks ago Nix 2.4 was
released. This
was the first release in more than two years. More than 195
individuals contributed to this release. Since Tweag is the biggest
contributor to the Nix project, I’d like to highlight some of the
features that Tweag has worked on.

Flakes
Flakes are a new format to package Nix-based projects in a more
discoverable, composable, consistent and reproducible way. A flake is
just a repository or tarball containing a file named flake.nix that
specifies dependencies on other flakes and returns any Nix assets such
as packages, Nixpkgs overlays, NixOS modules or CI tests.
You can read more about flakes in the following blog posts:

                    <span>Hi,
how do you handle famous quotes?
Do you rewrite them in you own words or do keep the original words?
How do you organise them?
Are they part of the content of a zettel/idea?
Or do you create a separate zettel for each quote?
Or do you collect quotes by author (or topic) on a (big) zettel?
What is your way?</span>

                    <span>Hi @ctietze! Thanks for the update to 1.7.5. However, when I installed it, the font for the display became much larger and I am unable to control the font size via the preferences, the menu bar, or keyboard shortcuts. I even tried changing fonts.
I have since rolled back to the last version for which I had a DMG file (1.6.3), so I couldn&#x27;t check if this occurs with a 1.7.x version.
I am on running Mac OS 12.0.1.
Can you or anyone else reproduce this issue?

                    <span>If you don&#x27;t use pcre or some other package then you may find emacs&#x27; own regexps are clumsy when doing interactive regexp replace, because you have to escape some of the most frequent constructs like \(...\) and \|.
 This snippet reverses the semantics for these when using M-x query-replace-regexp, so that you can simply type ( ) for capture and | for alternation and use \( etc. for matching an actual paren which is needed less often:
 (defun my-perform-replace (origfun &amp;rest args) (apply origfun (if (eq this-command &#x27;query-replace-regexp) ;; do conversion only for regexp replace (cons (let ((s (car args)) (placeholder (format &quot;@placeholder%s@&quot; (int-to-string (buffer-modified-tick))))) (dolist (char &#x27;(&quot;|&quot; &quot;(&quot; &quot;)&quot;)) (setq s (replace-regexp-in-string placeholder char (replace-regexp-in-string char (concat &quot;\\\\&quot; char) (replace-regexp-in-string (concat &quot;\\\\&quot; char) placeholder s))))) s) (cdr args)) args))) (advice-add &#x27;perform-replace :around &#x27;my-perform-replace)

                    <span>Hi all, 
 I use emacs mostly for academic writing. As a beginner, I thoroughly enjoy org-mode. However, for practical reasons (journal submission, co-authoring, etc.), I need to create a word document (.docx) more often than I thought. I&#x27;ve used pandoc to convert .tex to .docx, which I am more or less satisfied with. 
 I wonder if anyone has a nice workflow for academic writing, which often needs to end up with a word document. For example, if a bibliography is included, which, markdown or org-mode, gives you a better experience? Or are there other options? Any suggestion will be welcome!

                    <span>So I am interested in creating a &quot;filtered&quot; switch-to-buffer function. I was looking into the read-buffer function as its 4th argument PREDICATE mentions
  
Optional arg PREDICATE, if non-nil, is a function limiting the buffers that 
 can be considered. It will be called with each potential candidate, in 
 the form of either a string or a cons cell whose car is a string, and 
 should return non-nil to accept the candidate for completion, nil otherwise.
  
To my understanding, the predicate function needs to take one input argument which is a string or cons cell and when read-buffer is called it will pass every open buffer to the function and will only output those buffers that returned a non-nil value. At least this is what I understand from the docstring. 
 However, in practice, how exactly would you call read-buffer with this function as its 4th argument. I couldn&#x27;t find any info online about it so I was wondering if this community had any clue how it works.

The snippet box shows the name of the function along with (6 overloads) at the end of the line, however I am not sure how to access those overloads or select them, neither have I been able to find any documentation on this.

                    <span>I am writing a code in Haskell, and I was wondering if we can put a where statement (pattern matching) after a return statement in a do block? I tried doing this however it seems like my code is having trouble reading comments after doing so, so I am thinking that it might be confusing the comments as being part of the do block or a similar such error?

                    <span>Hello r/hashkell !
 I&#x27;m working on a programming assignment where I&#x27;m asked to speed up a BFS type algorithm (a N-puzzle solver to be specific) with parallelism. I&#x27;ve tried using parMap to evaluate the next the potential moves and their costs in parallel. But this has only made my program slower. Is there something wrong with my approach?
 I&#x27;d also like to run the actual path finding recursion with all candidates (or the best two) at the same time but I&#x27;ve heard this isn&#x27;t really possible due to the function returning an IO(). Is there anything I can do to make this part of the program go faster?
 Ideally I want something like this:
 for each state in possible_future_states: new thread(target&#x3D;BFS, args&#x3D;variables updated with this state being chosen) 
 Thank you for reading this. Any advice is greatly appreciated.
 ​

 This is my current attempt

                    <span>I&#x27;m trying to run mstksg&#x27;s AOC template, but I&#x27;m guessing this is a generic issue. When I &#x60;cabal run&#x60; the executable, I get errors like:
  : error: Warning: Couldn&#x27;t figure out LLVM version! Make sure you have installed LLVM between [9 and 13) ghc: could not execute: opt 
 I thought I&#x27;d solved this by (following some instructions at the bottom of this link) installing LLVM using homebrew and adding &#x60;/usr/local/opt/llvm/bin&#x60; to my path; in fact, I even seem to have one repo where it&#x27;s working and another where it isn&#x27;t, and I have absolutely no clue why. Can anyone offer any suggestions, or suggest other forums to ask?
 I note that opt is definitely in the path:  % which opt /opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/bin/opt

                    <span>Hello everyone, I have been learning about ZIO over the weekend and with a lot of materials to learn, a lot more of questions came with it. To give you some context, I never professionally worked with Scala so I have a lot of assumptions which certainly aren&#x27;t applicable.
 My first question would be about Tagless Final and ZIO. Because ZIO embeds its own Error type as ZIO[R, E, A], if using ZIO as a Tagless Final, it becomes possible to abstract and hide away one layer or Errors. So I have been trying to separate System errors from Business errors in the sake of having a Domain layer curated of error handling for the System errors.
 System error would be, what I qualify as lower level and environmental errors, as network connection drop, remote service being unreachable, etc. Business erro…</span>

                    <span>I have decided to spice up my holiday coding session consisting of nigths between 22/12-07/01 by swapping VIM for Emacs, so I have a couple questions.
 Premise for the setup; I&#x27;ll start from vanilla Emacs and I aim to have a minimal set of packages enabling me to write some C/C++ with completion (lsp and/or deep stuff not necessary) and a nice (simple) way to browse project related files.
 Questions:
  
What packages do you recommend and why?
 Configuration recommendations/snippets?
 Keybindings you can&#x27;t live without?
 Suggestions on good/must reads on the topic?
  
I&#x27;ve set up a repo containing some initial configuration which you can find here: https://codeberg.org/0xedd1e/dotfiles
 So far I&#x27;ve found Emacs to be really interesting and the package management seems superb (and easy). I also want to mention that I will not install evil-mode, at least not during this period.
 Ps. Not interested in an Emacs dist, I like keeping stuff clean and understandable.

                    <span>I have an org capture that sets a scheduled (right now) as well as a deadline (some other day) an captured TODO items. Unfortunately, an my agenda there isn&#x27;t a difference for whether it&#x27;s displaying the fact that I scheduled it today, or the fact that the deadline is today. Any recommendations on this? Is there a face or a function or a customization that I&#x27;ve missed here?

                    <span>Hello there,
 I am using the vscode css-language-server binary with eglot, and it&#x27;s working great in css files, but when I open up sass files, it does not work with the current sass syntax that does not have braces or semi-colons. When I type the css-ls auto-completion does not work correctly, and syntax errors get thrown even though the syntax is correct and sass code compiles fine without any errors.
 Any tips on how to fix this issue?
 I&#x27;m guessing that sass-mode needs to get installed and configured with css-ls/eglot in use-package(my setup)?
 Thanks in advance for the help

                    <span>I am trying to make the most of the excellent modus-themes (which are rather awe-inspiring in the rigor and attention to detail that as gone into them), but the more I investigate the more I realize I don&#x27;t understand how to use themes or even the basics of how emacs handles colors and faces, much less themes.
 It started when I realized that Info-mode was presenting links with an illegibly bright cyan, which I realized was #00ffff. This is despite the fact that modus-themes supports info-mode, defines a cyan which is not that color, and I have no other theme loaded.
 So why was info-mode using the &quot;wrong&quot; cyan? Or do I need to take special steps to configure modus-themes to apply to info-mode?
 For that matter, how come I can&#x27;t see modus-theme&#x27;s cyan anywhere in the list shown by list-colors-display? And where do the other named and defined colors on that list come from?
 How do I even get the color of the character at point?
 I realize these are basic questions but I&#x27;d appreciate any pointers on how to understand this are better.

                    <span>Since some folks requested it, I&#x27;ve done the bit of housekeeping required to get gh-notify available on MELPA: https://melpa.org/#/gh-notify
 If you use Magit/Forge quite a bit, you might find it useful. TL;DR: gh-notify lets you manage your GitHub notifications in a more efficient way, especially if you routinely receive large amounts of notifications.

                    <span>So i tried to write a program with a gui and decided to use gloss to render it. But when i try to import the module, Graphics.Gloss it says it&#x27;s not found. So then i tried to cabal install gloss but it outputs the following error message:
 cabal: Missing dependency on a foreign library: * Missing (or bad) C library: GL This problem can usually be solved by installing the system package that provides this library (you may need the &quot;-dev&quot; version). If the library is already installed but in a non-standard location then you can use the flags --extra-include-dirs&#x3D; and --extra-lib-dirs&#x3D; to specify where it is.If the library file does exist, it may contain errors that are caught by the C compiler at the preprocessing stage. In this case you can re-run configure with the verbosity flag -v3 to see the error messages. cabal: Failed to build OpenGLRaw-3.3.4.1 (which is required by gloss-1.13.2.1). See the build log above for details. 
 So naturally i tried to install the library with cabal, OpenGlRaw but that gave the same error message except the gloss part. I tried to find information about this library but couldn&#x27;t find anything useful for me, I am using nixos but the error appears on a secondary computer with fedora as well. I have opengl installed through my NixOS configuration and i have tried several c compilers or other openGL packages. This may not have to do with haskell but i assume i will get just as much help here as on r/NixOS 
 I am glad for anyone taking their time to help me.

 process.stdin.on(&#x27;data&#x27;, function (data) {
 let n &#x3D; parseInt(data, 10)
 let arr &#x3D; Array.from({ length: n }, (_, i) &#x3D;&gt; i + 1)

 arr &#x3D; arr.filter((e, i) &#x3D;&gt; i % 2 &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; 0)
 else if (order &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; 2) {
 arr &#x3D; arr.filter((e, i) &#x3D;&gt; i % 2 !&#x3D;&#x3D; 0)
 } else if (order &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; 3) {
 arr &#x3D; arr.filter((e, i) &#x3D;&gt; (i + 1) % 3 !&#x3D;&#x3D; 0)
 }
 order &#x3D; (order + 1) % 3

 console.log(arr[0])

 I was wondering if someone could show me an example of same code idea in Haskell?

                    <span>Hello guys! I was wondering if a physical mini keyboard exists that is suitable for using with Termux and org mode (I use doom emacs on Termux). What I have in mind is something that would look like the old school PDAs or this new Gemini PDA device. It would be great to be able to physically mount thid keyboard to the phone to mimic the clamshell form factor of a PDA and get a fully mobile emacs and org mode experience. Any thoughts are appreciated.

                    <span>Very new to emacs world here, trying to migrate from vim. I work on windows now (unfortunatly) and so far working with spacemacs has been far easier to get up and going than trying to configure vim on windows.
 unfortunatly spacemacs does not have support for angular in their layers utility. When setting up python lsp I just added the python layer in the config file then set a hook to start lsp-mode when in python mode. 
 I found ng2-mode in this github repo and a minimal layer setup for it in another random repo here.
 I added and angular folder to the layers directory and added it into the loaded layers in .spacemacs config file. 
 ng2-mode seems to load and run just fine. But LSP never starts, I dont get an lsp-log file buffer like I do when i open a python file.

                    <span>tl;dr use Emacs to write scientific LaTeX, want good non-obtrusive grammar-checker. Anyone who use Emacs for LaTeX frequently have any experience?
 I use Emacs for writing scientific texts in LaTeX, and so a spell checker/grammar checker is obviously important. I have yet to find a solution that I am happy with, so I would like to hear if anyone has some good suggestions.
 I have earlier used flyspell, but it falls short compared to Grammarly, LanguageTool and Trinka, as it only corrects words, and has no &quot;contextual&quot; understanding.
 I have tested lsp-ltex, which worded quite well, but I found it way too intrusive. Sure, I could probably have gotten it to work if i tinkered enough, but I feel like something so essential as a spell checker should be simple. For reference, below are two other threads related to this, but I did not find the answers there satisfactory; in particular I feel like many of the solutions are made for pure programming languages, and then bodged together to work with LaTeX.

                    <span>Hi! 
 I&#x27;m a regular Emacs user, testing the version 28 for some months ago (right now in 28.0.90). 
 Looking at the git repo and the devel mailing list, I was wondering if there are criteria/policies/requirements to declare a branch stable enough to be released. 
 The nearest example is, of course, Emacs 28, but I don&#x27;t know if there are some guidelines for any future release (28.2, 29, etc). 
 Thanks.

                    <span>Hello everyone!
 Title says it. Looking for a keyboard with relatively small space bar / more space for modifiers which can be pressed with thumbs.
 On my keyboard now with left thumb i can press comfortably first closest to space bar modifier, somewhat comfortably second closest to space modifier; with right thumb even first closest to space modifier is not comfortable.
 Priorities
 - portable
 - reasonably priced
 Usage - programming / typing
 OS - windows / android
 ​
 Options i am considering:
 - JIS (japanese) layout keyboard
 - ?remapping trackpad mouse buttons on thinkpad keyboard?

I tried with some images I found on the internet and it worked, I tried to create my own using canva.com and it didn&#x27;t work (both svg). It looks like a svg problem to me, when I open and view the code of these svg&#x27;s the one I created and exported has a slightly strange ending. Do you know where there is a good place to create these images with the &quot;real svg&quot;?

                    <span>Hi, I&#x27;m trying to figure what is done to figure out the searched symbol name when xref-find-definitions is called.
 The problem is the following. When I&#x27;m in org mode and in elisp source code block I try to use xref-find-definitions when my cursor is located on a string &quot;;; &#x60;own-variable&#x27;&quot;. Then emacs says &quot;no definitions found for &quot;own-variable&#x27;&quot;. So it somehow falsely thinks that the final single quote is also part of a symbol name. How do I find what is being used to decide what&#x27;s the searched symbol name?
 I tried profiling, and debug-on-entry for xref-find-definitions but that seems to be too late. The symbol name is already been made.
 I have an impression that Org mode uses &quot;pcomplete-completions-at-point&quot; for this completion but I did not manage to use debug-on-entry for that. I found the pcomplete-completions-at-point function by evaluating &quot;completion-at-point-functions&quot; in the buffer.
 Any tips would be welcome.
 EDIT: I&#x27;m able to jump to the definition with the following combination: M-x find-variable RET RET.

                    <span>I am using Emacs 28.0.90 and lsp-mode for Go. Most things are working, but packages imported from a github URL are not being found. For example, in the following code there is no trouble finding things from the fmt, os, or time packages, but I get complaints about the other three packages. 
 import ( &quot;fmt&quot; &quot;os&quot; &quot;time&quot; &quot;github.com/cilium/ebpf&quot; &quot;github.com/urfave/cli/v2&quot; &quot;spacelaser.net/zpr/pkg/snet/cfg&quot; ) 
 The error I get is &quot;could not import github.com/cilium/ebpf (no package for import github.com/cilium/ebpf&quot;. I have the variable lsp-go-library-directories-include-go-modules set to t and the directory $GOPATH/pkg/mod/github.com/cilium/ebpf@v0.7.0 exists and has the correct code in it. What am I missing to make LSP pick up these libraries?

                    <span>When checking the type for elem, my expectation was:
 (Eq a) &#x3D;&gt; a -&gt; [a] -&gt; Bool 
 But terminal gave me this:
 elem :: (Foldable t, Eq a) &#x3D;&gt; a -&gt; t a -&gt; Bool 
 I have just started learning Haskell. My best guess is that foldable is a protocol/typeclass to represent a generic container as opposed to a list []. But is there a better explanation?
 edit: Thanks everyone for your responses.

                    <span>Running the following with stack script --resolver&#x3D;ghc-9.0.1 works, but running with stack script --resolver&#x3D;ghc-9.2.1 results in a stack overflow. Oddly, it works on ghc-9.2.1 compiling with -O2 but hangs when compiling with -O0.
 This behavior is surprising to me because, to my understanding, UndecidableSuperClasses carries the risk of infinite loops when type-checking, but at compile-time, it should concretize m and FooM m and the constraints should be erased. Is this not what happens? And did anything change in GHC 9.2 regarding UndecidableSuperClasses?
 I&#x27;ve also dumped out -ddump-tc for both -O2 and -O0, but I don&#x27;t see any meaningful differences.
 Repro:
 {-# LANGUAGE FlexibleContexts #-} {-# LANGUAGE GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving #-} {-# LANGUAGE TypeFamilies #-} {-# LANGUAGE UndecidableSuperClasses #-} import Data.Kind (Type) class (Monad m, MonadFoo (FooM m)) &#x3D;&gt; MonadFoo m where type FooM m :: Type -&gt; Type runFoo :: FooM m a -&gt; m a newtype MyMonad m a &#x3D; MyMonad { runMyMonad :: m a } deriving (Functor, Applicative, Monad) instance Monad m &#x3D;&gt; MonadFoo (MyMonad m) where type FooM (MyMonad m) &#x3D; MyMonad m runFoo &#x3D; id main :: IO () main &#x3D; runMyMonad foo foo :: MonadFoo m &#x3D;&gt; m () foo &#x3D; runFoo $ return () 
 Update: It seems reproducible with even main &#x3D; runMyMonad $ runFoo $ return ()

                    <span>I can&#x27;t figure this out...
 I use a basic org-capture template:
 (setq 
 org-capture-templates
 \(&#x60;
 (&quot;t&quot; &quot;Task&quot; entry (file &quot;~/.config/emacs/journal/tasks.org&quot;)
 &quot;* TODO %?\n\n %U\n %a\n %i&quot; :empty-lines 1)
 (&quot;i&quot; &quot;Idea&quot; entry (file &quot;~/.config/emacs/journal/ideas.org&quot;)
 &quot;* IDEA %?\n\n %U\n %a\n %i&quot; :empty-lines 1)
 (&quot;j&quot; &quot;Journal&quot; entry (file+datetree &quot;~/.config/emacs/journal/journal.org&quot;)
 &quot;* %?\n %i\n&quot;)
 )
 )
 When I start the capture and select &#x27;j&#x27; to create a Journal entry, my first line has 7 stars. This causes the entry to start too far to the right and it looks weird. I can&#x27;t figure out why so many stars? Instead of 7, I expect maybe 4 stars:
 * Year
 ** Year-Month
 *** Year-Month-Day
 **** new journal entry goes here
 In an effort to learn elisp and try to fix the problem, I tried to modify org-datetree.el in the ~/.emacs/elpa/org-9.5.1 directory and recompile via emacs-lisp-recompile function after visiting the file. My modifications change the output (I removed tabs for example), but then it removes all of the dates! I don&#x27;t want to mess too much with the el file as my configuration is getting to a nice stable state.
 Any ideas why so many stars? Thanks in advance for looking at this!

                    <span>Is ther anyway to export existing anki cards to org-mode?
 I have found some github projects that deals with creating cards with org-mode, but not the other way arround.
 I eventually would like to convert notes (org files) to anki cards, but to be able to do that I first have to export my existing anki cards to org-mode.

I have nearly 4 years of experience, in those 4 years, I have 2 years of FP Scala experience. I&#x27;m a contractor, working fully remote, and currently getting 300EUR per day.

                    <span>Hi! This is my first time posting on this subreddit. 
 I am currently an intern at a bank that&#x27;s using Java and Spring for almost all of its backend services. My mentor tasked me to explore the basics of Scala for backend services so I&#x27;m here to ask for recommendations how one would build backend services as I&#x27;ve read around Scala doesn&#x27;t depend as much on frameworks as Java does. 
 I&#x27;ve read on some &#x27;frameworks&#x27; for Scala such as Play and Http4s, but the resources on those are quite scarce, and I&#x27;ve tried Http4s but I can&#x27;t get my head to wrap around dependency management using sbt.
 Are there any recommendations you would give me for learning?
 Thank you for your help!

                    <span>I&#x27;m trying to construct a 3 column dataframe where each column is an existing ListBuffer I have: var list1&#x3D; new ListBuffer[Int]() var list2&#x3D; new ListBuffer[String]() var list3&#x3D; new ListBuffer[String]() Next I run some ‏‏‎ logic to append items to each of the lists, so let&#x27;s assume they&#x27;re populated and all of equal length. Then I do: var new_df &#x3D; list1.toDF(&quot;list1_column&quot;) and I was thinking I could just use withColumn to add the other 2 lists as additional columns, one by one. But it&#x27;s saying: &quot;Type mismatch: expected Column. actual: ListBuffer[String]&quot; What should I do? Thanks so much! Have a great day!

Episode 60: Haskell: purely functional and statically typed programming language by Tomasz Nurkiewicz
Haskell takes these characteristics to the extreme. For example, doing any input/output is considered impure from a functional programming point of view.
Game rules with a Free Monad DSL by Rogan Murley
This post is about how and why my multiplayer card game GALGA uses a Free Monad DSL for its game rules. If that’s gobbledygook to you, read on and hopefully it’ll make at least a little more sense by the end!

                    <span>Is there a convention for user defined keybinding prefix? Based on this elisp manual I thought C-c was supposed to be that. While those are safe in lisp-mode, they are not in other major modes (org-mode, python-mode, go-mode...) that override the keybinds.
 Where do you map all your extra commands to so you don&#x27;t constantly fight with major-modes?
 EDIT: People pointed out that C-c LETTER is being saved for the user, which I misunderstood as it included other symbols as well. Thanks everyone.

Also create a link *back* to the item I linked from?
 Do a search on a headline for all items that link to it?
  
Thanks!

                    <span>Hey folks. I&#x27;m getting a new dev vm set up at a new job that requires jumping through some socks-proxy shaped hoops. So far, everything seems to be working either via the https_proxy env, ProxyCommand for git/ssh, or manually setting the proxy in Firefox. However, Emacs, when talking to any of the package repos, be they melpa, elpa, or gnu, always immediately errors with &quot;incomprehensible buffer&quot;. I haven&#x27;t found anything that makes any difference. I&#x27;d love to hear any ideas y&#x27;all have. TIA!

                    <span>I have been a happy Gnus user for years. Recently, though, it was persuasively brought to my attention that threads are fundamental to how emails work, so I have introduced some redundancy to my system in order to make the threads work. Now I find myself conflicted about how to resolve these three constraints:
  
Make &quot;sent&quot; messages visible anywhere, as sometimes I use a different computer at a different location. For this, I&#x27;ve made an email account which has the sole purpose of receiving BCC of all emails I send, and so I subscribe to this SENT inbox to get those messages.
 
I use the GCC field to store a local version of my email upon sending, which has the advantage of storing the BCC recipients that are omitted from my SENT emails (especially useful when I send an &quot;undisclosed recipients&quot; email).
 
I wish to see things in both my Sent folder and in-thread in my usual inbox location. This is working except that I end up with duplicates of message I&#x27;ve sent. I expect one in my sent folder and another in my inbox, but I am receiving two in my inbox, and (gnus-summary-ignore-duplicates t) doesn&#x27;t seem to make any noticeable difference, even though one of the messages I end up with in my inbox states &quot;this is a duplicate&quot;.
 Any improvements or alternatives that meet the needs of synchronizing mail across machines, maintaining a &quot;sent&quot; box, and allowing email threading in my inbox?

                    <span>I am working with lsp and company and found a very annoying feature that i would like to disable, when there is only one thing that can be suggested it is displayed like the image below, basically the word or symbol is &quot;auto completed&quot; on its own if i press tab if it is only a single suggestion. The problem is when i type too fast, for some reason this auto complete lags behind and actually affects the characters i input. So if i start typing sudo like below, if i am fast enough it will end up ignoring some of my input characters and i end up with suo or sdo sometimes. This placeholder is nice, to see but i dont want it to affect my actual keyboard input because it is slower than my type speed.

 EDIT: The issue did not seem to be related to the tooltip, nonetheless the answers below offer a perfectly good solution to replacing the tooltip with either nothing or the default company auto complete box (with only one suggestion). The problem was for some reason related to only typing the character &quot;t&quot; (for some reason) and the binding to (tab) i used to trigger auto complete in addition to enter (). 
 (define-key company-active-map (kbd &quot;tab&quot;) #&#x27;company-complete-selection) 
 This above was causing the character &quot;t&quot;, when typed in the buffer while company was filtering, to somehow lose focus from the buffer and stop typing in it.
 (define-key company-active-map [tab] #&#x27;company-complete-selection) 
 This however works fine, and tab also does what it is supposed to be doing - completing the marked suggestion.

                    <span>For the last few months I&#x27;ve been taking the source from the GH mirror and building my own Emacs. I figured it was time for an update, but these time I get errors running make. I upgraded to Fedora 35 yesterday just in case but still, same problem. A bunch of the compilation errors refer to the same structs/data types so I grabbed a sample of one of each (but maybe I missed one &quot;type&quot;):
 In file included from /usr/include/X11/Xlib.h:44, from xwidget.h:35, from window.c:41: /usr/include/X11/X.h:96:13: error: conflicting types for ‘Window’; have ‘XID’ {aka ‘long unsigned int’} 96 | typedef XID Window; | ^~~~~~ -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- In file included from xwidget.h:35, from window.c:41: /usr/include/X11/Xlib.h:433:3: error: conflicting types for ‘XRectangle’; have ‘struct ’ 433 | } XRectangle; | ^~~~~~~~~~ -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- In file included from xwidget.h:35, from window.c:41: /usr/include/X11/Xlib.h:487:26: error: conflicting types for ‘Display’; have ‘struct _XDisplay’ 487 | typedef struct _XDisplay Display; | ^~~~~~~ -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- In file included from xwidget.h:35, from dispnew.c:43: /usr/include/X11/Xlib.h:1067:3: error: conflicting types for ‘XChar2b’; have ‘struct ’ 1067 | } XChar2b; | ^~~~~~~ -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- In file included from xwidget.h:36, from emacsgtkfixed.c:30: xterm.h:1174:1: error: conflicting types for ‘x_display_pixel_width’; have ‘int(struct x_display_info *)’ 1174 | x_display_pixel_width (struct x_display_info *dpyinfo) | ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

                    <span>I&#x27;m not sure why but suddenly when I open projects with projectile it is also including the millions of files inside the .git dir within the project. This clutters up the list of the actual files I want to work on. I&#x27;m not sure exactly what change I made to cause this (it was not a change with my emacs config, but I have been messing around with my git config recently). Is there a way to get projectile to ignore .git dirs recursively, and globally?

                    <span>Hey all, my question relates to what is the best approach to add some customization in a package&#x27;s implementation. For example, the code block below I have added some lines to the initial implementation but, I am not sure, wether this is practical since some updates later will ament the code added in the file. 
 I hope I am clear, but to add some clarification, while I am adding/editing the code in the package&#x27;s implementation found in the installation, would there be a more efficient way to call this instead of editing the file here. 
 Example below -commented lines are the ones I have added in the original file- after updating the package they will be lost
 (defun sclang-switch-to-workspace () (interactive) (let ((buffer (get-buffer sclang-workspace-buffer))) (unless buffer (setq buffer (get-buffer-create sclang-workspace-buffer)) (with-current-buffer buffer (sclang-mode) (let ((map (make-sparse-keymap))) (set-keymap-parent map sclang-mode-map) (sclang-fill-workspace-mode-map map) (use-local-map map)) (let ((line (concat &quot;// &quot; (make-string 69 ?&#x3D;) &quot;\n&quot;))) (insert line) (insert &quot;// SuperCollider Workspace \n&quot;) ;; (insert &quot;// &quot; (current-time-string) &quot;\n&quot;) ;; (insert &quot;// Ready to do thy Biding Master &quot; (user-login-name) &quot;\n&quot;) ;; (insert line) (insert &quot;// using HTML Help: C-c C-h as usual, then switch to w3m buffer\n&quot;) (insert &quot;// and do M-x sclang-minor-mode in order te enable sclang code execution\n&quot;) (insert line) (insert &quot;\n&quot;)) (set-buffer-modified-p nil) cwd to sclang-runtime-directory (if (and sclang-runtime-directory (file-directory-p sclang-runtime-directory)) (setq default-directory sclang-runtime-directory)))) (switch-to-buffer buffer)))

                    <span>Forgive the title, but I&#x27;m going crazy here. I have spent 14 hours trying to get this to work and no luck.
 The issue is back-links won&#x27;t show up in my org-roam buffer.
 This is my config:
 (require &#x27;package) (add-to-list &#x27;package-archives &#x27;(&quot;melpa&quot; . &quot;http://melpa.org/packages/&quot;) t) (add-to-list &#x27;package-archives &#x27;(&quot;org&quot; . &quot;https://orgmode.org/elpa/&quot;) t) (setq org-roam-directory (file-truename &quot;~/org-roam&quot;)) (setq org-roam-v2-ack t) (require &#x27;org-roam) (org-roam-setup) 
 I have installed org-roam, and org-roam--sqlite-available-p is set to t.
 I created the nodes with org-roam-node-insert and can follow the links just fine with org-open-at-point.
 You can see my org-roam folder here (and my config file is in there too).
 https://github.com/thread314/org-roam-troubleshoot
 I&#x27;ve deleted my .emacs.d folder and run emacs -Q, same result. I&#x27;ve even tried it on a completely fresh virtual machine, backlinks still won&#x27;t show up.
 I am running Emacs 27.2, Org 9.4.4 and Org-Roam 2.1.0.
 I have tried asking for help on the org-roam discourse and on the org-roam slack, no luck with either.
 I must be doing something wrong, but I just can&#x27;t figure out what. Can anyone help?
 I&#x27;d be happy to make a donation of $200 AUD to a charity of your choosing if you can help me with this (if that helps sweeten the pot).

                    <span>For example, if I run M-x shell it opens a new buffer instead of changing the current buffer. The older version of emacs I used didn&#x27;t do that.

                    <span>Given a set of coins and an amount, find the minimum number of coins needed to make up the amount.
 Note: a coin with a unit value is always assumed to exist in the given set of coins.
 Examples:
  
 Coins Amount min. no. of coins 
  
 {1,5,10,25} 1 1 
  {1,5,10,25} 4 4 
  {1,5,10,25} 5 1 
  {1,5,10,25} 6 2 
  {1,5,10,21,25} 63 3 
 
  
Say we are given a set of coins Cs &#x3D; {1,5,10,21,25} and we want to find the minimum number of coins needed to make up 63, then the algorithm below essentially translates to the following:
  answer &#x3D; min_coins(Cs, 63) &#x3D; minimum ( min_coins(Cs, 62) + 1, min_coins(Cs, 58) + 1, min_coins(Cs, 53) + 1, min_coins(Cs, 42) + 1, min_coins(Cs, 38) + 1 ) 
 A direct haskell implementation of the above strategy is:

                    <span>I&#x27;d like to use MonadUnliftIO in my monad transformer stack while serving a Servant API. For example:
 haskell newtype AppM a &#x3D; AppM { runAppM :: Handler } deriving ( Functor, Applicative, Monad, MonadIO, MonadUnliftIO -- This fails to compile ) 
 The problem is that Handler cannot derive MonadUnliftIO as it&#x27;s a newtype over ExceptT ServerError IO a, which does not have an instance for it.
 In order to get derive an instance, here&#x27;s a possible solution: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;haskell {-# LANGUAGE DataKinds #-} {-# LANGUAGE GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving #-} {-# LANGUAGE TypeOperators #-}
 module Lib where

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been going through the University of Finland MOOC course on haskell, and this example popped up:
 ​
 someLetters :: Gen String someLetters &#x3D; do c  sample someLetters &quot;yyyyyyyy&quot; &quot;zzzzzzzzz&quot; &quot;xxxxxxxxx&quot; &quot;yyyyyyy&quot; &quot;yyy&quot; &quot;ww&quot; &quot;xxxxxx&quot; &quot;yyy&quot; &quot;yyyyyyy&quot; &quot;xxxxxxxxxx&quot; &quot;y&quot; 
 My question is how is this &#x27;someletters&#x27; fn a pure fn? It will always return a List of strings, but the strings will always be different. If it was modified to pass in a starting string, it would still produce a list of random length strings, so the even if the parameter is the same, the results will be different almost all of the time.
 Or is it not a pure fn, and is it then fairly easy to write non-pure functions in Haskell?
 TIA

                    <span>I have the following piece of code that executes just fine. Hower Hlint reports an error on the last line around x /&#x3D; y
 Hlint Error: Parse error: on input &#x60;]&#x27;
 grid :: Int -&gt; Int -&gt; [(Int, Int)] grid n m &#x3D; [(x, y) | x  [(Int, Int)] square n &#x3D; [(x, y) | (x, y) &lt;- grid n n, x /&#x3D; y] 
 What&#x27;s the issue here or is it just a bug in Hlint?

                    <span>Is there a way to specify a particular mode to use for the cells or columns of a table? Something like the #+BEGIN_SRC/#+END_SRC trick.

                    <span>I have an Org document, with two source blocks containing YAML:
 #+BEGIN_SRC yaml :tangle actual.yaml - foo: - spam - eggs #+END_SRC #+BEGIN_SRC yaml :tangle actual.yaml - bacon: - spam - spam - baked beans #+END_SRC 
 When I tangle, I want this output:
 - foo: - spam - eggs - bacon: - spam - spam - baked beans 
 But what I get is this; the second block is dedented, which produces broken output:
 - foo: - spam - eggs - bacon: - spam - spam - baked beans 
 Is there some way to get Org to preserve whitespace in source blocks?

                    <span>Hello everyone,
 I am looking to solve the following problem. I am using org-agenda to view items marked as TODO. This presents a list. The list is long and it&#x27;s a bit difficult to scan. Ideally, I would like to have an interface where only the first item would load, I would hit &quot;n&quot; and then the next and the next and so on until there are no items left.
 Is this possible to do? What are the steps to take to achieve this?
 Thanks very much!
 I am running Spacemacs (0.200.13@27.2)

                    <span>Hi all, I am in a dilemma. I have switched to a new job, now in my previous role I was working as a data engineer (scala and spark) and in the new role they want to put me in a team which deals with data processing (scala, spark, Kafka, akka streams, samza) but there is another team which deals with rest api development (scala, akka http, grpc, cats). I can choose where I want to be but this is where I am not able to make a decision. They have also told me that in future if I feel like the type of work I am doing is not for me then I can ask for change. Just want your inputs.

So I changed it to &#x60;shell-command-to-string &quot;chatty&quot;&#x60; and it gives me an output of &#x60;/bin/sh: line 1: chatty: command not found&#x60; but running &#x60;chatty&#x60; in my terminal launches the app just fine. 
 ​
 Is there something I can run that would launch programs on my system?

                    <span>So my emacs config is taking about ~20 sec to load which is really slow compared to the slowest load speed which I heard was around 5-7 sec? Just the previous day it loaded at about 4 sec. I haven&#x27;t really changed anything in my config since yesterday. What may have been the problem?

                    <span>Hi there! :)
 I wanted to share a package that I have developed. This package makes it possible to run, and interact, with shell commands that are run completely detached from Emacs. The name of the package comes from dtach, which is the program that makes this package possible. 
 As a user you start shell commands in dedicated sessions using dtache. Here is a list of some of the features that these sessions offer:
 - The user have access to all of the output from a session
 - The user gets a notification when a session has finished
 - Sessions are automatically labeled success or failure
 - Sessions can be started on remote hosts
 - The user can easily rerun a session
 - Sessions can be opened in a compile mode, which effectively makes it mimics M-x compile
 For a more thorough walk through of the package, and how to use it, you can watch this video which I have created: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;if1W58SrClk
 And the package itself you can find at https://gitlab.com/niklaseklund/dtache

                    <span>Hej fellow &#x27;macsers, and in particular, hej fellow hyperbole users,
 I recently started using Hyperbole as a knowledge base and must say I am quite satisfied. I have in as an org extension so I get the benefit of being able to hide/show contents while retaining the functionality of hyperbole/hyrolo (I believe, correct me if I&#x27;m wrong).
 However, there&#x27;s one thing that really annoys me, and I would like to know how to change that. Whenever I come out of a hyrolo-fgrep query, my hyrolo file is in read-only mode. Which means that I have to change out of it every time I made an edit. I C-s&#x27;ed through the Hyperbole manual but couldn&#x27;t find it mentioned anywhere.
 Since I am not yet very proficient with the inner workings of my kitchen-si *ahem* batteries-included computing environment I don&#x27;t even have a good idea on how to debug it. Thus, any more or less general considerations are also warmly welcomed!
 Have a good day, fellows :)

                    <span>I&#x27;ve got a slow program in Advent of Code. I&#x27;d like to profile it to see what&#x27;s slow.
 I&#x27;ve got each day&#x27;s program as a different executable in a single Cabal project. You can see the code on Gitlab.
 Cabal 3.6.2, GHC 9.2.1.
 My Cabal file looks like this:

                    <span>I feel like it is something stupid that I&#x27;m doing, but I just cannot figure it out on my own. I created a simple project with cabal and it created basic project structure. I added another module that I called Work.hs into the same app folder that the Main.hs is at. VS Code doesn&#x27;t show any errors but when I run it with ghcid I get this error:
 app/Main.hs:5:1: error: Could not find module ‘Work’ Use -v (or &#x60;:set -v&#x60; in ghci) to see a list of the files searched for. | 5 | import Work

                    <span>Hi, I am very new to haskell and recently I decided to read a book called Linear algebra 
 [Theory , Intuition, Code]. This book uses python+MATLAB as it&#x27;s language but I don&#x27;t like python that much and I don&#x27;t know matlab so I have been wondering are there any libraries that cover the linearalgebra funcitonality of numpy?

 However I don&#x27;t have much Haskell knowledge (done learn you a Haskell and working on Haskell from first principals) Every job seems to require several years of experience with Haskell
 Are there jobs that are more like work studies or internships for learning Haskell? Where I can restart as a complete beginner to get experience?

 If so, what are your practices, tips, and tricks?
 ​
 The manual on images seems to be very basic. 
 ​
 I use the org-download package by abo-abo (https://github.com/abo-abo/org-download) to drop images into a note. 
 ​
 Should I always prepare them beforehand to have a consistent look (e.g. to have the same width through all the notes)?

 I thought this might be interesting for you all.
 Generate an HTML version of your agenda and then make it a default landing page in your browser. Result: every time you create a new tab you get a peek at your updated agenda. 
 Keeps me slightly more organized.
 Here&#x27;s the repo (not in Melpa): https://github.com/dantecatalfamo/agenda-html
 I run it like so (in my config):
  (add-hook &#x27;org-after-todo-state-change-hook (lambda () (run-with-idle-timer 20 nil (lambda () (load-file &quot;/Users/trae/workspace/github/agenda-html/agenda-html.el&quot;)))))  and here&#x27;s is what my new tab looks like:

                    <span>Twice a year — in May and November, nixpkgs maintainers and
contributors get together to fix as many build failures as possible
for the new release. The event is, as per tradition, called Zero Hydra
Failures, or ZHF for short.
This year, me and fellow hacker cab404
had organized a hackathon to help the cause and spread the Nix love
around. The basic premise was, quoting cab404:
Go—go—go!
We wanted to fix as many builds as possible, right before the
branchoff. Fixing the broken builds would allow NixOS 21.11 to have a more complete package
set.
The main point of this post is to share the experience with people
looking to organize similar events.

Preparation
Due to the current lockdown in Moscow, we
weren’t able to decide whether the hackathon would happen at all until

                    <span>Hey, I&#x27;m trying to make counsel-fzf work on my windows setup and I can&#x27;t seem to manage. I&#x27;ve downloaded the fzf.exe binary and placed it in c:/emacs/bin and made that path available for emacs (both in exec-path and in the &quot;PATH&quot; variable). The command doesn&#x27;t do anything. It seems that it creates the process but there is no autocompletion list.
 Also, maybe related, when trying to run fzf from the *shell* it doesn&#x27;t provide the autocomplete list, even though it does so in windows cmd.
 Any toughts?

                    <span>For a while I&#x27;ve been lurking on the development of cell-mode [1], an Emacs mode created by David O&#x27;Toole. The blurb says:
  
Cell-mode is an object-oriented spreadsheet control for GNU Emacs. It provides a major mode for spreadsheet-based user interfaces; it can be further extended by defining application-specific Emacs Lisp minor modes which supply new cell and spreadsheet classes via Emacs’ included object system, EIEIO.
  
I decided to create this post because I am not sure how widely known this mode is, and I&#x27;d like to raise attention to it. Personally, I think it is an amazing idea - a magit or org-mode-like &quot;killer app&quot; for Emacs. It may sound like I&#x27;m exaggerating (and perhaps I am), but just off the top of my head I can think of a few really interesting use cases:
  
integrate it with org-mode as a table editor. You could edit the table in cell-mode and then see the ascii representation.
 integrate it with modes such as SQL mode and the like, so that you could visualise the table output as a cell-mode spreadsheet.
 as just a plain old spreadsheet. Most of my use cases for excel would probably go away with it plus Emacs lisp.
 easy CSV (etc) editing.
 derived modes (see mosaic [2] by the same author).
  
I&#x27;m sure many more use cases would quickly emerge by integrating it with other modes. If you use cell-mode or know of similar modes in this space do let me know on the comments.
 Disclaimer: I have no affiliation with David O&#x27;Toole or cell-mode development, just a regular Emacs user.

                    <span>Hi, I would like to replicate some of this behavior: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/goessner/mdmath/master/img/mdmath.gif
 The interesting part is seeing a representation of a latex equation as I&#x27;m typing them. Toggling the preview on and off is good in itself, but the live preview looks really, really nice. Is there a neat way to do this? I&#x27;m mostly interested in seeing equation live.

                    <span>I constantly open new emacs Frames and reposition relative to other applications (Ik, can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m not fully emacs yet), and found that manually repositioning the windows was a pain. Here&#x27;s a script and some keybindings I made to make that easier. These functions can also be called at startup to change how you want the initial emacs screen size to be.
 Explanation: It&#x27;s pretty simple, these functions just set the frame position, and size as portions of your initial starting screen size. 
 Hopefully, this helps someone, and any suggestions for improving code readability would be appreciated!

                    <span>One of my favorite parts of Org-mode is the customizable colored headers; personally, it makes me extremely motivated to work and makes Org-mode so much more beautiful. Here&#x27;s a quick script I made to make changing those colors easier, and hopefully, someone finds this helpful!
 ​
  
First, generate a palette you like from this color palette generator: https://coolors.co
 Copy the RGB color codes, separated by hyphens, from the url
 Paste it into the list in the same format as I have in the below code snippet
 Copy the code into your init file somewhere
  
Essentially, the code splits the string into a list of codes, then the face attributes set the org header colors to the corresponding list colors.
 I&#x27;d like to turn this into a package one day, but that&#x27;s a project for another time (or if someone wants to help me, I&#x27;d love to work with them). And finally, if anyone uses this, drop your color palettes below!
 ​
  (defun col-strip (col-str) (butlast (split-string (mapconcat (lambda (x) (concat &quot;#&quot; x &quot; &quot;)) (split-string col-str &quot;-&quot;) &quot;&quot;) &quot; &quot;))) (setq color-schemes (list (col-strip &quot;a21d1d-5497de-8e35b7-ffff5b-56cb7d-df5252-707efa&quot;) ; red blue purple study (col-strip &quot;2278bf-e15554-3bb273-507c6d-6e5775-598d91-7768ae&quot;) ; blue red green okay )) (setq pick-color 0) (setq color-theme (nth pick-color color-schemes)) (set-face-attribute &#x27;org-level-1 nil :height 1.3 :foreground (nth 0 color-theme)) (set-face-attribute &#x27;org-level-2 nil :height 1.2 :foreground (nth 1 color-theme)) (set-face-attribute &#x27;org-level-3 nil :height 1.1 :foreground (nth 2 color-theme)) (set-face-attribute &#x27;org-level-4 nil :height 1.05 :foreground (nth 3 color-theme)) (set-face-attribute &#x27;org-level-5 nil :foreground (nth 4 color-theme)) (set-face-attribute &#x27;org-level-6 nil :foreground (nth 5 color-theme))

                    <span>So, I started using Emacs yesterday, and it has been amazing! I am using the Doom Emacs distribution. I decided I am going to integrate Emacs in almost every part of my life, so I decided to switch to ORG mode from libreoffice. The switch wasn&#x27;t that easy but I did it. But now I need to know how to resize an image in Emacs, because sometimes I need to add images to my notes and documents. Thank you in advance

                    <span>Firstly doom emacs is great and God bless hlissner. But there&#x27;s one issue I&#x27;ve not yet been able to solve. 
 In doom emacs when the cursor is on a string, it highlights the entire string. But this really slows the app down and makes the editing process really annoying in the case of long strings. 
 Example
 In the above link, I am trying to edit a graphql schema which is a multi line string. And the entire string being highlighted every moment makes it really laggy and nearly impossible to edit. 
 So my question is how do I turn of this string highlighting feature in doom emacs? Thanks
 PS: I have googled for this but I couldn&#x27;t find te solution to this exact problem. Most of the solutions were to disable the hl-line mode which I don&#x27;t have a problem with.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve got all ESS packages installed via MELPA, I can enter R mode and run R commands, everything seems OK, except TAB completion for objects or parameters simply does not work (although it does perform indenting correction, which is one of the TAB features if a completion not detected). I have latest Emacs installed on Ubuntu 21.10, fresh install, no customization. Isn&#x27;t the latest ESS just supposed to work without any extra packages or configs? Is this a bug? Has the TAB completion been replaced by another command?

                    <span>I was reading a discussion about keyboards and decided that maybe this is something that would benefit others.
 I have been pressing Ctrl with my palm for years (just below left pinky). It only works with external keyboards, and it does not work very well for all Ctrl combinations (e.g. Ctrl-Z, Ctrl-X is at the limit of doable, in that case I use the right ctrl).
 but it has saved my pinky from being overworked
 (and yes, I tried dvorak, but I could not get used to emacs ctrl sequences no matter how much I tried... i was able to get to around 40-50 words a minute for text, but like 1 emacs command per minute --after 59 wrong commands).
 Aside from mapping CAPS lock to Ctrl, are there any other tricks people use with the typical keyboard?
 Edit: somebody mentioned that this is probably useful only for small sizes of hands. When fully extended my hands are 21cm from tip of thumb to tip of pinky.

                    <span>According to Transient documentation:
 &quot;The command can also be a closure or lambda expression, but that should only be used for dynamic transients whose suffixes are defined when the prefix command is invoked. See information about the :setup-children function&quot;
 So according to that I tried the following:
 (defun set-children (children) &#x27;((1 transient-suffix (:key &quot;o&quot; :command normal-func)) ;; OK (1 transient-suffix (:key &quot;k&quot; :description (lambda () &quot;All ok&quot;) :command (lambda (message &quot;hey&quot;)))))) (transient-define-prefix my-transient () [&quot;Description&quot; :setup-children set-children]) 
 I&#x27;m getting (wrong-type-argument (command symbol) (lambda nil &quot;hey&quot;))
 So it seems that it only accepts symbols
 Any ideas? thanks in advance

                    <span>I&#x27;ve often heard emacs described as a plaform to build editors, but aside from evil mode, I don&#x27;t know of any other radical rebuilds of the editing experience. While I like emacs, the keybindings are brutal to my old worn tendons. I know I can change them, but I lack the wherewithal to undertake a radical rebuild. I&#x27;m perfectly comfortable with vi but prefer something that&#x27;s not modal. Are there any other total redesigns of keybindings or editing I should look at?

I have an rss feed set up which I can attach to youtube subscriptions, but I&#x27;m at a total loss on how to play videos in VLC or something else from Emacs. I&#x27;ve tried the vlc package from melpa, I&#x27;ve fiddled around with the vlc.el file for hours, followed tutorials, and I got nothing to work right. Does anyone have any advice? If it&#x27;s relevant, I&#x27;m on Windows 10.

 This would be an online class - taught for 2 hours per day. Time of day and length of course to be determined. 
 This person will need to develop the class material without references to other programming languages or concepts. 
 Message me to discuss.
 Edit: 1. Time zone is one of the 4 US mainland time zones 2. Assumed knowledge would be high school and fluent English 3. Targeted toward Cardano smart contracts 4. Using whatever device they own (if there are device requirements that can be communicated to students prior to sign up) 5. Moneys is to be determined based off of length of class and number of students.

This centralizes the config in 1 place for all apps. Wanting to do the same with our Haskell linter, so hoping that hlint could do that. I don&#x27;t see that nor can I find examples of it.

                    <span>I have a project that (on @paf31&#x27;s advice, if I recall correctly) I had divided into a number of subprojects. I always run it in GHCI, and when I was using Stack I&#x27;m pretty sure I could rebuild incrementally. But then it stopped building in Stack, so I switched to Cabal, which only lets me rebuild incrementally for one subproject at a time -- if I make changes to another subproject, I have to quit and rerun cabal ghci. So suddenly compilation was taking a long time.
 I ducked the problem by just making it a monorepo again. But it made me wonder -- how hard would it be to make compiled code content-addressed, like Unison does?

                    <span>List comprehension is a very appealing feature in Haskell. It could support a form of non-deterministic computation. 
 For example,
  [[x,y] | x &lt;- [0..2], y &lt;- [10..12]] -- [[0,10],[0,11],[0,12], -- [1,10],[1,11],[1,12], -- [2,10],[2,11],[2,12]] 
 However, this construct is too static. I mean that these two generators (x &lt;- [0..2] and y &lt;- [0..2]) are solidified in the code. If the number of generators is unknown (e.g. List of generators as input), there is no way to use the List comprehension gracefully. 
 One way to solve the problem is using Traversable:
  sequenceA [[0..2], [10..12]] -- [[0,10],[0,11],[0,12], -- [1,10],[1,11],[1,12], -- [2,10],[2,11],[2,12]] 
 Now we have a List of generators. So far so good.
 The drawback of this approach is that it cannot handle the variables&#x27; references in a generator&#x27;s body.
 For example, 
  [[x,y] | x &lt;- [0..2], y &lt;- [10*x..10*x+2]] 
 We cannot represent [10*x..10*x+2] in sequenceA.
 Question:
 Is there any general way to do this job in Haskell? Maybe something like sequenceA, but can handle variables&#x27; references. Or do we have to write a small interpreter?
 Thanks
  
Edit:
 Some one possibly misunderstand my question.
 For example, if we just using List comprehension (or do-notation), how do we represent the following pattern in general way?
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; [[x1] | x1 &lt;- [0..2]]
 [[x1,x2] | x1 &lt;- [0..2], x2 &lt;- [10x1..10x1+2]]
 [[x1,x2,x3] | x1 &lt;- [0..2], x2 &lt;- [10x1..10x1+2], x3 &lt;- [100x2..100x2+2]]
 [[x1,x2,x3,x4] | x1 &lt;- [0..2], x2 &lt;- [10x1..10x1+2], x3 &lt;- [100x2..100x2+2], x4 &lt;- [1000x3..1000x3+2]]
 -- and so on &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 It could be solved by code generation and interpreter pattern, but I hope a better way. It would be nice if code can be seen as data (e.g. List).

                    <span>I&#x27;m hiring Haskell developers again, for the Core Strats team of Modeling and Analytics. The head of our group has given a talk at the Haskell Implementer&#x27;s Workshop last month where he described the team and what we do: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;A70SN7vFsKU
 ​
 Applications must go via these links:
 Warsaw: https://scb.taleo.net/careersection/ex/jobdetail.ftl?job&#x3D;128083
 London: https://scb.taleo.net/careersection/ex/jobdetail.ftl?job&#x3D;2100029752
 ​
 The Warsaw position is open to both contractors and direct employment, whereas the London one is only open for direct employment. Standard Chartered supports (practically fully) remote working, but only from the country of payroll (PL or UK in this case), and after an initial 3-month in-office period (where circumstances allow). We will cover visa and relocation costs for successful employment applicants.
 Note that the first step of the application is a Valued Behaviours Assessment and it is quite important: our team won&#x27;t be able to see your application until you pass this assessment.

 Cutting to the chase: I have a cabal project for Advent of Code, and would like to profile it. I am familiar with profiling single *.hs files, but I would like to be able to profile the entire project.
 What is the recommended best practice for doing this with cabal? I tried google, but it appears as though my googlefu need some work. My cabal file, as well as the rest of the project can be found here.
 If any more information is needed, please do let me know!

                    <span>Hi, 
 I&#x27;m currently writing up my PhD thesis using org-mode, and it is a joy in comparison to my past experiences writing raw LaTeX. 
 I&#x27;m simultaneously attempting to write up some of the thesis chapters in paper form for publication, and have been creating the papers by selectively #+INCLUDE -ing the thesis chapter .org files. I very much dislike the idea of maintaining the same text in multiple files (fix a typo or re-word something in one, will I remember to propagate those changes throughout?), however the text required for the papers needs to be somewhat more concise than what appears in the thesis. So far I have handled this by having org files containing the core text for a section, which appears in both the thesis and the paper, and another org file that expands on the core and appears in the thesis only. 
 This approach works well enough, but falls down when I want to interleave concise text and extended text. I could use the line number option for the include command to achieve this, however the text is changing too often for this to be practical. The natural conclusion seems to be to break things down even further, and to have separate org files per paragraph of text, and to construct larger documents out of these. 
 Does anyone here have any experience of something like this (maybe there are packages which could help?), or perhaps better ideas (i.e. am I being a lunatic)?
 Thanks!

                    <span>Hello! I am confused on how org-agenda-list is picking up an old file that doesn’t exist on my file system anymore, nor is it in org-agenda-files.
 The file it’s picking up is an old conflicted copy (by NextCloud sync) that I have since removed. It manages to show the old contents of that file so I assume it’s caches somewhere.
 Is my assumption correct? Is there a cache somewhere?
 I am using emacsclient and I have restarted it a couple of times with kill-emacs.
 What should I try next?

 // Want it to print &quot;Success&quot; def conversionParserImpl[T: Type](expr: Expr[T])(using Quotes): Expr[Unit] &#x3D; println(s&quot;Matching ${expr.show}&quot;) expr match case &#x27;{($a: Int) + ($b: Int)} &#x3D;&gt; println(&quot;Addition&quot;) conversionParserImpl(a) conversionParserImpl(b) case &#x27;{$a: Int} if a.value.isDefined &#x3D;&gt; println(s&quot;Literal: ${a.valueOrAbort}&quot;) case &#x27;{converter.apply($a)} &#x3D;&gt; println(&quot;Success&quot;) case _ &#x3D;&gt; println(&quot;Not matched&quot;) &#x27;{()} inline def conversionParser[T](inline expr: T) &#x3D; ${ conversionParserImpl(&#x27;expr) 
 But output is:
 Matching 1.+(Main$package.converter[scala.Int].apply(Wrapper.apply[scala.Int](2))) Addition Matching 1 Literal: 1 Matching Main$package.converter[scala.Int].apply(Wrapper.apply[scala.Int](2)) Not matched 
 If the converter is changed from generic to concrete Int, then the quoted code matches without any changes to the macro. Tried case &#x27;{converter[Int].apply($a)} in the generic case, doesn&#x27;t fix it.
 Thanks in advance for your help :)

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been trying to understand implicit for hours and read so many different articles. My head is all over the place, yet I really don&#x27;t get the main idea behind implicit. When do we need to use it, why do you use it, etc. if someone can explain to me as simple as possible, I would really appreciate!

                    <span>Hi All,
 I have been working in scala but only for writing spark jobs. Now from past few months, I have started learning FP in scala. I want to get into more depth. Any suggestions are welcome on how do I plan myself for it.
 Also, taking a Math course, will it benefit. If yes, please let me know any online courses for Maths. ( Ofcourse, FP is the hardest thing, but I want to get into it, slowly )
 ​
 Thanks in advance.

 (define-minor-mode my-keys-mode &quot;Minor mode with the keys I use.&quot; :global t :init-value t :keymap my-keys-mode-map) (defvar clipboard-mode-map (let ((map (make-sparse-keymap))) (define-key map (kbd &quot;C-s-v&quot;) &#x27;clipboard-yank) (define-key map (kbd &quot;C-s-c&quot;) &#x27;clipboard-kill-ring-save) map)) (define-minor-mode my-keys-mode &quot;Minor mode with clipboard keys&quot; :global t :init-value t :keymap clipboard-mode-map)

                    <span>Hi guys, emacs newbie here... I&#x27;ve been trying to get pdf-tools on windows, I keep on getting the same error when trying to build it with make -s.
 At this moment, I&#x27;d be happy if someone could share a link to prebuilt binaries for any of the recent versions of pdf-tools.
 I&#x27;ve tried with mysys and mingw, but I&#x27;m still getting errors: &#x60;&#x60; $ make -s Using Emacs 28.0 Importing package-keyring.gpg...

                    <span>Hello everyone!
 Currently when i want to reference webpage in note (org-mode) i simply put url as link, but this method is not future proof. (website/company can die, url change, etc)
 How do you save / archive web pages?
 Do you use bookmarking tools like wallabag, shiori, etc?
 Or do you simply save webpage as pdf, epub etc?

                    <span>Hello, I have prettier set to show errors when the format isn&#x27;t correct. But in Emacs it shows an additional (formatting?) string. I don&#x27;t know where I should report this to. In vscode and the terminal it shows just the Delete &#x27;;&#x27; part. Is this an ESlint or LSP error?

 I hope this makes sense
  
EDIT. In the meanwhile I removed eslint-plugin-prettier and installed prettier.el. I don&#x27;t really need linting hints showing up as errors as it gets fixed on save, so this is great

                    <span>Hi, I am trying to play around with semantic highlighting in lsp, and what i was trying to do is properly highlight usages of a function&#x27;s argument/parameter within a given scope (say, code block, function etc.), and not only at the declaration point. It seems that lsp does understand scopes, looking through the source i found out that faces such as lsp-face-highlight-write/read/textual - which do actually highlight the variable when i hover over it with the cursor. Now i am looking at doing the same but make it permanent, not only when you hover over the symbol. Trying to do that for both member variables and function argument variables. Lsp has lsp-face-semhl-member &amp; lsp-face-semhl-parameter which are only coloured at the point of declaration.
 In the example below, crude, but member variables are purple, while the ones passed as function arguments are underlined-pink. (The Styling is just a sample)

                    <span>Hi, 
 I&#x27;ve been using ghcup to manage and install ghc, stack, and cabal on my mac. Now I tried installing ghc on windows with Chocolatey and Haskell Platform. It installs version 9.2.1 by default with &#x60;choco install haskell-dev&#x60;. I need version 8.10.7 installed since some packages that I&#x27;m using are not yet supported under 9.2.1. What&#x27;s the recommended way to install 8.10.7. Is ghcup a viable alternative? I tried it and it seems not to have &quot;tui&quot; available on Windows for some reason.
 Thank you!

                    <span>I am trying to upgrade GHC from 8.10.7 to 9.X.X. I am very new to Cabal/Stack/GHC, but wanting to get into Haskell development after really enjoying LINQ and F# as a full time C# engineer.
 ​
 I have brew (3.3.7), stack (2.7.3), and Cabal (3.6.2) installed, and I thought something as simple as &quot;cabal update&quot; or &quot;brew update&quot; or &quot;stack update&quot; would somehow magically work.
 ​
 For context, I am used to archlinux where arch documentation, a simple pacman -Syu or grabbing from the AUR solves 99.98% of my problems. But I am relatively new to apple hardware for development.
 Thanks a ton, and I apologize for the ignorance.

I&#x27;ve heard a lot of good things about Functional Programming in Scala by Paul Chiusano and Rúnar Bjarnason, but I&#x27;ve also heard a lot of good things about Functional Programming, Simplified by Alvin Alexander. I was wondering if anyone had any opinions on either book, or if people would recommend one over the other or something like that. Any insight is appreciated!

                    <span>Greetings from Canada 🙂
I was using nvAlt and Simplenote together for about 10 years and recently migrated to my own app, Hyperdraft, which I consider a web remake of Notational Velocity; my app is not based on files, but it supports markdown and you can own your data.
I&#x27;m interested in the idea of &#x27;turning your text notes into a website&#x27; and have been cultivating a digital garden / personal wiki for about a year now, inspired by Andy Matuschak; in the same place as my private notes, I have other ones that are &#x27;public&#x27;, and they appear as pages on this website (wiki links become public URLs).
Learning about Zettelkasten over the last few years, it feels like I&#x27;ve been practicing it with todos and building projects, but not as much with &#x27;knowledge&#x27;—my notes about the work of others &#x27;slip away&#x27; because they are not interconnected and I don&#x27;t put them in my note taking app. (I&#x27;m looking for an app that approximates manual sorting of index cards).
The &#x27;searchable left-list&#x27; pattern is quite functional for me, and so I tend to incorporate it into all of my apps in some way. If you&#x27;re interested to know more, check out my presentation called Wetware of writing and doing, where I also go into how I use Hyperdraft to make things happen.
Hope to hang out here more often as I have more to learn about Zettelkasten and maybe some apps to make 😉.</span>

                    <span>Is there an app out there that imitates the original Zettelkasten&#x27;s spatial positioning (sequential ordering of index cards)? I would like to create one large universal stack of digital cards and sort them manually; I know that sounds tedious but it&#x27;s a hunch I&#x27;d like to explore.</span>

                    <span>I use emacs on various machines. I run the same init.el and set of packages everywhere, but different versions of emacs itself. In particular I want my setup to support a relatively old version of emacs (26.3) which I can find or easily install on random machines.
 As a result, I&#x27;d like to upgrade my packages but only when they are compatible with this maximum allowed version of emacs itself.
 I can hit &quot;U&quot; in the package list to mark all packages which can be upgraded up to my current emacs version. What I do now is manually inspect the upgrade list, checking the dependencies of each marked package, and removing items which require a too advanced version of emacs. But this is cumbersome.
 Is there a command or a programmatic way to restrict this list to show only the upgrades which are compatible with the maximum allowed emacs version? I can&#x27;t find any commands for this. I looked for package functions for querying a package&#x27;s dependencies by package name, but it seems like most of the functions in package.el need a package-desc as input, and I&#x27;m not sure how to get that struct only from a package name and for available rather than installed versions.

                    <span>Hi, I am trying to write a function for prettifying symbols on a per-mode basis. The idea is to accept the mode-hook and a list of substitutions, and then to create a hook and engage it with the mode-hook. The function looks like this:
  (defun +xx/prettify-symbols-set-hook (mode-hook symbol-list) (interactive) (add-hook mode-hook (lambda () (mapc (lambda (pair) (push pair prettify-symbols-alist)) symbol-list) (global-prettify-symbols-mode 1))) (message &quot;Hook set.&quot;)) 
 An example of the intended use would be:
 (+xx/prettify-symbols-set-hook &#x27;org-mode-hook &#x27;((&quot;#+BEGIN_SRC&quot; . ?») (&quot;#+begin_src&quot; . ?») (&quot;#+END_SRC&quot; . ?«) (&quot;#+end_src&quot; . ?«))) 
 I get no errors, but the hook does not seem to work. When I open new buffers of the given mode, the pretty-symbols do not appear. Any comments/suggestions would be very welcome as I am have very limited elisp experience.

                    <span>Hello , i started using doom emacs and once i am done familiarising with doom i plan on using emacs!
 I wanted to decrease the start time in emacs and from what i read i have to activate daemon which i did but it created some kind of confusion for me! 
 Basically created a symlink with ln -s /etc/init.d/emacs /etc/init.d/emacs.myuser then activated in my run devel!

                    <span>Are there some simple commands I can use to extract the timestamps and text for this html code?
 The class cue-group-start-offset contains the timestamps and cue style-scope ytd-transcript-body-renderer with attributes of role or tabindex is used for the transcript text.

                    <span>Hi everyone,
 I have a python setup with lsp, mspyls and company is used in the background for documentation completion (I think). For nearly all Numpy functions, company-show-doc-buffer returns an empty or sometimes wrong buffer. All other functions such as Scipy, built-ins or user-defined work perfectly well. Also, Code completion with company works fine for Numpy which is a bit weird.
 Has anyone encountered this as well? I read somewhere that Numpy added some decorators that might interfere with some APIs, but this also happens for old Numpy packages in a Python 3.5 environment.
 Please help :)

                    <span>Hej fellow parens haxx0rs,
 I am in the lengthy process of learning several lispy programming languages, one of them being guile scheme. I&#x27;ve installed the guile3 package using AUR on Manjaro successfully. Its binary resides in /usr/bin/guile3, and I am able to run it from the terminal no problem.
 For Scheme hacking, I want to use the Geiser package of which I heard only good stuff. I can use it with MIT Scheme and Guile-2.2.7, the implementation that is chosen when installed from official Manjaro repos. However, Geiser does not find guile3. When I try M-x geiser, it says &quot;Cannot find guile3 implementation&quot;.

 Currently, I have to download the package source code and untar it into stackproject/src and I can use those hidden module in my code.
  
Obviously, the obvious question is is there any simple way to import hidden module?

                    <span>Hello!
 I don&#x27;t understand how to get an index of locally available documentation and installed packages.
 I added the flag: &quot;Documentation: True&quot;, and indeed if I navigate to: &#x27;~/.cabal/store/ghc-8.10.7/attoparsec-0.14.3-a88f9f2009aaf50ec4de28c96eaab575e97e192943bebbfec18a608dffd670fd/share/doc/html&#x27;, all the docs are there, and they even link back to the ghc documentation (in &#x27;file:///home/jurjen/.ghcup/ghc/8.10.7/share/doc/ghc-8.10.7/html/libraries&#x27;), which is great!
 But navigating or exploring to such funky directories is unwieldy and I cannot find a generated index and they are not linked into the standard index living in &#x27;ghcup/.../share/doc/ghc-8.10/html&#x27; which is annoying since that is my main source of information for installed packages.
 I tried to set the options 
  docdir: /home/jurjen/.ghcup/share/doc/$abi/html/libraries/$libname htmldir: /home/jurjen/.ghcup/share/doc/$abi/html haddockdir: $htmldir 
 But that didn&#x27;t seem to do nothing. Anyone know how to make a global index of all (user) installed packages with cabal?

                    <span>After learning Haskell for some time, I would say that grasping most libraries and using them to build applications is a doable task, what really puzzles me is how to cultivate the mindset to enable one to build complex libraries. Some examples would be servant (type-level concept), scotty (monad transformer concept), opaleye (profunctor concept), and a lot more. Many Haskell libraries use sophisticated techniques to achieve DSL, but we seem to lack learning materials (the design parts, not the practical usage parts) that are accessible to everyday programmers.

                    <span>This is probably a super basic beginner question, but I&#x27;m struggling a bit to figure it out. I&#x27;m trying to make a simple web app to learn frontend development, and wanted some functionality supporting dropping files into the app, but I can&#x27;t seem to figure out how to get the literal contents of the file dropped to send it over to Haskell. My Haskell server is set up with Servant, and the Purescript side with Payload, and I&#x27;m looking at the documentation for Web.File.File, but the types are all abstract, and I don&#x27;t see how to get the actual contents of the file. I&#x27;m assuming it&#x27;s stored as a Blob, but there aren&#x27;t any functions for consuming blobs and Payload can&#x27;t transmit them.
 So I thought maybe I need to use the Javascript FFI, and was looking at this page, but I see there are quite a few different ways to consume the files, and I&#x27;m not sure what the difference is, or what Purescript types they would translate to. I&#x27;m assuming the problem isn&#x27;t actually super complex, but I&#x27;m just not quite sure what to try, as I seem to spend the majority of my development time trying to debug issues with the Haskell/Purescript sides communicating with one another, so I&#x27;m hoping someone might be able to point me in the right direction to avoid wasting any more.
 Basically I&#x27;m looking for something File -&gt; ByteString, so that the server can save/retrieve the file for later, without knowing the Purescript equivalent of ByteString.
 Alternatively, I mostly intend to have both the server and application running on the same machine, so if I can get the full filepath then I can just transmit that, and have the server read the file directly, but I can only seem to get the filename, and some googling seems to suggest the directory simply isn&#x27;t stored in a DragEvent.
 Is there any easy way to do what I&#x27;m trying?

                    <span>New on MELPA: python-MLS — multi-line (i)Python commands in the Python inferior shell
 One of the top iPython features I miss when using the python inferior shell in Emacs is the ability to use multi-line commands. python-MLS fills this gap, providing seamless multi-line command editing right at the prompt, with easy copy and paste in or out, a buffer-like editing experience, indentation, optimized fontification, persistent command history, history navigation, and more.

 Is there a way to do this?
 Edit: /u/moriturius provided the answer to this: M-backspace
 Edit 2: And it turns out Ctrl-backspace works, too.

 The basic support for Bitbucket is moving slowly and can be tracked here. My time to work on it is very limited :/

 That&#x27;s it, thanks for all the feedbacks so far.

                    <span>Hello all. I can link pdf in org mode by doing Ctrl-C Ctrl-l, this would show a prompt in the mini buffer and I can just choose &quot;file&quot; and select my pdf file. I can also write a description for it if I want. However, this would link to a complete PDF file, I would like to link to an exact page from that PDF. It doesnt need to be opened in emacs, I write stuff in org but I export as latex then as pdf; so the on Linux qpdfview takes care off that. Anyway, the command to insert the pdf file, if you expand it is:
 [[file:/home/user/someplace/file.pdf][some description]] 
 This would generate a some description and I can click on it (either inside emacs which opens the PDF with Docview or qpdfview if I export it org to pdf). I check this, https://orgmode.org/guide/Hyperlinks.html and tried to change the code to:
 [[file:/home/user/someplace/file.pdf::6][some description]] 
 so that it automatically opens to page 6 of the pdf. This does not seem to work.

 I am a big fan of the Eyebrowse package, it is a cornerstone of my Emacs usage.
 I have just one issue with it - under some circumstances, I lose all my window configurations when restarting Emacs. It really hurts, so I wrote a small package called eyebrowse-restore that automatically saves Eyebrowse window configurations for all your Emacs frames and allows you to use them again.

                    <span>Hi, I am looking for a way to override faces globally. For example force a face to inherit from another face all of its attributes. And want to avoid doing what i am doing below. What i do right now is something like the block below. But this is annoying. I looked into the Faces Wiki on Emacs found the remapping functionality - https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Face-Remapping.html. But it works just for the current buffer as far as i know. I want to avoid hooks for buffer switches to use the remapping, and preferably have this in my config, execute once, override the faces and be done at that point.
 What I am trying to achieve is force a few packages, which use custom face attributes (i.e helm-rg) to use the default attributes of my theme (i.e make the helm-rg-preview-line-highlight face force inherit/override itself from my mode-line face styles etc.). I am using doom-one theme - https://github.com/hlissner/emacs-doom-themes (on vanilla emacs, not doom)
 (set-face-attribute &#x27;dst nil ;; This is Just a sample, there are more attributes not specified here :underline &#x27;unspecified :slant &#x27;unspecified :weight &#x27;unspecified :height &#x27;unspecified :family &#x27;unspecified :foreground &#x27;unspecified :background &#x27;unspecified :inherit &#x27;src)

                    <span>I tagged it as AoC since my question came up doing one of those problems but its more of a general question I&#x27;d say.... 
 So I learned about Advent of Code and wanted to use it to learn some more Haskell.
 I did the first day, which went well. However I struggle with the second one...
 In theory it shouldn&#x27;t be too complicated.. My approach was as follows:
  
Read the lines
 Split the lines in 3 different lists (depending in the first character)
 Sum up all values
 ---
  
1.-2. were no problem.
 With 3 I thought I can just use foldl like that 
 foldl (\ p c -&gt; p + read (last c)) 0 testInputf
 where testInputf is a list of Strings ([String]).
 For me it would make sense that c is the whole String and last c is the last element of the String... However this doesn&#x27;t seem to be the case here... if I write it like that Haskell throws an error saying, that 
  Couldn&#x27;t match type ‘Char’ with ‘[Char]’ Expected type: [[String]] Actual type: [String] 
 And I can&#x27;t figure out why... Is there anything Im missing? Is there a general way of getting all last elements out of the Strings in a String List?
 For testing purposes Ive also tried using map 
 map (read . last) testInputf 
 which throws the same error and I can&#x27;t figure out why...
 Thank you very much!

                    <span>Hi, r/haskell,
 I am working on Chameleon, an experimental visual type debugging tool for Haskell. A couple of months ago I posted an advertisement for a user study for Chameleon. After that post, I was overwhelmed by a very generous amount of participation and constructive feedback from the wholesome r/haskell community. This time I want to conduct the study with more complicated code challenges. Some of the code I took from real-life Haskell projects, such as Cabal, hledger, xmonad,etc.
 If you are interested in helping us with our human-centered programming research, or you want to check out our Haskell type debugging tool, please click this link to proceed https://sup.ercu.be. The study is anonymous, and it will take you about 20 - 30 minutes to complete. But in turn, it will help us immensely.
 I am happy to answer any questions regarding Chameleon in this thread.
 Thank you,
 Shuai, Interactive Haskell Type Inference Exploration Team

                    <span>Edit:
 Based on the comments by u/p3tr4gon, u/psycotica0, I kind of understand how this partially applied type constructor works like.
 My little example use-case:
 type IntMap v &#x3D; Map.Map Int v --says IntMap is a Map with an Int key and some type v Value --my toy example function to return an IntMap String intMap :: Int -&gt; String -&gt; IntMap String intMap num str &#x3D; Map.singleton num str --and from the original question this also worked someAssocList &#x3D; [(1, &quot;John&quot;), (2, &quot;Lisa&quot;), (3, &quot;Mary&quot;), (4, &quot;Sandra&quot;)] myIntMap &#x3D; Map.fromList someAssocList :: IntMap String --------------------------------------------------------------------- --ghci output below Prelude&gt; :r [1 of 1] Compiling Shapes ( ch8_types.hs, interpreted ) Ok, one module loaded. *Shapes&gt; intMap 2 &quot;Noah&quot; fromList [(2,&quot;Noah&quot;)] *Shapes&gt; myIntMap fromList [(1,&quot;Noah&quot;),(2,&quot;Lisa&quot;),(3,&quot;Mary&quot;),(4,&quot;Sandra&quot;)] 
 And I agree that this is a toy example that probably does not have many use cases.
 Original question:
 In Learn You a Haskell 8.5, they have this example
 --partially apply type constructor type IntMap v &#x3D; Map.Map Int v type IntMap&#x27; &#x3D; Map.Map Int 
 How would I use this? I only know how to make a so-called IntMap like this
 import qualified Data.Map as Map someAssocList &#x3D; [(1, &quot;John&quot;), (2, &quot;Lisa&quot;), (3, &quot;Mary&quot;), (4, &quot;Sandra&quot;)] myIntMap &#x3D; Map.fromList someAssocList --deleted due to typo please see edits above

                    <span>I&#x27;m curious if anyone is using jOOQ for [only] query building, eg. with doobie. How has your experience been and what code have you written around jOOQ to make it work more smoothly?
 In particular I&#x27;m curious if/how records fit into the equation since tables seem straight-forward on their own.

                    <span>I&#x27;m looking for a way to get org-return to call org-open-at-point when point is on a citation (e.g. &#x27;[cite:@author1998]&#x27;). Digging a little I see that org-return will only call org-open-at-point if (org-return-follows-link is non-nil and) calling (org-element-context) would yield something of the form &quot;(link (:type...&quot;. Since calling (org-element-context) yields something like &quot;(citation-reference...&quot;, org-open-at-point is never called when point is on a citation and I call org-return. 
 So... any easy way to do this, short of redefining org-return? (Or better, perhaps, to write a wrapper that will call org-open-at-point when point is on a citation and call org-return otherwise?) It seems to me that it would be convenient to have citations treated much like file:// expressions, but maybe there&#x27;s a reason for not doing this?

                    <span>Left field question. I often copy text from GMail into an emacs buffer for saving. Some of the spaces get rendered as light blue underlines as, hopefully, shown in the image below. The text I&#x27;m cutting looks just like regular text. Any ideas whats going on? Or how I&#x27;d learn more about what emacs is rendering?
 BTW its an org-mode buffer

                    <span>So the title says it. Basically, I have a buffer full of babel code blocks that I don&#x27;t want to run when I first load the buffer in Emacs. I see org-babel-execute-buffer, but how do you make sure it&#x27;s off? I think the default behavior is already not auto-evaluating the blocks, isn&#x27;t it, so I don&#x27;t need to worry. So yes, how do you definitively control the org-babel-execute-buffer behavior on or off? It seems though, that an export to HTML etc. does try to run evaluate all blocks. How can that be turned off?

                    <span>Hello. I&#x27;ve been trying for 2 days to get this to work. This is obviously not the right way. I get *invalid* in the mode-line and the CPU total usage is instead displayed in the minibuffer. Also it does create a *Shell Command Output* buffer. That buffer is not desired. 
 Im aware that I need setq-default but for the purpose of testing I use with only setq. I test in the scratch buffer. Before someone comes and ask why? And say &quot;Emacs is a text editor!&quot; I run EXWM and I need the CPU/MEM total usage to be displayed all the time. I&#x27;ve been looking for a package that would display these info rather in the mode-line or in the systray. I&#x27;ve found nothing :( However, I did find a package that does display these info in the minibuffer. The minibuffer is not the best place for this tho. Also that package was making my Emacs slow af. Dont ask for the name of the package, I dont recall. Plus, I dont want to hit on someone else work. I cant even write this function alone, so ya. 
 So if you want to help, please do and thank you :) Also, Im pretty sure this little function could be appreciated by other Emacs users. 
 Here&#x27;s what I came with so far for the CPU:
 (defun cpu-usage-3 () &quot;Display CPU Usage&quot; (shell-command &quot;ps -A -o pcpu | tail -n+2 | paste -sd+ | bc&quot;)) ;; Found that ps command line on the internet. I did not create that. (setq mode-line-format (list &#x27;(:eval (cpu-usage-3))))

 I have two questions:
  
How do I have the cursor at $2 be between the { }?
 yas-choose-value prompts to choose a value but I can&#x27;t use Tab to choose the second value. If I do, it disappears. I have to use the arrow key

                    <span>I&#x27;m happy to announce that the second release candidate for upcoming text-2.0 with UTF-8 underlying representation has been just uploaded on Hackage: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/text-2.0/candidate
 Changelog: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/text-2.0/candidate/changelog
 Please give it a try. Here is a cabal.project template: https://gist.github.com/Bodigrim/9834568f075be36a1c65e7aaba6a15db
 What&#x27;s changed between rc1 and rc2?
 head.hackage has been updated to text-2.0, which helped to find and fix several bugs and regressions.
 What&#x27;s next?
 If no critical issues are identified in the next week or two, the final release of text-2.0 will follow shortly.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve started working on performance of the venerable but somewhat neglected pqueue package. The changes I&#x27;ve made so far are pretty obviously good, and make a big difference in even the most informal testing. But to make decisions about smaller points, I really need benchmarks, and the package has none. Does anyone know of a benchmark suite for priority queues? One that includes algorithms that involve persistent queue use would be particularly desirable, but I&#x27;ll take anything.

                    <span>I was musing about the following:
  
Would a language version*, where &#x27;in the case of a newtype everything (that&#x27;s derivable, including with language extensions, like GeneralizedNewTypeDeriving) is automatically derived, unless a manual derivation or a manual instance is defined (or manually suppressed, with a new syntax)&#x27; be more ergonomic?
  
I was thinking about this, because I noticed that with quick problems I was often reaching for type instead of newtype. The latter would afford more type safety, but even manually adding the relevant deriving ... clauses felt like a chore for the Advent of Code problems.
  
*) I don&#x27;t pretend that would still necessarily fall under Haskell2010 + a new extension; maybe this would need to be a hypothetical Haskell derivative, because of semantic changes down the line.
  
Would this even be viable? Would there be undesirable consequences? Would it indeed improve ergonomics, or was that stray thought just a wrong impression?

I searched a lot on internet, but I want an easy explaination of language-server and haskell-language-server in simple words. If you can also explain it layman&#x27;s term, it would be very helpful, hopefully. I appreciate your help.

                    <span>My situation: I offer lots of training. Around a training, several date-sensitive activities need to happen, that I would like to see in my agenda e.g.
  
a week before the training I need to order materials and exams
 the day before I need to set up the online whiteboard
 the day of the training, I need to conduct the training (and would like this to be reflected by a due date)
 one day after the training, I want to send a link to a feedback form
  
You get the gist.
 I&#x27;m wondering if there&#x27;s a way to set up a capture template so that I enter &quot;Training on subject X, on date Y&quot;, and org will automatically calculate the corresponding due dates for these surrounding activities and stick them into the newly captured structure.
 Any suggestions on how to accomplish this?

                    <span>I&#x27;m trying to learn Scala and need the docker plugin so that I can publish an image to my dockerhub repo. It&#x27;s very confusing to figure out how to do this, and there are so many steps involved. 
 I have created a simple hello-world app and running &#x60;sbt publishLocal&#x60; works fine. It seems like I need 2/3 different plugins for publishing to a remote repo? 
 If anyone has a simple example, it would be much appreciated! As long as I can run sbt publish from my terminal I&#x27;m happy
 Here is my code so far:
 ​
 build.sbt:
 scalaVersion :&#x3D; &quot;2.13.3&quot;
 name :&#x3D; &quot;hello-world&quot;
 organization :&#x3D; &quot;ch.epfl.scala&quot;
 version :&#x3D; &quot;1.0&quot;
 publishTo :&#x3D; Some(&quot;Hello-world app&quot; at &quot;&quot;)
 libraryDependencies +&#x3D; &quot;org.scala-lang.modules&quot; %% &quot;scala-parser-combinators&quot; % &quot;2.0.0&quot;
 ​
 plugins.sbt:
 addSbtPlugin(&quot;com.github.sbt&quot; % &quot;sbt-native-packager&quot; % &quot;1.9.4&quot;)
 addSbtPlugin(&quot;se.marcuslonnberg&quot; % &quot;sbt-docker&quot; % &quot;1.8.2&quot;)
 addSbtPlugin(&quot;com.eed3si9n&quot; % &quot;sbt-assembly&quot; % &quot;x.y.z&quot;)

                    <span>Slim pickings it seems, Proto Quill and Skunk, with JOOQ as the only stable offering (ironic that a Java library is the only one that is production ready to use with Scala 3).
 Ideally looking for something like Slick or Quill (i.e. composable type safe queries), but am probably going to be forced to go with JOOQ, which is as non-idiomatic Scala as it gets, or just ignore Scala 3 for another year and hope the landscape changes in the interim.
 Scala 3 adoption :\

                    <span>I love emacs as a text editor for programming. But I am trying to build a GTD system using emacs orgmode and calendar and the search lists and calendar displays on emacs always end up looking like a nightmarish wall of text that makes looking at them a pain, a bit too information-dense, making it hard to focus on things. My eyes just bounce around the screen without focusing on anything.
 Is there a way to build similar calendar and search screens on emacs that have instead a lot of white space and separation between items, and focusing in readability rather than on information density?
 I basically would like more structure and less text on screen.
 Some examples:
  
http://doc.norang.ca/block-agenda-nonproject.png
  
This is a task list, but it just presents line after the other of tasks with very little structure and forces you to read through everything to find things rather than having more structure and less crowded text.

Very crowded week-calenday-view with the tasks of one day just piling on top of the tasks of the next day and making it hard to get a clear, temporal view of the view.
 I haven&#x27;t been able to find any examples with more readable and less crowded views. Has anybody built anything like this? Or is emacs the wrong tool for this and maybe more centered for users that like to see a lot of information at once rather than more structured information? I realize it may be difficult to do what other task and calendar applications do with pure text, so I may be looking at the wrong tool.

                    <span>So I thought I might create a wrapper that uses advice to overwrite a function temporarily, re-routing it:
 (defun ct/with-notmuch-as-compose-mail (&amp;rest body) (progn (advice-add &#x27;compose-mail :override #&#x27;notmuch-mua-mail) (unwind-protect (progn body) (advice-remove &#x27;compose-mail #&#x27;notmuch-mua-mail)))) 
 Turns out this doesn&#x27;t work when called via:
 (ct/with-notmuch-as-compose-mail (compose-mail)) 
 What does work, though, is a macro!
 (defmacro ct/with-notmuch-as-compose-mail (&amp;rest body) &#x60;(progn (advice-add &#x27;compose-mail :override #&#x27;notmuch-mua-mail) (unwind-protect (progn ,@body) (advice-remove &#x27;compose-mail #&#x27;notmuch-mua-mail)))) 
 I don&#x27;t understand the reason.
 Can anyone explain why the function doesn&#x27;t do its thing?

                    <span>Dear all.
 I have some text with selected phrases marked within asterisks (&quot;*&quot;) because org-mode syntax helps to visualize them inside the text, and I&#x27;d like to extract those phrases to another buffer.
 As I understand after some searching, one way is to use occur.
 However, I&#x27;m struggling (to say it lightly) to find a working regex for this occurrence that is &quot;whatever is between asterisks&quot;. I tried txt2regex but no success still...
 Does anyone knows a way to do this; or been in this situation and found a different approach? My lisp/regex fu is very much near the bottom, but I&#x27;m happy to learn.
 As always, thanks a lot for your time and attention. :)
 Best regards...
 ​
 PD: I&#x27;m thinking about ways to do semantic analysis with org-mode. If anyone&#x27;s interested on this we can arrange some collaboration. :)

                    <span>I have been using Emacs for many years. Thanks to the fantastic introduction to ELisp, I knew enough to &quot;configure&quot; Emacs. For some reason only recently have I started actually thinking about how I can make my computer-life easier; and Emacs is the one tool which poses least resistence when I try to. 
 I am kinda mad at myself for not doing this sooner, but also very happy that I finally did. I didn&#x27;t know where else to share this :-)
 In last few days, I have written 2 small bits of Elisp code (which took me embarassingly long to write, but the exercise was very rewarding).
  
First was publishing org subtrees as github issues; so I can stay in org-mode where I am very comfortable thinking and documenting my thoughts, and also push them to Github for colleagues. I can mark an issue as &quot;DONE&quot; and it closes the github issue, or change its content, or labels. 
 And a few minutes ago I wrote a little code to insert my org-roam notes as rust documentation comments
  
It&#x27;s not much, but it is honest work and I am happy I am finally doing it.

                    <span>I need to investigate text log files a lot. Emacs with auto-revert-tail-mode does the job almost fine, except when there are long lines (JSON/XML dumps, 1-40kb large).
 In that case Emacs lags a lot.
 I use fundamental-mode + add few font-lock-add-keywords by (highlighting for INFO/DEBUG/ERROR &amp; for date/time):
 http://hg.defun.work/dot-emacs/file/tip/mylisp/log4-hi-mode.el
 Even with plain fundamental-mode Emacs is unresponsible. I tried debug on error on C-g and the stacktrace is only native rendering function redisplay_internal.
 Just writing the post I tried so-long-mode instead of fundamental-mode and it is much better but still noticeably lagging. Few extra font-lock-add-keywords in so-long-mode doesn&#x27;t have huge impact: movement is just a bit slower than without.
 I don&#x27;t like to open Notepad++ just for log files, though it might be the proper solution...
 Any suggestions on debugging long line issue?
 Could we expect Emacs rendering of long lines improved? 
 I&#x27;m with Cygwin Emacs W32 27.2. Almost the same situation with Emacs 27.1 in WSL1 terminal. so-long-mode provides better experience, few font-lock-add-keywords ruin smoothness of movement.
 UPDATE I really need some highlighting for log files (date/time + INFO/DEBUG/ERROR): I expect some help from the tool.

                    <span>Hi all,
 As the title says, I&#x27;m trying to move to Emacs 28, from Emacs 27, but I&#x27;m having all kinds of weird problems with the packages I use.
 This is my config BTW: https://github.com/croqaz/dotfiles/blob/main/emacs/Emacs.org
 Basically I have &quot;random errors&quot; with random packages.
 First there&#x27;s IVY and the suite of packages, the error is:
 custom-initialize-reset: Cannot open load file: No such file or directory, ../../../../../../.emacs.default/straight/build/ivy/ivy
 I comment ivy, counsel, swiper, ivy-rich, then I get the same error about another package. I comment it and I get another error, etc until I comment: centaur-tabs, doom-modeline, dimmer, which-key, maybe a few more.
 Then I delete ~/.emacs.default/straight/build/ivy and re-enable ivy AND move it immediately after use-package initialization and now it works!
 Then I re-enable all of them, one by one until they all work again!
 It&#x27;s like one package in there is causing some problems and makes all the other packages after it, to go crazy, that&#x27;s why I have to move them higher to make it work.
 I tried this so so so many times, that I made it work, but it&#x27;s a huge pain!
 Anybody else that understands the new version, that can help me?
 Thank you in advance!
 EDIT 1: Other than the problem with packages that I just mentioned, upgrading from Emacs 27 to 28 was painless.
 EDIT 2: Actually I also had the same trouble with yasnippet, company, js2, typescript and LSP packages...

                    <span>Hello again,
 I have a custom keyboard shortcut for moving quicker in VIM (for Emacs I use EVIL) where I hold down CTRL and press HJKL I move faster in the direction.
 Like this:
 ;; Movement changes - BUG: When I release CTRL it still does one last 5 line jump when pressing one of my keys (define-key evil-normal-state-map (kbd &quot;C-h&quot;) (kbd &quot;h5&quot;)) (define-key evil-normal-state-map (kbd &quot;C-j&quot;) (kbd &quot;j5&quot;)) (define-key evil-normal-state-map (kbd &quot;C-k&quot;) (kbd &quot;k5&quot;)) (define-key evil-normal-state-map (kbd &quot;C-l&quot;) (kbd &quot;l5&quot;)) 
 However, in EMACS when I use this, it does work. But once I let go off CTRL it does ONE last 5 jump, despite that it should have stopped. It also feels a bit like there is a small delay when doing this.
 Does anyone know a possible solution for this to make it more responsive and NOT have a &quot;last&quot; jump after letting CTRL go.
 Thanks in advance.

                    <span>Hello, 
 I&#x27;m back with some more question for my quest to move over to emacs. This time it&#x27;s only about HELM (there will be more questions I&#x27;m sure of it), but this thread is only for HELM. 
 I have a couple of question I&#x27;d love to get some help with. I&#x27;ve tried googling for them, but only found answers that didn&#x27;t really answer the question, or I couldn&#x27;t actually understand how the answer worked. :(
  
Is there a way to make helm-find-file to also look in sub-directories? When I googled for this, most people suggested Projectile with helm, but I could not get that working at all. There was no error or such, but it did not search in sub-directories. 
 
Is there anyway to make helm open a new window (or frame, not sure what it is called in emacs) at the center of the screen? There was some old questions here on this reddit for it, but they were 5 years old and then it seems like it wasn&#x27;t possible. However, I saw on the official documentation that it should be possible. I just can&#x27;t get it to work for me. I tried using Shackle to solve it as well, and that improved it, but still does not feel as good. 
 
 I believe that was my two helm questions I was mostly struggling with. 
 Thanks in advance

                    <span>I usually take daily notes and are categorized under a topic.
 I want to go through a specific category and want to get those in one single buffer (search or otherwise) with the contents.
 So let&#x27;s say I have a category country, I want to revisit all the details under this category.
 I am using spacemacs and projectile. A project search or org-roam-find usually lets me search the header but doesn&#x27;t say whats in the content.
 Options I know of - 
  
Creating an index of country headers and creating its own org-id for org-roam and visiting them manually
 
org-transclusion, where I could include all the same categories in one buffer and that would let me explore the content.
 
 What I am looking for specifically is something that would not require me to make changes like above which would require creating org id for categories which I can use in a buffer. I want a simple approach where a search query would give me what I am looking for in a separate buffer.
 Thanks in advance!

 I was using Emacs to edit some code for an upcoming deadline, I fat fingered something, Emacs exited to terminal. Usually this would be fine, I&#x27;d lost a few minutes of work, BUT it appears the files were rolled back to near when I started the Emacs session that terminated (multiple hours)
 I saved tens of times during the session, but nevertheless all my work appears to be gone. Of course it was as I was about to make a commit and push.
 I would really appreciate any insight into what could have possibly happened. My best guess is a shortcut for &#x60;git reset --hard&#x60;, but even my GitHub repo is more up to date than my local files now (but still at least an hour behind).
 With or without knowing what happened, is there a way to get these files back? Any help would be obviously be appreciated.
 Edit: change first line status to solved

                    <span>So I&#x27;m trying to implement a caesar cypher (see below). I have a function (caesar) that shifts right, e.g. caesar 1 &quot;abc&quot; would result in &quot;bcd&quot;, that works as intended. Now I was thinking to shift that to the left, I&#x27;d just have to adjust the the shift functions a little, but my current implementation doesn&#x27;t work around the edges, e.g. unCaesar 1 &quot;abc&quot; results in &quot;baz&quot; (?!) . I would love an explanation on why the shiftLeft functions behave like they do :)
 import Data.Char caesar :: Int -&gt; String -&gt; String caesar _ [] &#x3D; [] caesar n (x:xs) &#x3D; shiftRight n x : caesar n xs unCaesar :: Int -&gt; String -&gt; String unCaesar _ [] &#x3D; [] unCaesar n (x:xs) &#x3D; shiftLeft n x : unCaesar n xs shiftRight :: Int -&gt; Char -&gt; Char shiftRight a b | isUpper b &#x3D; shiftRightUpper a b | isLower b &#x3D; shiftRightLower a b | otherwise &#x3D; b shiftLeft :: Int -&gt; Char -&gt; Char shiftLeft a b | isUpper b &#x3D; shiftLeftUpper a b | isLower b &#x3D; shiftLeftLower a b | otherwise &#x3D; b shiftRightLower :: Int -&gt; Char -&gt; Char shiftRightLower a b &#x3D; chr $ ((a + (ord b - ord &#x27;a&#x27;)) &#x60;mod&#x60; 26) + ord &#x27;a&#x27; shiftRightUpper :: Int -&gt; Char -&gt; Char shiftRightUpper a b &#x3D; chr $ ((a + (ord b - ord &#x27;A&#x27;)) &#x60;mod&#x60; 26) + ord &#x27;A&#x27; shiftLeftLower :: Int -&gt; Char -&gt; Char -- doesn&#x27;t work yet shiftLeftLower a b &#x3D; chr $ ((a - (ord b - ord &#x27;a&#x27;)) &#x60;mod&#x60; 26) + ord &#x27;a&#x27; shiftLeftUpper :: Int -&gt; Char -&gt; Char -- doesn&#x27;t work either shiftLeftUpper a b &#x3D; chr $ ((a - (ord b - ord &#x27;A&#x27;)) &#x60;mod&#x60; 26) + ord &#x27;A&#x27;

                    <span>I tried to solve Day 9, part one with algebraic graphs, a library I wanted to try out for a long time. I eventually failed(succeeded, thank to a performance hint of /u/jitwit), because my approach (build graph -&gt; remove all vertices that have a lower neighbour -&gt; count the value of the remaining vertices) relies on neighbours :: Ord a &#x3D;&gt; a -&gt; Graph a -&gt; Set a, which has an inefficient implementation (folds the whole graph, hence my algorithm is at least quadratic.) It still works for the example input tho! :)
 I would be glad about answer or general feedback about the my solution:
 -- I seem to need some kind of indexing, otherwise there is no way to distinguish vertexes. -- Question 1: Is there a smarter way to do it? -- 1 2 &#x3D;&gt; neighbours (vertex 1) will look for both 1&#x27;s ((0,0), 1) ((0,1…</span>

                    <span>Looking at the following syntax:
 getValues x1 &#x3D; do
 g &lt;- get
 let name &#x3D; &quot;aName&quot;
 return [Map.lookup x1 (myMap g)]
 ​
  
Does &lt;- get set g to the output of the return line? If not, what does g &lt;- get do?
 x1 appears to be the key to a map lookup, and myMap g is the map, but what is the relationship between the g in myMap g and the g in g &lt;- get. Recursive? There is no g as an argument to getValues.

                    <span>The stereotype is that only Senior Haskellers get hired. Perhaps it’s best to just ask any lurkers if their company actually hires and mentors Junior devs and is actively seeking them today. 
 So, who’s hiring Junior devs?

                    <span>I want to separate my daily tasks with appointments and all from the (embarrasingly) long list of badly maintained tasks -- overdue ones, soon-to-be due ones, and those that are schedule for a past date.
 It was simple enough to hide the overdue stuff from today&#x27;s timeline:
  (agenda &quot;&quot; ((org-agenda-overriding-header &quot; &quot;) ;; Non-empty string to get empty line (org-agenda-span &#x27;day) (org-agenda-ndays 1) (org-agenda-sorting-strategy (quote ((agenda time-up priority-down tag-up)))) ;; Do not include scheduled, due or overdue items here (org-deadline-warning-days 0) (org-scheduled-past-days 0) (org-deadline-past-days 0) (org-agenda-skip-scheduled-if-done t) (org-agenda-skip-timestamp-if-done t) (org-agenda-skip-deadline-if-done t))) 
 But I cannot get that output to appear elsewhere, e.g. farther down, out of focus. This does display all overdue etc. taks, but also everything with a timestamp for today:
  (agenda &quot;&quot; ((org-agenda-overriding-header &quot;Overdue&quot;) (org-agenda-time-grid nil) (org org-agenda-remove-timeranges-from-blocks t) (org-agenda-show-all-dates nil) (org-agenda-format-date &quot;&quot;) ;; Skip the date (org-agenda-start-on-weekday nil) (org-agenda-span &#x27;day) (org-agenda-ndays 0) (org-agenda-skip-function &#x27;(org-agenda-skip-entry-if &#x27;todo &#x27;done)) ;; Show overdue items (org-scheduled-past-days 999) (org-deadline-past-days 999) ;; Ignore upcoming deadlines (org-deadline-warning-days 0))) 
 How can I get the bottom part to only show overdue etc. tasks, not those that are scheduled for today? 
 Do I have to write a (org-agenda-skip-function &#x27;(org-agenda-skip-entry-if &#x27;todo &#x27;done)) replacement in elisp that filters elements by date, i.e. &quot;not today&quot;? (How? :))

                    <span>Who thought that pressing enter on a link in org mode should not open the link when it&#x27;s in a table would be a reasonable default and why?
 And even if you have a good answer to the first question, why is there no variable that makes it possible to activate the behaviour 99% of users would except?
 I think naming funktions &quot;org-&quot; is a horrible design, and that is mostly unique for org-mode I know no other package that does that, so it&#x27;s breaking standard coding practises in emacs, but then also add such bad defaults and no way to configure it in a sane way drives me insane.
 It&#x27;s a enourmous effort to not use standard keys, but please I am not willing to press some finger destroying C-c C-o, my health is to important to me to want that, and in no case I ever want to behave  to jump to the next line when the cursor is on a link. Does really somebody want this behaviour this way? You prefer pressing C-c C-o over ?
 Sorry for the rant, I need to make some tea... cheers.
 org-return-follows-link is set to  in this example btw, so normally return would open the link, just not in a table.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been trying to put together a guide to Clojure as I&#x27;ve been using it, as an org file, with little illustrative bits of Clojure source embedded in the file, which I have a cider-repl evaluate &amp; which puts the results of each code snippet below the source code in a #+RESULTS: block. That&#x27;s all well and good when the thing we&#x27;re interested in is the return value(s) of the snippet, but I&#x27;ve been looking to try &amp; get the standard output written into the results too, or in a similar block maybe labelled as +#OUTPUT:.
 Does anyone know how this might be done? I suspect there must be some kind of option passed in the +#BEGIN_SRC CLOJURE line, but I haven&#x27;t been able to find out what it should be.

                    <span>Type-checking plugins interface directly with GHC’s constraint solver. This means we need to have
a certain level of familiarity with how GHC generates, manipulates and solves constraints.
In this post, we will attempt to demystify this constraint solving process, as well as review
a few aspects of type-family reduction, to facilitate the development of type-checking plugins.
This post will serve as a reference, when we start writing our own type-checking plugins in Part III.
Don’t worry: you don’t need to know everything before you start writing your own plugins!
It’s only when debugging a type-checking plugin that the rubber hits the road:
a few skills become rather important, such as the ability to understand the different types of constraints,
to read Core (and, in particular, coercion…</span>

                    <span>Since structure notes and conceptual overviews can quickly become the foundation of actual projects, I thought we might all enjoy taking inventory of the past 3 months in terms of which structure notes we&#x27;ve tended to.
Since &quot;tending to&quot; isn&#x27;t trivial to figure out (without at least modification date sorting), might as well kick this off with new notes.
So in reverse order, here&#x27;s mine:
202112061117 § Emacs debugging tips: I had 3 notes about how to find out why Emacs is slow at times, and error debugging, and grouped them that day.
202111241304 § Drag and drop in macOS apps: Stuff I researched in 2017 just ... existed. So I created an overview and outlines topics a bit more orderly. Unlike the Emacs debugging tips above, this is not a mere collection of tips, but becomes more and more of …</span>

Memory Maintenance
Considering notes as proxies for memories, as the size and matrix of the archive grows, more time is spent maintaining existing notes. New notes should be created with abandon. Integrating them into the archive as wholly as I do. Editing them with abandon.
My new note-taking/zettelkasting mantra is: Create and edit with abandon. Trust that magic will happen.

  
I realized that in a few months, let alone years, at this rate most of my time would be spent on the maintenance of memories [notes]. I, as others have found, would be too busy maintaining these memories to use them. 1


What does it mean to &quot;use&quot; a memory? I can use a note&#x27;s contents, and its idea can be reignited in me. It can spark new and novel ideas.

                    <span>Hi all,
 Problem Description
 I&#x27;m trying to have the same .org file exported to LaTeX and ox-hugo. I use the template docsy template to export to which uses an alert shortcode to render an alert/info area.
 In LaTeX I use awesomebox to render a similar block.
 The LaTeX output works perfectly when I am using 
  #+begin_noteblock This is a noteblock info environment from the awesomebox LaTeX package. #+end_noteblock 
 Now I want that noteblock to render into the following when using the ox-hugo export:
  {{% alert title&#x3D;&quot;Warning&quot; color&#x3D;&quot;warning&quot; %}} This is a warning. {{% /alert %}} 
 I found I should be able to use org-special-block-extras to do this conversion, but I seem to be getting it wrong, as on export no conversion happens. As I though there is maybe something wrong with the condit…</span>

                    <span>Hello there guys.
 So, I&#x27;ve recently got the source for Emacs 28.0.90 from https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git and built and installed it following the instructions. More specifically, I ran the following:
  
./autogen.sh
 /configure --with-native-compilation&#x3D;yes --with-json&#x3D;yes --with-gnutls&#x3D;yes --with-x-toolkit&#x3D;lucid --with-mailutils&#x3D;yes --with-rsvg&#x3D;yes
 make -j4
 sudo make install
  
The compilation and install were successful, as well as the Doom install. However when I try to run Emacs I get the following error message:
 error: Invalid hash table rehash size, 1.0
 When I try to run an Emacs client (after successfully starting a daemon) I get a more elaborate error message:
 *ERROR*: Error in a Doom startup hook: server-after-make-frame-hook, doom-init-theme-h, (error &quot;Invalid hash table rehash size&quot; 1.0)
 The same happens when build and install Emacs 27.2 (source also from Savannah), without, of course, the native compilation flag on configure.
 I saw that some Spacemacs users ran into the same problem and submitted this issue. I tried, as suggested there, to run an apt upgrade, but had no success.
 Btw, I&#x27;m using Ubuntu 20 and Emacs works fine in the terminal.
 Has anyone ran into the same issue? How can I fix this? 
 Thanks in advance!

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been using lsp-mode for a while now with eslint for my Node work stuff, and aside from screwing up some paths when initially installing it, everything worked just fine. But now we&#x27;re starting to transition to Typescript.
 I installed the ts-ls server without issue, and it runs just fine on *.ts files, but it&#x27;s also running for *.js files. Even stranger is that eslint is running at the same time! Now that both of them are running at the same time for a single file, syntax highlighting doesn&#x27;t work (although I get warnings and errors underlined as I expect). How do I configure this so that I don&#x27;t have both running?

 https://www.lawfareblog.com/feed?post_type&#x3D;all
 When I configure this in elfeed and use the tag +lawfare, elfeed shows only 3 items all from today Dec 8.
 When I configure the same feed in newsboat, I&#x27;m presented with 25 items going back to Dec 2.
 Does anyone know why this would be and if it is possible for elfeed to show me the same articles as newsboat?
 Thank you

                    <span>Got curious about bookmarks+ and downloaded it via quelpa today. After installation, I noticed a new behaviour when visiting dired buffers. 
 I visit a dired buffer, all details are hidden as per my config, but after 3 seconds or so, it suddenly shows all my details. Pressing &#x27;g&#x27; reverts it to the original setup, only to get overridden again after 3 seconds. I&#x27;ve singled it down to bookmarks+, since de-installation removes this bug.
 I&#x27;m posting it in this sub-reddit, since I couldn&#x27;t find a github for bookmarks+.

                    <span>Is it possible to add ob-kotlin to the org-babel-execute for Doom Emacs?
 Can you provide me some short guide? Thanks.

                    <span>On behalf of maintainers I&#x27;m happy to announce that bytestring-0.11.2.0 is finally released.
 Highlights from the changelog:
  
New functions: 
 ultra-fast SIMD-based isValidUtf8 validator,
 foldr&#x27;, foldr1&#x27;, scanl1, scanr, scanr1, takeEnd, dropEnd, takeWhileEnd, dropWhileEnd, spanEnd, breakEnd for lazy ByteString,
 writeFile to dump Builder directly,
 fromFilePath and toFilePath for locale-aware conversions.
 
 Performance improvements: 
 speed up floatDec and doubleDec up to 10x using Ryu algorithm,
 new SIMD-based count is up to 5x faster,
 improve inlining of foldl, foldl&#x27;, foldr, foldr&#x27;, mapAccumL, mapAccumR, scanl, scanr and filter,
 faster internal loop in unfoldrN,
 use a static lookup table for Base16 Builders.
 
 Add Lift instances for ByteString and ShortByteString.
 Put HasCallStack constraints onto partial functions.
  
Many people contributed their time and effort to make this release happen. Just to name a few in no particular order, mostly according to git log:

                    <span>I am trying to write an IO action that bugs the user to enter a number within a certain range.
 Since the user is entering the number from the keyboard, I have to allow the possibility that
 the user types in something that cannot be converted into an Int value.
 ​
 This is what I have so far
 ​
 action2 :: Int -&gt; IO Int
 action2 n &#x3D; do
 putStrLn &quot;\nEnter action2 ...&quot;
 ​
 let m &#x3D; 2 * n 
 ​
 putStrLn $ &quot;n &#x3D; &quot; ++ (show n)
 putStrLn &quot;... leave action2\n&quot;

                    <span>If I were a teacher of high-schoolers wanting to connect some underlying theory to Haskell, could I explain Haskell list comprehensions as basically just a Cartesian/cross product machine? Would this be accurate? And then the combinatorics product rule also seems at play here. I would appreciate any theoretical explanation of what a list comprehension is about.
 Edit: Looking at the Report I can see and understand the details, but somehow that list of facts in the &quot;Translations&quot; box implies, results in the Cartesian product. I&#x27;d like to know how and why.

                    <span>I am trying to make an Akka actor system and hoping to take advantage of discovery to automatically fulfill actor dependencies. I have put together a pattern that I believe should work using the receptionist, but I&#x27;m seeing some strange error that I have not had luck deciphering. I asked on stack overflow about it, but didn&#x27;t seem to get much traction there. I&#x27;m hoping bringing attention to it here will help me get some answers:
 Combining Akka (typed) actor pools and discovery to fulfill actor dependencies
 Any ideas??

 I have a complex case class with many fields 
 case class Foo(v1: String,..., v10: Int) 
 For tests I want to create some default value for it without manually passing all the parameters.
 val foo &#x3D; Default[Foo].value 
 I think tt could be done with typeclass
 trait Default[T] { def value: T } implicit val defaultString &#x3D; new Default[String] { def value &#x3D; &quot;&quot; } implicit val defaultInt &#x3D; new Default[Int] { def value &#x3D; 0 } 
 and derivation for case classes with magnolia
 Is there any implementation for something like this?

                    <span>I have been learning Scala for quite sometime now and found it a nice language. Coming from the background of JavaScript and Python, I found Scala to be a really cool language.
 What I want to ask this community is that how many of you use Scala especially to build microservices using Play Framework... I feel like diving super deep into it but I plan to learn typescript as well... Now I know typescript is definitely a big game player but Scala is something I have been enjoying a bit...
 Is it worth learning Scala in 2022 or should I go with something like golang or Rust? I know it depends on what things I am dealing with but in that scenario javascript and python are answer to almost all my questions Unless performance walks in and now even modern optimized frameworks are handling that well too.
 As a developer, keeping all your love and affection for Java based languages aside do you think it&#x27;s worth investing in Scala and Play Framework?

                    <span>Dear r/scala,
 I am a big fan of SBT that is my main tools for debuging while coding. However, sometimes I can have like 30 errors at once. It is required to debug from first to last since the last errors may be consequent to the firsts one. In this case I have to scroll back to find the start of the error thread which I feel is a lost of time. 
 Do you know a way to reverse this error thread, so that the first errors are shown at the bottom? Or to limit the number of errors shown?
 ​
 Thx
