                              <span>I am on windows and I am totally new to emacs. I have everything installed for rust already, works in my nvim setup too (I am switching to emacs dont worry). Now when I try to reload my config, or I safe a .rs file it tells me:
 &quot;file-missing Cannot open laod file. No such file or directory rustic&quot;
 So I understand that rustic is missing, but how do I fix it? The answers I find online just confuse me. I added that to my config now:
 (add-to-list &#x27;default-frame-alist &#x27;(fullscreen . maximized))
 ​
 (setq rustic-lsp-client &#x27;eglot)
 (setq package-archives &#x27;((&quot;melpa&quot; . &quot;http://melpa.org/packages/&quot;)
 (&quot;gnu&quot; . &quot;http://elpa.gnu.org/packages/&quot;)))
 (use-package rustic)

 I assume admins are aware but in case they are not - anyone can poke them? :-)

                              <span>I&#x27;ve got a case where I use re-search-backward looking for something akin to &quot;[[:blank:]][[:alpha:]]&quot;. While the leading whitespace is syntactically significant, it&#x27;s actually the location of [[:alpha:]] that I am interested in.
 So given a few examples that for the sake of the example all start at buffer pos 1000:
 A) &quot; blabla&quot;
 B) &quot; blabla&quot;
 C) &quot;blabla&quot;
 re-search-backward would correctly return 1000 for both A and B, but it&#x27;s actually the return values of 1 and 3 that I really want here. I can&#x27;t just remove the [[:blank:]] because I don&#x27;t want to match C where there is no leading whitespace.
 So I&#x27;m wondering if there is any alternative function or grouping trick where I can search backwards for a regex but get the position of a specific group in the regex back, or similar to font-lock-keywords be able to specify a regex for leading/surrounding text.
 Similarly, given the same example A I would like to use looking-at if the point is at position 1. For now I use (and (looking-at &quot;[[:alpha:]]&quot;) (looking-back &quot;[[:blank:]]))

                              <span>Hi,
 How should I configure emacs to use pdf-view instead of Docview when I load a pdf ? 
 I have both installed but Docview is used by default and I have to M-x pdf-view-mode each time.
 Thanks !

                              <span>I&#x27;m not going to switch over to vi bindings, but in exploring how the other 2/3 lives, I&#x27;ve grown disenchanted with Emacs&#x27;s keybindings for (backward-char) and (backward-word). For decades, I&#x27;ve used  and M- for those navigation commands, but as I&#x27;ve moved away from the arrow keys in favor of C|M-{f, n, p} , I&#x27;ve found the b variant more and more irritating. For me, C- is caps-lock and M- sits just below x. In both cases, combining them with b makes for a very weird hand shape.
 vi&#x27;s h,j,k,l navigation is interesting, but n,p make more sense to me than j,k and I use C-h, C-l and M-l enough to not want to remap them.
 I&#x27;m interested to hear about solutions to this thorn from people who don&#x27;t use vi bindings.

                              <span>Hi,
 Has anyone managed to find proper highlighting support for mdx files ? Markdown mode doesn&#x27;t cut it. Also, anyone editing tsx files on emacs? 
 I&#x27;m trying to work with gatsbyjs. Looking for tips and tricks from more experienced users!

                              <span>I had dogs almost all my life. And they were invariably always big breeds. Rottweiler, GSD, Caucasian Shepherd (google this one if you don&#x27;t know, I guarantee, you&#x27;d be amazed). I liked big dogs then, and I still love them. I didn&#x27;t understand small dogs until we got a miniature schnauzer. And I have to say, this tiny fella is the best companion and non-human friend I ever had.
 Similarly, all my Emacs life I simply ignored eww. I knew it existed, but I never tried using it. I just didn&#x27;t understand the point. I would always use &quot;the big browser&quot; and complain that it&#x27;s sad Emacs doesn&#x27;t have one. But lately, I&#x27;ve been using eww more and more, and sometimes even get annoyed when I actually have to open something in an external browser.
 I like eww because it allows me to focus on the text. …</span>

                              <span>Emacs is a perfectly good development environment, contrary to what the folks at Unity think. In fact, it’s better than any of the rubbish they shovel at you, but let’s not get too evangelistic. I’m running Doom Emacs on a Mac (using Macports as a package manager), and although there are some guides out there on getting Emacs to work with Unity, most of them didn’t get everything working for me, so I thought I’d write this guide to help others out. To use Emacs effectively with Unity means setting up LSP Mode integration. In order to do that, you’ll need a language server for C# and a way to generate .csproj files. Unfortunately, it’s difficult to test if the former is working without having the latter up and running. Let’s set up project file generation first.

                              <span>I&#x27;m pretty new to Haskell and learning it because I was interested in a pure functional language. I now know the basics of Haskell(at least I think I do), so what exactly I can build in Haskell, what is it mainly used for, and what are some distant goals we can achieve with Haskell? Can I build GUI apps in it? Is there anything similar to electron or Tauri in Haskell? is there any TUI-related things in Haskell? is there anything else I can do using it? I like this language a lot and would like to learn the rest of it by building things. Would appreciate some projects and frameworks suggestions along with any relative knowledge you guys deem worthy to know.
 Thank you :D

 How To Use It For Fun and Profit
 haskell {-# LANGUAGE DeriveGeneric, DeriveAnyClass #-} import Flat data Direction &#x3D; North | South | Center | East | West deriving (Show,Generic,Flat) 
 Use flat to encode and unflat to decode:
 haskell unflat (flat [North,South]) :: Decoded [Direction] -&gt; Right [ North , South ] 
 And, thanks to Flat&#x27;s bit-encoding, this list fits in just 1 byte:
 haskell flatBits [North,South] -&gt; &quot;10010101&quot;

                              <span>When designing an API, I would design it &quot;JSON first&quot;. However, JSON puts some restrictions on my types. This makes me think that people don&#x27;t normally ToJSON their actual models, but instead create specific ViewModels that they then map to the actual models in a Servant handler. Is this correct?
 I also consider doing some JSON -&gt; Haskell code gen, since reverse engineering what the JSON is going to look like from a Haskell type is not obvious to me. Say a type like
 data Test &#x3D; Test Int Int
 If you use Servant, what are your experiences?

                              <span>I come from an Android dev background and have been working with C# and Java for the past 3 years. My team has a project that involves stream processing coming up where we will be using the Kafka Streams API. I thought this is the perfect time to introduce Kotlin and encourage a switch from Java. I really loved Kotlin specifically for its hybrid OOP/functional approach and for its null-safety. It was easy to learn for me because I was familiar with Java, C#, Python, and JavaScript/TypeScript and it seems to combine a lot of great features from those languages as well as introducing great features of its own.
 However, I&#x27;m being told by organization leadership and more experienced coworkers that Scala is what we should use. I know these people have very little experience -- if any -- using …</span>

 Suffer no more.
 If, like many Haskell developers these days, you use the Haskell Language Server and VS Code you can immediately transform any Haskell source file in a rough and ready notebook.

 round&#x27; :: Double -&gt; Integer -&gt; Double round&#x27; num sgnf &#x3D; (fromIntegral . round $ num * f) / f where f &#x3D; 10^sgnf 
 And I&#x27;d like to nail down exactly why the fromIntegral is needed. The obvious thing to do is find out what types round is dealing with, i.e., round :: (RealFrac a, Integral b) &#x3D;&gt; a -&gt; b , and then assume it doesn&#x27;t work to try to divide the outcome of round by a integer. And don&#x27;t be fooled when the naked literals, e.g., 844.666 / 100 do work, since it&#x27;s really fromRational 844.666/fromInteger 100. Which is not what (round $ num * f) / f is giving us. So round results in an Integral, (round 844.666 :: Integral b &#x3D;&gt; b) , which needs to be passed to fromIntegral. But now I&#x27;m confused. Integral is a class. Can someone explain exactly what&#x27;s going on here?

 I do a few things that would really benefit from me being able to just run a single command and have a specific window layout set up - visit this file here, this one down here, [exwm-specific] &quot;run this command and position the resulting window here&quot;, etc. etc.
 For a more concrete example: take &quot;scheduling doctor&#x27;s appointments.&quot; Inevitably I need:
  
1) a firefox window for a map,
 2) a second firefox window for my voip webapp,

                              <span>In my ongoing quest to optimize my TRAMP setup for slow servers, I&#x27;ve tackled an annoyance where magit does a lot of work looking up a suitable git executable and whatnot when trying to set up auto reverts. I actually enjoy the auto-revert behavior on my local machine, but the aforementioned behavior was making visiting files very slow on some servers I work on. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ve overlooked an easier way to do this (I&#x27;ve tried a few) but I&#x27;ve settled on the following method using advice, I thought I&#x27;d share this in case it&#x27;s useful (or if there&#x27;s a better way out there).

  (defun my-magit-auto-revert-mode-advice (orig-fun &amp;rest args) (unless (and buffer-file-name (file-remote-p buffer-file-name)) (apply orig-fun args))) (advice-add &#x27;magit-turn-on-auto-revert-mode-if-desired :around #&#x27;my-magit-auto-revert-mode-advice))

                              <span>Hi,
 can you recommend me a session manager what can save / open buffers without a file (I just open a buffer write something down, don&#x27;t save it) like notepad++ ... I know the editor save it somewhere but I don&#x27;t want to bother about it.

 I&#x27;m currently using lisp-mode for The Knowledge Machine .km files, but it is not indenting things the way the documentation shows it. For example, this is how the handbook represents the following:
 (parts has (instance-of (Slot)) (domain (Physobj)) (range (Physobj)) (cardinality (1-to-N)) (inverse (part-of)) (subslots (mechanical-parts body-parts))) (mechanical-parts has (instance-of (Slot)) (superslots (parts))) (wheel-count has (instance-of (Slot)) (domain (Vehicle)) (range (Integer)) (cardinality (N-to-1))) 
 but when I indent the region containing it in lisp-mode, I get:
 (parts has (instance-of (Slot)) (domain (Physobj)) (range (Physobj)) (cardinality (1-to-N)) (inverse (part-of)) (subslots (mechanical-parts body-parts))) (mechanical-parts has (instance-of (Slot)) (superslots (parts))) (wheel-count has (instance-of (Slot)) (domain (Vehicle)) (range (Integer)) (cardinality (N-to-1))) 
 the problem (stuff pushed way out to the right) is worse for concepts that have longer names than wheel-count. I&#x27;m sure that there must be, if not a dedicated KM mode that I simply cannot find, an existing mode that can be customized to produce the handbook formatting, but I can&#x27;t find it.
 Edit 2: added a couple of more example declarations, all from page 12 of the KM user manual (pdf).

                              <span>Hi, I am working with org-element APIs and have a question, how to create an org-mode buffer given an org-element object?
 I&#x27;ve created an org-element object using &#x60;org-element-create&#x60; and some other APIs, and wonder how to dump it into org-mode content in an empty buffer. I searched the Internet, but cannot find anything useful.

                              <span>Hello, using showkey.el pretty well, just a minor issue. When using showkey-log-mode every time I do a keystroke the cursor jumps in the KEYS window, obstructing me to work inside the buffer where I want to navigate and extract the commands. Is there to always stay in that current window that I am executing code while the showkey window just reports?

                              <span>I started using emacs (doom; evil-mode enabled) on macOS and I am using the international US-layout. When I write German I can usually type “option-s” to get an “ß”. I emacs “option-s” becomes “meta-s” and therefore I have a problem.
 The only way I found so far is typing ‘c-x 8 “ s’ which is really cumbersome. Is there some better way I could utilize?

 I need this to add nodes in org-roam with spaces in the name.
 I was able to write a space on windows with Alt+Space Bar or some combination like this, but now I&#x27;m working on Arch Linux and this combination doesn&#x27;t work.
 Does someone know how to disable the search for a match on space bar in the config?

 Where is the best place to change the color of the message first given when you attempt to exit an edit with changes in place, but you don&#x27;t want to save the changes. Basically you just hit c-x c-v.?.
 In my instance, that text is dark blue on a black background and it is hard to read.
 And to those who would RTFM - where is the FM is should have read to find this out myself? I looked around and did not see the answer.

                              <span>Staged programming consists of evaluating parts of a program at compile time
for greater efficiency at runtime, as some computations would have already been
executed or made more efficient during compilation. The poster child for
staged programming is the exponential function: to compute a^b, if b is
known at compile time, a^b can be replaced by b explicit
multiplications. Staged programming allows you to write
a^5, but have the expression compile to a*a*a*a*a.
In Haskell, the traditional way to do staged programming is to
reach for Template Haskell. Template Haskell
is, after all, designed for this purpose and gives you strong
guarantees that the produced code is indeed a*a*a*a*a, as
desired. On the other hand it does feel a little heavyweight and
programmers, in practice, tend to avoid e…</span>

                              <span>So I’ve finally gotten a gmail setup working (mysync,mu4e), next step mu4e contexts and adding my Fastmail. But none of the walkthroughs and tips I’ve found online awknowledge multiple Fastmail addresses on a single account. 
 TL;DR: One Fastmail account, but several aliases/virtual addresses. So myemail@fastmail.com has addresses coolguy@mydomain.com and supercool@mydomain.com and wow@mydomain.com. The Fastmail client has a drop down for send from, and automatically sends email from the right alias when I reply. How do I duplicate this?
 I see no reference to send from or reply-to in any of the setups. Manually editing the from: line when sending from mu4e does nothing… the from and reply lines are just overwritten to whatever I have set for sending email. 
 Thanks for any help or pointing me to appropriate resources. (Setting up on Mac now, but will be xplat).

                              <span>Hello,
 I have created a library to manage property trees in Emacs. It started as a package to support some personal elisp projects but then I thought that it could be useful also to somebody else, so I have written an hopefully decent piece of documentation for it.
 You can find it on Melpa and on Github.
 Any feedback would be appreciated.
 Thanks,

                              <span>I have been looking for a solution to my full migration from tmux + vim to emacs. Because I write most of my code in Common Lisp now, it makes sense. 
 I use vanilla emacs with a few custom plugins and themes. 
 I saw spacemacs has a &quot;layouts&quot; feature that MAY be the solution to not using tmux.
 How can I install layouts in emacs? I cannot seem to find an individual mode for it? 
 Or is it custom to space?

                              <span>Is it just me, or does anyone else feel like learning elisp involves using an inordinate number of anti-patterns? For example, I was trying to figure out how to call a function that could create a new org entry from an org template, with certain values passed in as parameters. I kept running into a wall, until I realized that I needed to set a global variable to a plist containing the values, and then access those values using elisp in the template. This would be a sure sign that someone doesn’t know what the hell they’re doing in any other language I know of, but it seems to just be how things work in the EMacs/elisp world. I can only imagine how bad my code would be if I learned by hacking on EMacs…. 
 Is this just a function of EMacs being an older system that was developed before more best practices were developed? Is there some other justification for doing things this way? Or am I overblowing how often things work like this?

 But when I try to decrypt it and run org-decrypt-entry I am not prompted with anything and nothing changes.
 This is the configuration I use.
 (require &#x27;org-crypt) (org-crypt-use-before-save-magic) (setq org-tags-exclude-from-inheritance (quote (&quot;crypt&quot;))) (setq org-crypt-key nil) 
 Edit: This is the guide I followed, Configuring Emacs for (symmetric) Org Mode Encryption.

 This feature is originated from the awesome guys from emacs-ng (kind-of hibernated now). I extracted the WebRender related work into a new repo and made some small changes. Now it can be built and run under macOS, which supposed to works on all main platforms.
 Well, Linux build seems more solid. On macOS, I realized some issues I&#x27;ll just drop it here hoping some macOS Emacs guys wants to improve it. Haven&#x27;t tested on Windows.
  
the meta key not working on MacOS
 Crash after switching to background
  
This configuration option I am using on macOS
 ./configure --with-wr --without-ns --with-gnutls&#x3D;ifavailable CFLAGS&#x3D;&quot;-Wno-implicit-function-declaration&quot; 
  
Code lives https://git.sr.ht/~declantsien/WREmacs
 For Guix user on Linux I have emacs-next-wr definition here.
 This is demo video on macOS.

                              <span>I love emacs. It&#x27;s the thing I didn&#x27;t know I wanted for years. But since I&#x27;ve started learning it, I&#x27;m feeling stagnated, like I&#x27;m missing something. I know basic key chords, and I&#x27;ve started messing around with org mode, and I have a couple functions and keybinds in my init.el (all copy-pasted from the internet, of course). But I feel like there&#x27;s a gap yet to be bridged, and I don&#x27;t know where to start, because I don&#x27;t feel I truly understand emacs. 
 In short, what do I have to do to progress beyond being an emacs beginner? What resources should I use? When will I be able to use emacs for everything?

                              <span>Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;m trying to do:
 I&#x27;ve been using relative line numbers, which are great for moving x amount of lines up/down, especially in large files. On occasion, though, I&#x27;ll need to move to a specific line number (for example, if reading about a line from documentation or an error buffer). In those situations, I want to see all the absolute line numbers. My solution has been:
 (advice-add &#x27;goto-line-read-args :before (lambda () (setq display-line-numbers &#x27;absolute))) (advice-add &#x27;goto-line :after (lambda (_LINE &amp;optional _BUFFER _RELATIVE) (setq display-line-numbers &#x27;relative))) 
 This works perfectly. However, some times I change my mind after calling goto-line, and decide to do something else instead. When I quit out of goto-line (C-g), the second advice doesn&#x27;t get run and I&#x27;m stuck with absolute line numbers. Obviously it&#x27;s not much of a pain to set them back to relative, but I&#x27;m wondering if there&#x27;s a way to do it automatically.
 I&#x27;m also asking because I&#x27;m trying to get more familiar with how the advising functionality works, and I&#x27;d like to understand if there&#x27;s a way to get out the quit issue. It seems to me that sometimes there are advices that need to run, even if the function has been quit. Is there a way to make sure that happens?

                              <span>Sorry I posted and deleted because I accidentally put paredit instead of yasnippet lol. Copy mode doesn&#x27;t seem to assist at all for calling insert snippet. Would love some suggestions.

                              <span>Dear all,
 I&#x27;m very excited to announce release 3.12 of Copilot. Copilot is a stream-based DSL for writing and monitoring embedded C programs, with an emphasis on correctness and hard realtime requirements. Copilot is typically used as a high-level runtime verification framework, and supports temporal logic (LTL, PTLTL and MTL), clocks and voting algorithms.
 Among others, Copilot has been used at the Safety Critical Avionics Systems Branch of NASA Langley Research Center for monitoring test flights of drones. It also serves as a runtime monitoring backend for the requirements elicitation tool FRET (https://github.com/NASA-SW-VnV/fret/), via Ogma (https://github.com/nasa/ogma).
 ​
 Copilot can be used to generate hard realtime C99 monitors from requirements in structured natural language, …</span>

                              <span>I recently came across https://theam.github.io/tintin/index.html. It took a few minutes to get working (use stack with lts-14.21, have a &quot;synopsis&quot; field in .cabal file), but I really like the aesthetic of the docs, the ease of use (markdown files, latex support, runs Haskell in markdown docs). 
 The only downside is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to be maintained, and doesn&#x27;t work for ghc 9.
 If the authors are reading this, did they get discouraged from maintaining it because of low adoption, and how hard do they think it would be for me to update it? I&#x27;d absolutely love to use it instead of sphinx for the monad-bayes docs that I wrote here, but that library uses ghc 9

 ​
 I&#x27;m here because I want to learn Haskell programming language, and we study it in the university, but the problem is, our teacher jumped directly to logical gates chapter, now he wants from us to write the code of logical gate XOR !!!!
 So if there is any resource where I can learn, please, drop it in the comments.
 And thank you.

                              <span>I just realized that I had a heated debate last year at a local LUG meetup here in China with one of the most active Archlinux package maintainers (whose name some of you probably know but I&#x27;d rather not mention) about the status quo of Haskell on Archlinux. It was a painful and long debate; I didn&#x27;t post anything immediately after, but now that I think about it the debate eventually boiled down to, as I called it,
 A BROKEN PACKAGE IS BETTER THAN AN INSECURE PACKAGE. 
 If Haskell cannot manage to (at least pretend to) successfully update a dynamic library dependency without recompilation and/or large-scale ad-hoc per-package manual patching and/or 100x performance penalty due to uneliminated indirection, then it&#x27;s Haskell&#x27;s fault for doing so. Packages in other languages can get broken by security patches as well; it&#x27;s just that they often (at least pretend to) work and Haskell breaks too often.
 I never realized that security patches are his first and foremost concern since he never seemed to have expressed that explicitly regarding this issue. But now it has all come together.

                              <span>I programmed in Haskell for many years, but eventually switched to Rust a few years ago on the lure of it being a kind of poor man&#x27;s functional language, but with absolutely kickass performance. 
 The syntax is atrocious, but the compiler is almost magical, with the generated assembly resembling nothing like what I wrote in Rust (which looks more Haskelly than Rusty, with my indoctrination into Haskell years ago ...), but like what I might write directly in assembly. At this point, I am surprised when it doesn&#x27;t optimize like this. 
 I never did see is kind of performance in Haskell. Despite my best efforts, when I rewrite in Haskell, it rarely gets any faster than 0.1x to 0.3x the speed of the Rust equivalent. When you need the speed and not just the language niceties, this is depressing.
 Does Haskell/GHC have a chance at hitting this kind of performance? Is it a matter of manpower/mindpower/time, or are there fundamental limitations that make this practically impossible?

I want to thanks to this forum and to the person that create the blog.  I&#x27;ve been using the Zettlekasten method from 7 months and it really, but really speed up my research.
During my bachelor I always tried to digitalice my  physical notebooks (I use them to make summaries and draw my ideas) to avoid carry a lot of weight with me an to access to the information quickly. I tried to scanner them and store them in evernote but it was uncomfortable to read and there is no advantage over a physical notebook when I have to create new ideas.
At the beginning of the covid I was in my second year of my Ph.D. I search for methods to digitalice ideas and be more productive and I find the PARA me…</span>

                              <span>i have been rattling my brain with this problem for hours and ill probably kick myself when i see a solution
 i need to change a list of strings into a list of different tuples depending on what is within the string
 in my code i have this line:
 data example &#x3D; Number Integer | Text String
 i need to go through a list of strings and if a String is an integer number (for example 78) it will be changed into the tuple (&quot;Number&quot;, 78), and if it contains just text (for example the word &quot;trees&quot;) it will be changed into the tuple (&quot;Text&quot;, &quot;Trees&quot;)
 to keep it simple assume that any string passed into the function can only be integers or just plain text, but they are all Strings

                              <span>GHC2021 has TypeOperators in it: https://ghc.gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/doc/users_guide/exts/control.html#extension-GHC2021 which in turn implies ExplicitNamespaces: https://ghc.gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/doc/users_guide/exts/type_operators.html#extension-TypeOperators
 A quick grep on the GHC source (9.2.4 is the one i&#x27;ve used for this) also seems to have it here: https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/blob/ghc-9.2.4-release/compiler/GHC/Driver/Session.hs#L1448
 Yet this program:
 {-# LANGUAGE GHC2021 #-} module Main where import Servant.API (type (:&gt;)) main :: IO () main &#x3D; undefined 
 fails with:
 ~/w/test $ ghc Main.hs bin/Main.hs:4:26: error: Illegal keyword &#x27;type&#x27; (use ExplicitNamespaces to enable) | 3 | import Servant.API (type (:&gt;)) | ^^^^ 
 but if I add TypeOperators to the above program then it succeeds:
 ~/w/test $ ghc Main.hs [1 of 1] Compiling Main ( Main.hs, Main.o ) Linking Main ... 
 Anyone knows why this is? What am I missing?

                              <span>After a long research I came to the conclusion that probably the best way to build Haskell projects is to use Nix + Cabal as described in this comment https://www.reddit.com/r/NixOS/comments/7h8np7/stack_or_cabal_which_one_is_more_preferable_for/dqp268b/ or https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/tvbrmp/stack_compared_to_cabalinstall/i38g4my/ and some blog posts around the internet.
 This gives you all the advantages like binary caches (no need to compile dependencies), incremental builds, non-Haskell dependencies and other things you would expect in a modern build system. Stack was an attempt in that direction but is generally considered inferior compared to Nix + Cabal.
 So why isn&#x27;t there a tool that simply combines (or automates) the setup of a local nix environment + cabal + cabal2nix? 
 I think we could even achieve something like &quot;npx&quot; or &quot;pipx&quot; that allows us to run a Haskell application with just one command, e.g. &quot;hpx pandoc&quot; that installs and runs Haskell application for you on the fly.

                              <span>Hi, ladies and gentlemen. Can someone please sanity check my answer to a question from A guide to PureScript numeric hierarchy. In the end of matrices chapter the author asks:
  
Since matrices correspond to linear mappings, we can also conclude that linear mappings form a noncommutative ring where the multiplication operation is function composition. What will the addition operation be? (Hint: it’s the linear mapping analogue of matrix addition.)
  
I guess it&#x27;s the sum of two applications of linear mappings, like so: f(x) + g(x), where x is a matrix.
 Am I correct?

                              <span>Howdy! I originally posted this question on r/linux, and it was suggested to post it here as well.
 I&#x27;m installing Gentoo, and I&#x27;m looking at either StumpWM or EXWM as a WM, and I&#x27;m leaning toward EXWM simply because Emacs. However, I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a lot I don&#x27;t know about the comparison between them. I&#x27;m wondering if you nice folks might share your insights.
 I use Emacs a lot, and plan on using it more and more as I get my config dialed in. I&#x27;m fully invested in Emacs, and consider it to be part of the OS, so I&#x27;ll be using it either way. I think having more stuff in Emacs is nothing but handy. I will be using this setup on several PCs, including a crappy laptop, a gaming laptop, and a few desktops. Gaming is the main thing I&#x27;m worried about. I just use KDE on the gaming laptop for now.
 I&#x27;m also interested in programming, specifically in Lisp. I&#x27;m leaning more toward Common Lisp, which is what StumpWM is written in. Of course EXWM is Emacs Lisp, but that&#x27;s kind of Emacs-specific and wouldn&#x27;t be used for other software development. I&#x27;ve also considered learning scheme because I have a copy of SICP, but that&#x27;s taters under the skillet.
 Finally, I&#x27;m a few months away from getting going on managing a homelab. None of the servers will run this system, but all of the management will be done through it on my main PC. I will be doing a lot of multitasking, troubleshooting, remote-management, security stuff, note-taking, etc.
 So, in a nutshell, I&#x27;m wondering: - What can StumpWM do that EXWM can&#x27;t do? - What can EXWM do that StumpWM can&#x27;t do? - What are the major limitations of each, specifically when compared to one another? - How will each compare when stacked against the things I want to use it for? - How does the ecosystem for each one compare? I know the Emacs ecosystem decently well, but not StumpWM&#x27;s. Are there many plugins / extensions? Are there many users communicating regularly with each other?

                              <span>I&#x27;m wondering, are there any guide or tutorials out there about Evil that are targeted at non-vim users? I&#x27;m particularly interested in what you get with the evil +everywhere module, ie evil and the essential packages you&#x27;d want for editing.
 I&#x27;ve done evil-tutor but it&#x27;s pretty limited. I&#x27;m in the situation where I&#x27;m trying to use vim keybindings because they hurt my wrists less than chords. I&#x27;m okay with hjkl, c, d, r, i, a, f, w, b but other than that I&#x27;m pretty clueless.
 I don&#x27;t want to read a bunch of vim tutorials only to find out they use a bunch of packages that work different than evil. And I&#x27;m looking for the common editing operations that aren&#x27;t included in evil, like parens or s-exp manipulation.

 (setq org-download-image-dir &quot;~/org/references/notes/images/&quot; org-download-heading-lvl nil org-download-image-attr-list &#x27;(&quot;#+ATTR_ORG: :width 300&quot;) ) (after! org-download (setq org-download-method &#x27;directory org-download-timestamp &quot;%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S_&quot; org-download-link-format &quot;[[file:~/org/references/notes/images/%s]]\n&quot; )) 
 It was working earlier but now whenever I run org-download-screenshot, I keep getting the error wrong type argument when I take a screenshot on my mac.
 The images are being saved in a new folder in the same directory as the org file and not in my ~/org/references/notes/images/ anymore.

                              <span>This post details compiling and installing the *.deb files for Emacs 28.2 using the Debian maintainer&#x27;s git repository intended for sid. Yes, emacswiki mentions 2 repositories from which one may install such newer Emacs versions, so this post is partly intended as an exercise of getting to know Debian&#x27;s packaging tools.
 Note, it doesn&#x27;t seem easily possible to compile Emacs 28.2 on Debian 9, so I had to upgrade one of my machines to Debian 10 for this to work.
 To compile and install the Emacs packages except for the info manual:
 mkdir -p ~/src/deb/ cd ~/src/deb/ git clone https://salsa.debian.org/rlb/deb-emacs.git cd deb-emacs/ sudo apt install packaging-dev # For quilt, etc. # Edit files to use gcc-10 and related packages instead of gcc-12: sed -i &#x27;s#gcc-12#gcc-10#&#x27; debian/control debi…</span>

 error: This revision of snap &quot;emacs&quot; was published using classic confinement and thus may perform arbitrary system changes outside of the security sandbox that snaps are usually confined to, which may put your system at risk.
 If you understand and want to proceed, repeat this command including --classic.

 Could it really damage my host OS?

                              <span>My use of org roam is pretty basic. The last couple months I was just using a journal, as the easist thing to do to build up some note taking muscle. The trouble with this is that for a given project, say, the notes for it are spread all over the file, I want to bring them together. Enter org roam.
 I have a file per entity (person, project, journal, interview) and most entries are dated. Each week I like to review whats gone on and write up some conclusions, using the journal this was easy, but now not so much.
 Is there a way to search my org dir, for a date range (last week), and pull together all of the matching nodes, and display them with the title and file tags from the orignal files? Been reading about consult this morning, and that sounds like a possible route, but figure I&#x27;d ask for some guidance. 
 I guess I could go the other way, just use a journal and tag each node, and pull together the entity nodes adhoc, but that would rely on being very consistent with tags, which seems more error prone to me. Happy for any tips if others go this route.

 How to find out what couse it? Maybe there is something like debug-on-variable-change for watching functions (I&#x27;ve checked, it doesn&#x27;t work for functions).

                              <span>Hi,
 org-ql-search working terrific for me in searching agenda files and open buffers. However, am trying to figure how to search recursively in a specific directory and have that show up in the Buffers/Files: options along with org-agenda-files and org-directory.
 My org files folder structure is not flat, so the straight org-directory variable isn&#x27;t working for me as I think searches only the folder specified.
 (I do use deft right now, which filters down files but the grouped results buffer of org-ql would be a lot more helpful)
 Any pointers very much appreciated.

We&#x27;re a bit too early in the establishment of this concept for anyone to have written a canonical definition yet.

                              <span>Can someone please tell me how can I force #&#x27;completing-read to search not only in the displayed rows, but also within annotations?
 Consider a trivial example such as this:
 (let* ((coll &#x27;((&quot;Affenpinscher&quot; . &quot;Loyal and amusing&quot;) (&quot;Akita&quot; . &quot;Ancient Japanese&quot;) (&quot;Bulldog&quot; . &quot;Kind but courageous&quot;) (&quot;Caucasian Shepherd&quot; . &quot;Serious guarding breed&quot;) (&quot;Miniature Schnauzer&quot; . &quot;Long-lived and low-shedding&quot;))) (completion-extra-properties &#x27;(:annotation-function (lambda (k) (let ((desc (alist-get k minibuffer-completion-table nil nil #&#x27;string&#x3D;))) (format &quot;\n\t%s&quot; desc)))))) (completing-read &quot;Select a breed: &quot; coll)) 
 Evaling this snippet would display names of the dog breeds, along with annotated descriptions. And if I type &quot;sheph&quot;, it would correctly narrow the search to &quot;Caucasian Shepherd&quot;. But I also want to be able to type &quot;long&quot; and to find &quot;Miniature Schnauzer&quot;, but sadly, it doesn&#x27;t work that way. How can I change that?

                              <span>How do you develop Xcode projects using Swift/SwiftUI in Emacs?
 I want to use Emacs as alternative to Xcode since text editting capability of Emacs is so powerfull and I got used to it.
 It seems there are several ways to do that but each one has some issues.
  
lsp-mode is broken for swift over a year. 
 lsp-sourcekit ;; completion stops working after lsp server returns an error #3028
 
 company-sourcekit and SourceKittenDaemon doesn&#x27;t work for .xcworkspace 
 Support for xcworkspace #73
 
 eglot doesn&#x27;t officially support Swift and doesn&#x27;t have instruction to get it working. 
 konrad1977&#x27;s comment on Swift support? #825 seems promissing though.

                              <span>(I&#x27;ve been muscling my way through the various dated on-line guides, and reddit help has been so key... thank you... I&#x27;m almost there ;))
 mbsync successfully gets my email into ~/.maildir/myGmail/
 mu info shows maildir as ~/.maildir
 Email is indexed, I can run mu commands and see emails, etc.
 TL;DR: Invoking mu4e in emacs then makes the [Gmail] structure under ~/.maildir rather than using the already existing ~/.maildir/[Gmail]. (The effect is I can go to unread email, but can&#x27;t jump to inbox or any directories because they aren&#x27;t where the mail is, they show all empty since they&#x27;re the new dirs mu4e made.)
 I have no idea where this would be coming from since I thought mu4e is just going to use the mu info. Also I was going to try to re-init mu with ~/.maildir/myGmail, but can&#x27;t figure out how the hell to do (and seems like it won&#x27;t work for multiple accounts anyway). I can&#x27;t seem to kill mu (can&#x27;t find the process), but trying to init says it may already be running.
 If you can point me toward additional info that would be great. I&#x27;m on mac homebrew emacs and mu. (Much thanks to u/FrostyX_cz blog post on getting mbsync up).

 I have a ZSA Moonlander keyboard. With their online configurator, I set up a key to run the Emacs macro &quot;C-x b&quot;, that is &quot;Press Ctrl-X, then press B&quot;.
 But when I use it, it emits &quot;x&quot; and &quot;b&quot; separately.
 I downloaded the source code for my firmware and it looks OK to me:
 case ST_MACRO_2: if (record-&gt;event.pressed) { SEND_STRING(SS_RCTL(SS_TAP(X_X)) SS_DELAY(100) SS_TAP(X_B)); } 
 Taps Right Ctrl with X, waits 100ms, then taps B. Which exactly what I want it to do.
 What am I missing? I tried inspecting the keyboard events and it still looks OK to me. Dump from evtest when I press that macro key: https://pastebin.com/fJp5kyR4
 Is it executed too fast for Emacs?

                              <span>Hello, first post here. I have been a happy emacs user since I knew about its existence and now I&#x27;m a even happier user of org. My question is about org&#x27;s indent mode and custom themes. Apparently, org&#x27;s indent mode creates the illusion of indentation by inserting dummy &#x27;*&#x27;s at the beginning of each sub-header, and making them invisible. When I switch custom themes, most themes do not consistently set colours in such a way that those dummy stars are invisible, that is, I guess, have the background colour. I am aware that custom themes cannot be undone by design, however, as a matter of fact, some themes do work consistently correctly with respect to indent mode, notably, all sanityinc&#x27;s ones. Is it feasible to isolate the relevant feature of sanityinc&#x27;s themes and replicate it in other themes to fix them?

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to create a script so I can use it with windows open-with in file explorer, it&#x27;s supposed to pass the filenames to emacs but here is the problem: 
 Emacs.bat:  wsl bash -c &quot;. ~/.bash_profile &amp;&amp; emacs %*&quot; 
 (. bash_profile is needed to export variables for x server to work properly)
 %* is expanded to windows style filenames with \ instead of /
 I tried to work around this by passing these arguments to bash script:
 Emacs.bat:  wsl bash -c &quot;. ~/.bash_profile &amp;&amp; ~/.emacs.d/windows-open %*&quot;  windows-open: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 !/bin/sh
 echo &quot;$@&quot; | tr &#x27;\&#x27; &#x27;/&#x27; # see how it expands
 emacs $(echo &quot;$@&quot; | tr &#x27;\&#x27; &#x27;/&#x27;)
  and trying to run:  PS C:\Users\wisni&gt; .\bin\Emacs.bat &quot;te\st lmao&quot;
 C:\Users\wisni&gt;wsl bash -c &quot;. ~/.bash_profile &amp;&amp; ~/.emacs.d/windows-open &quot;te\st lmao&quot;&quot; test &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; as you can see only the first word of was passed to the script (te\st) and \s was somehow escaped by the shell to just s.
 I had tried to use single quote instead of double quotes:  wsl bash -c &#x27;. ~/.bash_profile &amp;&amp; ~/.emacs.d/windows-open %*&#x27;  but it breaks even more badly: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; PS C:\Users\wisni&gt; .\bin\Emacs.bat &quot;te\st lmao&quot;
 C:\Users\wisni&gt;wsl bash -c &#x27;. ~/.bash_profile &amp;&amp; ~/.emacs.d/windows-open &quot;te\st lmao&quot;&#x27; /bin/bash: -c: line 0: unexpected EOF while looking for matching &#x27;&#x27; /bin/bash: -c: line 1: syntax error: unexpected end of file &#x60;&#x60; any idea how to do it?

 Agenda view will show:
 Friday 11 November 2022 test: Today :log: test: :log: 
 You can see that it&#x27;s filtered the date from the second headline. Whereas if I do a tag search, the result includes the date:
 Headlines with TAGS match: log Press ‘C-u r’ to search again test: Captain&#x27;s log :log: test: Today :log:: test:  :log:: 
 How can I get agenda view to not filter out the date? Sometimes I name entries only by or including the date, and I&#x27;d like that full title to appear in agenda view.

 I am not an audio engineer, but I found this link which might help. And perhaps recording in acoustically dead environments (like a coat closet), as often the speakers and hosts have echos.

 what happens if the field language happens twice as there are two languages spoken in that particular movie?
 what happens when I add multiple urls: imdb / moviedb / the official website?

 OrgModeClockingXBar - See what you are working on ;-) (if using orgmode clocking)
 I designed a hack to see your clocked-in task on your bar.
 The hack is composed of a few elements, Emacs code that adds hooks for clock-in and clock-out, a Python script to process a file with the Emacs output, and a code for Xbar.
 I have been using this for 2 years, and it&#x27;s pretty robust. I didn&#x27;t have time to share it before.
 The code is not perfect, if you quit your Emacs, without clocking-out the content of the file will not be changed so you will not see any update on the bar (at least not till next clocking-in or -out)

                              <span>Hello to all,
 I had the following idea: use org-mode as a chat. For exemple, if you would like to do the following: chat with someone who doesn&#x27;t know org-mode well, via org-mode.
 That is, he would just have to call commands like &quot;reply to this message&quot;, where each message could be a heading, and each file a topic of discussion. The files would be in a folder that would be shared. This would largely mirror the layout of reddit replies. 
 Edit and precision : a person A would not have to be logged in to receive B&#x27;s message, just like on reddit or any other modern communication medium.
 ​
 Also, the power of org-mode could be used: combined with org-babel, org-attach, org-roam etc... that would be really cool.
 ​
 Is there a package to do this? If so which one? If not, would someone like to do it with me? Is it a good idea to make a package or is there an easier way?

                              <span>I just started trying to use Org Mode on a Mac Book Air (intel). I’m using the new Ventura OS. So I’m asking the hive mind how to get permissions to search the folders in agenda mode. I can open an org file and modify it, but I can’t search in agenda mode due to permissions. Other apps will prompt me for permission but with EMacs it just gives an error.
 Show me where to give Emacs permission to search the Dropbox folder.

I&#x27;ve created my first note, which contains the citation data and table of contents for a book I&#x27;m reading. I&#x27;m using Hookmark hooks to link from the table of contents. So, clicking a link in the note takes me to the linked page in the PDF. But hook links tend to be long, and add visual clutter to the note. Is there a way to hide the URL, leaving only the syntax coloring to show that the item is linked (without rendering the note in Marked2)?</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m starting at a new large company shortly and I&#x27;ll need to justify why I want Emacs on my computer.
 For context:
  
the new firm is a Microsoft shop - to the extent that &quot;cloud&quot; &#x3D;&#x3D; &quot;Azure&quot; (only) and GNU Linux or Apple is not even a dream at the moment
 I&#x27;m going to be one of the grown-ups in the room, running a team of technical people, but not coders, I guess the closest concept is technology consulting (if any of my team has ever heard of Emacs I&#x27;ll be surprised!)
 as a grown-up I&#x27;ll not be writing much (any) code, and I&#x27;m guessing coders get VSCode, because, well, MS
 I code, so elisp will be invaluable to me to build all those little tools to actually GSD
 I&#x27;m not a windows person, so I don&#x27;t have any starting points for windows-specific examples
  
So when I go in and say to tech that I want to install this currently non-approved &quot;text editor&quot;, I want to be able to say that Emacs is so much more than an editor, but using an example that translates to a Windows tech support person.
 I thought of something like &quot;Windows isn&#x27;t just a way of displaying windows, it&#x27;s an operating system&quot; - but I&#x27;m not sure that suggesting I&#x27;m installing a whole new operating system is a good look on day one...
 Does anyone have a good way of describing (concisely) Emacs in an analogy?
 I&#x27;ve seen this link, but it seemed to get into arguments around web browsers and JS and answers that were for a full on discussion, rather than a quick justification like I need. Did I miss any other discussions that I should have seen before posting?

                              <span>I&#x27;m usually programming in vscode or intellij during my working hours and wanted to make a slow switch to emacs for my side projects. Both of these options have a &quot;find in files&quot; keybind (ctrl+shift+f) which I use constantly to jump around at different areas. 
 Is there something like this for emacs? I&#x27;m on windows and have tried &#x27;elgrep&#x27; but it just doesn&#x27;t seem near as efficient as what I was using before because I have to set the directory, reg exp for files, reg exp to ignore files, etc etc... 
 Maybe there is some way to create a command to do this for me or a better/easier to use plugin out there.

                              <span>I am trying to use dired for copying and moving files over ssh. Instead of waiting for the operation, I found that I can use dired-async from emacs-async to make the operation asyncronous.
 However, now I have no way that indicates progress of copy/move operations. Is there a solution for this? In general, what do people use to indicate progress of processes that emacs spawns?

                              <span>UPDATE: You can see the quote below, but looks like google got rid of apps that sign in with &quot;only username and password.&quot; So, wtf aside, what&#x27;s the technique then? (looks like they didn&#x27;t break legacy so this will only affect new setups). Thanks again.
 ​
 To eliminate possibilities and simplify I&#x27;m just sending my password in Pass &quot;&quot; in the .mbsyncrc. Everything installed via homebrew on mac. (following the System Crafters youtube setup instructions). The first error was:
 ---------
 ...
 Connection is now encrypted
 Logging in...
 Authenticating with SASL mechanism PLAIN-CLIENTTOKEN...
 Error performing SASL authentication step: SASL(-7): invalid parameter supplied: Parameter Error in /System/Volumes/Data/SWE/macOS/BuildRoots/d7e177bcf5/Library/Caches/com.apple.xbs/Sources/passwordserver_saslplugins/passwordserver_saslplugins-194/plain_clienttoken.c near line 195
 C: 1/1 B: 0/0 F: +0/0 *0/0 #0/0 N: +0/0 *0/0 #0/0
 ------------
 From (https://macowners.club/posts/email-emacs-mu4e-macos/) I added AuthMechs PLAIN to the .mbsynrc file (also tried adding SSLVersions and SystemCertificates no). After that the error is just:
 Connection is now encrypted
 Logging in...
 Authenticating with SASL mechanism PLAIN...
 IMAP command &#x27;AUTHENTICATE PLAIN &#x27; returned an error: NO [AUTHENTICATIONFAILED] Invalid credentials (Failure)
 C: 1/1 B: 0/0 F: +0/0 *0/0 #0/0 N: +0/0 *0/0 #0/0
 ------_
 But the password is verified correct so I&#x27;m very confused to be stuck so early. Thank for any light you can shed on this (or if maybe there is a better place to post this... its all about getting email into emacs). I also used the info in the mac link above to export my certificates for a root certificate, don&#x27;t know if that would be related since I never quite groked certs.
 ​
 Thanks.

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I&#x27;ve been using emacs org-mode to organize my life and take personal notes for about 8 months now. It has taken over my life in the best possible way, and I&#x27;m currently trying to find a way to have it replace LibreOffice as my word processor. Does anyone have example configs or recommended packages for this?
 ​
 My two main requirements are checking for spelling and grammatical errors (checking grammar is particularly important), and the ability to make/edit rtf files so that my non-tech savy colleagues can open the files.

 This will fetch it from the git repo directly and straight will take care of the rest.

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;m on NixOS with packages aspell, aspellDicts.en, aspellDicts.de installed. When I switch to german dictionary in emacs 28.1 via ispell-change-dictionary and try to check a word with M-$, I get the following messages:
  
Starting new Ispell process /run/current-system/sw/bin/aspell with german dictionary...done
 ispell-init-process: Error: The file &quot;/nix/store/96n79c5sfssmn24rpfy7gvsfxcw959k2-aspell-0.60.8/lib/aspell/german&quot; can not be opened for reading.
  
I&#x27;ve set ispell-aspell-dict-dir (and also tried setting ispell-aspell-data-dir) to /run/current-system/sw/lib/aspell, where german.alias and other dictionary files like de.dat can be found. Unfortunately this does not have any effect, ispell.el still tries to open the dictionary via the /nix/store directory of the aspell package (not aspellDicts.de package!) like in the messages above.
 Does anyone have any idea how to fix that?

 Is there a way to make either eglot recognize those or make flymake ignore them?

                              <span>It takes a lot of typing to add code blocks in org-mode file. Example:
 This is text. #+begin_src print(&#x27;hello, this is code&#x27;) #+end_src This is text again. 
 Even if we reduce typing with convenient key bindings, this way of writing code blocks also adds a lot of clutter to the org-mode file. Is there some way to use simpler syntax to make code blocks? I like how easy it is to make code blocks in Markdown with triple-backquotes. Someone knows something similar for org-mode?

                              <span>Hi,
 So I’ve been using Doom now for 1.5 year. 
 I use emacs daily for notes in org-mode, magit, dired and occasional Python programming, but without lsp support as I can’t get it working inside a dev container. 
 All of my “customizations” are just modules I enabled with corresponding flags in doom. 
 I really like the doom experience but I can’t help to feel somewhat stuck as whenever I get some lisp error or want to change something I’m just lost and have no clue what to do. 
 In all other areas of programming I would never accept this, but I just find it so difficult to reach the “next” level and don’t exactly know how. 
 I’ve considered trying a Vanilla eMacs experience for the sake of learning, but then all my productivity would be lost. 
 What was the best thing you did in order to advance to an intermediate level as a beginner?

 I&#x27;m in the process of switching from Obsidian to Emacs because I want to integrate LaTeX stuff especially algorithms into my notes.
 Is it possible to have a PDF snippet inside an org note?
 Or maybe LaTeX code and being able to evaluate the LaTeX stuff?
 Edit: I need real LaTeX and not just math expressions.

                              <span>Hi all,
 i haven&#x27;t used Org / org-contacts for managing my contacts for years, and with so many other commitments on my plate, i no longer have the resources or interest to continue trying to maintain org-vcard, and deal with the data produced by the software of tech multinationals.
 org-vcard was my first Emacs package - i created it in 2014, even though i&#x27;d been using Emacs for decades by that point - and unfortunately, it shows. In recent times i&#x27;ve been trying to do some code cleanup, but to say that there are &#x27;infelicities&#x27; - both within the code itself, and in terms of the UX - is an understatement.
 At one point i started doing some work to move to a parser based on the grammars defined in the three vCard specs (2.1, 3.0, 4.0, with differences between them significant enough to make trying to deal with them Less Than Fun), but that didn&#x27;t get particularly far.
 i&#x27;d also toyed with creating an ELisp CardDAV library and refactoring org-vcard to make use of that, but that never eventuated either. (Partly, if i recall correctly, because when i first looked into doing this, there was a bug in Emacs&#x27; XML parsing; it got fixed, but the fix took a while to appear in an Emacs release.)
 If anyone is interested in taking maintainership, please contact me (Alexis) at the email address listed in the project repo.

 I saw this approach many times in other Haskell projects so I’d like to know whether this is the correct approach when using map/filter/foldl. 
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;haskell -- approach 1 -- does work, but why? append :: String -&gt; [String] append &#x3D; map (++&quot;!&quot;) . words
 -- approach 2 -- does work -- append :: String -&gt; [String] -- append line &#x3D; map (++&quot;!&quot;) (words line)
 -- approach 3 -- does not work -- append :: String -&gt; [String] -- append line &#x3D; map (++&quot;!&quot;) . (words line)
 main :: IO() main &#x3D; do print $ append $ &quot;Hello World&quot; &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 The output is:  [“Hello!”, “World!”]

                              <span>I&#x27;m considering starting a London Haskell meetup, or reviving it if it used to happen but lost ownership.
 I&#x27;ve not been able to find anything active on meetup.com - but I also guess an FP meetup would be perfectly fine too (just also couldn&#x27;t find many in London).
 In-person is important to me - I am as cautious as the next person - but I&#x27;d like to bootstrap something so that when everyone&#x27;s comfortable in a room again, it gets healthier as a community.
 I&#x27;ve got maybe 5 years writing HS, more or less as my primary off-the-clock language, so I&#x27;m not the most qualified technologist here, but can definitely speak to some of my specifics (quirks with getting performant WASM from Asterius, fun quarantine games built on IHP, music gen, etc).
 I&#x27;ve never dabbled in meetups and I&#x27;m really missing a sense of community even though I work in tech (FAANG).
 So - please, any wisdom, all appreciated!
 (if I missed an already active one then job done - please just show me it :) )

                              <span>Hi community! I&#x27;ve been working on a personal project for a while, and it&#x27;s been teaching me a lot about Haskell. I am applying currently for Haskell positions, so all your help and guidance into best practices and improvements is super appreciated! Roast me!
 I specially am curious on if there are ways to reuse some code and have less repetition, or to use some more advanced features, although I must say Haskell has helped to make developing this project and refactoring a pleasure! 
 The project is meant to replace sites like CifraClub or UltimateGuitar eventually, in a community driven manner. Help me realize the dream :) I plan to create some Docker image to more easily deploy, but I am open to all ideas and suggestions.
 I also learnt quite a lot about MongoDB but it&#x27;s my first time using, so it might be noticeable.
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I&#x27;ve just seen the post related to the new release of Fourmolu and thought I have a look into it. 
 Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t fit my style. However it reminded me that formatters existed (so far, I&#x27;ve been formatting everything manually for years) and it might be time to finally adopt one. I started investigating and the result is, they are plenty (too many ?), some which might be deprecated and none of them correspond to my style (I think).
 I mean I think because most of them are configurable and it may be possible that one with the correct configuration will fit. So my question is ; is there any formatter which will fit the following requirements (or the closest, I am even ready to modify it if needed).
 I&#x27;m pretty much only require list be aligned on (leading comma), but I don&#x27;t want the formatter to add new line for me after an &#x3D;. so
 myList &#x3D; [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] 
 (my prefered way) or 
  myList &#x3D; [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] 
 If I have myself started [ 1 on the new line.
 function call like this (when too long)
 function arg1 ( other_function x y ) arg3 
 I do record like this (or equivalent)
 MyRecord &#x3D; MyRecord { x :: Float , y :: Float } 
 But the most peculiar thing I do is have a trailing let, ie
 my function a &#x3D; let x &#x3D; a+1 y &#x3D; a+10 in x*y 
 and I can&#x27;t find any formatter allowing it. I&#x27;m surprised nobody is doing it because it works really well. It&#x27;s compact : save one line and one level of indentation and neat to read.
 The rest, I don&#x27;t really care , I don&#x27;t need import to be sorted or case to be aligned etc . In fact I just need the level of indentation to be correct : children of things (list element, argument, etc eee) all with the same identation, but first children inline with the parent.

                              <span>All the examples seem to be independent Purescript code. I did not find any example to manipulate DOM or to do an action when page load such as document.ready in jquery. I did not have the chance to work with Angular or React yet so maybe I&#x27;m missing something. Is the goal of purescript to be able to develop frontends that manipulate DOM and make AJAX calls? Is there any documentation about this use case? Thanks

                              <span>Consider:
 import io.circe.generic.auto._, io.circe.syntax._ sealed trait Data case class Failed(foo: String, bar: String) extends Data case class Success(foo1:String, bar1:String) extends Data case class Task(Foo:String, Data: Data) val something &#x3D; Task(&quot;test&quot;, Failed(&quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;)) println(something.asJson) 
 This outputs:
 val something: Task &#x3D; Task(test,Failed(1,2)) {&quot;Foo&quot; : &quot;test&quot;, &quot;Data&quot; : {&quot;Failed&quot; : {&quot;foo&quot; : &quot;1&quot;,&quot;bar&quot; : &quot;2&quot;}}} 
 But what I really want, is it to output:
 {&quot;Foo&quot; : &quot;test&quot;, &quot;Data&quot; : &quot;foo&quot; : &quot;1&quot;,&quot;bar&quot; : &quot;2&quot;}} 
 Effectively, I just want to delete the &quot;Failed&quot; block but keep everything within that block.

                              <span>Just noticed that I forgot to make an announcement for Fourmolu 0.8. If you haven&#x27;t been keeping up, lots of exciting new features in both Fourmolu 0.8 and 0.9:
  
Fourmolu 0.8 
 Added initial support for leading arrows
 Added new multi-line-compact option for people wanting to use {-| instead of {- |
 
 Fourmolu 0.9 
 Added support for putting let definitions on the next line instead of inline with new let-style option (and configuring whether the in keyword is left-aligned or right-aligned to the let keyword with the in-style option)
 Added support for outputting with unicode characters
 Leaves the where keyword in the module header where the user originally put it
 
  
As always, thanks so much for everyone who contributed. Really awesome work happening over here.

                              <span>so we had &quot;choco install ghc&quot; before (windows), and then you can right away run &quot;ghci&quot; interpreter and enjoy quick mafs.
 what do we do now since it is deprecated (a.f.a.i.r)? it looks so much more complicated now to just run an interpreter. i only use haskell for interpreter (as an advanced calculator) and i don&#x27;t really write scripts
 thanks for any suggestions!

For example, I want to be able to create a monomial with four variables in a Lex ordering and say it has type Mon 4 &quot;Lex&quot;. I&#x27;ve been trying to use the DataKinds extension with the TypeLits and Proxy modules to achieve this, but so far unsuccessfully. Right now, I have something like this:
 {-# LANGUAGE DataKinds, KindSignatures, GADTs #-} import GHC.TypeLits data Mon :: Nat -&gt; Symbol -&gt; * where Mon :: { degList :: [Int] } -&gt; Mon SomeNat SomeSymbol 
 This doesn&#x27;t work because SomeNat and SomeSymbol are of kind *, not of kind Nat or Symbol. First of all, why is this? The description for…</span>

                              <span>I have some parametrised GADTs which, at some point, I need to be able to generally use. Here&#x27;s one:
  data Entity (t :: EntityClass) where Entity :: EntityID -&gt; SiteID -&gt; EntityConfiguration t -&gt; Entity t 
 I also have a Some type to hide the parameter:
  data Some (t :: k -&gt; Type) where Some :: t k -&gt; Some t 
 I can also hide the parameter using a forall:
  data EntityX where EntityX :: forall t. EntityID -&gt; SiteID -&gt; EntityConfiguration t -&gt; EntityX 
 I have a function that wants to be able to generally use these parametrised classes (e.g. when getting them from a database):
  type Z &#x3D; Some Entity -- OR type Z &#x3D; EntityX instantiateFromRow :: (Int32, Int32, Value) -&gt; Either InvalidEntityError Z 
 I&#x27;m encountering an issue when writing tests for instantiateFromRow (although I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll encounter it elsewhere as well) in that I need to somehow verify that the result of this function is what I think it is (I&#x27;m using Hspec, for reference):
  instantiateFromRow (...) &#x60;shouldBe&#x60; expectedResult 
 The problem is that if I use Some Entity as the result type, then I have the problem that I need Eq instances for Some Entity, which I just cannot work out how to get right (I get lots of &quot;cannot match type t1 with t2&quot;), but if I use EntityX then I have problems with the forall t not matching the output of functions which do things like parse JSON instance FromJSON (Some EntityConfiguration).
 So I either need to find a nice way to:
  
extract the inner value from the Some existential (but this feels fraught with type difficulty in its own right);
 deriving / write Eq instances for Some Entity
 find a way to reconcile these type variables (which feels like a problem for which one needs dependent types at which point I&#x27;m both lost and screwed since Haskell doesn&#x27;t really support them AFAICT).

                              <span>I&#x27;m a Haskell beginner. Well, I&#x27;ve made multiple tries to learn Haskell. I improve little by little :) I&#x27;m wondering what would be a good way to structure Haskell programs. Suppose I have a User data type and some other types. Here are some possibilities I think ok:
 1) Type definition, functions and instances in User.hs. 2) Type definition in Types.hs along with other types; instances in Instances.hs along other type instances; user functions in User.hs.
 Do you have any battle-tested method ? I did not find any article about that.
 Thanks

 My current setup is neovim + GHC 9.02 + HLS 1.8.0 + stack 2.9.1, but I&#x27;ve experienced this consistently with VSCode as well, and older/other versions of HLS, stack, and GHC. The offending components seem to be stack and HLS specifically.
 What happens is: due to a (legit) compilation error somewhere in a module, the Haskell Language Server sometimes completely barfs on that module, shows the following error at the top of the file:
 ghcide compiled by GHC X.X failed to load packages: : cannot satisfy -package anypackage-X.X.X (use -v for more information). Please ensure that ghcide is compiled with the same GHC installation as the project.

 A non-home brew eMacs bin I installed worked fine fwiw. 
 Thanks so much for any help. It’s always the onion of learning issues when coming back to it.
 UPDATE: I did an install with —cask so I could try running it outside the terminal. And that FIXED it. So it is indeed something with the term as some suggested, but the meta checkbox didn’t fix it. I’m very happy right now, although I’m sure soon enough I’ll be complaining about how to get windows opening where I want, etc. thanks!

 M-w does not work. M-x works, which would seem to indicate that the problem is not that windows is prioritizing the meta key for other operations outside of emacs.
 When I run describe-key, it doesn&#x27;t register anything as happening when I press M-w.
 When I use M-x to find the kill-ring-save command, it shows M-w as being the assigned shortcut. And yet, nothing happens when I type M-w.

 Any ideas on whether the issue is with emacs or with windows, and how to address?

                              <span>So first, Eglot + clangd + company don&#x27;t insert function arguments for me. Company used to do this for me when I was using gtags. I&#x27;ve checked my config options, and I have ALL of the optional server capabilities turn ON and I&#x27;ve got &#x60;Company Clang Insert Arguments&#x60; set to &#x60;on&#x27;. I&#x27;m not sure what else to check. (Emacs 28.0.92 on Windows). 
 Second, is there a way to turn on completions for the class I&#x27;m working on without typing &#x60;this-&gt;&#x60; first? If I want a member variable and I don&#x27;t remember the name, there doesn&#x27;t SEEM to be something that lets me implicitly ask for just the class variables and functions. If I start a company completion, it gives me a much broader list of completions, which can be very handy, but usually the list is too big and generic.

 Edit: I don&#x27;t understand the syntax ((nil . ((variable . &quot;value&quot;)))) of .dir-locals.el, so many parentheses, but fortunately there is a add-dir-local-variable function, then just select the compile-command.

 I need to occasionally edit Jason buffers indented with 2 spaces, when my default indentation is 4.
 However, incanting (set-variable &#x27;tab-width 2) in such a JSON buffer has, to my surprise, no effect.
 M-x describe-variable says:
 tab-width is a variable defined in ‘C source code’. Its value is 2 Original value was 8 Local in buffer summary-fields.json; global value is 4 
 exactly as expected, but hitting tab, or even comma :-/ consistently aligns me with 4 space tabs, which is getting me down.
 C-h m gives me the mode:
 JavaScript mode defined in ‘js.el’: Major mode for editing JavaScript. 
 which also seems as expected.
 I&#x27;m running Aquamacs 3.6 GNU Emacs 25.3.50.1
 Thanks for any ideas or tips.

 I&#x27;m attempting to run emacs remotely through SSH X11 Forwarding but after installing Doom emacs it broken the resolution:

 Running emacs without any additional configuration loads it up on a GTK interface which is resizable and the resolution is fine. How would i go about correcting this in Doom?

 Org mode is perhaps the first thing that comes to mind as a way to have this in emacs. However, org mode isn&#x27;t directly extensible by the user. At least, I&#x27;m not aware of any API to define e.g. a new kind of plain list, with associated operations.
 Are there other packages that allow defining ad hoc user widgets in the same style? Recognizing patterns in bits of text, extracting info from them, and providing actions for interacting with them. This could very pair nicely with org.

                              <span>There is project.el (inbuilt), EDE (inbuilt) and many others to choose from.
 I understand that project.el is &quot;new&quot; and follows the approach when there is a .git folder and other heuristics to auto-determine what a constitutes a project. EDE is &quot;old&quot; and has a declarative approach.
 Yet EDE is prominently documented and has imenu-entries, suggesting newcomers to click and try.
 Is EDE using project.el under the hood? And if not: Wouldn&#x27;t project.el warrant menu entries?

                              <span>Often I find myself wanting to do the classic vim/evil pattern of 
  
search for 
 do something (e.g., a macro) to the text at/near 
 press &#x60;n&#x60; to go the next occurence of 
  
and so on...
 This works great for buffers, but I wish there was an equivalent behavior of &#x60;n&#x60;/&#x60;N&#x60;, but for entire projects. I know you can use projectile to find and replace regexps, but I like the flexibility and ease of use of the &#x60;n&#x60;/&#x60;N&#x60; + macros flow.

                              <span>Recently I&#x27;ve started using org-roam to build my note taking system.
 I am wondering whether there is a recommended workflow for using org-roam to read source code managed by git?
 What I am imagining is that:
  
When I open a source code file/buffer, the notes I&#x27;ve taken before would show highlight in the buffer.
 I can read the notes I&#x27;ve taken, and travel from notes to source, under org-roam
 &#x27;s help.
 The notes can record the git commit hash of the selected text if any. If I want to travel from notes to source like in 2.
 , it will show the historical file content when the notes were taken, if the file has changed.

Should I skip creating these notes and instead focus on actually practice programming in these languages; or should I take the time writing these notes?
The situation is a bit different regarding the two languages I&#x27;m learning, but I think that I maybe will end with the same solution for both languages. The first programming language is simple and similar to other programming languages I&#x27;ve worked in before. While I still need to read manuals and books to get to learn the languages, a big part of the language (syntax) and ecosystem (libraries) is similar to other languages and ecosystems I&#x27;ve used before.

an integration between the open-games-hs framework and rllib,
in order to gain access to the entire Python ecosystem and train agents for games written in Haskell.
open-games-hs is a Haskell library and DSL for defining,
operating, and analyzing certain kinds of game-theoretic games. It comes
with a rich type theory and implementation that allows for the
specification of agent strategies as Haskell functions.
For some games, encoding strategies in Haskell is fairly simple. But one could
imagine another way: what if we could learn those strategies? Utilizing the
theories of reinforcement learning? Well, one idea might be to try and build
a series of algorithms in Haskell implementing these strategies; or, we

                              <span>Title pretty much says it all. I&#x27;m currently using Notion (but sort of wish I had started with Obsidian) and on the verge of completely switching to org-roam. But I wanted to see if there was anything I&#x27;d be missing before I do that. The only things I can think of are
  
Aesthetics while editing - yes you can export with org in a pretty format of your choosing, but it seems like you don&#x27;t have quite as much control over aesthetics while writing. I don&#x27;t really care too much about this, just something I&#x27;ve noted
 Line wrapping in table fields - in Notion I make heavy use 2 column tables that have tens of rows, and line wrapping works seamlessly. It seems like org tables don&#x27;t really support line wrapping. I read about a few possible solutions but they seem a bit like they are going against the grain. This is probably the biggest holdup that might stop me from transitioning
  
Is there anything else I&#x27;m missing? I don&#x27;t care much about #1, but I&#x27;d also love to hear solutions to #2 if anyone has any.

                              <span>So, while using org-orgzly the other day, I noticed org-orgzly pushed an event to orgzly. This reminded me, that the script needs a way to interpret and distinguish events from tasks. Rather than just program it to how I setup and use orgmode, I decided to get some feedback from other users first. 
 So how do you do it? And do you think a consensus could be reached?

 This morning, like most mornings, I once more began the process, like many of y&#x27;all I imagine, of struggling, tussling, and generally wrestling with Org mode, in the quaint belief that one day soon I will finally bring the brute -- and my organizational life -- under control, and that way find joy, harmony, eudaimonia, and maybe even release from Samsara. On that day -- O Frabjous Day! -- I will have won the battle over chaos and the tyranny of umpteen calendar events, a thousand post-it notes, ten thousand notebook jottings, and an uncountable number of ideas that spin around my poor brain. On that day -- Callooh! Callay! -- I will be at peace, and my ToDo list will finally respect me.
 And then I noticed this:
 Submit to orgmode
 Forget Skynet; forget LaMDA; and forget Ava, that hot robot chick in Ex Machina. If anything is sentient, it&#x27;s Org mode and resistance is useless. Valar Org-hulis. 😩

                              <span>I&#x27;m wondering how I can use emacs lisp to change the way text appears in the buffer (without actually modifying the underlying text). Essentially I want to include a &quot;label&quot; of sorts. 
 Specifically, I create presentations using RMarkdown and xaringan (which use remark.js on the backend) in Emacs. Three dashed lines (e.g., &quot;---&quot;) marks the beginning of a new slide. At every occurrence of these three dashed lines, I want to display the slide number. So the buffer will look like this:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  
Header for first slide
 content
  
Header for second slide
  
Header for third slide
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 And what I want the the buffer to look like this:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 --- Slide 1
 Header for first slide
 content
 --- Slide 2
 Header for second slide
 --- Slide 3
 Header for third slide
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 So after I type &quot;---&quot; with a line break, it will add the slide number. The trick is that I can&#x27;t actually insert the text though because in order for xaringan to properly break slides, there cannot be anything after the three dashes, not even a line break.
 How can I do this? If I am in a git project, I can see that magit includes the &quot;+&quot; character at the end of the line without actually modifying the plain text, so this has to be doable, right?

 I&#x27;ve read something related to locals but it didn&#x27;t work well and i haven&#x27;t found support for the esotheric layouts (if it exists).

 I have the two things working individually but would like to modify the helm-bibtex menu to be able to choose this side by side display. 
 Thanks, RH

 Tl;dr: there seem to be some new email setups that seems cool (mu4e, notmuch, etc), and online videos for setup. But I don’t see anyone sorting/filtering email on arrive… more search the giant db ala gmail. Surely I’m just missing something?
 (I’d like my setup to work across Mac and windows)

                              <span>Reading through the documentation, it seems to me like emacs is just an elisp interpreter plus a lot of elisp code. There are lisp machine implementations for fpgas, so I was wondering (not for performance reasons but just as a hobbyist project or out of curiosity), if there are elisp machine implementations for fpgas. I.e. we replace the interpreter with an actual machine and use the elisp code as our kernel/os.

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to understand the first part of the second line -- which osascript &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp;&amp; -- in the following script, from this Tips And Tricks page, to start emacsclient on MacOS:
 #!/bin/sh which osascript &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp;&amp; osascript -e &#x27;tell application &quot;Emacs&quot; to activate&#x27; emacsclient -c &quot;$@&quot; 
 .My (very meagre) understanding is that the script does the following three things:
  
Check that osascript is present
 Launch Emacs (which I guess it is assumed should have a call to (server-start) in its init.el or .emacs), but only if osascript is present,
 Run emacsclient
  
Is that right? If so, I have two questions:
  
Exactly how does the &quot;but only if&quot; in my point #2 above work? I assume that if the which osascript fails, then the call to osascript -e never happens. But how is that done? Something to do with the &amp;&amp; I presume?
 Why is the script author making only the call to oasscript -e conditional on a successful which osascript? Why don&#x27;t they also gate the emacsclient line itself? (In other words why don&#x27;t just they kill the whole script if the which fails?) I might have understood letting the emacsclient line still run, even if the which had failed, but only if the author had included a -a option for emacsclient. Then, even if the failed which did blocked the call to oascript -e which in turn meant there would be no Emacs launched (and so no call to start-server), still emacsclient could have launched the alternate editor it had been given using -a. But as it stands, it looks like emacsclient will still valiantly attempt to launch even though it is almost certainly doomed to failure through lack of an emacs server.

                              <span>Reading through the eglot docs, it talks about how a lot of its functionality is exposed through the default emacs packages, and that&#x27;s one of the reasons why eglot is also built in, so it can work better with the defaults.
 So my question is - if I use flycheck, am I gimping myself? Does eglot also seamlessly work with flycheck, ivy, etc. because they all secretly use the same data sources or something?
 It&#x27;s also got me thinking, is flycheck way better than flymake? I kind of cargo culted my current set of packages.

                              <span>OK, so here&#x27;s my setup:
 I run Windows Emacs and do most of my work there.
 On some occasions I need to run Cygwin and do some stuff there.
 What I&#x27;d like to do when in Cygwin is to edit a file in my running Windows Emacs.
 I tried calling emacsclientw.exe from the Cygwin shell and pass a Windows file path but I always end up with a new instance of Emacs.
 Is that something that I can get to work?
 Cheers!

                              <span>There is something slightly annoying and I was wondering whether anyone had found/knows a solution for it. If I&#x27;m using company-files for file name completion but I already had a file name written down, the completion simply inserts the new file name, instead of replacing the old one:
  
&quot;./some-folder/_some-file.txt&quot; 
 &quot;./some-folder/my-file.txtsome-file.txt&quot; 
  
It would be nice if company was smart enough to remove the trailing file name. Is there a simple solution here?
 Thanks!

                              <span>I&#x27;ve never quite figured out how to search for Info nodes reliably in Emacs. I understand that Emacs is self-documenting and that the Info system is very comprehensive, so I always try to use Emacs and Info to search for answers before resorting to a web search. However I sometimes find it quite difficult to find what I need which makes me feel like I&#x27;m missing something.
 I was reading the Emacs development mailing list this morning and came across messages about &quot;EUDC&quot;, but I didn&#x27;t know what that was. So I hit C-h i to run info.
 I first tried m to select a manual, but EUDC did not appear in this list. I assumed that it would be part of the Emacs manual, so I tried to select &quot;Emacs&quot; from this list but that too did not appear. I closed info and instead hit C-h r to run info-emacs-manual and I then searched through the list from m for EUDC but found nothing. I then tried i (Info-index) but again EUDC did not appear in the list.
 I then tried a (info-apropos) but again nothing was found for &quot;EUDC&quot;. Finally I got somewhere with s (Info-search); this took me to a page &quot;33.4.2 Mail Header Editing&quot; which had a comment about EUDC at the very bottom. There finally I saw the text &quot;see EUDC (eudc)&quot; which was a link to the correct &quot;Emacs Unified Directory Client&quot; info page.
 As you can see, my method for finding the correct Info manual was far from optimal. My question therefore is, what is the correct way of finding manuals like this using Info in Emacs?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been experimenting with init.el for a couple, three weeks now. The Melpa repository keeps sending me an error, package not found, whenever I include (use-package helm). Actually, it does that with Ivy, too, and several other packages, but it does install a theme and org. I don&#x27;t know how to get past this step. Any suggestions welcome.

                              <span>I’ve been learning Scala for a few days and i’ve taken a notice that Scala programmers are totally against mutation. For instance, while loops and for loops are forbidden because of the mutation of variables to iterate over a collection etc. My question is, why the strong hate for mutation?

in case you missed it:

  
I will demonstrate by publishing articles what the outcome could be if you use your Zettelkasten to produce essays. I will be transparent about the framework conditions (time invested, structure of the day since I will have a newborn depriving me of sleep an neural drive). There will be some commentary about the how but my focus will be on the demonstration and not the didactics. However, since I will focus on both the truth and usefulness leafs of the knowledge flower and I publish content that is about the Zettelkasten Method there is immediate value to the Zettelkasten Community (hopefully). So, I feel I can skip most of the meta-communication for that project without losing the message. (I expect some people to be surprised what can be achieved w…</span>

 For example, given this heading in my org file, I would like a function that captures the CUSTOM_ID value so I can paste it elsewhere.

                              <span>Hi guys, I just installed Scala today for the first time, and thought I&#x27;d give it a whirl. My Scala version is 3.2.1, which should handle even JDK 19. However, during cs setup, cs installed JDK version 8u292. It might not be a big deal, but when I start off with a clean slate, I like to run the newest of the new to be able to take full advantage of the latest features, should I feel like it.
 What&#x27;s the &quot;correct&quot; way of changing the JVM version used by Scala, so I can use the latest version? Do I manually download and install the JDK of choice? Can one of the CLI tools do it for me, like NVM (Node Version Manager) for node?
 Thank you for your time!
 Edit: Understandably, when I didn&#x27;t specify it, it&#x27;s easy to assume I&#x27;m on linux, but I&#x27;m on Windows 11! Sorry for not including that in the original post, but I don&#x27;t really think it matters regardless.

                              <span>Imagine a bunch of microservices in different repos that you want to edit/search/view together. How would you do it with IntelliJ?
 I see the New Module wizard, and can add them as individual modules one-by-one - that sort of works, but only if the project has the &quot;use sbt shell for&quot; all unchecked - which is what I want since it gives me best experience on single-projects.
 With that thing checked in, the project just dissapears from the modules.
 How do you use/edit microservices and setup your favorite editor if you want them in a nice single view?

                              <span>Expand region may be my most used thing in emacs yet it&#x27;s a bit frustrating out of the box. I know there&#x27;s ways to &#x27;advice&#x27; the command to expand in certain ways, there&#x27;s 2 specific things I want:
 On assignments/expressions
 I&#x27;d like expansion to always select the expression first but it seems to work backwards e.g. with this region
 a &#x3D; b[c] ^ 
 expanding again leads to this
 a &#x3D; b[c] ^^^^^ 
 instead of
 a &#x3D; b[c] ^^^^ 
 On vterm/truncated lines Assume that the screen ends at col 5 with this
 barbaz foobar\ qux 
 If the region is currently foobar but the actual full string is foobarqux, expand region will go back and select all the way to the top of the buffer instead of the remaining part qux.
 TL;DR How can I bias expand-region to select forward instead of backward? Also to stop on newlines and not default to the entire buffer when it doesn&#x27;t seem to know where else to go?

                              <span>I recently started using ctrlf.
 Sometimes if the ctrlf minibuffer loses focus for some reason (does not just happen when I use my mouse), it will remain open and I cannot use C-s or C-r again until I manually click on the minibuffer to focus it.
 I would have expected C-s/C-r to focus an existing ctrlf minibuffer if it existed, but they do not, and I could not come up with a good way to implement this myself.
 Is there a good workaround for this? Alternatives to ctrlf?

                              <span>Hi, I have a question as described in the title. I&#x27;m working a lot with Kubernetes and because of the nature of it - a lot of YAML files.
 These files usually end being a YAML file with Go or helm templates, which totally breaks parsing of said file for with Flycheck. I do appreciate all the YAML structure hints and usual errors which Flycheck would catch - but I can&#x27;t figure out a way how to stop whole buffer from highlighting if YAML file contains some go template logic - or similar. I&#x27;d say the same would be true if i.e. the file would be an ERB template of said YAML.
 For context, I&#x27;m using doom-emacs, although not sure if that matters, I&#x27;d be happy to configure this even manually if needed.

                              <span>I recently fully committed to an efficiency oriented programming workflow/setup, switching to arch linux with a standalone WM and learning VIM movements and during this new era of my developer timeline I found out about Emacs and then Doom Emacs, I almost immediately went to Doom Emacs after spending only about 2 days in GNU/Emacs as I had heard about all the cool features such as evil mode and alot of speed improvements and I have so long really enjoyed using it and I am constantly updating my configuration for doom.
 However, when searching the web for help in configuring Doom Emacs because I want to use it as my main IDE and get rid of Intellij and VScode and in my search of doing so I realized that there was very little content on Doom emacs in comparison to GNU Emacs, my initial thought was that obviously GNU emacs has been around for 40 something years while doom is relatively new it makes sense, however I noticed that even recent videos from these couple of years still mostly feature GNU emacs.
 Is there some kind of advantage to using GNU emacs over more custom versions such as Doom? Maybe more customization, better performance? Or is there maybe some kind of inherent disadvantage to Doom?
 Also if anyone has any good resources on how to configure doom extensively please share them it would be appreciated :) 
 Edit: Thank you all for your feedback and clarifications, while reading through some emacs documentation I came along Chemacs and I will take the advice to watch the emacs from scratch series whilst being able to have my regular doom emacs setup on the side while working on my base emacs setup.

                              <span>I have been trying this code in my config, but nothing happens:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 (with-eval-after-load &#x27;git-gutter
 (setq git-gutter:update-interval 2
  git-gutter:window-width 2 git-gutter:added-sign &quot;++&quot;) 
 )
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 I like the default fringe style &quot;doom&quot; provides, they show both flycheck and git-gutter. I just want to increase the width.
 Previously, I tried git-gutter-fringe but it overrides the flycheck fringe. I checked vc-gutter file, I have not got is it using git-gutter or git-gutter-fringe.

 I have problems with my helm.

 Sorry for the noobie question but, is there an official documentation of eglot? 
 I am using it for my python programming projects but there are a few things that I don&#x27;t know how to configure them. This is a small list:
  
Setting the python console directory and the PYTHONPATH variable for each project
 Finding inside the project where a class is defined
 After executing a script with C-c C-c go to the point where it raises an exception
  
Thank you for your help.

 This is a fast and asynchronous Git status information that may be used as an UI element, say, in eshell prompt or in mode line. Note, it depends on an external executable gitstatusd by u/romkatv.
 The package was just submitted to Melpa.

 Some comment on Haskell cryptonite library from the report:
  
The cryptonite library is considered state of the art for cryptography within the Haskell ecosystem. However, the library’s maintenance should be strengthened and its test coverage expanded, given that it is a language standard. If the project is still developed in Haskell, consider investing in or contributing to the library and performing a security audit on it.
  
SimpleX Chat v4.2 is released with group links and many other things.

                              <span>Hi :wave:
 ​
 I&#x27;ve on one side a Windows 11 machine with my VSCode.
 On another - remote - side I&#x27;ve a Debian 10 machine with all Haskell tooling installed (ghcup, stack...).
 I connect my VSCode instance to my Debian machine through SSH (with the remote extension).
 I added the &quot;Haskell&quot; extension (the Haskell LSP actually) to VSCode and I set the correct settings on my remote machine.
 The problem is when I try to use it on a new project, the HLS server tries to start 5 times but fails without any error.
 So after 5 attempts it just says it cannot start.
 Here are the last chunk of logs HLS sends to VSCode (4 identical chunks are sent before, I just put one for sake of economy of space): 
 [Info - 00:40:50] Connection to server got closed. Server will restart. [Trace - 00:40:50] Sending …</span>

 libHS-tasty-autocollect-0.3.1.0-inplace-ghc9.4.2.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory 
 The mentioned file is the same library I&#x27;m building; the tricky thing about this library is that the library defines a compiler plugin, and the test suite uses the plugin itself.
 It works with Stack in CI and locally, and cabal exec -- cabal v2-test works locally. Can anyone help?

                              <span>Introductions to functional programming are usually targeted at people who are already accustomed to programming, and they typically present the perks of the paradigm by comparing it to imperative or object-oriented programming. This often leaves the reader with the impression that they have to unlearn practices and concepts they already know to adopt this new paradigm.
In this post I would like to try a different approach, not requiring any programming knowledge, but only the most basic intuition. We will build on high school mathematics, in the form of sets and functions, to provide a learning path to understanding functional programming1.

Introduction
Functional programming is a paradigm for writing computer programs based on, well, you can guess: functions!
These functions are exactly…</span>

 Totally novice&#x27;s annoying question here. 
 I sometimes get lazy to read these documentation pages, and I wanted to figure out how to work with
 Haskell as with C++, like calling main, and including another file that calls a function lets say called factorial. then what is the header in the head of the file main?
 and the file factorial?
 and how do I link them?
 I appreciate very much all the help

 I planned this as an addition to Cognitive Loads in Programming but it is written as an independent topic. My goal in this post has been to examine in-depth deductive and empirical as 2 distinct mindsets programmers have when coding and communicating. 
 I am posting it here as (1) a followup to Cognitive Loads in Programming, (2) because IMO it is relevant to the discourse about FP and Haskell in particular. 
 I hope you find it interesting.

                              <span>I was getting quite interested in Mastodon until I read that it is written in R*&amp;^-on-R#$%s, a combination I detest even more than PHP. Are there any attempts at an implementation in Haskell, or failing that, at least some relatively sane language?
 Is it enough to write a server that implements the ActivityHub protocol?

                              <span>Longtime emacs user (20+ years) and developer in other languages, but just now dabbling in elisp beyond my .emacs. I want to run an async process and have both stdout and stderr display to the same buffer (as if it was run in a terminal), but I want to just store stdout to a variable/pass to a lambda for use in code. I don&#x27;t see an obvious way to do this from the docs. 
 The two options I see are: 
  
I call make-process without the :stderr option, and both stdout/stderr end up in the same buffer, but a process filter can&#x27;t discern between them. 
 I call make-process with :stderr, and I have to provide a separate buffer for stderr
  
What I want is the combined output to show in a buffer for informational purposes, but code parses and uses stdout. This is because the commands I&#x27;m running are long running and display progress in stderr. Am I missing some obvious way to do this?

 Why on earth would that be the default setting? Oo

                              <span>My questions:
  
why doesn&#x27;t to global mode activate globally?
 
how do I get it to do that for all non-special buffers?
 
 emacs version: GNU Emacs 29.0.50
 I mostly use emacs-client.
 This doesn&#x27;t happen when I run emacs by itself or in a terminal emacs -nw
 I&#x27;m not doing anything to check if the daemon is running in my config.
 Basically everything runs the same code. 
  
Since version 27 emacs has a built-in display-fill-column-indicator-mode and a global version too. 
 Early in my init files, I create a text-mode buffer named *text* (naming is hard). 
 Later on I use (global-display-fill-column-indicator-mode 1) and when I open a new (non special) buffer sure enough there&#x27;s a fill column indicator over at the right hand side. Same when I visit elisp files, python files, .. pretty much everything. 
 However in my generated *text* buffer and the *scratch* buffer there is no indicator. 
 When I run emacs -nw or plain emacs works as expected and both those buffers have the indicator. 
 With emacs-client though, in those buffers, the global-minor-modes does include global-display-fill-column-indicator-mode but local-minor-modes does not include display-fill-column-indicator-mode. 
 In contrast I also have 
 (use-package display-line-numbers :ensure nil :hook ((text-mode-hook . display-line-numbers-mode) (prog-mode-hook . display-line-numbers-mode))) 
 And indeed display-line-numbers-mode is active in both the *scratch* buffer and my own *text* despite not setting those hooks until after the *text* buffer even using emacs-client. 
 How can I get this behaviour in all buffers?

                              <span>Recently, I decided to give ESS+eglot another go and was quite surprised by how much better it is than 2 years ago. It mostly just works if I call &#x27;eglot&#x27; when working on an R file, and the linting is great (for the most part). There are two things missing, though:
  
Automatic file name completion (I can trigger it manually, but it&#x27;s annoying)
 
Variable name completion after $, this one does not seem to work at all
 
 Does anyone know how to fix this?

                              <span>I am trying to emulate some features in TeXMacs, specifically how when you type &quot;QQ&quot; in TeXMacs, you get &quot;\mathbb{Q}&quot;. It&#x27;s really nice once you get used to it.
 I noticed abbrev-mode does basically what I want, but with a caveat: I need to insert a character before the expansion happens. So (with electric-pair-mode) I may have &quot;$QQ|$&quot; where | is my cursor. Then C-f afterwards does not do the expansion. This is a minor thing, but I feel like you can do a lot with this feature. I have looked through some source code (specifically abbrev.el/expand.el/dabbrev.el), and its seems detection of abbrev-table is built-in somewhere (like in the language modes themselves)? The last thing I&#x27;d want to do is add a hook to insert.
 Here is the code for abbrev-based expansion.
 (define-abbrev-table &#x27;global-abbrev-table &#x27;( (&quot;QQ&quot; &quot;\\mathbb{Q}&quot; nil :case-fixed t :count 0) (&quot;ZZ&quot; &quot;\\mathbb{Z}&quot; nil :case-fixed t :count 0) ))

 I know he doesn&#x27;t typically come over to Reddit, but I thought it would be worthwhile to let folks know that he&#x27;s looking for some kind-heartedness right now. I think he&#x27;s a treasure to the Emacs community and worth investing in.
 His public contact information is listed on his website: https://protesilaos.com/contact/ so I&#x27;ll message him directly about what methods will work best and update this post with more info if I find out.

 I am able to get Org use Excel to open a linked-to Excel file, but only if I open it using org-open-at-point on an explicitly-stated link. I cannot get it to work if I use org-attach to open it. 
 For example, suppose I use C-c C-a c to have org-attach attach-by-copying a file, my-spreadsheet.xlsx say, to a heading. Suppose too that I am using the ID method; that the ID property produced in the attachment process is 0123456789; and that org-attach-id-dir is set to its default value of &quot;data/&quot;. 
 Given all of that, I would expect to see a copy of my-spreadsheet.xlsx appearing in directory: data/01/23456789. And that&#x27;s exactly what happens. I also see the tag :ATTACH: added to the headline, and the ID prop…</span>

                              <span>Hello.
 I have one journal file called mylife.org It has many entries like so:
  
** [2022-11-01] *** dream i dreamt of cybernetic sheep **[2022-11-02] *** dream I was in antarctica **[2022-11-03] today was meh. lots of wasted time *** dream I foiled a bank robbery 
  
I just want to export the *** dream headings into another org-mode file if possible. so that i can call it dreams.org which only has my dreams like so:
  
*** dream i dreamt of cybernetic sheep *** dream i was in antarctica *** dream i foiled a bank robbery 
  
How can I go about it in the simplest way possible? Granted I lose out on the dates, but even achieving this would be helpful.

                              <span>I have a really odd problem, which I don&#x27;t see to be able to solve. This is is Emacs 28.2 (on AWS WorkSpace Linux 2, but probably not the issue). My default background in Emacs in the terminal is black. Great
 When I do &#x60;customize-themes&#x60; and pick for example wheatgrass, my default background isn&#x27;t exactly black. I do &#x60;customize-face&#x60; and set background to black, but it does not become black. It looks like the theme continues to override my customisation. How can I enforce the black background?
 This is in terminal emacs (nox).

                              <span>I have a hexacore mobile Xeon with turbo boost disabled and am running Manjaro.
 When I set the CPU governor to &#x27;Power&#x27; (i.e. tend to keep clocks low) the clocks stay at 800 Mhz and pixel scroll precision mode is very laggy, even though scrolling on chrome or firefox is completely smooth. When I set the governor to &#x27;balance power&#x27; or &#x27;performance&#x27;, the sensitivity of clocks to load improves - CPU clocks peak at 2.7 Ghz, the base clock, for the duration of the scroll - and the scrolling becomes smooth.
 I don&#x27;t know whether anyone else has experienced this and I&#x27;d like some tips on where I should post this to attract attention from developers. It&#x27;s not ideal that scrolling is so CPU intensive in the first place. Very grateful though, of course, for pixel-scroll-precision-mode!

                              <span>With Emacs 28.2 , after doing apt build-dep emacs to get the Emacs 27 prerequisites, and adding libgccjit, libjansson perhaps libwebkitgtk I can compile it okay.
 I suspect that Emacs 29 comes with addtional desirable features that require other libraries besides these three.
 Any tips on what some of these are?

                              <span>Both languages are pretty similar, so it might be a matter of implementing some of the data structures like buffers in common lisp. There is a basic elisp interpreter in one of the cl implementations already. Wouldnt it be nice to get access to cl projects as well as elisp ones?

                              <span>Hello everyone!
 When i add tag or attachment to header (with visual-line-mode on) they start to occupy 3 lines:
 **** Header1 :mytag: **** Header2 :ATTACH: 
 How to fix it? I guess i need to somehow set limit to header length cause now last char of :tag: and :attach: is on line 77 (which is more than my view width)
  
it&#x27;s more org mode question, posting here too for more users to see.

                              <span>When I open a link for an elfeed-search entry with &quot;B&quot; it will pop into whatever Firefox window I last had focused. Does anyone know if there&#x27;s way to tell elfeed/emacs I have a strong preference for the link to be opened using the browser window on the current workspace? I&#x27;m using i3 if that is relevant. I suspect it may well be.
 I have a feeling its possible but there&#x27;s a lot of state in play here which does not reside in emacs (X session, window manager, browser, ...)
 Thx!

                              <span>I love the universal plain-text environment that Emacs offers, it helps a lot when I have a million things on and get easily distracted. I find that time-blocking my days through org-mode and org-agenda helps a lot to balance all the aspects of my life.
 But with that, I would love to find a way that when I have to reschedule an event, Emacs would automatically reschedule everything else, e.g. due dates, time allocated, difficulty. Basically, I&#x27;m asking for SkedPal (https://skedpal.com/) as an Emacs mode. I hate to pay continuously for software and would love to stay within the Emacs ecosystem, but this is on the point of me desperately needing any possible solution.
 What&#x27;s the best way to do this? Is there something already available? Could I learn Elisp and code it myself? Would someone be willing to code it?

 The smart indent doesn&#x27;t seem to recognise the correct number of spaces.

 Is this the correct behaviour for haskell files?
 Thanks for any help :)

                              <span>In python.el mode there is a command bind to C-c C-p which starts an Python interpreter. If I have Emacs frame splitted in several windows this command randomly raplace one of this buffer which causes to my that I have to reorganize again all my layout. I&#x27;ve encounter similar experiance in org-mode source block with command org-edit-special bind to C-c &#x27; and the behavior of splitting window is controlled by org-src-window-setup variable originally bind to reorganize-frame and I changed it to &#x27;split-window-right defined in window.el. I would like to implement similar behavior to running this Python shell but with &#x27;split-window-below but lack of elisp knowlegde doesn&#x27;t help me to tie all of this things to create some custom funtion and hook it to this command. Is anyone has similar code?

 I&#x27;ve started investigating in a second language to understand just what the experience is like for at least one other language.
 Are there any good tools or built-in support to offer replacement text for any of the most frequently needed documentation such as variable &amp; function docstrings?

 Is there a way to wrap consult-locate with another function or some other setting/hack to grep the results? In effect, I need to get this kind of output from the consult-locate:
 (setq consult-locate-args (concat &quot;mdfind -name &quot; args &quot; | grep -v archive&quot;))
 This obviously doesn&#x27;t work, but getting that result is the goal.

                              <span>Has anyone gotten this to work? So far I used a hydra including this snippet to resize windows. As many others I wanted to try out transients for my keybindings. In particular I liked that I could use an infix toggle state to switch between windmove and resizing using the same keys (I guess I could also bind the toggling key to switch back and forth between different hydras too). I have used the same functions as the hydra in the link. Namely these:
  (defun hydra-move-splitter-left (arg) &quot;Move window splitter left.&quot; (interactive &quot;p&quot;) (if (let ((windmove-wrap-around)) (windmove-find-other-window &#x27;right)) (shrink-window-horizontally arg) (enlarge-window-horizontally arg))) 
 The resizing more often then not fails however, because the transient window in and on itself is fixed-size and does allow neither explicit, nor implicit resizing. So every Splitter that touches the transient can&#x27;t move and the command fails silently. Since this is probably a common application does somebody know how to get this to work?

                              <span>I found myself wanting more than one auto-yasnippet readily available the other day, so I integrated them with registers. I&#x27;m not sure how often I will need this again, but it&#x27;s quite a simple bit of code, and it seemed worth sharing:
 (require &#x27;cl-lib) (require &#x27;register) (require &#x27;auto-yasnippet) (defun my-aya/current-to-register (snippet register) &quot;Put the current aya snippet into REGISTER. When that register is later inserted or jumped to, the stored snippet will be expanded.&quot; (interactive (list (or aya-current (user-error &quot;There is no current auto snippet&quot;)) (register-read-with-preview &quot;Snippet to register: &quot;))) (set-register register (cons &#x27;aya snippet))) (cl-defmethod register-val-insert ((snippet (head aya))) (let ((aya-current (cdr snippet))) (aya-expand))) (cl-defmethod register-val-jump-to ((snippet (head aya)) _arg) (let ((aya-current (cdr snippet))) (aya-expand))) (cl-defmethod register-val-describe ((snippet (head aya)) _verbose) (princ &quot;an auto-yasnippet: &quot;) (princ (cdr snippet))) 
 Since copy-to-register has two bindings in ctl-x-r-map reusing &#x27;s&#x27; seemed okay to me, but pick whatever binding you like.

                              <span>Hello everyone!
 I got interesting in org attach as filesystem after reading these posts 1, 2, 3. Could you guys tell:
 -, do you use 1 data dir or set separate dirs per top heading (category)?
 -, do you create heading per file or put several (many) files in single heading?
 -, any tips on heading/file naming, use of tags, etc?
 if you could show small example of your typical usage it would be most helpful.

 When i add tag or attachment to header (with visual-line-mode on) they start to occupy 3 lines:
 **** Header1 :mytag: **** Header2 :ATTACH: 
 How to fix it? I guess i need to somehow set limit to header length cause now last char of :tag: and :attach: is on line 77 (which is more than my view width)

 Dear all,
 As we are preparing the next release, we should make sure that no critical bugs go into the release version of Org.
 I think I have closed all the straightforward bug reports listed in updates.orgmode.org and a number of unconfirmed bug reports that were left without response.
 However, there is still a number of bugs that either require further discussion or difficult to fix (for me). Some reports may also be missing from my records.
 It would be helpful if you can help with further feedback or fixing the bug reports listed below. Especially the reports marked with [*].
 Also, if you know some bug report that is not listed below, but important to fix before the next Org release, please let me know in the reply to this mess…</span>

                              <span>In this post I asked how a literal 1 gets interpreted as of type Num a &#x3D;&gt; a. The answer was 1 is actually fromInteger 1, i.e., Haskell auto-magically considers naked 1 to be function call fromInteger 1. And since fromInteger is a method in Num etc., etc. Likewise 3.14 is actually fromRational 3.14 and so, likewise, the class system is invoked. But the types of fromInteger and fromRational are fromInteger :: Num a &#x3D;&gt; Integer -&gt; a and fromRational :: Fractional a &#x3D;&gt; Rational -&gt; a . But then ((fromInteger 1) + (fromRational 3.14)) :: Fractional a &#x3D;&gt; a , which means the 1 got routed through Integer by fromInteger into playing well with Rational, deferring to Rational. How is this happening? The invocation of a class&#x27; various type instances is understood -- once a hint is given, i.e.,
 λ&gt; :t (1 :: Int) (1 :: Int) :: Int 
 but this won&#x27;t work
 λ&gt; (1 :: Integer) + (3.14 :: Rational) :124:19-34: error: • Couldn&#x27;t match type ‘Ratio Integer’ with ‘Integer’ Expected: Integer Actual: Rational • In the second argument of ‘(+)’, namely ‘(3.14 :: Rational)’ In the expression: (1 :: Integer) + (3.14 :: Rational) In an equation for ‘it’: it &#x3D; (1 :: Integer) + (3.14 :: Rational) 
 Once again, the hint-free, naked literals are playing nice with each other. And yes, if Haskell is subbing in fromInteger 1 for 1 and fromRational 3.14 for 3.14 then yes, the whole class system is involved. But how is this managed? Examples I&#x27;ve seen so far are helped by relying on type inference hints to route things to the proper from*. But naked literals, then adding &quot;unlike&quot; naked literals is a type inference that goes deeper than I can fathom. It&#x27;s leveraging the class world like I can&#x27;t figure out but would really like to know. It reminds of functors maybe?

 ​
 When trying to install GHCup on a fresh Debian 10 server with the standard command:
 curl --proto &#x27;&#x3D;https&#x27; --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://get-ghcup.haskell.org | sh 
 I get the following error (after answering &quot;Yes&quot; to most of the 3 questions the installer asked):
 [ Error ] Process &quot;sh&quot; with arguments [&quot;./configure&quot;, [ ... ] &quot;--prefix&#x3D;/home//.ghcup/ghc/9.2.4&quot;] failed with exit code 1. 
 Without more details in the logs about what happened..
 Given that:
 - all dependencies requirements are ok
 - I installed GHCup hundreds of times without any problem
 I don&#x27;t understand what could be the problem at this stage...
 Any help? :)

                              <span>I have had an idea for a kind of program verification, but I&#x27;m not sure whether it can be implemented directly into Haskell. The simplest form of it can be phrased in terms of functions of type Bool -&gt; Bool -&gt; ... -&gt; Bool.
 Consider for example the function f x y z &#x3D; (y &amp;&amp; z) || x. Suppose I want to prove the property that &quot;if x is True, then the value of f x y z is independent of y and z&quot;. In other words, &quot;f True is a constant function&quot;.
 My idea for proving this property is to extend the Bool types to a kind of 3-valued logic similar to Maybe Bool, but with different semantics. You could call it, say, data Partial a &#x3D; Actual a | Unknown. The semantics of Unknown follow the truth table e.g. at this Wiki link. Then you could do a calculation:
  f (Actual True) Unknown Unknown &#x3D; (Unknown &amp;&amp;…</span>

                              <span>Hey, I&#x27;m a a student doing a double degree in mathematics and computer science, and I&#x27;m wondering if anyone has suggestions for academic literature relating to haskell or functional programming in general.
 At university, you get taught the basics of programming in the world of OOP, such as data structures, implementation scheduling, algorithm analysis, etc. I&#x27;m interested in finding what kinds of materials are available from the POV of the functional paradigm, be it technical or more of a case studies.
 I&#x27;m interested in continuing my education one day, although, I&#x27;m not sure whether I want to remain in pure mathematics or look into specific fields in the comp sci domain.
 If anyone here has any interesting blogs or academic materials, I would be very interested to be linked to some resources for my own reading. Thanks!

                              <span>Hiya, I recently came across the following articles which discuss GitHub actions that create GitHub releases with that include downloadable binaries for Haskell programs: - https://vrom911.github.io/blog/github-actions-releases - https://kodimensional.dev/github-actions
 Unfortunately, a few of the components used in them are deprecated (like set-env and set-output) are deprecated. I&#x27;ve tried reading a related article about environment files, to no avail. I&#x27;m likely not proficient enough with GitHub CI to update this myself. 
 Anyway, I was hoping someone had recently used GitHub Action to automatically: - build on linux, macos, and windows - upload artifacts to a GitHub Release
 I&#x27;d also be amenable to a similar setup in GitLab if that&#x27;s been done, as I&#x27;m not really tied to GitHub.
 Bonus points if it supports static binaries on Windows, but not a deal breaker at all. I&#x27;ve figured out how to do static builds on Linux, and my understanding of Mac is it&#x27;s nigh impossible.

Mainly pragmatism :-). I figure that if I reference a note a lot in other notes, the information in the note being referenced is &quot;more valuable&quot;, since I keep coming back to it. I don&#x27;t do tagging, and structure notes are a later addition to my Zettelkasten, and are treated as regular notes, but with a lot of outgoing links. So those two are out too. Does either of those help you in using your Zettelkasten? I&#x27;m always looking to improve this metric.


I completely understand the need for pragmatism. I tag most notes and sometimes use a tag in a search, for example, if I want to limit …</span>

                              <span>I am new to haskell and was reading about haskell&#x27;s lazy evaluation. What I understood was that an expression is kept into haskell program and only evaluated once it is loaded. Would it not hog up a lot of memory ? For example if I have multiple expressions of the form f1 f2 f3 ... fn a1 a2 ... am which work on lists. In this case all of them will be stored in memory and if I am using only one element from each expression at a time, others will not be evaluated and the complete logic chain would stay in memory. Would it make haskell programs less memory efficient?

                              <span>Hi,
 i&#x27;m new to Haskell. Is there an easy way to call haskell code from the nodejs runtime. Can be compiled to js, i don&#x27;t mind. The haskell functions don&#x27;t need to interface with any api. They&#x27;re just meant to process some logic from an input and return an output. I value debugging friendlyness very much (do you use traditional debugger with breakpoints etc in the functional world, or how is it done there? ).
 It can be elm or some haskell near language too.
 thx !

 I want to implement the functor for it so I can work with commands as such :
 myMap &#x3D; HMap {keyValues&#x3D;(insert  [&quot;hi&quot;,&quot;hello&quot;,&quot;hello world&quot;]  (initialize 10))} 
 This is the structure of the custom type itself.
 data HMap a &#x3D; HMap { keyValues :: a } deriving (Show) instance Functor HMap where fmap f (HMap a) &#x3D; HMap (f a) type HashTable &#x3D; HMap lengthsTable :: [String] -&gt; Int lengthsTable (x:xs) &#x3D; length x 
 running the above command gives me the error :
 Couldn&#x27;t match expected type: [String] -&gt; b with actual type: [b0] * Possible cause: &#x60;()&#x27; is applied to too many arguments In the first argument of &#x60;()&#x27;, namely &#x60;insert  [&quot;hi&quot;, &quot;hello&quot;, &quot;hello world&quot;]&#x27; In the &#x60;keyValues&#x27; field of a record In the expression: HMap {keyValues &#x3D; (insert  [&quot;hi&quot;, &quot;hello&quot;, &quot;hello world&quot;]  (initialize 10))} * Relevant bindings include myMap :: HMap [b] (bound at :43:1) 
 I understand there&#x27;s a type mismatch here. I&#x27;ve tried changing the type that my functions call. In the basic implementation of a functor for a function type, the syntax seems correct. Am I understanding this wrong?

                              <span>I am trying to setup a way to systematically search through all my org-roam notes and I came across the following code that uses consult-ripgrep:
 (defun bms/org-roam-rg-search () &quot;Search org-roam directory using consult-ripgrep. With live-preview.&quot; (interactive) (let ((consult-ripgrep-command &quot;rg --multiline --null --ignore-case --type org --line-buffered --color&#x3D;always --max-columns&#x3D;500 --no-heading --line-number . -e ARG OPTS&quot;)) (consult-ripgrep org-roam-directory))) 
 I am using doom emacs and I setup the above code in my config.el file. However, when I run M-x bms/org-roam-rg-search and type in anything, it asks me about &#x27;matched required&#x27; as shown below:
 https://preview.redd.it/bc0mqodfu6y91.png?width&#x3D;1416&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;08f72ee119e7bec1076b1d243428fc38db60f9da
 I am confused about what I am doing incorrect as it is searching the correct folder where my notes are stored and I am typing in keywords that exist in the directory but nothing shows up.

Listing packages now causes an archive error:

                              <span>As noobie to emacs (6 months) I used spacemacs then doom emacs. However I didn&#x27;t like both they were bloated with a lot of features that I don&#x27;t know they exist. When things break you need to ask for help.
 I started watch how to build you custom config from scratch and I tried and I like it so much. Adding packages one by one after I know they are useful for me. I learned a lot more than the 6 months with doom and spacemacs.
 Now, I want to setup evil keybinding like doom and space emacs but it&#x27;s overwhelming and confusing. I tried looking into space/doom configs that involve packages I use in but I found a lot of custom functions there&#x27;s no logic to the keybinding.
 My question, is there any reference that I can use as help or template in my journey to setup evil keybinding. P.s: I don&#x27;t mind templates for emacs binding as long the logic is explained so I can follow the same or adapt.

                              <span>After spending endless hours doing perf optimizations in lsp-mode source code finally, I gave up on the efforts on achieving performance in the elisp layer because it is practically impossible. At some point, it became clear that even if the sequential execution of the requests is comparable with other editors the the fact that (almost)no IO work is performed when emacs UI thread is busy ultimately chokes both the server and the client(especially for the single-threaded servers).
 Here it Emacs fork https://github.com/emacs-lsp/emacs based latest(?) release 28.1 branch that uses separate thread(s) for processing json and communication with the language server thus taking more than 95% of the load off the main UI thread. In addition, it reduces the GC pressure because some of the objects never reach the lisp layer. Compile it just like a normal emacs(make sure to have --with-modules configuration flag) and it should work with the latest and greatest lsp-mode. 
 The code is still not extensively tested and works only for Linux/Unix. With the help of https://github.com/606u we are going to add Windows support as well.

 EDIT: eli-zaretskii pointed out that &#x60;display-line-numbers-mode&#x60; draws in the text area only so this isn&#x27;t possible. Does anyone know of a package that can draw in the margin instead?

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m trying to generate a static site from all my org notes. The notes are currently a mix of plain org and org-roam notes and dailies.
 So far I&#x27;ve tried using ox-hugo to generate everything using this snippet (using doom emacs&#x27; doomscript):
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; (defcli! export-org (file) (require &#x27;doom-start) ; load doom user config (with-current-buffer (find-file-noselect file) (setq org-hugo-base-dir &quot;org-hugo-dir&quot;) (let ((org-id-extra-files (find-lisp-find-files org-roam-directory &quot;.org$&quot;))) (org-hugo-export-wim-to-md))))
 (run! &quot;export-org&quot; (cdr (member &quot;--&quot; argv))) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Basically I loop over all org files calling this script on each one, ox-hugo however fails with an error:
  Error: [ox-hugo] my-file.org: The entire file is attempted to be exported, but it is missing the #+title keyword 
 Apparently ox-hugo requires at least a #+title property in every file... Problem is, I have hundreds of files and it would be quite tedious to add a title to every single one of them.
 So far I&#x27;ve considered these options:
  
I&#x27;m possibly missing some ox-hugo/hugo configuration
 Programmatically adding #+title to every file
 Switching to a different export mechanism altogether
  
Any advice is greatly appreciated, thank you all!

 My Emacs running LSP and not getting parameters upon choosing a function
 Technically, I have two questions but the one in the title is far more important to me.
 So my understanding is that LSP/Company can be made to insert the parameters of a function so that the parameter names are already filled out for you; while from the no-longer-supported company-lsp, the below Gif demonstrates the relative idea:
 Company Mode inserting the parameters of the function chosen
 But, as you can see from the end of my video, my Emacs doesn&#x27;t insert those parameters, just giving me an empty set of parentheses.
 My setup isn&#x27;t terribly complicated, sticking to general defaults:

                              <span>I need help. I can get all the individual parts of the query, but I cant seem to figure out how to string it all together.
 I am trying to create a custom agenda view and I want the hourly day calendar at the top and then the custom TODO query results at the bottom.
 I am fine with org-ql and org-super-agenda if that makes it easier.
 This is the logic I am looking for:
 if TAG:inbox or (TAG:+@work+next &amp;&amp; (NO SCHEDULED &amp;&amp; NO DEADLINE)) or (TAG:+@work &amp;&amp; (SCHEDULE || DEADLINE is today or overdue)) 
 I would also need the syntax to get it added to org-agenda view menu
 (add-to-list &#x27;org-agenda-custom-commands &#x27;(&quot;w&quot; &quot;calendar and @work+next TODO&quot; ... 
 I can pay you with venmo or paypal or probably something else.
 I&#x27;ll post the solution here once it is working in case it will help others.
 Thanks BFF!
 EDIT: also before you blast me the answer, double check with me that it has not already been answered. I don&#x27;t want 10 solutions sent to me and then 9 people feeling like I cheated them!!!

 Not sure if this is an org or DooM issue but I can&#x27;t use &#x60;RET&#x60; &#x60;&#x60; or &#x60;&#x60; to open links from an org file. Ideally I want to open in Firefox because of the Wayland integration. Unfortunately It just errors out: 
 &#x60;symbol&#x27;s value as variable is void: scheme&#x60;
 *Setup is as follows:*
 - org: 9.6
 - DooM emacs: 
 - Doom core v3.0.0-pre 
 - Doom modules v22.10.0-pre 
 - Emacs 28.1
 Happy to provide config file snippets.

                              <span>Perhaps there is no &quot;right&quot; way, but I&#x27;m trying to learn Scala. Perhaps more accurately, I&#x27;m trying to improve my terrible Scala and wanted to know the right way to try to build an app in Scala that could do what I am currently doing using Python and Boto3. Querying S3, Step functions, etc. etc.
 Wanted to know here whether anyone could point me to how they&#x27;re using Scala and AWS (or course Scala and Spark are how I generally use Scala, but now I want to use it for more and perhaps move some of my Boto3 stuff into Scala - mostly for learning purposes).
 Also, if I create an &quot;app&quot; that can run from the CLI, I will obviously have to also create some shell script to run the app because I need to invoke Java and all. Is there a better way of doing that?
 Thanks folks

 Python comes which much larger quantity of data science libraries, why scala for data science?

                              <span>Hello everybody,
I recently discovered the Zettelkasten method and am curious, if this method would be of any use to me. I&#x27;m doubting because all the explanations I see online or in books about that method using Zettelkästen are in the field of sociology, psychology, personal development etc., and I can see very well, why the method would be useful in those fields, where finding new ideas is a crucial part of the work done there. But I didn&#x27;t find a single YouTube video or alike made by scientists about that method.
So I wonder, if a Zettelkasten could be useful, as well, in fields where it&#x27;s much more about facts than insight. I mean, in those fields it&#x27;s much less about &quot;discovering unexpected relations&quot; and &quot;coming up with new ideas&quot;, but much more about collecting data and facts and pu…</span>

 If I try to find what C-M-p is mapped to via describe-key (C-h k), the emacs simply ignores C-M-p and displays nothing until I type another key.
 Does anyone know the solution to fix it?

                              <span>I&#x27;m a big Emacs fan and have loved using it for years but can&#x27;t help but think there&#x27;s a lot of jankiness in various language modes.
 Syntax highlighting in general is slow. Tree Sitter is an interesting potential replacement and I got it working with some languages but I got lost trying to install a language manually - ex vue tree sitter.
 Indentation can be unexpected. For example, say you are a PHP developer and you decide to try Emacs. The first thing you&#x27;d do is install some sort of PHP support, right? So you&#x27;d likely go to php-mode.
  
This is how php-mode highlights and indents my code by default.
 On VS Code, here is how it indents and formats the same code almost out of the box. Just had to install the PHP formatter. Just works.
 So then on your Emacs PHP journey you&#x27;d try to look for a better mode so you&#x27;d install web-mode and be happy because it formats it as expected. But I&#x27;ve experienced situations where web-mode would format in an unexpected way or syntax highlighting bugs out so I&#x27;d have to re-run M-x web-mode.
  
I seem to experience this a lot. A language mode that&#x27;s just has the janky kind of feel. I also wish there was more of a standard in how things were done. As an example, several language modes define their own variable for tab width. I do understand this is a project that&#x27;s been around since the 80s so cruft is to be expected.

 I am using hl-todo-mode and it highlights TODO keyword and also : punctuation without any problem. However, I also want it to highlight all the words after the TODO keyword until the end of the line. How can I achieve it?

 Please help to clarify it:)

                              <span>I&#x27;m learning from Get programming with Haskell. I have skipped all the capstone projects so I can revise all those topics and do those projects freshly. I&#x27;m at the halfway point. After finishing this book what should I learn? I am planning to learn typeclassopedia for higher theory (such as monad transformers). But I&#x27;m concerned that even after i do all the programs in this book. I wouldn&#x27;t be doing any &quot;real programming&quot;. Meaning, i feel like these are toy problems and i should find programs with actual substance(grounded in real world usage) so I can gather real experience. What site or book will have real coding challenges that will help me grow and mature as a programmer. My background is cybersecurity and I&#x27;d love to learn server side coding to improve my web security knowledge. Even tho this is my preference I don&#x27;t mind coding a parser combinator or something else that will help me. Tldr - what kind of practical programs should i code to progressively learn Haskell back end coding and land a job.

                              <span>How do I implement recursion for a function based on the number of calls within an argument. For example, if I have:
 cases &#x3D; t True $ t 10 $ t &#x27;a&#x27; func a (var x y) &#x3D; x 
 I would like to be able to test each case based on a. It would look something like:
 func a (var x y) &#x3D; True func (t a) (var x y) &#x3D; 10 func (t(t a)) (var x y) &#x3D; &#x27;a&#x27; 
 Where exactly would I implement the recursion? I&#x27;m thinking somewhere on &quot;a&quot; and also think somewhere on y.

                              <span>Hi everyone,
I realised there&#x27;s an &#x27;Introduce Yourself&#x27; category in the forum, so I thought I&#x27;d say hello.
Now that I&#x27;m thinking about it, I can&#x27;t remember how I discovered the Zettelkasten system. I only know that I somehow found it online a few months ago, while researching note-taking and study skills. I&#x27;m not originally from Germany, but I live here now, so the German-sounding name &#x27;Zettelkasten&#x27; piqued my curiosity when I first saw it.
The reason I was researching in the first place, is because I knew I would start studying for a Masters in October of this year. My Bachelors experience was way too ad-hoc. I just didn&#x27;t have a good system. Knowing that I wanted to have a much better experience studying for a Masters, I was determined to get a good note-taking and connection-building system in place before my studies started. After some reasearch, I realized that the Zettelkasten method was what I needed, and I&#x27;ve been using it actively for about a month now.
It&#x27;s still too early yet to have many links between notes, but I&#x27;m starting to build a nice network, one note at a time.
The forum history has already helped me, both to understand the method and to get ideas for my own personal implementation. I look forward to future learning with you.</span>

                              <span>I am again finding myself experimenting with a graphical view after watching Bob Dotos Video on how to use Obsidian to write an essay. He seems to have a quite young Zettelkasten or at least does not make use of connection like I use. With a depth&#x3D;2 a local graph by my Zettelkasten looks like this:

This is pretty typical when I browse my Zettelkasten and I am not able to get value from it. Of course, I am not practiced in using a graph view and my practice is by no means informed by a graph view. So, that could be confounders.
So, I find myself at a strange tension point: I really like using visual structures for my own Zettelkasten work. This is an example (actually from the book):

But whenever I run into the graph view I find myself unable to make it work.
I am not willing to stop challenging my position on graph view yet. I have a gut feeling that there is a blind spot I am not aware of. But I am confronted with a similar issue like many people it seems: There are no genuine demonstrations out there but just mock examples. Bob&#x27;s video is a very concise demonstration on how writing with a Zettelkasten can be realised. I recommend to watch it to enrich your perspective. But the youth of his Zettelkasten makes the graph view part not applicable to my own Zettelkasten.
I filter methods and techniques by their longevity. And if the graph view cannot show its power with older and more developed Zettelkastens I don&#x27;t think it is very promising to get into it. I want to concentrate my time and effort on methods and techniques that scale.
So, my question is: Are you aware of examples of graph view being used for more older and complex Zettelkastens?
Additional thought: Perhaps, the graph view is suited most to develop underdeveloped parts of the Zettelkasten?</span>

 So...
 I feel like my transformObject3d instance is very repetitive...but I am failing to see how I can simplify...I think that the Record passed to my Object3d constructors is different between the constructors and this is preventing me from simplifying...
 Any advice for a noob like me?
 module Object3d where import MatrixT (MatrixT, readPosition, writePosition) import Transformable (class Transformable) import Uuidable (class Uuidable) data BoardTag &#x3D; TwoByFour | OneBySix | QuarterInchPlywood | HalfInchPlywood data OrbTag &#x3D; Source | Destination | Measurement data PlaneTag &#x3D; Ground data Object3d &#x3D; Board { uuid :: Int, tag :: BoardTag, matrix :: MatrixT } | Orb { uuid :: Int, tag :: OrbTag, matrix :: MatrixT } | Plane { uuid :: Int, tag :: PlaneTag, matrix :: MatrixT } instance transformObject3d :: Transformable Object3d where getTransformationMatrix (Board { matrix }) &#x3D; matrix getTransformationMatrix (Orb { matrix }) &#x3D; matrix getTransformationMatrix (Plane { matrix }) &#x3D; matrix setTransformationMatrix (Board attrs) m &#x3D; Board attrs { matrix &#x3D; m } setTransformationMatrix (Orb attrs) m &#x3D; Orb attrs { matrix &#x3D; m } setTransformationMatrix (Plane attrs) m &#x3D; Plane attrs { matrix &#x3D; m } getPosition (Board { matrix }) &#x3D; readPosition matrix getPosition (Orb { matrix }) &#x3D; readPosition matrix getPosition (Plane { matrix }) &#x3D; readPosition matrix setPosition (Board attrs@{ matrix }) v &#x3D; Board attrs { matrix &#x3D; writePosition matrix v } setPosition (Orb attrs@{ matrix }) v &#x3D; Orb attrs { matrix &#x3D; writePosition matrix v } setPosition (Plane attrs@{ matrix }) v &#x3D; Plane attrs { matrix &#x3D; writePosition matrix v } instance idableObject3d :: Uuidable Object3d where getUuid (Board { uuid }) &#x3D; uuid getUuid (Orb { uuid }) &#x3D; uuid getUuid (Plane { uuid }) &#x3D; uuid

 I&#x27;ve recently been going through the Scala Cats rockthejvm course and while it&#x27;s been great value it feels a bit to abstract. I have trouble imagining how this will be used in real life.
 Are there any courses that are more &quot;hands on&quot;? As in, work in more realistic applications rather than abstract monad exercsies?
 Thank you very much?

                              <span>I&#x27;m a bit confused on what exactly the $ means. The way it is being used is for testing a function that I defined for an assignment. The way it is set up is :
 bigEnv &#x3D; ECons True $ ECons &quot;foo&quot; $ ... t3 &#x3D; test [var VZ bigEnv @? True] 
 (the ... is implying there is more tests but all within the same format). I understand that when testing bigEnv, it should be True, but does the $ mean that it is testing each thing within bigEnv separately or together to equal True?

                              <span>First of all sorry for a long question that probably has an obvious and short answer.
 I&#x27;m working through the idea that you can get to the Comonad typeclass, and its NonEmptyList instance, just by roughly considering the analogy between a category of CoKleisli arrows and turning it into code. In other words extract is extract :: w a -&gt; a and compose is compose :: (w a -&gt; b) -&gt; (w b -&gt; c) -&gt; (w a -&gt; c). Now you can rearrange to get extract and duplicate, and add Functor&#x27;s fmap.
 What I&#x27;m having a hard time with is that to implement compose for NonEmptyList is that if you start with a w a you can apply the first CoKleisli to get the b, but to get a w b to plug in to the next function you need to sort of conjure duplicate from thin air. Once you have duplicate you can go ahead and implement the NonEmptyList Comonad we are all familiar with, which &quot;duplicates&quot; the incoming list to its list of itself and its tails.
 The question is, isn&#x27;t there a simpler, but trivial and uninteresting implementation of compose here (and hence for extend also) that instead of duplicate, simply takes the head of the NonEmptyList. As far as I can tell this implementation is also lawful as a Comonad. I am missing a satisfying way to express that the way duplicate is implemented is somehow &quot;the right and obvious way&quot;.

                              <span>I&#x27;m attempting to implement a very basic hashMap . The goal is to just append strings to a list at an index that we receive from the hash function.
 data HMap &#x3D; HMap { keyValues :: [[String]] } deriving (Show) hash :: String -&gt; Int hash myString &#x3D; ((length myString) * 2) &#x60;div&#x60; 3 initialize :: Int -&gt; [[String]] initialize n &#x3D; replicate n [] insert :: String -&gt; [[String]] -&gt; [[String]] insert nothing xs &#x3D; xs insert s xs &#x3D; newList where newList &#x3D; before ++ [s:x] ++ after (before, x:after) &#x3D; splitAt (hash $ s) xs 
 This is the implementation. My approach is to replace the current nested list inside a hashMap object. It doesn&#x27;t help to think about this in an object-oriented style but it makes sense to me this way.
 I run the following commands and get the following back. I don&#x27;t understand why the list is unchanged. I assume it has to do with the method of using splitAt to insert a new list of strings where the split is occurring. I&#x27;d like some insight as to what is happening here and maybe alternative solutions if possible. 
 Many thanks in advanced friends.

                              <span>Hi,
 for few months now I am working on my hobby Yesod project - site for teaching physics. So far I managed to implement everything I tried to and I found Yesod amazing.
 However, I am starting to have my doubts if I should keep at it or go rather with something more mainstream (I am looking at django currently). And if so, what do you recommend? I plan to make this my life-long project, so its not something I want to ditch after a year and if, by some chance, it becomes sucessfull, I do have a lot of pretty complex plans for it, so future maintainabiliy and extensibility is also a consideration.
 Here are my concerns:
 1.) Haskell currently seems to me like a botomless pit of learning. Now, I do enjoy learning it, however I would like to soon shift my main attention from learning program…</span>

                              <span>I’ve seen various full rewrites during my career and I always thought myself that this would not happen in a better language. Unfortunately I only have very limited experience with Haskell and I never worked with it professionally so I cannot answer this for myself. I’m asking those who has more experience with Haskell. Did you ever see a codebase that was architected so badly that it was beyond repair or the new business requirement were just not compatible with it and it had to be rewritten? How true is that you can still reuse most of the business logic because it is ultimately pure? I’m talking about drastic architectural changes in large programs or complete rewrites.

 Currently on the higher functions chapter, and could use some help please.
 I cant seem to wrap my head around what happens under the hood during currification. I looked through all the posts about it on here and read on the wiki and other websites but some things are still unclear to me.
 let&#x27;s say we have a function add 2 3 4 when going through the process of curryfication, we get addTwo first, which returns a function that we can pass the parameter 3 to to get addTwoThree and so on.
 What I would like to know is what do the functions addTwo and addTwoThree do essentially?
 Do they return anything ? Or are those specifics in machine language and we dont know what goes on behind the scenes ?

 Exactly how much easier? Can we measure maintainability numerically? Expressing maintainability it in terms of concrete dev hours/money saved would surely be a boon to pure FP adoption. What can we do to produce those numbers?

                              <span>At first this was gonna be a question, but I looked a little further and realized the subtleties:
You ever notice in the two ZKs Luhmann worked on he indexed notes in both of his boxes 1-N?
Ex. So, a card labeled 1 or 1-6 can essentially be found in both boxes.
What&#x27;s different, fascinatingly, is how he wrote them.
In his first ZK, we saw him use a comma &quot;,&quot; (or in English, the period &quot;.&quot;) to branch his notes, but with the second one he used the slash &quot;/&quot;. That way he can account for notecards 1.6 and 1/6 to co-exist in his wider note-card system.
Luhmann probably would have changed it up if he wanted in a digital system, but I cannot blame him for taking the easy way out in that switch up. It was a good way to start over but leave no zettels behind. With that being said, even if he lived a lot longer, I&#x27;m not sure he would have opted to start a 3rd physical box.
(Rather minor, but I wasn&#x27;t sure if this fits more in &quot;Workflows&quot; or &quot;The Zettelkasten Method&quot; category. It was kind of a toss up for me.)</span>

                              <span>Hi I am relatively new to this subject and thought that it would be wise to debug my thinking before progressing too far. I am having difficulty with topics and connected zettels......
From what I have read the Luhmann system:
If the above is mapped onto a digital zettelkasten, then:
The unique id becomes, say YYYY-MM-DD-HHmm
The link to an already existing topic is a wikilink
The direct link to another zettel is a wikilink
The keywords are tags
My question: assuming the above is correct, then what means within a digital zettelkasten is typically used to assign topics to the top level zettels? As keywords are tightly tailored and the top level topics must be broad by their nature, so using tags for both would be confusing.
Thanks for feedback</span>

I wonder what is meant by that? And is it an interruption or disruption? Multiple storage might be interdependent, but to pull away the material a new topic can be added. So I think on a digital Zettelkasten this is no longer a problem.</span>

                              <span>Hello,
 Is there some detailed documentation of how to setup flymake with different languages?
 I used this but I must be missing something.
 https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/flymake.html 
 I have flymake-php installed and php-mode.
 I can start flymake with flymake-mode and get it in the menu.
 But the check does nothing, after I put in deliberate syntax mistakes in the php file.
 I tried flymake-php-load as well but that also does seem to do nothing for me.
 A flymake-running-backends also shows me nothing, which makes me think it is not really running actually or knows which backend to use.
 Do I need to install a language server or something? Or if there is perhaps an in depth guide. 
 Thank you very much.

                              <span>Hi! I am thinking about making a set of foot pedals for Emacs. I&#x27;ve looked into it before and I know different people used them differently but the impression I got was that your feet are too slow and too desynced from your hands to make it worthwhile (at least without significant practice). 
 My motivation stems from my left hand getting pretty overloaded, making some sequences of C and M impractical. For example, I struggle with using binds like C-c  because I tend to hold down the control while I press the next letter, so I get C-c C-. 
 So my idea would be to have pedals for priming the next keystroke to have a C or an M. So I can press the Cpedal, then hit c  and get C-c key. The pedal would then need to be released in order to register another C. There would be one pedal for C and one for M. 
 I was wondering if anybody had any experience with foot pedals and how useful (or useless) they were in your workflow. Have you ever used footpedals? If so, what did you use them for in Emacs? Did you have any use for them outside of Emacs? Were they comfortable? 
 Anything helps!

                              <span>I don&#x27;t know if I did something weird to cause it, but I kept having problems with SyntaxError: invalid syntax - IndentationError: unexpected indent when I tried to run python source blocks. The problem came from the auto-formatting occasionally throwing spaces on a line in a way that made the interpreter freak out.
 I couldn&#x27;t find a solution, so I came up with this:
 lisp (add-hook &#x27;org-ctrl-c-ctrl-c-hook (function (lambda () (replace-regexp-in-region &quot;\s+\n&quot; &quot;\n&quot; (org-element-property :begin (org-element-at-point)) (org-element-property :end (org-element-at-point))) nil))) 
 It chomps spaces at the end of lines which fully eliminates them from the lines that were causing problems. (it does it for all languages and alters the contents directly. I&#x27;m okay with both those things)
 I did a write up with more details and notes
 It took me a straight 8 hours to come up with the solution. Because I&#x27;m interested in seeing how other folks work I decided to post my notes from the endeavor. It&#x27;s mainly just a bunch of sequential code snippets as I try to home in on the solution
 I&#x27;m still new to this. If you see something wonky or dangerous, please let me know

                              <span>It isn&#x27;t clear to me how to add new projects to Emacs&#x27; native project concept. In my case, my Emacs init files is a git repo with submodules for each package that I&#x27;m using. I have the main repo added as a project but when I go to a submodule, Emacs thinks it is part of the main repo but I&#x27;d rather have each be their own separate project.
 Has anyone dealt with such a situation before?

 I&#x27;m new to emacs and this subreddit, so sorry if I do something wrong. I currently have to use VSCode because I&#x27;m dealing with typescript and react projects on the daily bases. That&#x27;s the only thing stopping me from switch to emacs.
 I managed to setup ts suport with typescript mode and lsp, but I can&#x27;t setup auto-imports. I guess it should be configured in LSP but I really can&#x27;t find it. 
 My config: https://github.com/ToxyFlog1627/emacs. LSP: https://github.com/ToxyFlog1627/emacs/blob/master/Emacs.org#lsp
 Any help would be really appreciated!

                              <span>[SOLVED]
 I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s happening, but when using Emacs inside Tmux, I can&#x27;t type an asterisk? Instead, the minibuffer says &quot;M-O j is undefined&quot;. Anyone know what this actually means?
 Edit: I&#x27;m using uxrvt, but the same happens in xterm.
 Edit 2: Ok, at least I have a work around - holding shift and it works??!
 Edit 3: Turns out it was urxvt that was breaking. Switched to Alacritty and everything worked

                              <span>I wish to record my exercise performance, but I cannot bring my laptop with me to the gym and record my performance nor do I wish to write it down and then insert it into my fitness.org file since that sounds cumbersome.
 My current process is to use Orgzly and sync my fitness.org file with my phone and I simply record everything at the gym from my phone as the following example with separate headings for each exercise:
 * Pull Ups 2022-10-21,5,10,10,15,20 2022-10-31,10,10,15,15,20 * Bench Press 2022-10-24,90,95,100,110,100 2022-10-28,95,100,100,110,100 
 I did attempt to use tables, but they don&#x27;t look easy to use in Orgzly so I am currently doing the above since it is easy to input into Orgzly on my phone. However, now that I have collected several months of data for all my exercises, I wish to produce a graph of my progress for each of the headings and I am unsure how to do this in the same fitness.org file since I recorded my data as csv instead of in an org table. In addition, I was also wondering how to plot the same data from multiple headings into a single graph using my above format? I am curious to see what others are doing and if there is a better way to track performance that can sync with my files on my computer while being in a format that is easy to work with.

                              <span>Hello, I remember there was a library posted here some time ago that would convert between case classes if one&#x27;s fields was a subset of the other, using macros.
 I would like to use it to do something like this &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;Scala case class Task(id: Long, description: String) // Sql-saved class case class Comment(id: Long, taskId: Long, comment: String) // Sql-saved class
 case class TaskDTO(id: Long, description: String, comments: Seq[Comment]) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 And be able to split incoming DTOs into a Task that is easily storable in the DB and the list of comments that will have foreign keys to the task.
 Does anyone know the name of such a library? Or maybe have some pointers as to how to do it differently? (I considered the DTO just being a class composing the task and comment list as fields, but that feels wonky)

                              <span>Hi, I have strange problem with org-mobile (iPhone) synced by Dropbox. Every time I sync files (after refreshing Dropbox token) entries from “Capture” disappears. According to the documentation:
 ‘’’The notes you captured in the MobileOrg app will be appended to a file called &#x60;from-mobile.org in your default org directory (variable org-directory).’’’
 But this file remains empty (mobileorg.org also becoming empty). Am I stupid and am I doing something wrong or is it some kind of bug in the application?

Binary Packet Parsing by Monday Morning Haskell
This problem is about parsing a binary format, similar in some sense to how network packets work. It’s a good exercise in handling a few different kinds of recursive cases.

                              <span>When one is programming, they may compile the same project dozens of times per day,
often after making only small modifications.
Recompiling all the modules each time would be extremely time-consuming and disrupt the programmer’s workflow.
Therefore, build tools are careful to avoid recompiling files if they
know the result would be identical to what is already built. This is
sometimes called recompilation avoidance.
Bazel is an open-source tool to build and test projects.
It is particularly well-suited for multilingual monorepos. As such,
Bazel has a strategy for recompilation avoidance.
Bazel tracks the inputs and outputs of build actions precisely in
order to decide what files need to be recompiled after a change.
The exact mechanism is out of scope for this article, but well described …</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been thinking it&#x27;d be nice to have this feature, and it shouldn&#x27;t be too hard to implement. But before I go and start working on it (which wouldn&#x27;t be in a while, because of previous obligations), I want to check if there&#x27;s already something that does this, or comes close.
 Here&#x27;s the behavior I&#x27;d like: with a simple command, I can open a new buffer that shows me a &quot;cheatsheet&quot; with all the keybindings I&#x27;ve saved before, along with their command-name and a brief description.
 Additional nice features would be:
  
ability to group keybindings by modes
 ability to filter by the current active mode(s), so that only keys/commands related to it are shown
 ability to save keybindings interactively
 ability to save keybindings easily from a mode&#x27;s keymap. Something like: in the *Help* buffer&#x27;s description of the mode, select any commands, and save them to the cheatsheet
  
Often it is enough to do a quick describe-mode to find the name of the function I&#x27;m looking for, but I think this feature could be particularly helpful for major modes like magit or org, which can have quite complex keymaps. It could also help people who are just starting out with Emacs.
 Do you know if a feature along these lines already exists?
 I found this cheatsheet package that comes quite close, although it lacks some of the features I&#x27;d like and (most importantly) does not automatically save cheatsheets between sessions. I haven&#x27;t taken a good look at the code there yet, but I think I might use it as my starting point.
 Would people be interested in this features? Any advice/critique is appreciated :)

                              <span>Hello, I&#x27;m a beginner at Emacs, I tried to figure this out by myself at first but it&#x27;s too confusing for me.
 I use God Mode on Emacs (vim-like modes) and I want to exit it when the comment-dwim command doesn&#x27;t comment out a region, only when it does and indented comment or a comment in an empty line, so that I can write afterwards, without having to press esc.
 ​
 Maybe there is some way to add the god-local-mode-pause function (the function to get into &quot;insert mode&quot;, so as to say) to any of the comment related functions, however, I don&#x27;t really know elisp, so any help is much appreciated.
 Tl;dr: is there any way to adhere a function to another so that when I execute one, with its name, it does another one as well?
 Edit: never mind, just learned what advising functions are for.
 The code I ended up with :
 (defadvice comment-indent (after comment-indent-after activate) (god-local-mode-pause)) (defadvice comment-add (after comment-add-after activate) (god-local-mode-pause))

 Is there some setting for this?

                              <span>I am using the zerodark-theme which customizes org-block-begin-line and org-block-end-line to have a background color with the extend property set to t.
 I like this change to the interface but it has some weird behavior. In the following screenshot
 https://preview.redd.it/ogyahfuvekx91.png?width&#x3D;275&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;b2b9f91213506ef84772672c1557043aef19fbda
 The color extends beyond the end of the line #+end_src to the following empty lines. This is not always the case and calling font-lock-update correctly colors the empty lines, though I am not sure why it happens in the first case!
 More annoyingly for collapsed items which have a source block inside them get colored like Hello... above.
 Is this a bug or intended behavior? Can I &quot;fix&quot; it?

                              <span>I would like to make a minor mode for quickly entering text containing accents or diacritical marks. In this mode, I would replace the keybinding for each alphabet key with a prefix map that is only defined for the number keys. For example the keybinding for the &#x27;a&#x27; key could be defined as:
 ﻿(cl-loop for ch across &quot;ąäàáæåâãǎα&quot; for ind from 0 do (define-key quick-accent-mode-map (kbd (format &quot;a %d&quot; ind)) &#x60;(lambda () (interactive) (insert-char ,ch)))) 
 So if the user typed &quot;a1&quot;, &quot;ä&quot; would be inserted into the buffer. But if the user typed &quot;a&quot; following by anything other than a digit, I would like the prefix map to have a &quot;default&quot; action that simply performs the actions that would result in the absence of the prefix map. So if the user types &quot;ad&quot;, then, for a typical text-editing major mode, &quot;ad&quot; would be inserted into the buffer.
 Is it possible to define a default action for a keymap to achieve this behavior?

                              <span>Hello.
 I have configured a bigger line spacing because I like to have spacing between lines to increase readability.
  (setq-local default-text-properties &#x27;(line-spacing 0.50 line-height 1.50)) 
 I use LSP peek to show references and definitions but, since I&#x27;m not using the default line height, the peek panel bottom most of the time is not visible because (I guess) wrongly calculates the panel&#x27;s height.
 Is there a way to customize de panel position and/or size so I can adjust it to my config?
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>Hey,
 I&#x27;ve recently moved to Emacs for some tasks I used other applications for including Music-player/mpd control.
 I wonder has anyone managed to set these kinds that make you start these &quot;apps&quot; inside Emacs
 globally so you can activate them outside of Emacs?
 Like I use &#x60;s-h h&#x60; to activate &#x60;helm-emms&#x60; or &#x60;s-h b&#x60; to activate &#x60;emms-browser&#x60; and I would like to able to use these outside of Emacs.

                              <span>Hej fellows,
 while &#x60;circadian&#x60; does switch from the &quot;sunrise&quot; to the &quot;sunset&quot; theme, it doesn&#x27;t do the other way around. Given correct long/lat, the opposite switch does simply not happen (even like 2-3 hours after the sun has risen).
 Can anyone help me understand why that happens?
 My configuration:
 (use-package circadian :config (setq calendar-latitude 50.1) (setq calendar-longitude 8.66) (setq circadian-themes &#x27;((:sunrise . modus-operandi) (:sunset . modus-vivendi))) (circadian-setup))

 I&#x27;ve been trying to find the source of a file-notify--call-handler error:
 file-notify--call-handler: Symbol’s function definition is void: nil 
 I can finally reproduce the error in vanilla emacs using just a few lines of code. First, I evaluate the following in a buffer in vanilla emacs (emacs -Q):
 (require &#x27;filenotify) (require &#x27;autorevert) (require &#x27;subr-x) (global-auto-revert-mode) (save-window-excursion (find-file &quot;~/tmp/test.el&quot;)) 
 And then, making use of the updated value of file-notify-descriptors (which I gather changes once you visit a new file if global-auto-revert-mode is enabled), I do the following: 
 (file-notify--handle-event (car (hash-table-keys file-notify-descriptors)) &#x27;(renamed attribute-changed deleted) &quot;/Users/apc/tmp/tes…</span>

                              <span>Hi everyone, I just started trying to get into concurrent Haskell, and my program doesn&#x27;t behave the way I would assume it should. I have reduced it to a minimal example, and I would appreciate some help figuring out the problem. Thanks in advance!
 Below is my program. Here is how it is supposed to work:
  
The program is based on an MVar quitFlag that is supposed to act as a flag: the main thread is a loop that exits if and only if quitFlag is nonempty.
 The program first launches a thread that counts up starting from 0 (see countingLoop) and writes into the flag once it gets past 1000. It also prints every number it counts.
 The main thread just loops indefinitely until the flag is set, at which point it just exits.
  
All I get is a program that never exits and prints nothing on screen, whereas I would expect it to print the first 1000 numbers and then exit.
 module Main where import Control.Monad (when, void) import qualified Control.Concurrent as Cc main :: IO () main &#x3D; do quitFlag  Int -&gt; IO () countingLoop flag n &#x3D; do when (n &gt;&#x3D; 1000000) $ Cc.putMVar flag () print $ &quot;n &#x3D;&#x3D; &quot; ++ show n countingLoop flag (n+1) -- | Run in a loop that only ends once the flag becomes nonempty runUntilNonEmpty :: Cc.MVar () -&gt; IO () runUntilNonEmpty flagVar &#x3D; do flag &lt;- Cc.isEmptyMVar flagVar when flag $ runUntilNonEmpty flagVar

                              <span>Sorry for the rant. I am preaching to the choir here. I recently saw a post in which someone regurgitated the often-commented Philip Wadler quote, “Agda is what Haskell wants to be when it grows up.” I love Agda, and one of my favorite papers of all time is a proof of computational complexity using Agda (https://projekter.aau.dk/projekter/files/335444832/pt101f20thesis.pdf). But I’m sorry, Haskell is the grown-up version of Agda, and it is the rational adult in a room full of children when compared to every other programming language. Agda, Idris, etc. are programming ideals, and I would love to see them reach the level of maturity of Haskell. But, guess what? You can do literally everything in Haskell, right now, at an astronomical level compared to any other programming language. Serious…</span>

                              <span>Does anyone know of a way that I could possibly run a Servant Server on the cloud for free? Are certain cloud services better than others for this task?
 I&#x27;m thinking it might make the most sense to write the code on a local machine, and compile it on my local machine, and then upload a binary to the cloud. But perhaps there&#x27;s another way to do this that I don&#x27;t yet know.
 Ideally I&#x27;d like something where I can send HTTP requests to a given url/ip and have Servant handle them and send results back to me.

Is possible to do some work around for deprecation error while maintaining 2.11 compatibility?

                              <span>Dear Zettlers,
I am currently reading the Artikel The Two Definitions of Zettelkasten and am just a couple of hundred words in. @chrisaldrich contextualises the Zettelkasten Method within the bigger picture of using practices that seem to have something in common. I am perfectly happy to admit that I do the very thing that Chris is pointing out: My starting point it the article by Luhmann and while I am aware of the history Zettelkasten Method I never saw much practical value from reading the historical use cases.
I, myself, am a pretty non-nostalgic character. My passion for the Zettelkasten Method is fueled by exactly two motivations:
Improving my personal toolbox for knowledge work.
Generating tools to help other people to improve their toolbox.
I see this as an advantage because I have little incentive to lose myself in tweaking tools or spending time on the tool for fun and joy (nothing wrong with that if you do because it aligns with your own goals, of course).
The downside of this utilitarian approach is that it creates a blind spot which can be a source of fallacies.
So, the question is: What did you learn from the history of the Zettelkasten Method? What is there to be found what is missing in the current collective thinking in the internet?
Live long and prosper

                              <span>On GitHub, a user proposed to change &quot;ghost&quot; to &quot;mind&quot;:

  
Changing ghost into mind. The mind refers to the mental frame, while ghost is the soul of a dead person.


In reaction to that, I wrote the first commentary to the translation:
The Zettelkasten as the ethereal ghost that hides in plain sight
In German, &quot;Geist&quot; means both &quot;mind&quot; and &quot;ghost&quot;. The question spelled out could be something like &quot;Can the mind of the Zettelkasten be observed?&quot; Or something like that. So, why &quot;ghost&quot; instead of &quot;mind?&quot;
There is great anime film titled &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot;. It is quite a philosophical movie that asks the question: If your consciousness can be moved from your body and brain to machine are you still considered a human or will you become a computer program? One possible answer could be: If we can move from body to body, and we are still considered human we should be considered to be ghosts that take possession of bodies.
What do the visitors see when they see everything and are disappointed? Perhaps, they feel the same disappointment of scientists who opened the scull of people to look at the human mind but see &quot;it all&quot;: just flabby gray tissue.
To this day, this seems to be the feeling us who start their own Zettelkasten. The frankensteinian fantasy of creating something alive turns into obsession or disappointment. The mind of the Zettelkasten turns into a ghost, something ethereal and evasive that can hide in plain sight. We dive into our Zettelkastens in search for what we believe we created and just seem to find notes.
So, what is the Zettelkasten? One possible answer might be: The ghost that is able to hide in plain sight and just can be seen from the corner of the eye.
What do you think about that reasoning?</span>

                              <span>Hi, I am a recent grad who has been professionally developing software in Haskell over the past two years. 
 I very much enjoy developing in the language and my job in general but I am somewhat worried about my future prospects not working in a more &quot;mainstream&quot; language.
 There aren&#x27;t many jobs concerning pure statically typed FP languages in my area and I would strongly prefer not to work a fully remote job. I am tied to my current location for the forseeable future. 
 As a result of the above, I worry about a scenario where I would end up losing my job at some point down the road and not being able to carry my experience onto my next job as easily. Is this justified or would it not be difficult to make a switch if need be? I notice vacancies often require several years of experience in whatever programming language the company offering the job is using. My qualifications are solid for my age and I have had the opportunity to contribute to open source projects as well so I guess that might help me in such a scenario. Maybe I should look to contribute to some non-FP open source projects just in case?
 In short, the dilemma I am in is that I do not want to quit my FP job but at the same time I do not want to potentially end up in a bad spot career-wise.
 I figured it could help to have some perspective from other people about this matter and would love to hear your thoughts on it.

                              <span>Hi all!
 I have recently uploaded my first cabal package to Hackage, the text-compression library: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/text-compression
 This library aims to provide a simple interface to various efficiently implemented compression algorithms.
 Currently, this library only has implementations for the Burrows–Wheeler transform (BWT) and the Inverse BWT algorithms.
 A brief list of future algorithms to be implemented and supported:
  
FM-index
 Move-to-front (MTF) transform
 Run-length encoding (RLE)
  
And more!
 A test suite is to be implemented for the current and future implementations.
 ​
 I would appreciate any and all feedback, and thank you for taking the time to check out this post and the library!
 ​

                              <span>I&#x27;d describe myself as a relatively senior Haskell-dev. Recently however, I had the opportunity to ask a much more experienced (20y+) Haskell-guru to review my code. He sighed, smiled and and said my code reminded him of his early Haskell days. I asked &quot;how come?&quot;, to which he replied
  
I also used to write r instead of request -- you&#x27;re a programmer, not a mathematician. You&#x27;re doing Haskell, people already know you&#x27;re clever -- you don&#x27;t have to write it on their noses (Swedish proverb)
  
I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m alone in doing things this way. If I were to justify it, I&#x27;d say past-me was carried away by Haskell&#x27;s promise of extremely concise code, and using 1-3 character variable names lend themselves to that end. Am I (are we?) just being vain at the expense of future maintainability? Have any of you found yourself adopting more descriptive variable names (as is custom in most other languages) with more experience?

 At least we&#x27;ve got a variable. How does a naked number, unidentified as to whether it&#x27;s an Int, Integer, etc., have type Num p &#x3D;&gt; p?

                              <span>I am trying write a function where depending on what the arguments are, it does different things with out an insane amount of pattern matching. For example, the function eval has 4 arguments. &quot;eval if t 1 2&quot; should return &quot;1&quot; and &quot;eval if f 1 2&quot; should return &quot;2&quot;. If the 2nd argument is t i want to return the 3rd argument and if f then the 4th. I need to do this on a bigger scale, but this is a simple example I can think of. Can someone help me out on how to do this?

                              <span>Hi, I wrote two functions for the Haskell functor laws and I am now required to do the following:
 Show that Either String (Maybe Integer) follows the functor laws. You will need several test cases that &#x60;shouldBe&#x60; True. These cases should test when the Right value is Nothing or Just k, where k is some Integer. Your test cases should also test when Either is a Left value. 
 Will someone please help me understand how to use &quot;either&quot; to test the functor laws? The two functor laws that I wrote are shown below:
 firstFunctorLaw :: (Eq (f a), Functor f) &#x3D;&gt; f a -&gt; Bool
 firstFunctorLaw x &#x3D; (fmap id x) &#x3D;&#x3D; x 
 secondFunctorLaw :: (Eq (f c), Functor f) &#x3D;&gt; (b -&gt; c) -&gt; (a -&gt; b) -&gt; f a -&gt; Bool
 secondFunctorLaw g f x &#x3D; (fmap (g.f) x) &#x3D;&#x3D; (fmap (g . f) $ x)

                              <span>I was always surprised that creating an internal link to another heading in org-mode is so laborious: navigate to that heading, store the link, navigate back, insert it. consult-org-heading is a really slick interface to quickly narrow the headings list and jump to one. So why not re-use it to directly insert links to headings at point? I threw together this small gist which works well for this. Now I can invoke consult-org-heading, use orderless to winnow to the heading I want, C-, to embark, and l to insert the link. 
 What methods do you use for quick internal link insertion in org?

                              <span>From time to time, elfeed gets confused and displays this in the mini-buffer:
 elfeed: 1 jobs pending.. 
 and this on the first line of the search page:
 0 jobs pending, 1 active .. 
 There&#x27;s no curl job running, in fact emacs has no child running (according to pstree). elfeed itself is still usable. The message survives a deletion of the elfeed buffers and is only cleared if I restart emacs. Which is a pain.
 Any ideas for me before I restart emacs again? (I&#x27;ve already scoured the bug reports at https://github.com/skeeto/elfeed/issues)

 I&#x27;ve seen registerv-make too, and that doesn&#x27;t seem to do the trick.
 Can anyone give me a simple template to have registers set to single- or multi-line-strings during init?
 (for bonus points, how about a kmacro? I have a certain sequence for interacting with gnus to process hundreds of emails a day that I&#x27;d love to not have to redefine every session)

                              <span>Is there a way to prevent the creation of dedicated buffers when editing org sources. I often just want to quickly edit the source and do not need the advantages of a dedicated area.
 I couldn&#x27;t find an anwer on the internet and even after reading the source code, I could not find a way to prevent it.

                              <span>I modifies the manoj-dark.el file to my liking. Its located in my .emacs.d dir and I want to set it as my default theme. I cannot, for the life of me, figure out how to do that. I have not set any other theme in the &quot;customize-theme&quot; menu and dont want to. Just load/set whatever the .el file as my standard theme. 
 Can somebody please tell me how to achieve that?

                              <span>Hi, sorry for the noob question, but I&#x27;ve been starting to use the terminal for the first time and emacs as the text editor for that. I wanted to enable the mouse, so I turned on Xterm Mouse Mode, but once I did that, scrolling seemed to be completely turned off. Whenever I try to scroll, it just says mouse 4/5 are undefined.
 I tried to find a solution online, but the solutions I came across seemed very hack-y. It feels like this kind of thing is just a setting I missed, especially because scrolling was working perfectly fine before. If there is no &quot;direct&quot; solution, I am curious why this is the case. Thanks!

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to understand the behavior of the variable current-prefix-arg. In particular, I&#x27;m trying to understand whether if I pass a prefix argument to func, and other-func is called by func, other-func should be ignoring that prefix argument. 
 Consider the following four functions: 
 (defun f1 (arg) (interactive &quot;P&quot;) (when arg &quot;Non-nil&quot;)) (defun f2 (arg) (interactive &quot;P&quot;) (when current-prefix-arg &quot;Non-nil&quot;)) (defun g1 (arg) (interactive &quot;P&quot;) (message &quot;%s, %s&quot; current-prefix-arg (f1 nil))) (defun g2 (arg) (interactive &quot;P&quot;) (message &quot;%s, %s&quot; current-prefix-arg (f2 nil))) 
 I would have thought that both g1 and g2 would behave the same. But if I call g1 with the C-u prefix key, I get &quot;(4), nil&quot;, whereas if I call g2 with the C-u prefix key, I get &quot;(4), non-nil&quot;. 
 Is this as it should be? I understand I can bind current-prefix-arg to nil before calling f2, i.e. I could just call f2 inside the scope of a let expression, binding current-prefix-arg to nil. But is there a cleaner way to do this? 
 Looking at the manual section on prefix command arguments hasn&#x27;t helped me figure this out, so I&#x27;m hoping someone here may be able to help. (I&#x27;m not clear on what is meant there by &quot;the next editing command. At first I thought prefix-arg would be passed on to functions in the scope of another, but current-prefix-arg would not; now I&#x27;m not sure anymore.)

                              <span>Hello to all,
 My problem is quite simple to understand: when I activate &quot;org-toggle-inline-images&quot;, I would like my images to be centered. Indeed, I tried this in a org-file
 #+ATTR_ORG: :width 800 :center t
 [[file:images/anImage.png]]
 ​
 But it obviously doesn&#x27;t work. 
 Does anyone have a tip?
 ​
 Thanks in advance

So, I&#x27;m trying to get a deeper understanding of what can be done with Org properties, and I notice that in the documentation there are, or appear to be, at least three types of the wee beasties, namely:
  
Special properties;
 Built-in properties; and
 User-defined properties.
  
The first of them is described explicitly in the Org manual, section, 7.2 …</span>

And it does this at the file level, so that you get optimal invalidation, caching, and concurrency performance without having to manually create and maintain mountains of BUILD file metadata: https://blog.pantsbuild.org/why-dependency-inference/

                              <span>I have been taking rock the jvm’s advanced scala course on Udemy, and I feel like there just isn’t enough legitimate practice for the concepts to fully sink in. Basically, I recognize the patterns when they come up in production code that others write, but I have a hard time actually using the patterns myself. Work projects that require me to use them are once in a blue moon type situations, so I need a way where I can hone my scala skills and understanding outside of the day-to-day projects that come up.
 I’m wondering if anyone has advice on how I might craft my own mini practice projects that would help me really get a feel for when to use type classes, implicits, futures, and whatnot. 
 I guess more broadly, my question is: how do I come up with projects to hone my skills without prompting from courses or from product folks at work?

 Expected output:

 102|null|xyz|743

 Spark version 3.2 and Scala version 2.1

                              <span>This guide explains how to install NixOS on a computer, with a twist.
If you use the same computer in different contexts, let’s say for work
and for your private life, you may wish to install two different
operating systems to protect your private life data from mistakes or
hacks from your work. For instance a cryptolocker you got from a
compromised work email won’t lock out your family photos.
But then you have two different operating systems to manage, and you
may consider that it’s not worth the effort and simply use the same
operating system for your private life and for work, at the cost of
the security you desired.
I offer you a third alternative, a single NixOS managing two securely
separated contexts. You choose your context at boot time, and you can
configure both context from eit…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to extend the class A which is written in Java to class B in Scala.
 class A { private Pattern pattern; private String regex&#x3D; &quot;folder1/folder2/folder3/.*&quot;; A(...){ this.regex &#x3D; regex; this.pattern &#x3D; Pattern.compile(getRegex()); } public String getRegex() { return regex; } } class B(...) extends A(...) { val regex: String&#x3D; &quot;folder4/.*&quot; override def getRegex(): String &#x3D; { regex } } 
 However, it seems that the getRegex() in Pattern.compile(getRegex()) is getting a null
 value from the B class. I&#x27;m also not allowed to pass the regex through the constructor. Not sure how I can resolve this issue.
 Anybody has any ideas?

                              <span>What is the best solution for a priority queue in scala if I’m limited to the standard library, but I would prefer a functional solution to using mutable structure?
 One solution would be SortedMap, but I read some benchmarking blog posts that they tend to be slow.
 Other would be implementing a binary heap using a Vector, which is supposed to be faster, but I’m not sure if it will still be faster if I need to perform the sifting on it.
 Is one of these options viable or is it just one of the situations, where using a mutable data structure is the best option?

 Given Twitter being known for Scala use, do you think this is opportunity for Scala getting a lift, or Twitter will be doing less Scala? Any insights how Scala and/or FP in general is viewed within Tesla for example?

 It throws me an error when I&#x27;m creating the stack methods, like pop, push or top, I don&#x27;t know why , This must be like a prefix calculator, I don&#x27;t know if my logic is correct in the eval method for evaluate the expression. 
 For example if a user in the main put +67 in the solve is 13

                              <span>Hello Ghosts and Ghouls,
 After a period of spooky deliberation and well-received release candidate, Koz and I are pleased to announce mtl-2.3.1, which features the following hellish changelog:
  
Add modifyError to Control.Monad.Error.Class, and re-export from Control.Monad.Except.
 Make the MonadCont instance for ContT more polykinded; now, r is allowed to be of an arbitrary kind k, rather than only Type.
 Add a generic liftCallCC for use with any MonadTrans.
 Add modifyError to Control.Monad.Error.Class
 Return re-export of ExceptT and related functions to Control.Monad.Except.
 Add label function to MonadCont
  
If you wish to migrate to mtl-2.3.x and have not yet done so, please refer the migration guide in the repo: https://github.com/haskell/mtl/blob/master/docs/Mtl-2.3.x-Migration.md
 A release has been published on the github repository under the tag v2.3.1.
 Happy Halloween!
 Emily + Koz

                              <span>Since Haskell is an imperative language, which describes what to do rather than how to do it, how does one do complexity analysis on it?
 Are there any tools that help you with it ?
 What is the &quot;mathematical&quot; approach to this? I assume it&#x27;s something like analysis of single functions , to figure out their compositional time complexity ?
 I apologize for the foolery, I&#x27;m just a beginner :)
 Thank you !!

 Edit: I&#x27;m not sure how to include codeblocks on reddit, tried using backticks but that does not work. Apologies if this might be hard to read.

 The prospective opportunity of contributing cabal packages to Hackage excites me and was wondering if anyone knew of how to be added to the Uploaders group there? I have sent an email but maybe the admins haven&#x27;t seen/checked emails for new users to be added to the uploaders group?
 Does anyone know if there are any other requirements to be given access to upload packages to Hackage?

                              <span>What is wrong with the following Monoid instance? I am getting these errors:
 • Couldn&#x27;t match expected type ‘(a0 -&gt; a0 -&gt; a0)
 -&gt; Vec -&gt; Vec -&gt; Vec -&gt; Vec’
 with actual type ‘Vec’
 • The function ‘Vec’ is applied to three arguments,
 but its type ‘[Double] -&gt; Vec’ has only one
 In the expression: (Vec x) () (Vec y)
 In an equation for ‘mappend’: mappend &#x3D; (Vec x) () (Vec y) 
 data Vec &#x3D; Vec [Double] deriving (Num, Show, Eq)
 instance Monoid Vec where
 mappend &#x3D; (Vec x) () (Vec y)

 -----------------------------------------------------
 Question 2: In the following function I am trying to return a list of booleans depending on the values of the 2 input vectors. If the first 2 numbers match, it should be True, and so on. The functions compile but I am unable to test them.
 andd :: Vec -&gt; Vec -&gt; [Bool]
 andd (Vec x) (Vec y) &#x3D; zipWith equals x y
 equals :: Double -&gt;Double -&gt; Bool
 equals x y &#x3D; x&#x3D;&#x3D;y

                              <span>Hello,
 I&#x27;m trying eglot on emacs-29 which I configure like follows (mostly for C++): &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 (progn (customize-set-variable &#x27;eglot-autoshutdown t) (customize-set-variable &#x27;eglot-extend-to-xref t) (customize-set-variable &#x27;eglot-ignored-server-capabilities (quote (:documentFormattingProvider :documentRangeFormattingProvider)))
 (with-eval-after-load &#x27;eglot (setq completion-category-defaults nil) (add-to-list &#x27;eglot-server-programs &#x27;(c-mode c++-mode . (&quot;clangd&quot; &quot;-j&#x3D;4&quot; &quot;--malloc-trim&quot; &quot;--log&#x3D;error&quot; &quot;--background-index&quot; &quot;--clang-tidy&quot; &quot;--cross-file-rename&quot; &quot;--completion-style&#x3D;detailed&quot; &quot;--pch-storage&#x3D;memory&quot; &quot;--header-insertion&#x3D;never&quot; &quot;--header-insertion-decorators&#x3D;0&quot;)))) (add-hook &#x27;c-mode-hook #&#x27;eglot-ensure) (add-hook &#x27;c++-mode-hook #&#x27;eglot-ensure) (add-hook &#x27;rustic-mode-hook #&#x27;eglot-ensure)) 
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Things seem to work, however, even when I have requested clangd to not do header insertion --header-insertion&#x3D;never, eglot keeps inserting headers for me. How can I disable this behaviour or I&#x27;m I doing something wrong?
 For example, if I&#x27;m on a C++ buffer and I type std::vector then eglot will go ahead and add #include  which I don&#x27;t want at all.

                              <span>Greetings, fellow Emacsians!
 On behalf of the EmacsConf 2022 organizers team, I’m very excited to announce the schedule for EmacsConf 2022 (Dec 3 and 4).
 All of the times listed on the schedule are in EST (UTC-5). You can click on each talk’s title to open its page for more information, including its scheduled time in your local time. (Displaying local time requires running a tiny bit of AGPLv3+-licensed free/libre JavaScript code, included on the talk pages.)
 For prerecorded talks, this time is also when the talk’s video will be made available on the same page. Please note that the times are approximations, and that the schedule may change leading up to the conference.
 As the conference approaches, we’ll post more details on how to watch and participate.
 You can subscribe to the emacsconf-discuss mailing list at https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/emacsconf-discuss to be sure you’ll get updates. We’ll also put updates here on r/emacs.
 Want to help make EmacsConf even awesomer? Volunteer!
 https://emacsconf.org/2022/volunteer/
 We hope to see you all around on Dec 3–4 for EmacsConf 2022!
 (This email was slightly adapted from the email sent to the emacsconf-discuss@gnu.org mailing list.)

                              <span>So I&#x27;ve been using Gnu Emacs in the office for about two weeks now. I&#x27;m a vim user and will remain a vim user but I was challenged to try emacs by my colleagues and I in turn challenged them to try Vim. After the promised two weeks I can say the following about emacs from a vimmer perspective.
 I actually LIKE IT. I like the possibilities of emacs and the extensibility although for my workflow it doesn&#x27;t offer much that vim plugins don&#x27;t.
  
I don&#x27;t like emacs PACKAGE MANAGER at all and I don&#x27;t really care for lisps. I find vim script much easier. I don&#x27;t like how emacs treats buffers and I find myself constantly killing extra buffers. I don&#x27;t mind the emacs key bindings that much but I quickly changed the evil mode because muscle memory was killing me. 
  
I both LOVE &amp; HATE M-x commands! I love them cause you can discover so much about was emacs can do but I hate typing them. I REALLY like w3m in emacs! I use w3m in a terminal on a daily basis and with emacs I can just have it open in a buffer or split and do my work at the same time. 
  
I LOVE how great emacs handles RTL languages. It is just great and looks great too.
  
I don&#x27;t care for org mode! Yea yea I know you will hate me for saying it but I really dont care about it I prefer Vim wiki
  
I DON&#x27;T like the emacs terminal options that I&#x27;ve tested so far. K couldn&#x27;t install vterm so maybe thats why
  
With all that being said I will use both emacs and vim on a daily basis for different things but what would make my life easier in emacs would be if I knew a way to handle buffers more effortlessly in emacs. In vim I can ZZ out of any buffer or split. The emacs evil mode doesn&#x27;t provide that by default and I couldn&#x27;t map it myself in the config.
  
PS: I use the latest release of emacs in the Arch repos. I am a frontend web developer.
  
PS2: sorry about the lengthy post, just thought I&#x27;d share my experience. Cheers.

A I thought it would be nice if there was a common knowledge base on what Luhmann himself wrote on Zettelkasten. So here is a translation of all 18 notes of the section 9/8 of his second Zettelkasten. I tried to find a middle ground between a translation that is faithful to his style, the nature of the German language, and the least ambigious English I can come up with.

                              <span>While surfing around on Emacs Stack Exchange, someone commented to go look at dir-locals-set-directory-class. It has a closely associated function called dir-locals-set-class-variables.
 Base Emacs knows about projects. Projects are defined (mostly) via version control. I know about Projectile and use it as well but this is in base Emacs introduced in version 23.
 The two steps are to first set up dir local variables based upon class using dir-locals-set-class-variables. I explain why I used eval later but I did this:
 lisp (dir-locals-set-class-variables &#x27;proj1 &#x27;((nil . ((eval . (pedz/proj1-set-default-mode-locals)))) (enh-ruby-mode . ((eval . (pedz/proj1-set-enh-ruby-mode-locals)))))) 
 The second step is to tie a project (specified by its directory) to a class like this:
 lisp (dir-locals-set-directory-class &quot;~/Source/proj1&quot; &#x27;proj1) 
 And you are done. The two functions pedz/proj1-set-default-mode-locals and pedz/proj1-set-enh-ruby-mode-locals will be called based upon the mode of the file being visited within the project. And they are also called for such things as compile buffers and other buffers not visiting files within the project based upon default-directory. Those functions can set variables, enable modes, etc.
 So... you are asking Why not just use .dir-locals.el?
 The answer is because of risky variables. I now have three variables that end with program which are (properly) considered risky that need to be set in this project and it isn&#x27;t possible to type ! and tell Emacs &quot;Yes... those variables for this directory are ok. Please don&#x27;t pull on my shirt tail again about this.&quot;. Rather, each new file that is opened, it will ask if those variables are ok to be set.
 And I totally get why. It is unsafe to just set those variables based upon something that may or may not be under your control. But your init files are (or should be) under your control. So, I&#x27;ve moved all of the project specific settings into my init files.

                              <span>Suppose I have a table and I work with one row at a time, is there any elegant way to set one cell to something different? If I try this:
 (defvar my-table (make-hash-table)) (puthash &#x27;foo &#x27;(nil nil 0) my-table) (puthash &#x27;bar &#x27;(nil nil 0) my-table) (puthash &#x27;baz &#x27;(nil nil 0) my-table) (defun do-stuff () (let ((running (nth 0 (gethash key my-table))) (chain-state (nth 1 (gethash key my-table))) (last-idle-value (nth 2 (gethash key my-table)))) (setf running t))) (do-stuff &#x27;bar) 
 then I would hope that (gethash &#x27;bar my-table) shows me the row (t nil 0) but it&#x27;s still (nil nil 0).
 This matters because now the only thing that will work is if I don&#x27;t let-bind. And that makes my large functions super-unreadable with (nth 1 (gethash key my-table)) all over the place. 
 I&#x27;ve also tried cl-letf and seq-let, they don&#x27;t help here.

                              <span>Problem
 Characters in my org-mode blocks is fontified with the Input Serif font, but I want them to be fontified with the PragmataPro Liga font from the default face, when I set the fixed-pitch face to inherit from default. But when I manually set the fixed-pitch face to use the PragmataPro Liga font everything works as I want.
 Because it works as I intend when I set fixed-pitch directly to use PragmataPro Liga instead of inheriting that propoerty from default I conclude that I&#x27;m doing something wrong when I set fixed-pitch to inherit from default.
 I&#x27;m trying to figure out what I&#x27;m doing wrong mostly because this problem shows that there&#x27;s a hole in my understanding of Emacs.

 I&#x27;m 99% sure that I&#x27;m doing something wrong here, but I can&#x27;t figure this out:
 This is the scenario: I have one frame with two windows showing two separate dired buffers, let&#x27;s call them A and B. A is visiting ~/testA/ and B is visiting ~/testB/. In both directories, there is a subdirectory foo/ that I want to merge from buffer A into buffer B, and it doesn&#x27;t matter if the files within that subdirectory are overwritten (this is what I want to do). I mark foo/ in buffer A by pressing m (dired-mark) and press C (dired-do-copy). I am prompted for the location that I want to copy to; I enter the directory that buffer B is visiting and press RET.

                              <span>Hello all,
 I have been playing with keymaps and wrapper commands a lot. And something I have come to realise is that a lot of stuff could be implemented really fast by sending arbitrary key sequences. 
 Keyboard macros seem limited to me : they look more like a succession of commands than a succession of keys.
 Two examples I could not achieve with macros (maybe I&#x27;m doing it wrong)
 - Prepare a command : for example I want to prepare a call to isearch, with foo pre-typed into the minibuffer. When I do it the macro way, the macro will execute the command isearch foo
 - Define an alias for partial key-bindings : let&#x27;s say I want to alias C-x r to C-r, so that i can type C-r t instead of C-x r t (which is bound to #&#x27;string-rectangle). I could not make a keyboard macro work since C-x r is not bound to anything
 Is there anyway to send arbitrary key sequences to the emacs interpreter from elisp ?
 ​
 Thanks !

                              <span>From the docs, it seems that when building emacs, one obtains an executable called temacs which then loads the elisp libraries that give us a functioning editor. I imagine this temacs binary is just an elisp interpreter. Is there a way to interact with temacs like one does with the sbcl repl and manually load the elisp libraries to see how emacs bootstraps in real time?

Problem is that in Scala 3, every scala sub version seems to compile to one _3 JAR and they are incompatible. It seems that scalatest JAR is compiled with 3.1 which 3.0 can&#x27;t read. 
 I don&#x27;t understand how it is improvement over 2.X where every version has its own JARs. If you have one library compiled by scala3.1 it means you can&#x27;t use scala 3.0. What is situation between 3.2 and 3.1? Can 3.1 read library compiled by 3.2?

 I&#x27;m trying to map this to a Scala function, that uses LazyList, not 100% sure how,
 e.g., if I have a recurrence relation, assume operator is just + and we have integers...
 F(k,n) &#x3D; F(n-1) + F(n-2) + ... + F(n-k)
 And I can supply the k first elements of the stream, is there a simple way to define the relation in terms of itself, i.e.
 lazy val xs: LazyList[Int] &#x3D; a #:: b #:: c #:: d #:: .... etc...?

 So in his talk The Case For Effect Systems Spiewak says something(its timestamped) like &quot;I had a service that could handle 100 connection and then when it got a 1000 it didnt crash because it was written with IO and Resource&quot; and doest really elaborate on why that was the case 
 From my point of view its very easy to have such guaranties in &quot;1 thread per request&quot; model since all you have to say is &quot;this thread pool of size 100 will handle http connections&quot; and 101th concurrent connection will fail cause you dont have a thread to for it. When with effect systems and asynchronous stuff in general(eg NodeJs which only has 1 thread) where you have n threads to handle a much bigger m of concurrent connection you dont have that. And generally its a good thing cause what you do is essentially keep a queue of things to do trading memory and latency for the ability to handle any number of connection up to the limits of you your systems resources. You latency rises but you dont return 500s. Up to the point where you die.
 And I dont see how IO and Resource would help you with now dying when IO(and to be fair Futures) is the thing that enables such a problem

                              <span>Hello, guys! I have the technical question.
 Need to merge the payload if the reference number(refNo) is the same in different messages. Limitation is that I can only use a KTable and if the key is an even number I don&#x27;t need to merge the payload. Additionally, the order of incoming messages should not change the result.
 ​
 For example, if we have an empty topic and incoming messages are:
 ​
 1: { key: &quot;1&quot;, value: {refNo:1, payload:{data1}} }
 2: { key: &quot;2&quot;, value: {refNo:1, payload:{data2}} }
 3: { key: &quot;3&quot;, value: {refNo:2, payload:{data3}} } // this one should be not effected and left how it is
 ​
 Expected result:
 ​
 1: { key: &quot;1&quot;, value: {refNo:1, payload:{data1, data2}} }
 2: { key: &quot;2&quot;, value: {refNo:1, payload:{data2}} }
 3: { key: &quot;3&quot;, value: {refNo:2, payload:{data3}} }
 ​
 The only way I can think of to do this is to use two times .groupBy and join with the original topic everything again.
 ​
  
First change the key to refNo, save the key to the value itself, and join the payload during aggregation.
 Secondly .groupBy revert key to the initial state.
 The last step joins everything to the original topic because I lost one message during grouping by.
  
​
 I&#x27;m pretty sure there&#x27;s an easier way to do this. What is the most optimized and elegant way to solve this issue?
 ​
 Thank you in advance.

You can make looping patterns greedy using the pattern.greedy() method, but you cannot yet make group patterns greedy.
  
And in the examples they have the following comment for greedy:
 // expecting 2, 3 or 4 occurrences and repeating as many as possible start.times(2, 4).greedy()
 What do they mean by repeating as many as possible in this context?

                              <span>Hello,
 I have the following code example to encode numerals as Church numerals, this compiles (with RankNTypes enabled) :
 s :: (a -&gt; b -&gt; c) -&gt; (a -&gt; b) -&gt; a -&gt; c s x y z &#x3D; x z (y z) k :: a -&gt; b -&gt; a k x _ &#x3D; x type ChurchNumeral &#x3D; forall a. (a -&gt; a) -&gt; a -&gt; a csucc :: ChurchNumeral -&gt; ChurchNumeral csucc n &#x3D; s (s (k s) k) n 
 However, once I η-reduce csucc to
 csucc &#x3D; s (s (k s) k) 
 I get
 • Couldn&#x27;t match type: (b0 -&gt; c0) -&gt; a0 -&gt; b0 with: forall a. (a -&gt; a) -&gt; a -&gt; a Expected: ChurchNumeral -&gt; ChurchNumeral Actual: ((b0 -&gt; c0) -&gt; a0 -&gt; b0) -&gt; (b0 -&gt; c0) -&gt; a0 -&gt; c0 • In the expression: s (s (k s) k) In an equation for ‘csucc’: csucc &#x3D; s (s (k s) k) | 130 | csucc &#x3D; s (s (k s) k) | 
 How could I get this version to compile? I&#x27;m guessing passing in the argument explicitly allows GHC to know that the second argument of the most-outer s call has the expected type, but leaving that s partially applied, GHC is looking for the type in the signature of s and it can&#x27;t unify that type with ChurchNumeral. Is that correct?
 Thank you in advance!

                              <span>-XScopedTypeVariables is super useful but traditionally only allowed binding type variables in function definitions with explicit types. Recently-ish we got explicit type variables in pattern positions
 lookupQMap :: forall a. Typeable a &#x3D;&gt; QKey a -&gt; QMap -&gt; Maybe a lookupQMap qid qmap &#x3D; -- This could use a Data.Typeable.cast, but it&#x27;s simplified from some more complex code case lookupQ qid qmap of ResultEntry @r&#x27; dat _ | Just Refl  ... 
 Which is great and makes GADTs much more usable in my experience. But there is some churn when adding new arguments, which I usually work around by using record syntax
  case lookupQ qid qmap of ResultEntry @r {resultData&#x3D;dat} -- [parser] [E] parser error on input &#x27;{&#x27; 
 The proposal and paper don&#x27;t seem to mention record patterns. Is this an oversight, or an intentional decision because it would make the grammar ambiguous, or something else? Does anyone know a workaround?

 I have only found today&#x27;s date, and I don&#x27;t know how to perform an asthmatic operation like subtracting one from the year&#x27;s parameter.
 Currently, this template expansion % expands to today&#x27;s date, how can I modify it?

                              <span>First, I am not the author of this tool, but have used toc-mode to make tables of contents for pdf and djvu files for many times. There are only a few other tools have the same functionality, but toc-mode is supposed to be the most convenient one. 
 Most other tools are command line, which is not adequate for this task. Even though a pdf contains the information of its table of contents, it is almost impossible to get a perfect table of contents automatically. You always need to do some editing to the extracted table, and this is why having this tool in Emacs is reasonable. Most editors focus on programming code, but things involving editing are more than that. I think toc-mode is a good example.
 By the way, the same author has more ambitious goals to create better a better doc viewer with some editing functionalities in Emacs. This is again a great example how Emacs do can more than code editing.

                              <span>I have been eyeing emacs for a very long time but haven&#x27;t taken the plunge yet because of the barrier to entry. I take a lot of notes that involve figures and equations. Due to my dislike for latex, I type all of my notes using markdown in vim. While markdown is fine for simple readmes, it&#x27;s a bit lacking when it comes to organizing figures or making anything but basic tables. I would like to know whether orgmode has the ability to group figures. There are two kinds of these. The first is the type where you have multiple independent figures along a row, with each having its own caption. The second is like the first but in addition to each figure having its own caption, there&#x27;s a caption for the whole group. Can emacs do that without resorting to using ugly latex code ?

However, I&#x27;m coming up short when looking for hooks, functions, or filters to make use of. Essentially, I want to run compilation-next-error whenever a compilation finishes with errors.
 ​
 In case you haven&#x27;t tried compilation-shell-minor-mode inside an inferior shell, please give it a try. You won&#x27;t regret it. It also works with vterm, but you need to do a little extra work to make sure the key bindings don&#x27;t conflict with each other.

 And how to fix it?

                              <span>I recently have switched from using ivy/counsel to vertico/consult/embark/marginalia. Sometime during this transition, when I ran load-theme, it would activate each theme as I scrolled through the list, giving a preview of the theme with the current windows. When I finalized my configuration, I found that I no longer got theme previews when running load-theme. Did I imagine this functionality? Does anyone know how to set this up? I read through the docs for consult and embark and didn&#x27;t see anything relevant. Thanks!

                              <span>I have some exercise information recorded in a table in one of my org files and I was trying to plot the table in a graph and have the graph pop up beneath the table. 
 Here is the type of data that I am trying to plot:

 I am running emacs on WSL2 on a windows computer and I installed gnuplot from the ubuntu terminal first. Then I also included the following in my init.el file: use-package gnuplot :straight t. I then placed my cursor near the table and ran M-x org-plot/gnuplot as mentioned in the manual. I did not get any errors but I am not sure where the graph was created? How can I make the graph pop up in the org file?

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking for a way to bypass org-agenda dispatcher (unsure about the terminology here: I&#x27;m talking about the buffer you get immediately upon calling org-agenda), and thought of a simple way of doing it. 
 (defun my/org-agenda () (interactive) (setq my/agenda-views nil) (dolist (cmd org-agenda-custom-commands) (add-to-list &#x27;my/agenda-views (cons (car (cdr cmd)) (car cmd)))) (let ((view (cdr (assoc (completing-read &quot;Select an agenda view: &quot; my/agenda-views) my/agenda-views)))) (org-agenda nil view nil))) 
 That worked just fine, but I thought it&#x27;d be nice to be able to pass restrictions (to buffer, subtree, etc.) to the function, perhaps using C-u as a prefix for a buffer restriction and C-u C-u for a subtree restriction. So I figured this should work: 
 (defun my/org-agenda-restr (&amp;optional arg) (interactive &quot;P&quot;) (when arg (org-check-for-org-mode)) (setq my/agenda-views nil) (dolist (cmd org-agenda-custom-commands) (add-to-list &#x27;my/agenda-views (cons (car (cdr cmd)) (car cmd)))) (let ((restr (cond ((equal arg &#x27;(4)) &#x27;buffer) ((equal arg &#x27;(16)) &#x27;subtree))) (view (cdr (assoc (completing-read &quot;Select an agenda view: &quot; my/agenda-views) my/agenda-views)))) (org-agenda nil view restr))) 
 But it doesn&#x27;t. For some reason, no matter which custom view I try to call, I get a CRM prompt asking me to choose a keyword. 
 Now, I thought maybe I was passing the wrong type of object as the third argument for org-agenda, So I tested using this, and it looks like what I&#x27;m passing as the third argument is a symbol, which I thought is what it wanted: 
 (defun my/test (&amp;optional arg) (interactive &quot;P&quot;) (let ((restr (cond ((equal arg &#x27;(4)) &#x27;buffer) ((equal arg &#x27;(16)) &#x27;subtree)))) (when (symbolp restr) (message &quot;Yes&quot;)))) 
 So I&#x27;m going wrong somewhere, but cannot figure out where.

                              <span>I am using chemacs2 in order to test other emacs flavours and learn from them. My main emacs is a nano-emacs based on the config of u/Nicolas-Rougier.
 But while the loading of my emacs works without any problem when located under .emacs.d, if I use chemacs2 and relocate my default config under .emacs.nano, I get the error that the library guess-language is missing, when starting emacs with emacs --with-profile default. Why does this problem only come with chemacs2? I am using straight as the package manager. 
 Has anyone else also similar problems with chemacs2?

                              <span>Is there something special about the key combination C-&#x3D;? 
 I tried to bind C-&#x3D; to er/expand-region from the expand-region package but nothing happens when I press C-&#x3D;. 
 If I try C-h k C-&#x3D; it&#x27;s as if I hadn&#x27;t pressed any key at all. The minibuffer prompts me to press some keys as if I hadn&#x27;t pressed anything. 
 For example a bare text-mode buffer C-h k C-&#x3D; C-p previous-line.
 Further, if i try binding C-S-&#x3D; the same situation - it&#x27;s ignored. Yet binding C-+ works so when I press C-S-&#x3D; what is bound to C-+ executes.
 As far as I can tell my OS (linux) window manager (xfce4 xf4wm) doesn&#x27;t bind C-&#x3D; to anything special.

However, it&#x27;s quite painful to try to adjust the settings drastically on my &quot;perfect&quot; system (I botch a config, all of a sudden just undoing those changes is difficult).
 I&#x27;ve been thinking of making an alternate/fake user account just for the other Emacs setup (or a chroot?) - anyone have any other ideas/preferences?

 Oh yeah fill-paragraph does not have this behavior in other modes. It is behaving as expected.

Brave individuals who we created this script for, who are not only willing to org mode it, but org mode it in the nude mobile with orgzly.
 The only way for us to continue improvement, fix bugs, optimize code, and provide additional features to benefit the use or org is to have people out in the real world using it and breaking it. So, my brave friends, use it, and break it good. Break it real good.

                              <span>Some of you Zettelkasten fans might be interested in an outdated and idiosyncratic program called Literary Machine. You can learn more here:
http://sommestad.com/lm.htm
The program is powerful but far from intuitive, so here are my personal notes about how to use it:
The core items in LM are:
Concept/category words (in the Dictionary pane).
Text items (notes; little boxes in which you write text).
Projects (collections of selected text items).
In a regular outliner program, you add items to a category (in a tree view or hierarchical list); in LM, it&#x27;s just the opposite: you add categories to an item (similar to tagging with #hashtags. This is true for LM projects, too. You don&#x27;t add items to a project; you add projects to an item. All of this is done by dragging a concept (dictionary word)…</span>

1. What

  
Zettelkasten contains many atom thoughts and this method chains each thought together by their unique addresses. This web of thoughts makes it convenient to visit from one thought to another.



Thus, this method underlines the connection between different knowledge. On the contrary, stacking notes linearly just leads to a bloated mess over time. This non-linear organization just allows our mind to scale with the number of thoughts (organic growth) and still remain cle…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking at this in hackage trying to pick apart the concept of Num and I&#x27;m wondering (among other things) why there is no commutativity for multiplication mentioned? Is it somehow auto-magically created from the other &quot;ring&quot; properties? I&#x27;ve got a few more questions, but those later.

                              <span>Actually, I already tried setting it up in VSCode, I installed stack, then a bunch of haskell extensions, then VSCode told me to install GHCup, and then updated extensions and what not and now nothing works.
 Whenever I try running my program with &quot;Load GHCI&quot; I get this kind of message: 
 : error: can&#x27;t find file: Lib.hs Failed, no modules loaded. 
 And when I try executing the default &quot;someFunc&quot; function (which basically prints a string) I get: 
 :1:1: error: Variable not in scope: someFunc 
 What&#x27;s wrong? How can I fix that? Or maybe I should just start from 0? Or even use a different IDE? What do you guys recommend?
 I&#x27;m very much fascinated with Haskell, category theory and functional programming, but how can I get into it when I&#x27;m unable to execute a simple Haskell program.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been looking around, but I&#x27;m quite unsure which one to choose. None of them have any recent commits either: 
 https://github.com/masterdezign/Learning#readme
 https://github.com/mikeizbicki/hlearn
 https://github.com/aligusnet/mltool
 Are there any people here that can attest for the ease of use of any specific library? Perhaps some suggestions for other libraries that I haven&#x27;t found? 
 I wanna try building a music classification application to make it easier to make good d&amp;d playlists and I wanna look around for some language that I haven&#x27;t tried yet, so I can learn something new while I&#x27;m building.

                              <span>Hi everyone, I am working on a Haskell project using cabal. It is a simple executable cabal project with a Main.hs file which imports a few other .hs files.
 Whenever I build it using cabal new-run, the imported source files seem to only get recompiled if something that depends on them changes in Main.hs. This is the case regardless of whether they have been edited since the last compilation.
 How can I change this behavior? Am I doing something wrong? Surely I should be able to edit the imported files and have the changes be reflected upon compiling the project?
 My workaround as of now is to systematically delete, before each compilation, all the files generated by cabal during the last one, which I am sure is not the intended way.
 Sorry if my question is dumb; as might be apparent I don&#x27;t know much about the compilation process but I&#x27;d be happy to know more.

                              <span>Hey everyone, I&#x27;m making a compiler for a Computer Science class for a fairly simple language based on pascal (Pascal-0).
 In this language, we have a few reserved keywords, the thing is, they are case-insensitive (as are the variables). That means that for example, function, FUNCTION and funCTiOn all mean the same thing.
 As these are reserved keywords, I can easily &quot;hard-code&quot; them into the Lexer with something like this:
 function { \_ -&gt; FUNCTION } 
 But this obviously is not case insensitive.
 I found a possible way to do it with maps, but I really would prefer to do it via regex if possible.
 Obviously, I can also do something like:
  (f|F)(u|U) ... (o|O)(n|N) 
 but that&#x27;s obviously out of the question as it is not scalable.
 Is this at all possible, and is there a better way to do it other than maps, if regex isn&#x27;t possible?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been doing interview prep with Python since the companies I&#x27;m interviewing for don&#x27;t allow Haskell as a language to do the interview in. And I&#x27;ve wondered, once more, why the state of error messages in Haskell is so deplorable? Python gives you concise useful hints like &quot;perhaps you meant .. &quot; if you misspelt a variable, and on a whole makes it much easier to know what you&#x27;ve done wrong once you&#x27;ve read the message. On the other hand, I&#x27;m not sure how many people are expected to understand what the following error message is supposed to mean without some significant Googling and time spent banging your head over what a Skolem type is:
 ...

Gives me the type of anything the user inserts (e.g. true --&gt; Bool; 3 --&gt; Integer)
 Then outputs false IF the type does not equal Num
  
Currently i have:
 ziffertest :: Num -&gt; Bool
 ziffertest x &#x3D; x&#x3D;0 &amp;&amp; TYPE CONDITION
 In consequence e.g. f only puts out an error and not a boolean false.

                              <span>Kinda clickbait title, but I&#x27;ll go with it. I&#x27;m someone who&#x27;s familiar with both functional and oo paradigm and have experience working on industrial/research project with both. Although I work with different languages and paradigms for work and study purposes, I personally prefer Haskell over other languages I work with.
 Recently, I decided to learn a new language (for fun, for job hunt etc) and am thinking of Scala. Since I love Haskell, I wanted to start with Functional Programming in Scala. However, seems like the book doesn’t cover Scala 3. Should I worry about it and use some other resource? Or should I just go with Scala 2.x?
 Also, since I haven’t started learning, I&#x27;d appreciate if you let me know if I should learn it or something else (maybe &quot;Go for elixir since you like strictly functional stuff&quot;)?
 Thanks!
 Edit: Thank you all for your valuable comments. I made up my mind to give Scala a try. Probably I will start with 2.x and move to 3 after getting some head around it.

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently operating in a strict environment in which &quot;idle&quot; TCP sessions are dropped (at the router level is my guess). M-x sql-postgres prompts for user, host, password and then starts a psql session (comint). I need to instead use the URL form - postgres://host?keepalives_idle?et_al - but need help getting that sent properly. I&#x27;ve tried setting sql-connection-alist 
 (setq sql-connection-alist &#x27;(db (sql-product &#x27;postgres)(sql-database &#x27;postgres://host/dbname?keepalives_idle&#x3D;60&amp;keepalives_count&#x3D;10)))
 but still get prompted for host/user. (I have a .psqlrc file so no password needed)
 All this on linux platforms, emacs version is 25 sadly
 Any pointers appreciated.

                              <span>I&#x27;d like to have a completing-read type command that can perform commonly used file moving/copying operations. For example, I&#x27;m constantly syncing a couple of projects to a remote machine where they run. Currently I bind a key for each one to an rsync shell command call like so:
 (defun myprojectA-sync () (interactive) (shell-command (concat &quot;rsync -a --progress --exclude-from&#x3D;&#x27;~/myprojectA/.syncignore&#x27; ~/myprojectA/ remotemachine1:~/myprojectA/ &amp;&amp; echo &#x27;Done.&#x27;&quot;)))) (map! :leader :desc &quot;Sync my project A from local machine&quot; &quot;c b&quot; #&#x27;myprojectA-sync) 
 It&#x27;d be helpful to have one single command to call a completion list that can run the pre-defined file operations for Project A, B, C, etc. I don&#x27;t see why they couldn&#x27;t act on multiple machines (remotemachine1, remotemachine2, etc.) or use different commands (mv, scp, rsync, etc.).
 Is there some feature/package that already exists to do something like this? 
 If not, does anyone have suggestions for a novice in elisp when it comes to writing the function? My thoughts so far were just a bunch of lists like
 (setq sync-names &#x27;(&quot;Sync project A&quot; &quot;Sync project B&quot;)) (setq sync-method &#x27;(&quot;rsync&quot; &quot;scp&quot;)) (setq sync-dest-dir &#x27;(&quot;remotemachine1:~/dir1&quot; &quot;remotemachine2:~/otherdir&quot;)) 
 to call shell-command wrapped in competing-read.

                              <span>I want to make a serious deep dive into understanding cookies (as in web cookies). I&#x27;m wondering if using Emacs as my web browser while I do this would work. I&#x27;ve not tried it at all.
 The thought is that I will be able to dig out and look at the cookies more easily and rig up triggers for various events such as when particular cookies are fetched or changed, etc.
 Along those lines, are there any Emacs packages you would recommend to help facilitate this adventure?

What is the native way to have this kind of functionality with icomplete? And for that matter, how does your fido config look like? Its hard to find examples on the internet

                              <span>is anyone using org-capture-ref ? I am planning to replace my zotero in my workflow with emacs. so far capturing content from browsers and adding more details by hand which is tedious. Zotero auto-discovers such metadata automatically adaptive to the site. org-capture-ref seems to be doing a similar thing, org-ref does this but its main UX is from emacs, but when I read i mostly live on firefox and only capture when necessary. it helps me explore more, and would the method till get used to browsing via emacs, which may take a long time, because my bad I have huge resistance. I am going to try out org-capture-ref, but would like to know the experience of existing users.

                              <span>Here&#x27;s a little derived mode that makes using emacs as a MySQL client a little more developer-friendly: https://git.sr.ht/~rfm/dbcnx-mode/tree/master
 Essentially, you name SQL files according to the keys in your &#x60;sql-connection-alist&#x60;, and with a &#x60;dbcnx&#x60; extension. The mode adds one keybinding: &#x60;C-c C-l&#x60;, which connects using the credentials associated with the filename/alist key, leaving you with one buffer containing queries you want to run and another in which to run them and see the results.

                              <span>Hello! I&#x27;ve been struggling with this issue for several days now and wondered if any Mac OS Emacs users have successfully overcome it. I created a thread on the Emacs StackExchange describing the issue and my attempts at solutions in detail, but the gist is:
  
I&#x27;m building Emacs from source on Mac OS, 12.4 w/ M1.
 
I&#x27;m configuring Emacs with native compilation.
 
  ./configure --with-native-compilation \ --with-ns \ --disable-silent-rules 
  
The build succeeds, src/emacs runs like a charm and I make install.
 
My nextstep/Emacs.app runs, but emits a ton of libgccjit.so: error: error invoking gcc driver errors to the Messages buffer.
 
 I suspect the Emacs.app package has some misconfigured paths that are unable to find my libgccjit library, which I&#x27;ve installed via homebrew. I&#x27;ve tried experimenting with exec-path-from-shell to ensure Emacs is aware of my shell paths, but to no avail.
 In the meantime, I&#x27;ve been able to use emacs and emacsclient from the CLI with no issues to speak of. The only problems arise when I interact with the Emacs.app application. Anyone have an idea as to what&#x27;s going on here?

 I have really tried to keep this as short as possible and could use some help. My friend and I manage a small business together and want an interface to create and assign tasks that we can mutually access and modify. I&#x27;m very familiar with Org Mode but initially thought I&#x27;d not force that upon my partner, but, well, obviously org mode is just the best so nothing else will do so I immediately gave up on that idea. The more I thought about it the more handy I thought it&#x27;d be to just do this in org mode, naturally. 
 I&#x27;m familiar with using a terminal emulator on Android / iOS and Syncthing to sync my org files. I will be doing this along with most task-admin related things. My partner however is not familiar with Emacs at all, so I&#x27;d like a sufficiently capable app that&#x27;s also dea…</span>

                              <span>When GHC 9.2 was released in late 2021, I was eager to migrate my projects, particularly to reap the ergonomic benefits
of the record dot syntax feature.
My disappointment was immeasurable as I discovered that some of my more involved type-level computations caused GHCi to
get stuck, just spinning indefinitely at full CPU load – it meant that in order to get productive with the new compiler,
I would have to invest a potentially significant amount of time to debug a regression.
Since my plate was already full at the time, I postponed this with the hope of an upcoming minor release magically fixing
the issue.
At the beginning of May, I was presented with the opportunity to work on an arbitrary GHC topic in order to gain
expertise as part of Tweag’s mission to improve GHC. To avoid having to …</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m using GADTs to model the domain of my programme, and quite enjoying the experience, but have found that it requires quite a lot of boilerplate.
 For example, I am building a series of &quot;filter&quot; functions which filter input datatypes:
  data MyType &#x3D; TypeOne | TypeTwo data MyEntity (t :: MyType) where MyEntityOne :: String -&gt; MyEntity &#x27;TypeOne MyEntityTwo :: String -&gt; String -&gt; MyEntity &#x27;TypeTwo 
 I can create input filters which I can nicely compose with a fish (&gt;&#x3D;&gt;) operator:
  filterOnes :: forall a. MyEntity a -&gt; Maybe (MyEntity &#x27;TypeOne) filterOnes x@(MyEntityOne {}) &#x3D; Just x filterOnes _ &#x3D; Nothing 
 The thing is, I&#x27;m finding writing this sort of case a bit tedious, and it would be much nicer to have something like this:
  filterOnes &#x3D; filterFor @&#x27;TypeOne -- or, even better myFilter :: forall a. MyEntity a -&gt; Maybe (MyEntity &#x27;TypeOne) myFilter &#x3D; (filterFor @&#x27;TypeOne) &gt;&#x3D;&gt; someOtherFilter 
 But I don&#x27;t know how to create something like this, which reminds me of the generic-lens library. I feel like this might be a common pattern with GADTs, is there an obvious solution?

                              <span>Hello everyone! I&#x27;ve got some exciting news to share.
 Earlier this year, I&#x27;ve released the first version of HVM, a massively parallel functional runtime that aims to be the ultimate target for pure functional languages like Haskell, Elm, Kind and many others, and finally unleash the inherent parallelism of the functional paradigm. HVM&#x27;s first version was very limited; it could only parallelize algorithms that recursed in a perfect binary tree fashion, it lacked IO and had some synchronization bugs. Soon, we&#x27;ll be releasing an updated version, which fixes these bugs, includes IO primitives, and a new workstealing-based scheduler, which is capable of generalizing to basically any functional program that isn&#x27;t inherently sequential. For example, it can use all cores on the computation of Fib(n), achieving maximal performance!
 The most exciting news, though, is that a GPU runtime is on the works. I&#x27;ve just, right now, finished the very initial prototype, a self-contained, 1200-LOC file that evaluates a busy recursive function on the GPU. It is performing about 680 million rewrites/second on 4096 cores of my Laptop RTX 3080. That&#x27;s 4x more than single-thread performance, on the very first attempt of the very first prototype. I believe we&#x27;ll soon be reaching record benchmarks on GPUs. Several API improvements and stability features will also be included on the upcoming update.
 We&#x27;re ahead of very exiting times for functional programming, and I hope this encourages language developers to target the HVM! Imagine a working STG-&gt;HVM compiler? We&#x27;re also interested in hiring a CUDA professional to help us profile and improve the GPU back-end. If you know someone who&#x27;d be interested, please let me know via DM! And be welcome to visit our Discord community and ask anything on the #HVM channel.

                              <span>To add to the list of Haskell wishes I posted yesterday: instance derivation for variable size tuples.
 That each tuple size has to be treated separately is really annoying. A lot of effort has been spent on much less important (&#x3D; less common) problems, it certainly can be solved somehow with the syntax for variable type tuple size + extended tuple size... Actually maybe I&#x27;m just reinventing some existing wheel, but I&#x27;ve never seen it used.
 For example:
 class Encoding a where encode :: a -&gt; String 
 Now I have to do:
 instance Encoding (a, b) where encode (a, b) &#x3D; encode a  encode b instance Encoding (a, b, c) where encode (a, b, c) &#x3D; encode a  encode b  encode c -- and so on until the limit of either tuple size or patience is reached 
 You can see code like this across endless number of libraries, including base
 Why cannot I instead have something like this:
 instance Encoding (a, b) where encode (a, b) &#x3D; encode a  encode b instance Encoding (..., b) where encode (a@..., b) &#x3D; encode a  encode b 
 Never mind the specific syntax, it can be whatever, but the idea is to define instance for all tuple sizes recursively.
 Is it maybe possible already?
 That would also require (and allow) some size-polymorphic operations to add/split the first/last tuple elements, in a type safe way.
 I&#x27;ve no idea why it doesn&#x27;t already exist.

 (Or should I just have my third thumb surgically removed?) :)

 This was an especially noticeable deficiency when trying selectrum with projectile-find-file - I couldn&#x27;t open my dotfiles and type &quot;init&quot; to find &quot;init.el&quot;, as it seemed to want me to specify the entire path preceding it.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been using emacs to write tex documents for a long time, and recently switched to spacemacs, with evil mode. I use the reftex command reftex-reference to insert \ref commands. In spacemacs evil mode, when I use this, the reference is inserted *before* the cursor (point), so that it&#x27;s off by one character. I would like to know if it&#x27;s possible to configure this to insert after. I&#x27;m asking here because I think this is a general evil-mode issue rather than a specific spacemacs configuration issue. Details below.
 Here&#x27;s what happens:
 Have a tex file with some text like the following, with the cursor at the rectangle marker, and with the buffer in evil&#x27;s &quot;normal state&quot; (like vim&#x27;s normal mode), not insert mode.
 \begin{theorem}\label{mylabel} theorem text \end{theorem} Now some words▮ 
 Note that this is what happens when there&#x27;s a space *after* &quot;words&quot; in the text; in evil&#x27;s normal state, the cursor is a block that occupies the position of a character.
 Then I use the reftex-reference command and select &quot;mylabel&quot;. The inserted text I get is
 Now some words\ref{mylabel}▮ 
 with the inserted \ref *before* the trailing space. Then the space appears *after*. I believe the line that actually does the inserting is line 510 of reftex-ref.el.
 ​
 To be clear, this is not because the final character is a space. If I delete the space after &quot;words&quot;, positioning my cursor on the final &quot;s&quot;, then the inserted reference looks like
 Now some word\ref{mylabel}s 
 with the cursor positioned on the final &quot;s&quot;.
 ​
 So, the problem seems to be that reftex-reference is doing the insertion on the *left* side of the &quot;normal state&quot; cursor, not the right. I would like it to insert on the right. Does anyone here know how this can be configured?
 Thanks!

                              <span>I guess this is a rhetorical question because I doubt anyone knows why but it turns out that dired buffers return nil for buffer-file-name instead of the path to the directory they are viewing.
 I believe this has cost me a ton of time but I did learn a lot along the way. lsp-docker highest level function is lsp-docker-start. It calls lsp-workspace-root which calls buffer-file-name which, if starting from a dired buffer, returns nil so lsp-workspace-root returns nil and the LSP server is not started.
 This is my first venture into LSP mode and I was doing something slightly different, a basic low level function was returning nil, so I assumed I was way off track in my set up, and I needed to dig deeper. And, indeed, I came up with a solution. I was documenting what I had found for myself so I wouldn&#x27;t forget and started asking myself more questions.
 I went back and tested lsp-workspace-root in a file that had LSP mode enabled and it returned the proper path for the workspace. I then restarted everything, loaded lsp-mode but didn&#x27;t start it, and went to the directory of the project. Sure enough, lsp-workspace-root returned nil (as it had before). I then looked at the code and started to try and follow it step by step. That&#x27;s when I discovered that dired buffers have no buffer-file-name. I opened TAGS (an arbitrary file within the project) and now lsp-workspace-root returns the proper workspace.
 I think I could have set up my LSP stuff with a simple YAML file had I tried lsp-docker-start from a file rather than a dired buffer and saved the time spent coming up with the solution I pointed to.
 Anyhow... live and learn I guess.

 the above snippet is in my config to conveniently choose from a pool of recently visited files. I am wondering if there is any advantage in using &quot;change buffer&quot; e.g. ibuffer instead? Or rather, whats the difference ?

 Is there a variable I can set so that this happens automatically upon export, without my having to write it out manually?
 I&#x27;ve had a look through the manual and can&#x27;t find anything. Maybe I&#x27;m just being dense, or maybe the docs haven&#x27;t been updated, but surely this exists right?

                              <span>hi guys, to reduce amount of topics I create here I wish I can use emacs&#x27; self-documentation better. 
 I can&#x27;t quite figure how to search across all the documentation for a specific word or regex if possible. 
 Example: I know that org-clock-report table (or clocktable) has :narrow param. I initially found it in google but now, since I know it exists, how can I quickly find info about this param directly in emacs? For example I want to find a manual page where this param is mentioned. Is there anything like apropos-EVERYTHING command that will look for a word (or regex) in all documentation? 
 Even more. I now know that info about :narrow param for clock table can be found in org manual on a page called The clock table. I know it from google. How could I find this page using emacs? 
 How would you find that page in emacs manual?
 P.S. I know about describe-* and apropos-* (and info) functions but I don&#x27;t see any function that does the search across everything. There are also similar questions in the internet and there is a suggestion to search the documentation with grep or zgrep which I don&#x27;t find useful. They just search in *.info files which when opened don&#x27;t behave as info pages. Is greping the only way?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve seen developers expensing a Sublime Text / JetBrains license to their employer, no questions asked. It would be amazing if one could similarly contribute financially towards emacs development efforts. 
 Would it be possible to cook up something formal enough (through FSF or some other org) like an annual &quot;Emacs support license&quot; with a couple of different tiers based on amounts (such that users can choose the split to different projects of interest). Users might then be able to expense it at work with the justification that it helps improve the specific packages they depend on (including core emacs). The same &quot;licenses&quot; could equally well serve as a portal for personal donations, but I feel that there&#x27;s likely substantial low-hanging fruit in getting corporate funding in this grassroots manner.
 (I&#x27;ve pondered about this before, but some questions on the emacs survey reminded me of this again.)

 I try to use org-ref and ivy-bibtex for my bibliography management. What I&#x27;m not able to do, is to search through my bibtex file and then, decide whether to open the org-ref note, pdf, ...
 So far, what I&#x27;m able to do is:
  
run ivy-bibtex from everywhere, and search through my bibliography
 Left mouse click on an existing citation to a bib entry in my org-file to bring up org-ref-hydra/body
  
What I want to do:
  
run ivy-bibtex from everywhere, and search through my bibliography
 on return, execute org-ref-hydra/body on the selected line in ivy-bibtex
  
​
 Has someone an idea on how to achieve this behavior?
 Best

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently switching my package management from Debian to Guix, and so far it&#x27;s been wonderful. However, I just found something very curious. In the screenshot, you can see my &#x27;old&#x27; self compiled Emacs (28.1) and my new Emacs (28.2) installed via Guix. They render the same text in the same file, in the same theme, with the same font (as per M-x describe-font), but they look quite different.
 Here&#x27;s a screenshot showing the two side by side: https://screenshots.200ok.ch/screenshot_2022_10_26-a7bdddc0.png
 The version to the left is quite thin, the weight seems off. However, the weight is the same. Changing the weight will not remove this discrepancy. 
 Both Debian and Guix have the bold variant of Fira installed: https://screenshots.200ok.ch/screenshot_2022_10_26-36be0060.png
 Generally speaking, the bold variant works insofar that I can use it globally: https://screenshots.200ok.ch/screenshot_2022_10_26-5620acc4.png
 However, when used in a font-face, it won&#x27;t become bold: https://screenshots.200ok.ch/screenshot_2022_10_26-bb7ddfd5.png
 I&#x27;m happy if anyone can point me to the necessary change to make the new install look the same as before. Thank you for your help!

                              <span>​
 Hi everyone, 
 ​
 I&#x27;m trying to write an elisp function that allows me to more easily query org-roam database with various keywords.
 ​
 Suppose I want to find all the titles that contain both &quot;hello&quot; and &quot;world&quot;, I know this can be done with a single query instance like the following:
 ​
 (org-roam-db-query [:select * :from titles
 :where (and (like title &quot;%hello%&quot;)
 (like title &quot;%world%&quot;)) ] )
 ​
 Now I&#x27;m trying to turn this into an elisp function to make it easier to use. However, the challenge is my queries can contain an arbitrary number of keywords, for example:
 (org-roam-db-query [:select * :from titles
 :where (and (like title &quot;%hello%&quot;)
 (like title &quot;%world%&quot;) 
 (like title &quot;%again%&quot;)) ] )
 ​
 The function should thus accept a list of keywords and return the notes that contains ALL the keywords in that list, something like:
 ​
 my-func(&#x27;(&quot;hello&quot; &quot;world&quot;)) -&gt; should return all notes containing &quot;hello&quot; &quot;world&quot;
 my-func(&#x27;(&quot;hello&quot; &quot;world&quot; &quot;again&quot;)) -&gt; should return all notes containing &quot;hello&quot; &quot;world&quot; &quot;again&quot;
 ​
 Can anyone suggest how to implement such a function?

                              <span>Hi, 
 I am wondering whether someone has used org-mode as a basis for publishing documentation of Python projects via Sphinx. Actually, I am looking for a workflow to write my documentation in org-mode, convert it to .md or .rst, add Sphinx&#x27; autodoc-extension and finally publish the result with GitHub Pages. 
 Has somebody done something like that? Thanks...

 I am watching Rainer König&#x27;s video on scheduling, deadlines and agenda view. I cannot use the agenda view. One of the comments says:
 Quick tips, the keybinding for agenda view has to be setted on the init file. Standard recommendation seems to be :
 (global-set-key &quot;\C-cl&quot; &#x27;org-store-link)
 (global-set-key &quot;\C-ca&quot; &#x27;org-agenda)
 (global-set-key &quot;\C-cc&quot; &#x27;org-capture)
 (global-set-key &quot;\C-cb&quot; &#x27;org-iswitchb)
 Another one, for the agenda view to process your current file add it witc
 C-c [ 
 But I don&#x27;t have any idea what they&#x27;re talking about :/ Could you help me?

 3rd year CS student here.
 Just started learning Haskell and I absolutely love the elegance of it.
 I&#x27;m still very much a newbie but I can see this becoming my favorite language.
 I think you understand where I&#x27;m coming from. :)
 ________________________________________________________________________________
 Well anyway enough about me and on to my problem:
 - I&#x27;m using a Linux Debian based distro
 - I used ghcup to install:
 GHCup 0.1.18.0 latest, recommended Stacks 2.9.1 latest, recommended HLS 1.8.0.0 latest, recommended GHC 9.2.4 recommended GHC 9.0.2 
 ghcup, stacks and ghc all work...
 HLS works if I type haskell-language-server-wrapper-1.8.0.0 in the terminal and it says:

 Since I started working with Haskell professionally at the beginning of the year (yay!), and neovim is my editor of choice, I&#x27;ve decided to put some elbow grease into improving my experience.
 And of course I would be happy to share it with (and get feedback/contributions/ideas from) any other Haskellers who use neovim!
 haskell-tools.nvim
  
Built around haskell-language-server, mostly.
 I just finished work on a feature that triggers a hoogle search for the type signature of whatever is under the cursor.
  
On a side note, my neotest-haskell adapter (TreeSitter-powered hspec tests) now supports both Cabal and Stack.

                              <span>Hoping someone proficient in Haskell can give me some pointers on a homework assignment I&#x27;m currently bashing my head against. We&#x27;re currently covering higher order functions, and our professor wants us to write a function that acts as a form of simple memory storage. Here&#x27;s the part of the assignment that&#x27;s stumping me:
 -- We&#x27;ll consider a different way to represent memory. Memoryf is a function from variable names to values. type Memoryf &#x3D; String -&gt; Int -- The function memf1 gives all variables the value of zero memf1 &#x3D; \_ -&gt; 0 -- The following commands use the function putValue to modify our memory function: memf2 &#x3D; putValuef &quot;z&quot; 3 memf1 memf3 &#x3D; putValuef &quot;y&quot; (-2) memf2 memf4 &#x3D; putValuef &quot;x&quot; 1 memf3 -- putValue should take three arguments: -- 1. The name of a variable, x -- 2. The variable value m -- 3. A Memoryf function -- putValue should assign x to m and return the updated Memoryf function putValue :: String -&gt; Int -&gt; Memoryf -&gt; Memoryf putValue x m memf &#x3D; _________________________ -- Write your code here -- Example output: -- (putValue &quot;x&quot; 5 memf4) &quot;x&quot; -- 5 
 My thinking is that calling putValue should add something to the effect of &quot;if memf x is called, return m&quot; but I have no idea how to write this. The furthest I&#x27;ve gotten is:
 putValue :: String -&gt; Int -&gt; Memoryf -&gt; Memoryf putValue x m memf &#x3D; (\x -&gt; m) 
 which is useless because it will return the value of m for any variable, and thus doesn&#x27;t work as a store of value.
 I&#x27;d greatly appreciate any guidance y&#x27;all have to offer. I&#x27;m giving myself a headache trying to sort through this myself.

                              <span>Just trying to get my head round do notation, and settled on a few problems with lists. I ended up writing the following code to (eventually) annotate entries in a 2d nested list (trying to mimic a 9x9 array) with column/row numbers. :
 arrayWithCoords :: [[Int]] -&gt; [[(Int, (Int, Int)]] arrayWithCoords arr &#x3D; do a &lt;- zip arr ([1..9]::[Int]) b &lt;- zip a ([1..9]::[Int]) return _ 
 Obviously the solution right now is incomplete, but I keep getting the following type error for a:
  • Couldn&#x27;t match expected type: [a0] with actual type: ([Int], Int) • In the first argument of ‘zip’, namely ‘a’ In a stmt of a &#x27;do&#x27; block: b &lt;- zip a ([1 .. 9] :: [Int]) In the expression: do a &lt;- zip arr ([1 .. 9] :: [Int]) b &lt;- zip a ([1 .. 9] :: [Int]) return _ 
 On inspection in the editor a is given a type annotation of [Any] , rather than ([Int], Int) as I expected

 Unsurprisingly perhaps, this thought was spurred on by the latest projectile release.
 I most likely won&#x27;t move back to projectile with this information, but may implement any very compelling features atop project.el.

 Is there any way to do this?

                              <span>Made the foolish mistake of early adoption of MacOS Ventura. Looks to me like the new OS breaks libgccjit and therefore native comp.
 ​
 Is anyone able to compile on the latest MacOS?
 ​
 So far, I&#x27;ve been unable to link the libgccjit hello world: https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/jit/intro/tutorial01.html
 The farthest I can get is to the following errors:
 gcc-11: warning: could not understand version &#x27;13.00.00&#x27;
 ld: -rpath can only be used when targeting Mac OS X 10.5 or later
 collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
 At which point, it seems as if the problems are inherent to gcc-11 in combination with MacOS&#x27;s ld. Anyone able to make this work?

 Here is my init.el
 For the record both machines have .emacs.d in home directory (~/.emacs.d/init.el) and as far as I checked, neither do I have any other .emacs dir in my laptor nor any duplicate init.el
 2 Issued I have 1) init.el is not loaded unless I manually Mx load-file Load file: ~/.emacs.d/init.el 2) When I do load manually, relative line numbers and disabling the welcome screen do not work when all the rest (multi-cursor/auto-complete etc.) work normally
 And again, I&#x27;ve this issue only on my Laptop, when on my PC I get the setup fairly quickly and easily

                              <span>Yesterday I was trying lsp-mode. After getting a bit annoyed with my laptop&#x27;s fan always getting activated, I decided to try eglot. So far it feels much more lightweight.
 I&#x27;m having trouble getting it to do some things though.
 For context, I use pyvenv to manage my virtual environments:
 (use-package pyvenv:ensure t:config(pyvenv-mode 1)(pyvenv-activate &quot;~/miniconda3/envs/myenv/&quot;))
 I have done both conda install python-lsp-server[all] -c conda-forge and conda install pyright in this environment.
 If I use pyright-langserver, then a lot of imports are &quot;unknown&quot;.
 If I use pylsp, then those imports seem to work, but I get some funny autocompletion behaviour. 
 import numpy as np
 np.lin
 This says &quot;no completion found&quot;. But
 from numpy import linalg
 linalg.
 This works as expected, and I get reasonable suggestions for completions.
 ​
 Can someone tell me what&#x27;s going on here and I to get this working? I was hoping things would work right out of the box, but...

 sh mkdir a cd a git init echo a &gt; a &amp;&amp; git add a &amp;&amp; git commit -m a echo b &gt; b &amp;&amp; git add b &amp;&amp; git commit -m b echo c &gt; c &amp;&amp; git add c &amp;&amp; git commit -m c git rm b &amp;&amp; git commit -m x GIT_SEQUENCE_EDITOR&#x3D;&quot;sed -ri &#x27;2s/pick/e/&#x27;&quot; git rebase -i --root git mv b b2 &amp;&amp; EDITOR&#x3D;: git commit --amend git rebase --continue

                              <span>hi everyone, 
 I recently switched to straight.el mostly for packages contributing purposes and it works really great. 
 In my init.el I sometimes use package-installed-p function to check if package is installed but straight.el doesn&#x27;t install packages &quot;emacs way&quot; so that function always return nil. I expect there should be similar function in straight.el but I can&#x27;t find one. 
 Do you know if it&#x27;s exists? 
 Thanks
 EDIT: There is straight--installed-p but it expects a RECIPE and I don&#x27;t really understand what is this. Definitely not a package name

                              <span>I&#x27;ve always ran into this issue for years...
 My usual workflow is that I&#x27;m working on a project (with .projectile in the root directory), and at some point I need to working on files outside of this project.
 I&#x27;ll then C-x 5 2 to create a new frame and start opening files there. Then I switch buffers, and what I see are all my buffers.
 Is there a way in which I could group/filter buffers based on some default criteria? For example, if the buffer belongs to a project (with a .projectile file), filter those buffers into one group. 
 Or better yet, simply add filters so that I can stay organized.

It updates the schedule time and properties, but also adds that last line - State &quot;DONE&quot;... which I don&#x27;t want to have. Is there a way to prevent this?

                              <span>I use doom emacs and it offers [ ], [-] and [X] as part of the org-todo-keywords.
 In the org-agenda I noticed that the state changes for these states are not listed with the corresponding time when org-agenda-log-mode is active.
 Here is an example to display what it looks like instead:
 Tuesday 25 October 2022 inbox: 10:00 ┄┄┄┄┄ State: (DONE) DONE Test1 TODO -&gt; DONE inbox: State: ([X]) [X] Test2 [ ] -&gt; [X] 
 The headline with Test2 is displayed without the time. Both headlines have a LOGBOOK drawer that does look the same.
 * DONE Test1 TODO -&gt; DONE :LOGBOOK: - State &quot;DONE&quot; from &quot;TODO&quot; [2022-10-25 Tue 10:00] :END * [X] Test2 [ ] -&gt; [X] :LOGBOOK: - State &quot;[X]&quot; from &quot;[ ]&quot; [2022-10-25 Tue 10:00] :END 
 Further it seems like all todo keywords that start with [ and end with ] are not displayed with the corresponding time but below the time-grid with State: in front like seen above.
 I believe I tracked down the function that generates the State: entries (https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/9bfe00dda6b59d9b93eb7a825f6e0868afa1cca3/lisp/org/org-agenda.el#L5943) but I am not really able to understand the function and what is causing this behavior as I am fairly new to emacs/elisp
 Is there someway to show the tasks with the checkbox style todo keywords with time?
 Is this a bug or a feature that I can configure?

                              <span>During my internship at Tweag, I got the opportunity to work on Chainsail (see the announcement blog post), a web service that helps to sample from multimodal probability distributions.
A common approach to sampling well-behaved distributions involves Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods derived from the
basic Metropolis-Hastings algorithm; building a Markov chain that has the desired distribution as its stationary distribution.
The major benefit of Metropolis-Hastings over more “direct” sampling methods is that it doesn’t require the target distribution to be normalized.
But it does have a big flaw:
if the distribution presents multiple modes separated by areas of low probability, the Markov chain tends to get stuck in one mode, and thus samples the distribution incorrectly.

 what is the most efficient, built-in way to navigate to e.g. the Name subword?
 using subword mode still makes me press M-f multiple times and also slows down general buffer navigation by treating every capital letter now as a separate word.

                              <span>Hello. I&#x27;ve recently been trying to set up emacs to play nicely with python. The number of options is a bit overwhelming, but a lot of signs are pointing towards using lsp with pyright and lsp-ui. So that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve been doing, along with using pyvenv to choose my virtual environments. But I&#x27;ve noticed that I don&#x27;t get any warnings if my lines are too long. I&#x27;m not sure why this is? Does it have to do with my settings, or is this not something lsp/pyright should catch?

                              <span>A year or two ago, straight.el was probably the most recommended package manager for GNU Emacs. As I’ve revisited my configuration today, I noticed that there are a few recent package managers (namely, leaf and elpaca) which are new to - at least - me and (at least elpaca) want to be straight.el’s “successor”.
 Is there any write-up about the state of GNU Emacs package management in 2022? Straight.el works for me (and I need its custom build features for two packages), but I don’t want to rely on deprecated packages for too long.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been working with Django, using Flycheck and Company-mode for check and autocompletion. Well, Flycheck have been showing errors with objects member in classes, but this is a False positive, even company sugest to me the correct completion but Flycheck mark this like error.
 I have searched in web, and found that Flycheck is using wrong dir, but i don&#x27;t know how customize that. Is there some option to Flycheck work well on Django?
 pylint has an module named pylint-django. Can be this enhabled in Flycheck?
 Edit: I found solution that works to me for now, but isn&#x27;t automatic.
 1) Install pylint-django pluging with pip pip install pylint-django
 2) Create a pylint config file in the root directory of project. You can do thi from terminal
 pylint --generate-rcfile &gt; .pylintrc
 3)Enhable Django pluging in pylint config file in &quot;load-plugins&quot; line
 load-plugins&#x3D;pylint_django
 That worked to me. When you start flychek in current buffer, you can see if flycheck is using the config file:
 M-x flycheck-verify-setup

 📋 https://emacssurvey.org/
 About the Survey
 This time there are no non-free Javascript or user-tracking caveats as this features a bespoke survey framework written from scratch for the Emacs User Survey to support a pure HTML-forms + CSS approach with server-side rendering 🎉.
 See the FAQ for more information on the survey itself.
 Promoting the survey
 It would be fantastic for this to be shared as far and wide as possible, to get responses from a large swathe of the community. If you can share this with the non-Reddit Emacs communities you are a part of, as well as any friends or colleagues that use Emacs that would be greatly appreciated 😊.
 So far the Survey has been shared on: - Reddit - Hacker News - Lobste.rs
 Addendum: all my responses are shown as missing?
 It has been noticed by several people that their results page shows some or all of their answers to be missing for questions they answered. In every case I&#x27;ve checked so far, all responses did get recorded in the database, but there seems to be a glitch that is occurring in some cases with the display/export of results.
 TLDR; Do not worry, your answers are safe.

                              <span>Since its initial release (corresponding thread) the library has got several improvements (the current version is 2.2.0.0), but the most significant development happened within the ecosystem. Here&#x27;s the list of new adapter libraries:
  
crypto-rng-effectful - generation of cryptographically secure random bytes and numbers.
 
log-effectful - structured logging with multiple backends.
 
hpqtypes-effectful - access to a PostgreSQL database.
 
retry-effectful - combinators for monadic actions that may fail.
 
 It&#x27;s worth noting that all of these are light wrappers over existing libraries, not rewrites. As advertised, effectful makes it easy to adapt libraries to be used as effects.
 Also, the Monocle project has moved to effectful.
 If anyone was skeptical about effectful, maybe that&#x27;ll convince you to give it another look. I&#x27;m sure this is just the beginning :)

                              <span>According to this: https://redmonk.com/sogrady/2022/10/20/language-rankings-6-22/
 ​
 What is surprising is that it is:
 - more adopted than Clojure that I thought to be the most popular functional language (even though I think it&#x27;s really bad).
 - much more adopted than Erlang and F#, I thought Haskell is used less frequently than these.
 - has almost as many projects as Elixir in GitHub, but much more popular on Stack Overflow - shows the strength of the community.
 - as widely adopted as Perl.
 ​
 Looking at this chart I think we can get Haskell into the top 10 (or even 5) languages by solving several problems, as community (I do have a vested interest that it happens – our SimpleX Chat is written in Haskell):
 - make JSON a first class citizen in Haskell code, ideally with some syntax-level support, without requiring QQ, rather than one of the most complex to use libraries. It doesn&#x27;t seem a coincidence that 2 most popular languages - JavaScript and Python - make it really easy to integrate with JSON.
 - make cross-platform compilation &quot;manageable&quot; (including mobile and web), not just &quot;possible&quot;.
 - solve problem of compiled binary size - it should be at least 5x, better 10x smaller – even if it comes at cost of 10x longer compilation time (so that we would only use it for production builds).
 - at the same time, make interpreted tests execution simpler - I still can&#x27;t figure out how to do it, waiting for several minutes until it builds with most cores idling is very time consuming... Maybe this is a solved problem, and there is a simple answer how to do it.
 - make networking and cryptography more trustworthy - with exodus of some maintainers into Rust-land they are at risk of abandonment – I will share more comments on this subject a bit later.
 ​
 These are all issues that Haskell Foundation and community can help solving, we could chip in some time/money too if there is some concerted effort.

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking for suggestions for how to manage repeated tasks with subtasks. Ideally, I&#x27;d like to be able to mark the parent heading as done and have all the DONE subtasks (or even better, those without a certain property) be changed to TODO. In practice, what I want is to be able to move from this: 
 * TODO Meal plan for the week SCHEDULED:  ** DONE Make list of dishes ** DONE Make grocery list ** DONE Get groceries 
 to this: 
 * TODO Meal plan for the week SCHEDULED:  ** TODO Make list of dishes ** TODO Make grocery list ** TODO Get groceries 
 after marking the heading task as done. 
 I suspect I could make use of org-todo-repeat-hook and define a function that will take all the sub-tasks of a given task and change them from e.g. DONE to TODO, or to the TODO state the parent will be in after repeat, e.g. 
 (defun my/org--bequeath-state () (let ((state (org-get-todo-state))) (org-map-entries (lambda () (org-todo state)) nil &#x27;tree))) (add-to-list &#x27;org-todo-repeat-hook &#x27;my/org--bequeath-state) 
 But I&#x27;m wondering if anyone has given this more thought and has a better conceived solution they&#x27;d be willing to share.

                              <span>I would like some advice for a university project that requires writing an application that makes queries on a large dataset.
 I am using Spark+Scala.
 1) materials where can i find similar solutions? where can i find some tutorials for aggregate queries in Spark? or just some examples of aggregate queries on simple datasets?
 2) Spark advices any general advice? any advice on how to best use dataframes with Spark in this project? are there general things to be careful of in order not to have bad performances?
 how would it be better to return the results of a query considering that I will have to create a graphical interface?
 3) query tips I use a flight dataset. What might be some interesting aggregate queries to do? I have a lot of columns, so a lot of information about each flight
 I know that is a lot of questions, but answers for just one question will also be helpful.

                              <span>Hi, i’m an F# senior developer with 3 years of experience in f# and 4 in c#. Because of the broader job market, and me falling in love with Scala (because e.g. HKT), i’m considering to make a career switch. 
 Has anyone went through this? How hard is it to apply for a senior position with no commercial experience in Scala?

                              <span>Hello all, 
 I am currently using Org mode to try and write a JET SOP/ write fantasy books or whatever. However, When trying to navigate through the text instead of going through each line, it jumps through each paragraph in chunks. 
 I know that this is due to &quot;word wrap&quot; and that technically it is all one giant line. But how does one change this behavior. I know a few days ago when I tested Visual Studio code I got the same issue. 
 (ignore my bad writing, this is super duper early) 
 TL:DR: how to change function of emacs to make it act more like a traditional word processor?

                              <span>Before I was defaulting to always using &#x60;switch-to-buffer&#x60; and selecting things manually and thought it was just fine to do that.
 Then I started using &#x60;next-buffer&#x60; and &#x60;previous-buffer&#x60; and developing an intuition for what buffer would show up.
 It&#x27;s made my experience of using emacs drastically better in the same way that learning &#x60;ctrl+tab&#x60; and &#x60;ctrl+shift+tab&#x60; in web browsers made my browsing experience better. Maybe these kinds of feelings are very subjective, but I feel like this one might generalize to others experiences well.
 By default they are bound to &#x60;C-x &#x60; and &#x60;C-x &#x60;.
 Feel free to also share any similar other &quot;wow this makes buffer management so much nicer feeling to use&quot; experiences you&#x27;ve had.

 The :file link created by org-attach when org-attach-store-link-p is non-nil should be to the attachment, not to the original. In fact the link is to the original, not to the attachment. I believe this is a bug.
 DETAILS
 I&#x27;ve noticed some unexpected behavior in terms of the link that org-attach creates and places in org-stored-links when org-attach-store-link-p is non-nil. I&#x27;m seeing it when the method of attachment is move, copy, or symlink, either via org-attach-method, or when chosen directly when running C-c C-a. (I haven&#x27;t tested any of the others.) The issue concerns the target of the created link.
 My expectation is that the target of such a link should point to the actual attachment itself. By that I mean, the target should be the path to the file or link in its place in th…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been tinkering with making simple interfaces with transient and tabulated-list-mode, things like a list of scripts with some information on them as columns, and key bindings/transients to edit, lint or execute them. While this is nice, for something more elaborate tabulated-list-mode is not enough. I am trying to get a view inspired by magit&#x27;s status buffer, so I thought I could use magit-section for this. However, I couldn&#x27;t find any guides on how to make something with it, and I am not savy enough to extract the exact usage from the magit code (I did try).
 So my question is, does anyone have any guides or any simple elisp code that I can use for reference to create a new derived mode out of magit-section?
 Edit: Fixed formatting.

 When I try to export an org file to pdf it always gives the error: Stopping because of bad filename. 
 Latexmk: Filename &#x27;~/notes/exports/20220825222250-beamer_presentation_example.tex&#x27; contains character not allowed for TeX file. Latexmk: Stopping because of bad filename(s). 
 I believe it is because the home directory is specified with a tilde character. 
 How can I fix this error?

 Is there some setting I&#x27;m missing?

                              <span>First, let me say, I accept that this isn&#x27;t strictly speaking an Emacs question, but a quick search on Reddit suggests that there isn&#x27;t a better place to ask. And I am using it with Emacs so I&#x27;m hoping you&#x27;ll take a generous view.
 I download mail with mbsync, manage it with mu4e, and send it with SMTP. This all works fine and has for years.
 Except that I find that I suddenly have to deal with email hosted on office365. It does IMAP, so I can read my mail, but it warns
 &#x60;Notice: far side store does not support flag(s) &#x27;P&#x27;; not propagating.&#x60;
 The consequence of this is that the changes I make locally aren&#x27;t reflected on the server. Refiling or deleting mail doesn&#x27;t have any effect. That means my INBOX is just going to grow and grow and grow and eventually that&#x27;s going to be a problem. (Nevermind that if I decide to peek at my mail from my phone or something, it&#x27;s going to be a confusing mess.)
 In a previous life, I managed with davmail, but dear $DEITY in heaven, I&#x27;d really rather not have to do that again.
 Anyone know if mbsync (or the office365 account) can be configured to make things Work Right(TM)?

 I personally enjoy configuring things and feeling like I&#x27;m building new skills, so the startup costs I sometimes run into when creating a new development environment often don&#x27;t phase me -- I will usually spend the extra time to tinker with my dot files and learn a bit of Elisp in order to save time down the line. 
 From the start, the appeal to me has been finding ways to use my mouse less and edit code faster. I love the feeling of using my keyboard to navigate within and between files, and I think that removing the mental context switch…</span>

                              <span>Hey,
 I&#x27;ve recently moved my calendar need to org-mode with org-caldav after using Emacs for years for programming, writing and chatting.
 Now I wonder how/if I should do the same for Email..
 My current setup involves Kontact for IMAP and EWS.
 All the setups I&#x27;ve seen so far do download/sync all Emails from the IMAP server. Is it possible only download the headers and then the full emails on demand? My current setup is that I keep my Emails on the IMAP server and fetch only what I want to read.
 Akonadi does this quite good.

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m very new to org-mode although it already looks like something that I&#x27;ve been trying to invent myself (in much more lame ways) for many years.
 One thing that I don&#x27;t immediately see from them the manual - is there some &quot;standard&quot; or well-know way to work with the outline-organized data that have multiple dimensions?
 Here is what I mean by that:
 Say, I have a lab diary where I track number of processes - each process every day:
 * Day 1 ** Morning sync up meeting with the team my notes on it ** Ongoing Experiment 1 checking out the night results, trying new approaches ** Something else ... * Day 2 ** Morning sync up meeting with the team ... ** Ongoing Experiment 1 ... ** Something else ... * Day 3 ... 
 And this is how it goes!
 So, the first dimension here is the timeline: Day 1, Day 2, ... while the second one is the processes that repeat every day.
 Clearly, depending on task, it would be handy to see this outline from the different points of view: sometimes considering the &quot;time&quot; dimension to be the outer one, sometimes to see the &quot;process&quot; dimension to be the outer:
 Time dimension is outer:
 * Day 1 ** Process 1 ** Process 2 ... * Day 2 ... 
 Process dimension is outer:
 * Process 1 ** Day 1 ** Day 2 ... * Process 2 ... 
 One can easily come up with a case of three or for dimensions like. E.g. &quot;Date/[Home|Work]/Habit/Successes&quot;.
 Turning the tree inside out to follow the day by day progress for one of experiments would be very helpful. As well as tracking the daily successes in the second example.
 Is there a built-in feature or packages or a known workflow for such case?
 Like best practice(s) for such data organization, turning the outline inside out, making different OLAP-like views into the outline?
 thanks :)

 Is there a setting I need to turn on? Or is it simply the case that amm doesn&#x27;t support indentation based syntax?

                              <span>I want to stream values from more than 1 conduit at once, without restrictions such as &quot;the values of the conduits must have the same type&quot; or &quot;the values must be requested in a predictable order&quot;. For example, something like:
 example &#x3D; do foo  lift $ putStrLn &quot;it&#x27;s over&quot; Just True -&gt; awaitInt &gt;&gt;&#x3D; \x -&gt; (yield $ x + 4) &gt;&gt; example Just False -&gt; awaitString &gt;&gt;&#x3D; \x -&gt; (lift $ putStrLn x) &gt;&gt; (yield $ length x) &gt;&gt; example 
 How would I go about doing something like this? Can I convert a &quot;source&quot; conduit to an imperative-style generator within its respective monad? Is there some library which provides multi-input-stream conduits?

 Do I have any alternatives in the approach to doing this? I&#x27;m still new to haskell so it&#x27;s all a lot to take in.

                              <span>I&#x27;m creating a game where several &quot;walkers&quot; (and other objects) are positioned on a board. &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; data Dir &#x3D; N | E | S | W deriving (Eq, Ord, Show, Enum, Bounded)
 data Pos &#x3D; Pos { x :: Int, y :: Int} deriving (Eq, Ord, Show)
 data Object &#x3D; Object { pos :: Pos, dir :: Dir} deriving (Eq, Ord)
 -- An Walker is an object with a position and a direction. newtype Walker &#x3D; Walker Object newtype Exit &#x3D; Exit Object newtype Entry &#x3D; Entry Object &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 In order to move them, I have a function that takes a list of walkers all located on the same tile. Several walkers can be on the same tile, in which case they collide.
  -- this function takes a list of walkers with the same position. move :: [Walker] -&gt; [Walker] move ws &#x3D; ... 
 I&#x27;m not so satisfied with this solution, because the pre-condition (all located at the same position) is not reflected. I&#x27;m thinking of several solutions to express/enforce the condition: 1. Use a guard 2. Decompose the first argument 3. Use refined types
 Use a guard
 I could use a guard to enforce my pre-condition:  move :: [Walker] -&gt; [Walker] move ws | isSamePos ws &#x3D; ... move _ &#x3D; error &quot;All walkers must have the same position&quot; 
 It&#x27;s an OK solution, however it&#x27;s a pity that the types don&#x27;t help us and look clumsy.
 Decompose the first argument
 I could decompose the first argument to express the fact that they all have the same position:  move :: Pos -&gt; [Dir] -&gt; [Walker] move pos dirs &#x3D; ... 
 It&#x27;s an interesting solution because now illegal states are unrepresentable. However, I lost the idea that my inputs are walkers and not anything else.
 Use refined types
 I couldn&#x27;t install Liquid Haskell, but I guess the solution would look like:  {-@ move :: SamePosList Walker -&gt; [Walker] @-} move :: [Walker] -&gt; [Walker] move ws &#x3D; ... 
 It seems overkill :)
 What is your opinion? Thanks!

                              <span>I&#x27;m creating a sort of game where several &quot;walkers&quot; are positioned on a board. &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; data Dir &#x3D; N | E | S | W deriving (Eq, Ord, Show, Enum, Bounded)
 data Pos &#x3D; Pos { x :: Int, y :: Int} deriving (Eq, Ord, Show)
 data Object &#x3D; Object { pos :: Pos, dir :: Dir} deriving (Eq, Ord)
 -- An Walker is an object with a position and a direction. type Walker &#x3D; Object type Exit &#x3D; Object type Entry &#x3D; Object &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Several walkers can be located on the same tile, in which case they collide. To manage this, I have a function that will move them. This function takes a list of walkers all located at the same position, and calculate their next position:  -- this function takes a list of walkers that are at the same position. move :: [Walker] -&gt; [Walker] move ws &#x3D; ... 
 I&#x27;m not very satisfied with this function, because the pre-condition (walkers must be at the same position) is not encoded in the type. I&#x27;m thinking of several solutions: 1. Encode the precondition as a guard 2. Decompose the argument 3. Enforce property with refined types
 Encode the precondition as a guard
  move :: [Walker] -&gt; [Walker] move ws | isSamePos ws &#x3D; ... move _ &#x3D; error &quot;All walkers must be at the same position&quot;.  It&#x27;s an OK solution, however it&#x27;s a pity that the type doesn&#x27;t help you.
 Decompose the argument
 I could decompose the list of walkers, removing the redundant part (they all have the same position):  move :: Pos -&gt; [Dir] -&gt; [Walker] move pos dirs &#x3D; ...  That solution is interesting, because illegal states are now unrepresentable. However, I lost the idea that the input is a walker.
 Enforce property with refined types
 I could use Liquid Haskell to check the precondition using a SAT solver. I&#x27;m not quite sure how to write it, it seems a bit overkill.
 What is your opinion? Thanks!

 Is there a way to configure F5 to run a terminal and use GHCi to run my program?

 On MacOS, I use Hammerspoon, and I assigned a shortcut to it&#x27;s console and then promptly forgot it. Would love to hit M-x Hammerspoon-console anywhere and have it brought up. 
 Wondering if there&#x27;s anything like that already available?
 There&#x27;s built-in spotlight, and alfredapp but I would prefer to leverage emacs further.

 How i should customize the variabe?

                              <span>hi all,
 a package that i am using defines an a-list of various font properties f.e. &#x27;family&#x27;, &#x27;weight&#x27;, &#x27;height&#x27; etc. etc.
 i want to set values to these properties progammatically, f.e. on linux + my-home-machine i would want to set &#x27;family&#x27; to say &quot;Iosevka Mono&quot;, on my laptop i would use a high-dpi friendly font etc.
 i wrote a trivial function like so:
  (defun util:get-host-default-font-family () &quot;return host specific font-family&quot; (interactive) (cond ((utils:host-name-is &quot;host-01&quot;) Iosevka Mono&quot;) ((utils:host-name-is &quot;host-02&quot;) &quot;Go Mono Regular&quot;) ((t &quot;Consolas&quot;)))) 
 the &quot;utils:host-name-is &quot; returns &#x27;true&#x27; when current hostname matches the provided argument, &#x27;false&#x27; otherwise. the above function does the right thing when called interactively on different hosts. 
 however, when i use it like so
  (:default-family (util:get-host-default-font-family)) 
 i get a
  Wrong type argument: stringp, (util:get-host-default-font-family) 
 how do i fix it ?
 
 thanks !

                              <span>I just found out that I can emacs as my IRC client with ERC which is great. However, there are a couple of issues that I am wondering if Emacs supports: the first is that the message prompt is terminal style, which means that it keeps moving as I receive messages. Is there a way to replicate the interface of other IRC clients where there is a separate frame for inputing messages?
 The second issue is that it seems that receiving files from an XDCC server does not work. Is there some special configuration for it to work?

                              <span>In my config https://github.com/vidbina/dotfiles/tree/reorg-for-lit-prog/emacs#-text you may spot that I use visual-fill-column-mode and adaptive-wrap-mode to improve the readability of text in Emacs.
 ⚠️ The gotcha is that I sometimes have bits of context that I want to exclude from being &quot;wrapped&quot; such as tables. My current UX on this is poor as I usually want to see the table fully extended while simultaneously sneaking a peak at text in the paragraphs around it. Is there a way to do this (exclude a region from being wrapped) or is there a term that describes what I&#x27;m looking for that I should factor into my web-search queries?
 🤔 There is never really a use case where the wrapped table is even readable for me so it&#x27;s just a lost piece of screen real estate when I wrap the buffer. It may as well be folded away to be conjured up through something similar to C-c C-v v where can open expanded code into a preview buffer (to see how all the noweb refs resolve). How do you deal with wrapping when tables are present? Hoping to learn what I can improve about my usage to minimize this &quot;pain&quot;.
 💡 For now I keep toggling between the wrapped and non-wrapped states and now that I&#x27;m typing this, I&#x27;m thinking that I can open a cloned frame or buffer. That way I can show the table non-wrapped or extended in one buffer, while I look at the wrapped peripheral text in a cloned buffer and thus have a way to keep the wrapped states apart. This however does alter the layout of buffers which is again a bit of a UX killer as it disturbs the y-flow of the text in the original buffer if you catch my drift.
 Looking fwd to getting schooled. Thanks for helping think along. 🙏🏿

                              <span>Hi all,
 Relatively new to emacs. I&#x27;m looking to use emacs speaks statistics and take advantage of using polymode and quarto mode (https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-emacs) which best I can tell is a version of polymode that allows using quarto based documents.
 So far I can build the quarto document and output a html window, but if I try to run individual chunks or pieces of code it doesn&#x27;t work. The github page states it uses ESS by default but when I try to use the ESS run commands I get Wrong type argument: window-live-p, nil. I&#x27;ve googled this error message but haven&#x27;t seen anything similar so far.
 I&#x27;ve also tried having polymode itself enabled with quarto mode and on its own, and using the polymode run chunks command but I get a similar error message.
 Anyone have any ideas or potential solutions?
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I&#x27;ve recently replaced my old FHD monitors with QHD and UHD (4k) ones. I can change DPI to increase font sizes of Emacs and other applications, but cannot change the size of the mouse cursor for EXWM.
 I first tried to change the cursor size by following https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/612138/502857 . However, the new mouse cursor size is only applied when the cursor is not over an Emacs buffer.
 A mouse cursor over an Emacs buffer.
 A mouse cursor over Google-chrome
 There is an Emacs option for the color of the mouse cursor, but the option for the size doesn&#x27;t exist in Emacs 27.2 .
 Is it possible to change the size of the cursor for EXWM?

                              <span>I&#x27;m running multiple versions of Doom side by side and it seems that when a session fails to start properly clearing out ~/.emacs.d/eln-cache/28-xxxxx makes the problem go away.
 I can only guess that the Doom sessions orChemacs2 sessions read some compiled scripts in that directory which are not compatible with them. From the Doom docs, there is an EMACSDIR environment variable that is supposed to be the ~/.emacs.d directory for that Doom session.
 After reading the docs I have decided to run doom install with --doomdir, --emacsdir, and I am also configuring the Chemacs2 ~/.emacs-profiles.el to set the relevant environment variables as described in https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/xs0avw/a_way_to_manage_multiple_doom_profiles_with/, which now includes more variables.
 Moving forward I am also adding the EMACSDIR option.
 Should these options reduce the risk of a shared ~/.emacs.d/eln-cache/28-xxxxx?

 One type of operation I&#x27;m finding hard time to replicate is the custom operator-pending mappings. In lisp like files, I use operators from vim-sexp a lot. 
 e.g. similarly to caw (change a word), the plugin adds daf (delete a form), cae (change an element), etc. 
 How can I replicate them? I&#x27;m having a hard time to find related docs, it seems that &quot;operator&quot; has other meanings in emacs.

Also, is this &quot;package&quot; related to the commonly used practice, when using use-package, of writing something like

 to keep things organized?

                              <span>Hey! I’m experimenting with some pretty non-standard layouts’ configurations (using a lot of xkb features like custom types and actions) to work around some wrists problems, multiple languages/layouts I need to work with also attempting to get to a setup that doesnt break the flow (e.g. standard layouts for english and ukrainian have weirdly different placements of non-alphanumerics which doesnt help at all to internilize the physical typing habbits, etc.)
 So far its starting to look pretty well but I have the major problem with getting my multiple layouts work in Emacs.
 Given that at different times a same key on my keyboard could generate a different symbol from six different alphabets, I’m trying to understand how to get emacs bindings to work invariantly to this (well ordered) chaos.
 An idea that came to my mind was this: if emacs did have a central function that performs a key lookup - it could’ve been probably advised - in case of a failed search - to change all the latin letters in the failed to be found sequence to the ones from the other alphabet I use and rerun the search. And do it for every of the languages of interest until it either works out or finally fails.
 I wasn’t able though to confirm from the elisp reference that this is possible)
 Sorry for the probable naivety of this question - I’m really not that familiar yet with Emacs internals and not speaking from arrogance here - just trying to describe my thought process trying to both explain what I need and not to overload the reader with complexities of my setup.
 Probably there is some true and very different way to solve tgis question that I’m not aware of.
 Thank you :)

                              <span>Hi everyone, I am no developer, only a Linux freaks for nearly 20 years. And a drummer. I need to work my rudiments. You know, these combinations of patterns on the bass drums, the snare and the Charley. I have already written a few charts in lilypond / Frescobaldi.
 And I am figuring out that it would be cool to develop an app for emacs that uses lilypond and the various combinations bd/snare/charley patterns to shows exercices to be worked out.
 The question is: is it affordable for someone like me, to start on such a project? I&#x27;d like to learn, but I need something motivating... And this would be it.
 Is Lisp a good idea for such a project? Or would Python be a better choice?
 If you have a few crumbs to lead me in the right direction, so that at least I start on the right path.. that&#x27;d be cool

                              <span>Hello everyone.
 I use doom emacs to edit math notes, full of latex fragments, in org mode.
 I really need to have a quick way to toggle the renderization of all fragments in a document, as if I was going to each one of them with the cursor and doing M-x org-latex-preview, which of course I have keymapped to an easier binding (SPC l p).
 I saw on the web that a way to do this would be prepending C-u to org-latex-preview (in my case C-u SPC l p). But C-u is bound to evil-scroll-up, thus preventing me to do any other combination starting with that C-u. 
 So I&#x27;ve been trying to disable the binding of C-u from evil-scroll-up. 
 Note: in the afterthought, that is not really what I should have been doing, because instead it would be way better to use something like SPC l l p. 
 Anyway, I tried p…</span>

 I recently moved from helm-swoop to helm-occur. In helm-swoop, search results are shown in the same color that the major mode shows with syntax coloring. However, helm-occur shows search results as a single color. I checked the customize-group for both helm and helm-occur but could not find a variable for this. 
 Is there a way to make syntax coloring enabled in the helm-occur buffer?
 Thanks.

 I currently still have different directories, and have defined the keys 1-7 in dired-mode-map to open them. But of course it would be nice to just enter the first letters of the file name in Helm Mini in the case that I know the file name, which currently only works for recent files and for files in my Org directory.

 For my terminal (alacritty), the font is in size: 13 #Point Size
 For emacs, I have tried these two: but they just seem smaller than the 13 point size font set for my terminal. I had to set emacs&#x27; font :height to 140 or use &quot;Liberation Mono-14&quot; for the font size to more similar :(
 (set-face-attribute &#x27;default nil :font &quot;Liberation Mono&quot; :height 130)
 (set-face-attribute &#x27;default nil :font &quot;Liberation Mono-13&quot;)
 Any tips guys?

                              <span>Hi folks,
 This is probably quite a simple question and more to do with Emacs Lisp syntax than anything else. I&#x27;m trying to set Org&#x27;s org-tag-alist variable so that a directory containing all my projects can easily have the type of project categorised according to some default tags. Unfortunately, the .dir-locals.el file uses different syntax (dot notation?) to what I&#x27;m already barely used to with regular Emacs Lisp, so I&#x27;m struggling to make it work. In particular, I&#x27;m trying to get some group tags in that variable, but I&#x27;m utterly clueless because I just haven&#x27;t had the time to learn Emacs Lisp yet.
 Could anyone supply a minimum working example of a .dir-locals.el snippet that adds group tags to Org mode? Many, many thanks in advance!

                              <span>Hi, 
 Over the years I have discovered that the sub is divided fairly evenly over eglot and lsp-mode. I was wondering, what makes users prefer one over the other? 
 I am evaluating moving over from lsp-mode, now that eglot is shipped with emacs and it supports emacs-native features where possible. I mainly use python, julia, and web-devvy things like typescript, tsx, css, and html.
 Thanks!

                              <span>I recently released Tecton, a new DSL for authoring CSS. My goal for this project is to make &quot;CSS in PureScript&quot; more practical for real-world use cases, meaning: * Extensive type-level validation * Minimal syntactic overhead * Broad CSS coverage * Alignment with W3C specifications * Exhaustive testing
 If you&#x27;re interested to take a look, a good place to start might be the Zen Garments example, adapted from Dan Mall&#x27;s CSS Zen Garden submission in order to assess the library&#x27;s CSS coverage.
 From there, you might like to see some examples of CSS errors that will fail to compile. Some of these issues are significantly more complicated than e.g. providing a  value where a  was expected (although those cases are covered too).
 Hopefully the next step would be to try it out for yourself, using the large test suite as a reference wherever the (WIP) docs currently fall short.
 I am looking forward to any feedback you might have to offer! I would also like to note that contributions are welcome, so please let me know if you are interested via Twitter or [email](mailto:nick@saunde.rs); or, if you have something specific in mind already, just review the contributing guidelines and then open an issue.
 Thanks for reading!

                              <span>Currently, I would like to learn fs2 thoroughly (how it works, and build some different size of applications with it).
 Before I jump right into learning fs2, I would like to understand its bigger picture. However, I haven&#x27;t been able to find any useful information about what are the possible use cases of fs2, for what we can use this awesome library, and so on.
 To my understanding, fs2 is used when we don&#x27;t know the size of the incoming data.
 I am looking for answers to these questions:
  
How does a REST-based microservice look like when it heavily relies on fs2?
 Can you suggest good learning resources for fs2? (for example: github projects...)
 What are the possible use-cases for fs2?
 Can we increase throughput by using fs2 instead of using only cats-effect? (for example in a REST-based microservice?)

to give you a heads-up:
Translating &quot;Kommunikation mit Zettelkästen&quot;
I am working on a special translation of the Original article by Luhmann. The problem of translation can be partly understood by these two quotes from the disclaimer I am writing:

  
French is a fine park, Italien a big, bright, colorful wood. But German is almost a primeval forest, so dense and mysterious, so without a passage and yet with thousand paths. You can&#x27;t get lost in a park, and not so easily and dangerously in the bright Italian wood; but in the German jungle, within four, five minutes, you can go missing. Because the path seems so difficult, many try to march through as straight as possible which violates the nature of this language. It surely wants a main direction but invites to deviate from t…</span>

                              <span>Hi folks,
 I&#x27;ve just started using Org and I am fascinated by it and the possibilities it offers over every other system I&#x27;ve ever tried. I&#x27;ve started tinkering with custom agenda views, and I&#x27;ve got this fairly basic custom view happening with the following code:
  (setq org-agenda-files &#x27;(&quot;~/Documents/projects&quot;)) (setq org-agenda-custom-commands &#x27;((&quot;p&quot; &quot;Programming todos&quot; ((tags &quot;programming&quot;))))) 
 Now, I have a number of projects in that projects directory whose top-level headline is marked with the WAIT TODO keyword, but whose children are marked with regular TODO. My logic here is that I want to mark an entire project as waiting or blocked without having to mark every subtree or subtask as waiting, too.
 The problem is, when I use my custom agenda view, the project headline appears (albeit greyed-out), and all its children appear. Is there a way to exclude an entire tree from appearing in a custom agenda view if its headline or one of its parents is marked with a certain keyword, in this case, WAIT?
 Thanks in advance for any help!

 e.g. when I use WinHugs and notepad, I can write code in notepad and then run the code in WinHugs and test functions.

                              <span>So I usually use atom for most programming and was trying to find haskell packages but found none and then went to sublime and was finally able to find some syntax highlighting. Which IDEs are the most popular IDEs for haskell in industry just like c/c++ has Visual Studio, intellij for IDEA and vs code for javascript ?

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to use the cabal mixins feature to automatically replace every implicit prelude import with a custom prelude (in this case relude). apparently it doesn&#x27;t play well with &#x60;stack repl&#x60; https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/5077 but I don&#x27;t really use it anyway.
 Problem is the example projects there all use stack to import pure cabal projects, the latter of which do have mixins, but are not stack-ified themselves. In my case, I want to be able to add something to package.yaml or stack.yaml like:
 -- package.yaml (or stack.yaml) cabal-fields: mixins: base hiding (Prelude) - relude (Relude as Prelude) - relude 
 or something like that, just so that the .cabal file stack generates has this option enabled. I haven&#x27;t been able to figure out how to do this. Some help?

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently studying Secrets of the Glasgow Haskell Compiler Inliner by Jones &amp; Marlow (2002), and am trying to understand the &quot;subtlety&quot; they mention about the rapier algorithm.
 On the bottom left corner of page 7, they mention:
  
There is one other important subtlety in this algorithm: in the case where x is not in theta we must delete x from the substitution, denoted phi \ x. How could x be in the domain of the substitution, but not be in scope?
  
However, the authors do not elaborate much further due to space constraints.
 I&#x27;m trying to understand what they meant by this comment. Although I can fabricate inputs that produce the scenario they describe, I&#x27;m not sure what concrete example would lead to that input, nor why it&#x27;s important to handle it the way they do.
 Also, the paper only shows two cases of their substitution algorithm that handles lambdas. Do we fall through to the second case if we fail the guard of the first case (i.e., when we match on a lambda introduces a variable already in-scope)? That is, am I correct in reading that as pseudo-Haskell?

                              <span>Hey everyone! I recently started using Emacs+ESS for writing R code, and I am really liking it so far, Emacs is impressively extensible &amp; flexible. There is however one thing I am missing: keybindings to insert some special snippets/characters I use really frequently. Specifically, I want to bind Control-Shift-m to insert the R pipe operator „%&gt;%“, and Alt-i to insert the assignment arrow „&lt;-“, like in RStudio, as not having these bindings sort of disrupts my workflow. What would be the best way to do this in Lisp?

                              <span>I&#x27;m honestly not sure if this is an issue with emacs or screen, but I&#x27;ll try here. Middle of the day today, emacs started acting weird for me: The status line (the one with the mode and file/buffer name) started being underlined instead of reverse, and when I scroll down whatever buffer I&#x27;m editing, ALL of the text gets underlined. This makes it very hard and annoying to edit.
 I&#x27;m on a mac, and this only happens when I run emacs under screen. But I depend on screen, and do everything in a screen session, ingrained habit of decades that would be very hard to change.
 I&#x27;ve been using emacs in plain text shell sessions running under screen on macs for many many years, and I&#x27;ve never seen this before. It started in the middle of the day, in a screen instance I&#x27;ve had running on this mac since…</span>

                              <span>I use TRAMP to connect to GitHub Codespaces via my Codespaces package. However, I noted recently that my TRAMP sessions were suffering tremendous and unignorable lag when navigating within a file. I went through my enabled modes one-by-one and was surprised to learn that vc-mode was, in this case, the culprit. Setting vc-handled-backends like so:
 (setq vc-handled-backends &#x27;(Git)) 
 had a profound effect on latency. I&#x27;m not sure why this is the case, but its original value holds a bunch of entries for VCSs that died decades ago (CVS, SCCS, RCS…): it&#x27;s possible that one of my packages was using all of vc-mode&#x27;s backends.
 My TRAMP sessions to Codespaces are now as responsive and fast as if I were to connect to them via VS Code. Hope this helps someone!

                              <span>Hey Emacs friends! 
 I&#x27;m putting together a little package to preview markdown files similarly to how they are rendered on GitHub. Previously I&#x27;ve used grip (and grip-mode), which are awesome, but I wanted a little more room for customization and to avoid hitting the GitHub API on every change.
 This package does the rendering locally if your Emacs has xwidget support. I&#x27;d really appreciate any feedback anyone has!

                              <span>So I&#x27;ve been using org-mode and org-roam for a bit. I&#x27;m finding that my notes are kind of getting into a mess but that&#x27;s mostly because of my insane life contexts I guess.
 Here is kind of where I&#x27;m at in life, for context:
  
Work (routine stuff, development projects underway, ideas, I have a bit of a management role but it&#x27;s really spread out over a bunch of contexts in and of itself (different functional areas I manage)
 Business 1
 Business 2
 Personal Life
 Personal development projects
 Education goals
 Investment goals/research
  
I like keeping notes and todos together, but I think separate contexts is a good idea so if I&#x27;m in work mode I&#x27;m not seeing all the stuff I need to do in my business. Something I&#x27;m kind of wanting to is a way to mark something as delegated to X person. I don&#x27;t need them to see that I delegated it, just to remind myself that I told them to do something and to follow up.
 ​
 I started out with a regular org file for each context, then ended up creating new org files for each &quot;thing&quot;, which created my mess. Today I decided to try creating dailies in org-roam to see how that works out.
 ​
 Any suggestions for how to keep life organized in org or org-roam when you&#x27;ve got so much going on. From experience, no todo list/notes manager has ever really worked that well for this for me.... a few were okay (todoist on the todo list side and evernote on the notes side.... but they both had their own issues)
 ​
 I like org and org-roam I&#x27;m just struggling with how best to setup a structure that fits such a lifestyle.
 Any thoughts or input is very welcome...

                              <span>A thought occurred to me today while I was getting ready, mentally preparing. I realized that I was feeling a bit stressed about the day but that the thought of my todo and agenda buffers had a calming effect. I thought to myself, &quot;it&#x27;s alright, you&#x27;re organized and at least if there is chaos it is somewhat documented chaos and you don&#x27;t have to hold it all in your mind.&quot;
 Last weekend, I took the time to do a much needed cleanup of my init.el file. I got rid of all the cruft of comments, things I&#x27;d tried but given up though not yet deleted. I made a move to using straight.el as my package manager. I switched from Ivy to Helm. I just did some things I&#x27;d been meaning to do for a while. I cleaned up my todo file and recommitted to using &#x27;C-c a a&#x27; more throughout the day.
 I assume that many of you, like me, find a certain &quot;gee, that&#x27;s neat&quot; quality to getting some of this working. A sense of satisfaction maybe. I like learning new ways to do things, maybe cleaner, tighter. But the thing that I keep coming back to even more than all that is that this technology, this nerdy system, has a way of calming me and making me feel better. It feels like the world has more and more information each day, more chaos, etc. Using org-mode helps me live in the world.
 I was curious to see if any of you have had similar thoughts about it?

has to deal with more than one technology or language within the same

maybe not all at once. In the first post of this series, I’d like to focus only

                              <span>I am really new to Haskell and I came across this discussion about how closures in Haskell can be used to mimic objects in traditional OOP. 
 Needless to say, I did not understand much of the discussion. What is really confusing to me is that, if A is an instance of an object (in the traditional sense) then I can change and update some property A.property of A. This doesn&#x27;t create a new instance of A, it updates the value. Exactly, how is this particular updating achieved via closures in Haskell? 
 I understand that mutability can have bad side effects and all. But if a property of an instance of an object, call it A.property for example, were to be updated many times throughout a program how can we possibly keep track of that in Haskell?
 I would really appreciate ELI5 answer if possible. Thank you for your time!!!

                              <span>I drank the Kool-aid and I love it. I can&#x27;t quite articulate what it is that I love about this language but since I learned how to use it... I use it for everything. I occasionally would like a CLI tool that doesn&#x27;t exist on apt, and so I build it myself. I used to use C for this, and now it&#x27;s Haskell! The other day I was thinking of spinning up a chess clone because I wanted to build an AI that could beat me at chess (without looking up how chess engines work, just as a puzzle) and I thought, why not Haskell?
 Something about programming in Haskell makes me feel like a god genius programmer. She&#x27;s so fast, so sleek, such a pure functional mathematical language. It&#x27;s easily my favorite language by far and I just can&#x27;t quite figure out what it is that makes me geek the fuck out about it. 
 Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk.

                              <span>Hey everyone, really dumb question but I think I understand this wrong. Ok so... say i had this function 
 f :: a -&gt; Bool
 f x &#x3D; x&#x3D;&#x3D;0 
 However, since im using the &quot;&#x3D;&#x3D;&quot; operator, to tell haskell that i wont be using any other type other than the ones to which (&#x3D;&#x3D;) has instances, Id make it this correct? 
 f :: (Eq a) &#x3D;&gt; a -&gt; Bool
 f x &#x3D; x&#x3D;&#x3D;0 
 But this throws an error telling me i also have to include (Num a) &#x3D;&gt;
 Why is that? I&#x27;m not using any operator that is in the Num a class... Why does it need this? Isn&#x27;t the whole point of overloading to restrict &quot;a&quot; to only be a type which has an instance in the used operator/function?? What makes me add (Num a) &#x3D;&gt; here too?

                              <span>I just wanted to check within the community on the status of using GHCJS for larger projects.
 Is everyone just locked on 8.6 or earlier like we are?
 It seems like https://github.com/ghcjs/ghcjs/issues/821 is a rigid dealbreaker for any sizable project.
 Our setup of using a hybrid of ghcjs-8.6, ghc-8.6 and ghc-8.10 works well enough, but I&#x27;d be lying if I said it wasn&#x27;t being heavily stress tested.
 I&#x27;m hoping that ghc-9.6 can potentially come to the rescue with a JS backend, but I was curious if there are other solutions on the horizon.

 Can we great a type of unknown amount of .... data?
 I know with record syntax we can create 
 data somedata &#x3D;{ sum:: String, sum:: Int}
 What&#x27;s stopped me from using Haskell for my everyday data science projects was with record syntax I would to modify things so the types and headers to the csv files matched.
 Which is a pain if I am just wanting to download data and play with it.
 Is there a way to create types, say similar to a Dataframe in Python or R where you can turn a CSV to a DataFrame?

                              <span>MicroPython runs on some embedded systems. It provides a Python REPL through the serial port (e.g. /dev/ttyACM0). One can use it through (serial-term &quot;/dev/ttyACM0&quot; 9600) from within Emacs.
 On the other hand python-mode provides some functionality (like python-shell-send-buffer or python-shell-send-defun) to interact with an active, locally running python3 REPL.
 I&#x27;d like to be able to send Python code from a Python-file buffer directly (without me copying and pasting) to the MicroPython REPL.
 Any idea how to achieve that?

                              <span>I&#x27;m not an emacs power user nor very proficient at elisp.
 I use magit quite heavily in emacs, and I&#x27;m regularly working on multiple git repositories at the same time. These are different repositories/worktrees for the same project, just with different branches checked out. I&#x27;m not sure if it is relevant, but these are Perl projects, using cperl-mode, and each project has a single TAGS files at the project root. The first time I use &#x60;M-.&#x60; (&#x60;xref-find-definitions&#x60;), I get prompted to load a TAGS file, and I select the one for the current repository I&#x27;m using. This works as expected. However when I happen to be editing a file from a different repository and hit M-., the previously loaded TAGS file is still used, so this brings me to the source file from the wrong repository. Since the files look identical, I don&#x27;t notice this and regularly make edits in the wrong git worktree.
 I saw that I can load multiple tags tables using visit-tags-table, and then switch between them using select-tags-table. Is there any way to automate this so that when I use &#x60;M-.&#x60; it automatically chooses the TAGS file closest to the current file path? I looked into project.el and projectile, but I couldn&#x27;t find any examples for how to do this.

                              <span>Today I discovered there are two built in variables that you can customize in org-faces to achieve a style similar org-modern. However, there are limitations, for example, org-modern add space paddings to improve the visuals, which you cannot do with these two variables.
 Exactly for that reason, I will have little use for this discovery, and would rather keep it out of my .emacs.d. But hey, maybe someone would make use of this somehow :).
 You should be able to see an example also below. 
 (with-eval-after-load &#x27;org-faces (setq org-todo-keyword-faces (append (cl-loop for todo in &#x27;(&quot;TODO&quot; &quot;NEXT&quot; &quot;STARTED&quot; &quot;PROJECT&quot; &quot;HOLD&quot;) with faces &#x3D; &#x27;(:height 0.8 :inherit (org-modern-todo)) collect (cons todo faces)) (cl-loop for todo in &#x27;(&quot;CANCELLED&quot; &quot;DONE&quot;) with faces &#x3D; &#x27;(:height 0.8 :inherit (org-modern-done)) collect (cons todo faces))) org-priority-faces (cl-loop with end &#x3D; org-priority-lowest for i from org-priority-highest to end collect (list i :inherit &#x27;org-modern-priority)))) 
 Here a gist link to the same snippet, acting as a backup.

 I&#x27;d rather install from an existing package.
 Emacs should be like PostgreSQL. As soon as there is a new release the packages arrive immediately.

                              <span>This started with package-selected-packages not behaving correctly. For some reason it only evaluated to about 5 packages, while it listed over 20 in custom-set-variables. This continued whatever I did (-Q didn&#x27;t help). So I tried moving my init.el. Without an init.el, package-selected-packages evaluates correctly. However, when I try to put it back, Emacs doesn&#x27;t recognize it. What&#x27;s going on?
 Edit: apparently, at some point, Emacs auto-generated a .emacs file. I&#x27;ve deleted it and init.el is recognised now, but the issue with package-selected-packages still remains.

 I watched a couple videos on System Crafter&#x27;s YouTube channel and I like how he can put configuration and initialization code specific for a package within the use-package construct. It seems very tidy and organized.
 I&#x27;m going to start playing with it but thought I&#x27;d see if anyone else has gotten it to work. It might be that I will need to set :ensure nil in each so use-package doesn&#x27;t try to load the package since el-get will have already done it.

 What&#x27;s the best style set of keybindings (in your opinion) for Emacs, and &quot;Why?&quot;.
 Background:
  
I ask this since I have a keybinding to easily switch to Vim style keybindings a la &#x27;Evil Mode&#x27;, but only do so for programming purposes. 
 Everywhere else I use Emacs style keybindings (Org Mode, etc).
 I also use a few custom Hydras as well for weird things like buffer rotation, etc.
  
Curious what you crazy Emacs wizards use these days (ex: Xah Fly Keys, etc). Feel free to provide the &quot;What&quot; you use individual keybinding sets for as well.
 Let&#x27;s have at it, let the best keybindings win! :)

                              <span>Hi r/emacs !
 While I love org-mode, and would much rather use it than any other option, I still have a hard time because I manage a lot of my tasks through my phone. Same for content consumption, I do a lot on my phone thus cannot save anything easily in org.
 I&#x27;ve tried orgzly, but it does not really fit me. 
 How do you manage all that ?
 Thanks !

                              <span>Hey, I put together a Emacs dynamic module for greetd-ipc. With this we can use Emacs as a greeter for greetd. Here is the repo https://git.sr.ht/~declantsien/egreet and a demo https://i.imgur.com/m3ppyg8.mp4
 The rust code are mainly borrowed from agreety. And I am using the Emacs Module in Rust crate here.
 For those who are not familar with greetd. greetd is a minimal, agnostic and flexible login manager daemon.

                              <span>Just thought I&#x27;d document this fix here.
 I have Emacs running portably on Dropbox through a batch script that sets the HOME environment variable:
 REM Set the environment variable HOME, which Emacs uses as the base directory. set HOME&#x3D;%~dp0 REM Run Emacs, passing any parameters to it as well. &quot;D:\Dropbox\Apps\emacs\emacs-28.1\bin\runemacs.exe&quot; %* 
 I began getting this error whenever I tried to list ELPA packages:
 Failed to verify signature archive-contents.sig: No public key for _____________ created at 2022-10-18T08:05:04+1100 using RSA Command output: gpg: keyblock resource &#x27;/d/Dropbox/Apps/emacs/.emacs.d/d:/Dropbox/Apps/emacs/.emacs.d/elpa/gnupg/pubring.kbx&#x27;: No such file or directory gpg: Signature made Tue Oct 18 08:05:04 2022 AUSEST gpg: using RSA key _________________ gpg: Can&#x27;t check signature: No public key 
 My googling led me to this Stack Exchange thread which noted that this was caused by the homedir expansion producing an invalid directory path.
 The fix in my init.el is therefore:
 (setq package-gnupghome-dir &quot;elpa/gnupg&quot;) 
 This creates the keys in the directory that Emacs expects (.emacs.d/elpa/gnupg/) and allows the whole thing to work.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been using an alist as a means of counting occurrences of characters in a string. However, the values associated with a key in the alist are persistent across function calls, even though I reset the alist in a let form (and, well, it&#x27;s inside a function!). Here is a minimal working example. Calling my/test multiple times continually increases the alist values:
 (defun my/test () (let ((my/alist &#x27;((a . 0) (b . 0)))) (incf (alist-get &#x27;a my/alist)) (incf (alist-get &#x27;b my/alist)) my/alist)) 
 What am I doing wrong? Something tells me the problem is with incf, but I cannot understand how my/alist is stored in memory, since it should have its scope inside the function and be reset when let is run.

The code below is my attempt at a function to create a timer, but how do I have it start the second timer when the first one finishes? Thank you for the help!

 A very basic question that I didn&#x27;t manage to answer via Google: I can&#x27;t figure out how to input a vertical bar in OrgMode (|) even though option + 7 works in other non-Emacs applications.
 Does anyone have any insight into why this might be? Edit: I&#x27;m using Emacs for MacOS.

 My Org Headlines
 Currently, my headlines style like this which…isn&#x27;t particularly helpful? The first 3 tend to blur together, for me, and the 4th look like comments, rather than a headline.
 I&#x27;m not sure what I&#x27;d change them to so I thought I&#x27;d ask what others are doing and/or theirs look like, get me brain rolling with some ideas.

                              <span>I am a FTE Linux kernel dev, I use bare bones Emacs and have been wondering if maybe I should add LSP support, as I hear it&#x27;s technically possible to use a LS with the kernel. Anyone do this today, or have advice on how to configure Eglot for the kernel? All I have ever used is cscope and ctags. I&#x27;d like to get it working so that the LSP server picks up the correct headers for the build arch and picks up all the GCC flags.
 I also usually run my builds inside of a container so I don&#x27;t use my system&#x27;s gcc toolchain.
 I am not an Emacs wizard, so detailed instructions for an idiot are most welcome.

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 Trying to fix bugs in a package that&#x27;s gone a bit stale so I&#x27;m trying to figure out how to use edebug. Edebug manual is pretty dense and a couple of weeks between debugging sessions I forget how to run it. In the spirit of &quot;learning in public&quot; here&#x27;s a quick screen cast: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;560QrNt-a_w
 This should really be accompanied by a blog post, and it&#x27;s kinda there in my notes. Would love some feedback.

                              <span>Is their a way to get use both the system clipboard and emacs kill section? By default my vim configuration used the vim clipboard for most things but I had keybindings to copy and paste to the system clipboard. Setting this varible I was able to stop emacs from clobbering my system clipboard but I don&#x27;t see any commands to copy and paste from the system clipboard.

 (setq x-select-enable-clipboard nil)

 Thanks!

                              <span>I use eglot with clang to do c++ completion. 
 I noticed that there is no completion for an object. For example, if A is object and I type A., I get nothing after the dot. Explicate executing completion-at-point returns nothing either. 
 This happens no matter if the class of A is defined in the project or defined in a library. I assume lsp should be able to find the member functions. Am I missing some config? If there is a better system, I would like to try. Thanks.

                              <span>Is it possible to have bookmarks update their location based on where your cursor is?
 For instance, if I create a bookmark in file A on line 1, move to line 2, switch to file B, then jump to my bookmark from file A, I would like to be on line 2.
 I just switched over from vim and I was able to implement it using vimscript auto commands, but I am not as good at elisp.

                              <span>Hi everyone, I am building my emacs on the bas of the nano-emacs of Nicolas Rougier. I am testing several of his own config features, and I get this error.
 With debug init, I get this:
 Debugger entered--Lisp error: (void-function org-make-tags-matcher) (org-make-tags-matcher &quot;*&quot;) (cdr (org-make-tags-matcher &quot;*&quot;)) (defvar my/org-imenu-filter-function (cdr (org-make-tags-matcher &quot;*&quot;)) &quot;Filter function to decide if a headline is kept&quot;) load-with-code-conversion(&quot;c:/Users/f/.emacs.d/init.el&quot; &quot;c:/xxxxx/.emacs.d/init.el&quot; t t) load(&quot;c:/Users/f/.emacs.d/init&quot; noerror nomessage) startup--load-user-init-file(#f(compiled-function () #) #f(compiled-function () #) t) command-line() normal-top-level()
 I looked into the help, the variable exists, it comes with org.el. I looked into org.el and found the variable... I do not understand why I am getting this error.
 Any idea? Thx!

                              <span>I need to do some work on a large repository which already contains a large number of eclipse project files. They apparently can&#x27;t be removed, and they are a real pain when I try to use lsp java as it updates many of them and creates a lot of new ones.
 No problem, I thought, I&#x27;ll just create a parallel directory structure and symlink things in places, and then import that into lsp. However, at some point in the process of importing the project (based on Maven pom files) it canonicalises some paths and ends up importing the original directory structure.
 I realise this is more of an underlying Eclipse issue, rather than an Emacs one, but does anybody have a good suggestion for how to work round this?

                              <span>Hi everyone,I have an interactive function that moves currently opened file into different folder.I do it with rename-file.
 The issue is that when the file is moved, the buffer opened doesn&#x27;t really know about it and after any change in the buffer and then save, the file gets saved into old location.
 How do I associate a buffer with new location? I found somewhere that I can use &#x60;write-file&#x60; function and it suppose to change &quot;the pointer&quot; to file but it didn&#x27;t. It does write to specified location but save-buffer still saves it into old file.
 Thanks

 Side question: Is it expected one would chose an export target (eg PDF) a priori or do people generally intend to ship to any and all platforms?

I think I have bound a texture(I have never seen it), and specified texture coordinates for each vertex, but due to the insane statefullness and pretty much complete lack of documentation (for the high level API), I&#x27;ve spent more than a few hours just trying to get an image on a quad in the background of my window. My quad just ends up colored as the other quads. How do I specify the use of a texture instead of color? If someone could provide a minimal example of actually getting a texture on a surface, I would be very grateful. This is the relevant function:
 drawBackground texRef &#x3D; preservingMatrix $ do matrixMode $&#x3D; Projection loadIdentity ortho2D (-1/2) (1/2) (-1/2) (1/2) matrixMode $&#x3D; Modelview 0 translate $ Vector3 (-1/2) (-1/2) (0::GLfloat) tex &gt; v 0 0 t 1 0 &gt;&gt; v 1 0 t 1 1 &gt;&gt; v 1 1 t 0 1 &gt;&gt; v 0 1 where v x y &#x3D; vertex (Vertex3 (x) (y) (0) :: Vertex3 GLfloat) t u v &#x3D; texCoord (TexCoord2 u v :: TexCoord2 GLfloat) n &#x3D; normal $ (Normal3 0 0 1 :: Normal3 GLfloat)

 I decided to propose a Haskell devroom (like a one/half-days pecialist track or miniconf) for FOSDEM 2023, to be held February 4--5 in Brussels (main site; call-for-devrooms). It would be great to promote Haskell among this audience and hopefully attract new contributors / community members.
 Unfortunately I left it quite late (deadline submission is today). I only just realised I need a secondary contact (i.e. co-organiser) to submit the proposal. So... any volunteers?
 Ideally you are located in Europe or definitely planning to attend FOSDEM. If you are willing, please message me here on Reddit or mail frase at frase dot id dot au. I think I all need right now is your name and email address (and enthusiasm).
 The text of my proposal may be found at https://github.com/frasertweedale/talks/blob/master/2022-02-xx-fosdem-haskell-devroom/proposal.md.
 I have experience organising and hosting FP miniconfs at linux.conf.au including running the CFP etc. I expect FOSDEM will be similar, just on the other side of the world from Australia, where I live.
 Thank you!

 What do you think about such piece of the code? Would you go that way? Is it anti-pattern? What&#x27;s your approach? 
 newtype CryptoService &#x3D; CryptoService { generateToken :: Seed -&gt; Token }
 myFancyCryptoService :: CryptoService
 myFancyCryptoService &#x3D; ...
 data EmailService &#x3D; EmailService
 { cryptoService :: CryptoService
 , sendEmailNotification :: Username -&gt; IO ()
 }
 myFancyEmailService :: EmailService
 myFancyEmailService &#x3D; { cryptoService &#x3D; myFancyCryptoService, ... }
 Thanks to that I am able to use cryptoService&#x27;s generateToken method while implementing sendEmailNotification.

                              <span>I search here, finding the newest discussion related to scalastyle is about 4 years ago. I am wondering if anyone is still using it?
 I have a personal project that I want to check if the code uses some specific type such as enumeration. I successfully setup custom rule. But when attempting to lookup methods provided by CompilationUnit[1]. I can&#x27;t find that code in scalastyle repo. Then further searching on the internet seems to me scalastyle community is not active anymore.
 If so, any alternative projects recommended? 
 Also where can I find the code or scaladoc CompilationUnit? 
 Many thanks.
