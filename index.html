 # end:
 I have this code in the beginning of my file. Yesterday, it was asking me confirm the use of local variable and then works perfectly . However now there is no confirmation and when i save nothing happens. I used M-: to try function and it worked. It have happened before then i deleted, added, tried many things and it started to work suddenly even it was totally same. Do you had similar issue or do you know how can i debug? 
 p.s. : i&#x27;m noob to emacs and the code is from SO.

                              <span>Lately I&#x27;ve been trying to replicate my LaTeX setup for mathematical writing in org mode. I have been able to get everything working fine when it comes to LaTeX exports, but I would ideally like to also export to HTML.
 In many fields of mathematics it is common for papers to follow number conventions along these lines:
 1. Section one Theorem 1.1.  (1.2) Corollary 1.3 2. Section two Lemma 2.1. 
 In LaTeX I would typically achieve this behaviour by using the amsthm package, putting this in my preamble:
 \usepackage{amsthm} \numberwithin{equation}{section} \newtheorem{theorem}[equation]{Theorem} \newtheorem{corollary}[equation]{Corollary} \newtheorem{lemma}[equation]{Lemma} 
 Then LaTeX to produce the outline at the start of this post would look something like this:
 \section{Section one} \begin{theorem}  \end{theorem} \begin{equation}  \end{equation} \begin{corollary}  \end{corollary} \section{Section two} \begin{lemma}  \end{lemma} 
 This means that in org mode I can just add a few lines to my LaTeX preamble with header options and then just write:
 * Section one #+begin_theorem  #+end_theorem #+begin_equation  #+end_equation #+begin_corollary  #+end_corollary * Section two #+begin_lemma  #+end_lemma 
 However, I&#x27;ve been struggling to figure out how to replicate any of this functionality for the html export. I&#x27;ve been trying to read the code that exports to html to see if there&#x27;s a good place to hook in so I can add numbers, but I&#x27;ve been struggling to understand how any of it works.

 Is this possible to define without appealing to Eq? I imagine that from a lambda calculus perspective, this should be possible by comparing lambda terms directly (supposing x, y have normal forms).

 I don&#x27;t mind having the messages logged, in case I find time to investigate, but these are not pressing issues. (&quot;docstring wider than 80 characters&quot; -- in someone else&#x27;s code? Who cares?) It&#x27;s intensely irritating.

                              <span>I have used Tramp to browse remote servers happily for years. But my sysadmin and I were working on something just now that involved log files, which can grow to gbs in size. He mentioned how he uses a &#x3D;vim -view&#x3D; or something like that for browsing big files, which I know is a different mentality than Tramp. The default Tramp I&#x27;ve used always downloads a copy of the file (at least, I think it does) to generate the buffer -- which seems a problem with the big ones, since I&#x27;m recreating a local large too-large thing to maintain the buffer. Is there a way to tell Tramp that for some files I don&#x27;t want to recreate the thing -- just view/search/highlight in it? Or am I misunderstanding the situation completely?

 Debugger entered--Lisp error: (wrong-type-argument number-or-marker-p nil) eyebrowse-free-slot(nil) eyebrowse-create-window-config() funcall-interactively(eyebrowse-create-window-config) call-interactively(eyebrowse-create-window-config nil nil) command-execute(eyebrowse-create-window-config) 
 Anyone have any idea how to fix this?

                              <span>By default, the right abstraction is a bit of type safety around raw SQLite.
 That is sqlite-simple.
 By design, it will last at least a few decades without much of maintenance by the upstream developers due to not having much of anything on top of SQite. But, it has some type safety for marshalling data types. It also has a quosi quoter for long SQL queries.
 It exposes the full expressive power of SQLite. So, you won&#x27;t need to wait for the upstream developers.
 If you want to re-use composable query functions or your application needs to run on different kinds of databases, then you should at least have a look at libraries with higher abstractions, such as beam, squeal, persistent + esqueleto, and selda.
 beam is a bit more complex, but it exposes more SQL features than other higher abst…</span>

                              <span>I could swear I saw a package a while back for working with non-IO environment types interactively in ghci a while back. Something to run actions in a separate thread and pass the results back to the caller, so that it can maintain a persistent environment yet still be easy to user interactively in ghci.
 I couldn&#x27;t find anything like that with a quick search, so I started writing my own. It was very simple at first, but as I started addressing more and more edge cases where things could go wrong, I ended up with a lot of subtle things going on. It reached a point where I started wondering if I&#x27;m duplicating work, or if it would add value to put what I&#x27;ve done on hackage. So does anyone know if something is out there already?
 For the curious, my work is available at https://github.com/chowells79/shuttle/blob/main/src/Control/Shuttle.hs . I haven&#x27;t got it to release quality yet, as I&#x27;m not sure there is a need to. But I have addressed all the technical edge cases I could think of, which at least is interesting for the curious. (The naming is also not great at the moment, but that&#x27;s another separate issue.)

                              <span>TeXmacs is a scientific text editor with a high-quality typesetting engine, of course inspired by LaTeX and able to import/export it (with some limitations) and produce HTML, PS and PDF.

 After using it for a while, it became necessary for me to add quick coding experiments to certain documents. This plugin allows us to run GHCi sessions right inside the editor, which divides interactions into separate cells. This gives us extra capabilities such as re-writing and re-evaluating one or all prompts, deleting interactions, etc. Correct and re-run as many times as needed.

                              <span>Hey there,
 I don&#x27;t know about you, but trying to figure out how to actually configure Emacs for modern web development is a nightmare most of the time since nothing gets properly indented for React projects and the like without a ton of work involved (which absolutely should not be the case in the year of our Lord, 2023 --&gt; Hoping for the day that there&#x27;s like an &#x27;IDE Emacs&#x27; or some bs that just does this for you).
 That being noted, I found this small snippet to be amazing for anyone who configures React projects with using &#x27;.js&#x27; files like I do.
 Just wanted to share the source of the snippet, and the snippet itself, aka include this in your &#x27;web-mode&#x27; config and this should fix any indentation issues for the HTML type segments in the JSX &#x27;return&#x27; statement of any React based &#x27;.js&#x27; files in a React project.
 Related source link aka flooose&#x27;s answer:
 - https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/20016/no-html-jsx-indentation-in-jsx-mode/20055#20055
 ​
 Related snippet I borrowed for my own config:
 (add-hook &#x27;web-mode-hook (lambda () ;; short circuit js mode and just do everything in jsx-mode (if (equal web-mode-content-type &quot;javascript&quot;) (web-mode-set-content-type &quot;jsx&quot;) (message &quot;now set to: %s&quot; web-mode-content-type)))) 
 Hope this helps, thank God for StackOverflow.

                              <span>Available here: https://github.com/rkallio/ol-straight. ol-straight provides a way of constructing an org link that references a straight package. Use org-insert-link to insert a straight type link in to an org document. Opening said link will take you straight to the package&#x27;s homepage URL.
 When exporting a document with straight type links, the links will be exported using the https:// protocol. 
 This package is mostly useful for writing a literate Emacs configuration, where a reference to a package may take you to the package&#x27;s homepage.

                              <span>Hi All,
 I was able to created 3 more episodes of Discovering Emacs the past month and wanted to share them here, and hope some of you find it helpful. Here&#x27;s a brief overview of what was covered in last few episodes.
 Using Whitespace Mode (EP 4):
 Takes a look at Emacs&#x27;s whitespace mode and discusses how we can simplify its configuration to make it more applicable for most use cases.
 Making Incremental Search Work for You (EP 3):
 Shares some of the ways I utilize Emacs&#x27;s incremental search. In addition it makes some configuration recommendations that you might also find useful.
 Efficiency With The Mark Ring (EP 2):
 Discusses the differences between global and local marks. It also explains when and how marks are added to these mark rings. In addition, it also shares some configuration recommendations.
 As suggested by some members of the community, I also created an accompanied YouTube video for each episode of the podcast. YouTube Channel | Podcast Episodes 
 If anyone has topic recommendations, please feel free to share them here. I will definitely add them to my todo list, thanks!

                              <span>I&#x27;m new to emacs, and I&#x27;ve learned the basics, installed some packages, and configured it to my liking the last 2 weeks or so. I&#x27;m using the basic emacs keybindings (no evil).
 One thing that has repeatedly caused me some headaches, is custom keybindings, either for functionality of packages that don&#x27;t provide their own keybindings, or for custom functions. For instance,
  
I want to configure a binding for consult-line (searches for occurrences, lists them in consult, allows to jump to match), something I&#x27;m probably going to use frequently. So I go for &#x60;C-c slash&#x60; , vaguely inspired by vim, which I&#x27;ve used for a while in the past.
 I try it in my config file and it works.
 I want to use it in org mode and realize it&#x27;s already bound to something else there. Shit.
  
How to best avoid this &quot;in advance&quot;, such that it&#x27;s unlikely to happen in the future, even if I install more packages or use more modes? I guess letting my own commands start with &#x60;C-c&#x60; is a bad idea.
 I thought about starting all custom commands with something else, like &#x60;C-some_key...&#x60; where &#x60;C-some_key&#x60; kind of works as something like a personal leader key. But when I use the same leader/prefix key for all personal keybindings, no matter what they do, I feel this breaks the logic of the seperation that we have with &#x60;C-x&#x60; vs &#x60;C-c&#x60; for instance. Whereas using multiple such preface keys seems to escalate keybindings and memorization efforts.
 Also using C might be difficult, as C-something is already bound to a bunch of stuff (eg &#x60;C-v&#x60; for scrolling). What else would be a good option? How are experienced people handling their personal keybindings?
 EDIT made: clarified that the binding I was trying to use was C-c slash-key, somehow it only displayed C-c, which made it confusing

                              <span>Hi, I would like to build an Emacs configuration from scratch. I know there are some alternatives out there such as Prelude, Purcell&#x27;s Emacs.d, and Crafted Emacs but I would like to build my own.
 By modular configuration I mean a configuration in which things are split up in separate files. For example:
 ;; in the main init file: (require &#x27;php) (require &#x27;javascript) (require &#x27;dired) 
 If I don&#x27;t want to use Emacs to code in a certain language I can just comment out the require statement.
 I&#x27;ve noticed that people who built modular configurations did not rely on use-package and they just used the built-in features.
 I was wondering if it&#x27;s possible to build a modular configuration using use-package? I guess use-package is just a macro and what it does it groups things together. Right?
 I think what I need to do is to just put all those use-package chunks into separate files? For example, all dired related stuff into a dired.el file:
 (use-package dired :ensure nil :after all-the-icons-dired :bind (&quot;C-x C-j&quot; . dired-jump) :hook (dired-mode . all-the-icons-dired-mode) :custom (dired-auto-revert-buffer t) (dired-listing-switches &quot;-agho --group-directories-first&quot;)) (use-package dired-narrow :after dired :bind (:map dired-mode-map (&quot;/&quot; . dired-narrow))) (use-package dired-subtree :after dired :bind (:map dired-mode-map (&quot;&quot; . dired-subtree-cycle) (&quot;&quot; . dired-subtree-toggle))) (use-package all-the-icons-dired :after all-the-icons) 
 and PHP related stuff in php.el, so on.. even if the use-package stuff is just 3 lines of code in that file (I may add more stuff in that file in the future).
 I can go with a programming.el that contains all languages but I think having a separate file for each language is better because I can disable and enable the languages I want easier in main.el.
 Please share your thought about this. I would be grateful for any suggestion.

                              <span>New job, embedded software. They have a Linux build server with some homegrown toolchain based on llvm with a mix of makefiles, scons and custom scripts. Huge codebase.
 Development happens on Windows 10 per company policy. I think I can survive the hostile OS with some mix of git bash/msys2/wsl2. Most devs are apparently happy to use some proprietary commercial ide, some vscode, some qtcreator, some vim on the build server.
 I&#x27;d like to give emacs at least a try but I&#x27;ve grown accustomed to use either lsp-mode or more recently eglot with clangd backend. It usually works flawlessly with locally buildable smallish projects and sane build systems (be it autotools, cmake, meson, never really had an issue). 
 Problems I foresee:
  
generate compile_commands.json: hope I&#x27;ll be able to install bear on the build server and that bear will actually work
 separate dev environment and build server: could I maybe generate compile_commands.json in the linux build server and copy it and have it working on the windows dev machine? 
 emacs on windows, native or wsl2? in the latter case cmdline or with some xserver, which one? I just need a few packages, vertico, consult, marginalia, etc. Org-mode would be nice. I think I could live without magit, but that would be sad.
  
Do I have any chance to keep my usual workflow? should I give vscode a try and live happy(ish)?
 Is there maybe a dumber setup for code completions and symbol look up that doesn&#x27;t rely on clangd?

                              <span>Hi, newbie here. I am using Emacs and in particular Org mode for almost a month now. 
 I have some tex document that I want to copy-paste to canvas, but it is a bit of a pain because I need to change say $\tan (x)$ to \(\tan (x) \) and what I do is a bit silly and tedious doing it one by one, and that might be the only way to do it, but I was wondering if there was a quicker way to do it? 
 Thanks!

                              <span>I have a keyboard shortcut for inserting a new heading with the current date in org-mode:
 (defun heading-date () (interactive) (org-insert-heading) (insert (format-time-string &quot;[%Y-%m-%d %a]&quot;)) ) (global-set-key (kbd &quot;&quot;) &#x27;heading-date) 
 I&#x27;d prefer that it always use a top-level heading, not the current heading level. I&#x27;ve read the fine docs but I can not figure out how to set a top-level (single *) heading.
 I know that I can just enter a literal * character. But is there a &quot;correct way&quot; to insert a specific-depth level heading in org-mode?
 Thank you.

                              <span>Hello, I receive this error:
 Symbol&#x27;s value as variable is void: package-archives
 Even though I have this code in the init.el:
 (add-to-list &#x27;package-archives &#x27;(&quot;melpa&quot; . &quot;https://melpa.org/packages/&quot;)) (setq package-archive-priorities &#x27;((&quot;melpa&quot; . 100) (&quot;gnu&quot; . 50) (&quot;nongnu&quot; . 25))) 
 I checked to see if anything evaluates at all in init.el so I added this code:
 (message &quot;It works.&quot;) 
 and I see the message &quot;It works.&quot; in the messages buffer. I have my HOME environmental variable set in Windows. Any idea what may cause that package archive error?

                              <span>This is how I usually grep -r &quot;some_text&quot; ./**/*.py
 Emacs requires specific output, so: grep --color&#x3D;auto -nH --null -re &quot;t&quot; ./**/*.js . However, emacs outputs ./**/*.js is not a file or directory.
 Edit: This has been explained in the comments (the shell expands GLOBs/*, emacs doesn&#x27;t)
 rgrep failed also!!, in the second prompt &quot;search for &quot;xxxx&quot; matching the wildcard:&quot; I can&#x27;t put *.js or *.py!!!! it&#x27;s limited to a few choices!
 I must be missing something stupid here!
 Edit: Yes, I&#x27;m missing something dumb. rgrep second prompt gives you possible choices for the wildcard. To write your own wildcard you need to actually choose what you wrote by going up with the arrow key! I&#x27;m on emacs 29 with doom. I hope this is just a bug, not a feature!

                              <span>Most tasks require you to have multiple buffers open at the same time. These could be multiple files, or other secondary buffers like magit or speedbar. If you need to have multiple files open at the same time, where do you like to have your main file?
 Note: 
  
if you have multiple monitors, I&#x27;m assuming emacs is in your main screen if you&#x27;re doing some heavy editing
 the poll has no options for multiple buffers stacked vertically (i.e., upper and bottom), but feel free to vote anyway and leave a comment

 emacs: writing to child signal FD: Bad file descriptor 
 I use the form above in a function to open a terminal on the current directory. Am I doing it wrong?
 start-process-shell-command doesn&#x27;t raise the error (but I don&#x27;t use it because on quitting Emacs kills the processes launched with start-process-shell-command).
 My OS is Emacs 28.2 running Fedora 37.
  
Update Maybe I&#x27;ve run into https://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug&#x3D;58960 as suggested on https://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/help-gnu-emacs/2022-11/msg00260.html. If I run M-x shell before evaluating call-process-shell-command no error is shown, indeed.

                              <span>I tried to find an inbuild function for searching for values inside list-variables but did not find one. Then I wrote one recursively, but as I expected it bloats to quickly to be used on longer lists.
 I also looked a bit into loading the list into a buffer and then searching for a regexp but I don&#x27;t want to load a buffer (maybe there is a virtual buffer, which is not visible or active in a sense? Or a temporary file to be searched?).
 So what is the best way to search a long list of symbols for a symbol in a program?
 ​
 Here is my humble attempt:
 (defun arg-is-in-car (arg cons-arg) (eq arg (car cons-arg))) (defun list-is-empty (list-arg) (not list-arg)) (defun arg-is-in-list (arg list-arg) (if (arg-is-in-car arg list-arg) t (progn (if (list-is-empty list-arg) nil (arg-is-in-list arg (cdr list-arg))))))

                              <span>Greetings to all. 
 It just so happened that my Intellij license ran out. Well, I decided to look towards the exotic, and so far I have stopped at emacs.
 There were several questions(In Emacs I&#x27;m a complete noob). If there are java developers who write in Emacs, I hope for their help (and configs :)).
 Actual questions:
 1) Which is better: build emacs from scratch or use doomEmacs as a starting point?
 2) Which lsp servers are better to install for Java (sometimes I also write in Scala)?
 3) Which plugins to install for Maven and Gradle? Will there be auto-completion? 
 4) Will it be possible to create and run projects directly from Emacs? (Not so important, but still)
 5) How is Spring? Is there a plugin that is analogous to Spring Tools?
 6) Which plugins should I use to integrate git, sql, markdown, xml?
 7) Which plugins should I use for database integration? Is there such a possibility at all? Interested in redis, postgresql.
 What I plan to use it for:
 1) Development of the backend part
 2) JavaFX development of home projects.
 3) Minecraft modding. Purely on the fan.
 Thank you in advance for your help.

                              <span>Hello, I am trying to develop a mode for a custom language of mine. The language deals with a lot of logical operators such as &quot;∧&quot;, &quot;∨&quot; and &quot;∀&quot; etc. What I am trying to implement is a feature so that I can write &quot;\and&quot; to get the &quot;∧&quot; symbol (kinda like they do in the agda-mode).
 Currently I am using the prettify-package, however I realised that this package does not actually replace the text with the symbols in the file. It simply replaces it visually in my mode, but the source-text still remains in the file.
 I could rewrite the parser of the language to also parse &quot;\and&quot;, but I prefer to avoid this and get Emacs to replace the actual string with the Unicode-symbol it refers to.
 Does anyone know about any similar package to prettify-package which also replaces the actual strings with the symbols? 
 Thanks in advance 
 PS. I am not sure how standard the prettify package is within the Emacs community. But here is a link to the code I am using: https://github.com/Ilazki/prettify-utils.el/blob/master/prettify-utils.el

                              <span>Please recommend resources (of any kind such as book, blog, youtube channel) to me to learn haskell. I am a CS student and do code in several different languages, as part of learning, haven&#x27;t done any project or industry work and I have very very weak grasp at maths (fine with relation and functions in maths now). I just started reading learn you a haskell for great good since yesterday. I don&#x27;t get what 5 /&#x3D; 5 means, 5/5 :&#x3D; 1 then why its says False? Haskell has module but not classes at all, right? Some important concepts to make a solid grasp on? I&#x27;m just curious about haskell and because it&#x27;s so different and bla bla bla. But where are actually its applications because I&#x27;m desiring to become a future haskell dev these days, please give me big solid reasons to stick to it. 
 Please be kind. Thank you so much.

                              <span>I just released brick-tabular-list-2.0.1.0 on hackage.
 Everything that bugged me in API and implementation has been corrected. Before 1.0.0.0, the API was convoluted. Before 2.0.0.0, the API and the implementation were a bit difficult to understand.
 Now, the API and the implementation are simple and easy to understand.
 It seems there will not be breaking changes for the next few decades.
 If you want a tabular list in terminal emulators, look no further. You have found it.

                              <span>Hi, guys! I apologize for asking a silly question.
 I set up a quick repo to play around and build minesweeper in Haskell for practice. I decided to use Cabal over stack, because I&#x27;ve seen other people use it to good end.
 ​
 So, my first step was to set up the structure of the project and try to see how the imports worked.
 So, I ran cabal init -n followed by creating a src/myfancypkg directory with myfancypkg.hs file, containing a single function. So, the structure of the project is:
 minesweeper |app -main.sh |src |myfancypkg -myfancypkg.hs -minesweeper.cabal 
 dist-newstyle folder appeared after running cabal init
 Coming from Go, I got spoiled with the local imports discovery that happens auto-magically. When I try to use my new package in main, I get this error:
 app/Main.hs:3:8: error: parse error on input ‘myfancypkg’ | 3 | import myfancypkg (myhello) | 
 I tried figuring out how to fix it, but after two hours of searching and trying I finally resorted to asking the mature crowd. I apologize for asking such a dumb question too.
 Thank you SO much for taking time!
 Here&#x27;s the repo for you to examine: https://github.com/rkuprov/minesweeper

 I have been getting some errors and I think it’s because the latest version of ghc supported on Hasktorch A and the oldest version of ghc supported on macos M1/2 B are incompatible. That is to say that B &gt; A (we want A &gt;&#x3D; B). 
 Are there work arounds or are there good alternatives to Hasktorch?

                              <span>It is a truth universally acknowledged that the Python packaging ecosystem is in need of a good dependency checker.
In the least, it’s our hope to convince you that Tweag’s new dependency checker, FawltyDeps, can help you maintain an environment that is minimal and reproducible for your Python project, by ensuring that required dependencies are explicitly declared and detecting unused dependencies.
If you work with Python, and care about keeping your projects lean and repeatable, then this is for you.

Why do we need a dependency checker?
Say you’re working on a new project that uses Python, and you want to
leverage Python’s ecosystem of 3rd-party libraries.
So you decide to import something.
For that something to work, you must first install it into your development environment

                              <span>I have almost structured textual log files and want investigate the content with tool assistance.
 I managed to parse my logs with https://github.com/otros-systems/otroslogviewer but GUI somewhat inconvenient...
 Is there anything for Emacs which
  
understands structure of logs (time/host/ip/logger/category/etc could be parsed and I don&#x27;t want to write ugly kilometer long regexes),
 and allows hiding parts based on structured patterns? Like I want to hide all errors from &quot;main&quot; thread or requests from ip&#x3D;localhost.
 handles 100MB files
  
My current log format is not one line but multiline so no M-x flush-lines.
 PS I wonder if I can repurpose Wireshark to parse logs so later I can filter out / highlight / search.

 (require &#x27;package) (add-to-list &#x27;package-archives &#x27;(&quot;melpa&quot; . &quot;https://melpa.org/packages/&quot;)) (setq package-archive-priorities &#x27;((&quot;melpa&quot; . 100) (&quot;gnu&quot; . 50) (&quot;nongnu&quot; . 25))) (package-initialize) &lt;---- here it is (unless (package-installed-p &#x27;use-package) (package-refresh-contents) (package-install &#x27;use-package)) (use-package use-package :init (setq use-package-always-ensure t) (use-package use-package-ensure-system-package :ensure t)) 
 I&#x27;m not sure if I understood correctly because I&#x27;m not a native English speaker but from what I read online it seemed to me that the (package-initialize) is not needed anymore in the init file since Emacs 27. However I&#x27;m not sure about it. Is that true?
 I&#x27;m using Emacs 28.1. So, in my case should l get rid of the (package-initialize) line and set the package-enable-at-startup variable to t in early-init.el instead of nil? I&#x27;m not planning to use anything lower than Emacs 28 in the future.

                              <span>Hello guys. Just saw a lot of people is switching to emacs because org mode. Saw it on the internet and is just to write notes with a cool format. I don&#x27;t write a lot of notes at all, and if i do it i feel comfortable with raw text. If i need to do something looking nicer better use HTML.
 So please tell me why is so amazing org mode? Thanks

                              <span>I saw this package one time that changes the way syntax highlighting works by coloring things based on their indentation level in a file. It would be very useful for certain filetypes like xml, where the indentation (ideally) reflects the semantics of the file structure. Think of it like rainbow-delimiters except for entire levels of indentation.
 I meant to set it up but never wrote down what it was called and now I can&#x27;t find it anymore. I&#x27;m not talking about this: https://github.com/DarthFennec/highlight-indent-guides and results for this (and the 5+ other packages that do this same thing) is all I can find when googling different variations of &quot;emacs syntax coloring by indentation level&quot; etc.
 Anyone know what this package is called?

(custom-set-variables ;; custom-set-variables was added by Custom. ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful. ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance. ;; If there is more than one, they won&#x27;t work right. &#x27;(package-selected-packages &#x27;(ox-hugo))) (custom-set-faces ;; custom-set-faces was added by Custom. ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful. ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance. ;; If there is more than one, they won&#x27;t work right. )  I understand the custom-set-variables option, but why the empty custom-set-faces option?

                              <span>I am not sure if this is a new issue, or if it&#x27;s something I just noticed, but rather than &#x60;org-cycle&#x60; cycling through the visibility of a sub-tree, it only folds the subtree.
 subsequent TAB key presses do not reveal the tree, and the only way to view the contents is to close and reopen the file.
 In &#x60;insert&#x60; mode, the TAB key promotes and demotes the subtree just fine. 
 There is no way to unfold the subtree.
 I have seen a few issues that are close to this one, but I haven&#x27;t seen this issue.
 Ideas? Thanks!

                              <span>Hi, I have been lurking around for a while now, really enjoying the discussions, so I thought it might be time to introduce myself.
I am a originally from Slovakia, but have been living in Norway for a decade now. I’m a researcher in data analysis, working with a lot of machine learning, and like to learn about a variety of things in my free time too. My interests range from the biophysics of movement through diet, pregnancy and childbirth, to neurodiversity, gardening, parenting, knowledge work and whatever else that catches my interest.
I have first heard about the Zettelkasten method about two months ago and it was a love at first sight. I always struggled with organising my notes and the organically organised chaos of Zettelkasten just makes perfect sense to me.
I started out using Obsidian. That is actually how I ran into the Zettelkasten, as I was originally only looking for a simple markdown editor. After a month and a hundred notes I could feel this was becoming very important to me and decided to move to an open source software instead - namely org-roam in Emacs. I’m new to Emacs, but fairly stubborn, so I have been steadily climbing its famously steep learning curve and I think I’m quite happy with my choice. The time when my Zettelkasten was hanging between the two systems, so to speak, was quite uncomfortable though.
I haven’t quite landed with my note-taking routines yet, but I have the most important bits in place. I use my trusted Bullet Journal for planning, journaling, tracking and fleeting notes, while any “knowledge” goes into the Zettelkasten with Zotero keeping track of the references.
I am very excited to see how things will evolve and looking forward to the interesting discussions here on the forum.</span>

Is there any module tied to compile mode which would, when stepping through errors, parse these messages, and ask if you wanted to apply the suggestion, and if you said yes, would modify the source code in emacs?

                              <span>Hey,
 I&#x27;ve been playing around with a few different modal editors (particularly Meow and God mode) and saw the recent post on Holymotion. I&#x27;ve been trying to incorporate avy more into my workflow, but often find that I run a command then realize I should have run an avy command instead. I&#x27;ve written this very basic function, which takes the last repeatable command and runs a set avy command based on that. I&#x27;m sharing it here for mostly since I&#x27;m very new to actually writing my own elisp functions and would really appreciate any input on how to improve it.
 ​
 (defun avy-extend-command (repeat-arg) &quot;Runs a specific avy command based on what the last-repeatable-command was&quot; (interactive &quot;P&quot;) (cond ((eq &#x27;next-line last-repeatable-command) (avy-goto-line-below)) ((eq &#x27;previous-line last-repeatable-command) (avy-goto-line-above)) ((or (eq &#x27;forward-word last-repeatable-command) (eq &#x27;forward-char last-repeatable-command)) (avy-goto-word-0-below-in-line)) ((or (eq &#x27;backward-word last-repeatable-command) (eq &#x27;backward-char last-repeatable-command)) (avy-goto-word-0-above-in-line)) (t (message &quot;%s does not have a related avy-extend-command&quot; last-repeatable-command)))) (global-set-key (kbd &quot;H-j&quot;) #&#x27;avy-extend-command)

                              <span>Emacs is notorious for including all kinds of functionality including a web browser, a calculator, and tetris.
 However, it doesn’t seem to include language support for many popular languages including go and lua. Out of curiosity, what’s the reasoning for this?

                              <span>Hello Emacser.
 a year ago started to create my personal website using emacs and org-mode. I figured out an org file could also be an weblog using ox-rss. It exports the org file as RSS file. But I wanted more than one weblog, and I wanted to have an subscribe link to the corresponding xml file added to the html-postamble string. For instance: general.html -&gt; general.xml etc.
 I figured out there is an property list called &quot;info&quot; generated as the export process is running. This property list includes all properties from the org-export-options-alist and the export backend specific options alist. (i.e.: org-export-define-backend &#x27;html)
 The property :html-postamble can be a function name which is called during the export process. Its only argument is info, which is the property list. So far …</span>

                              <span>I was thinking about a mildly annoying issue with emacs--I&#x27;ll semi-frequently litter a file with a misedited key chord (mistyped ctrl-a or ctrl-e leave an [ae] or ctrl-T swaps something). How much would switching to a modal mode help this?
 I&#x27;ve never tried evil but I have tried viper (I use vi for quick edits and emacs when I&#x27;ll be there awhile) and found the usability of almost vi strange. If I was going to move to a modal mode, I would have three requirements:
  
ability to have the mode on for some file types or buffers and not others. Viper-mode appears to open every new file in the modal editing mode which isn&#x27;t what I want. Ideally, file-local variables would be supported.
 ability to easily switch back and forth (e.g. viper&#x27;s ctrl-z) between the modal mode and normal emacs.
 limited performance degradation.
  
 How much would switching to a modal mode help this?
  
As a semi-frequent vi user, I&#x27;d guess that it&#x27;ll make it go away.

                              <span>Usually, i use emacs for writing (org) and Common Lisp programming. It&#x27;s perfect for this.
 Recently, I setup my emacs for Typescript/NextJS development. It works well. But a few times, flycheck was telling me I had an issue... after 30 mins of debugging, I reverted buffer and it went away. There was no error.
 Another time (and a few times after that), the app crashed. No errors. Nothing. I opened the same project in vsCode and i had lots of errors. These did not come up in emacs. 
 The challenge now is that I cannot rely on the emacs messages to be accurate. 
 Im not sure what the issue is either.
 Any thoughts/similar experiences?

                              <span>My package perject is now available on MELPA. It allows grouping frames, buffers and window configurations per (user-defined) project. It makes use of the built-in packages desktop.el and tab-bar.el.
 The main difference to something like the built-in project.el is what is considered a &quot;project&quot;. In project.el, every project has a &quot;root directory&quot; in which the files belonging to the project are supposed to live. In contrast, there is no such assumption in perject. Projects are completely user-defined and it does not matter where a file is actually located on the file system. One can use project.el alongside perject.
 You can find more information and some video demos on the website: https://github.com/overideal/perject

                              <span>Emacs has C-M-h as &quot;mark function&quot; command. It calls different functions in different modes (for example, C++ calls c-mark-function, python calls python-mark-defun). I&#x27;d like to have this functionality in a different binding (C-M-f, it&#x27;s a little bit easier to reach). How can I achieve this? I tried
 (define-key (current-local-map) (kbd &quot;C-M-f&quot;) (lookup-key (current-local-map) (kbd &quot;C-M-h&quot;)))
 This works with C++, but not with python. But it seems that both modes puts the C-M-h binding in their major mode&#x27;s keymap, so I don&#x27;t know why it works with C++, but not with python. Any ideas?

                              <span>Hi, I have two questions and would appreciate any help!
  
How can I change the behavior of the shift key + arrowkeys to behave like in other text-editors? I&#x27;ve recently started using Emacs with Evil Mode. Having used VScode and IntelliJ IDEs in the past. Afaik if you use the VIM keybidings &quot;properly&quot; there is no need to select text with the arrows, but I am currently somewhat short on time so I haven&#x27;t had much chance to learn them properly. So for now I am using the arrows keys. But when I use them in the insert state shift + arrow is always jumping whole words. And Ctrl + shift + arrow selects whole words. I would like it to behave like I am used to with shift starting the selection, arrows moving one char at a time, and ctrl + arrow to be used to jump whole words? Is that somehow possible? Which brings me to my next question 
 
Why is which key not showing the bindings for Ctrl + Arrow / Shift+Arrow etc. ? In regards to my previous questions, I was trying to find out how I can achieve it. Online I heard which key (C h + the key you want described) often, but there&#x27;s no way for it to describe Ctrl/shift + arrow for me. If I press C-h k shift-arrow it only describes the behavior the arrow key. Is it because Ctrl/shift are some sort of modifiers and not keys? If yes, is there any way how to describe behavior of such key combinations?
 
 I hope my questions make sense, english is not my native language and I have a hard time to describe what I mean. I apologize if I am unclear.

 Doing &#x60;M-x flypsell-german()&#x60; and &#x60;M-x flyspell-english()&#x60; does work.
 But what I would like is to have the English dict the default when starting a python buffer. The &#x60;:config&#x60; section using &#x60;(flyspell-english)&#x60; doesn&#x27;t seems to work. It is always German (my OS default language/locale) not English.

                              <span>As a happy, long time user of Ivy+Swiper+Counsel, I&#x27;ve had a years-long absence from tweaking my reasonably stable Emacs config. I&#x27;ve come back recently and found that Vertico+Consult+Orderless+Embark+Marginalia+Corfu are all the rage.
 I found this post pretty convincing in its description of the advantages of the new Vertico+Consult+Orderless+Embark+Marginalia+Corfu way, and want to give these new packages a try, but overhauling my config (which is pretty tightly integrated with Ivy+Swiper+Counsel) is going to be no small feat.
 In particular, I need help finding equivalents for the following:
  
ivy-read (this is a big one, as I heavily use its integrated prompting and collection-gathering functionality)
 counsel-hydra-heads (used in all my hydras)
 counsel-yank-pop
 amx integration in to counsel-M-x
 counsel-grep-or-swiper
 counsel-grep-or-swiper-backward
 ivy-explorer
  
Also, is there a guide somewhere that shows how to get Vertico+Consult+Orderless+Embark+Marginalia+Corfu to work well with each other?

                              <span>I always thought that head is not strict, because:
 head [x,undefined] &#x3D;&#x3D; x
 head (cycle[x]) &#x3D;&#x3D; x
 or am I wrong? is head actually strict? What I know is that lists are in weak head normal form because lists are evaluated to the outermost data constructor. And when working with weak head normal form then the function is definitely non-strict; Or did I understand something wrong?

 I can load it successfully into GHCi, using :l Test.hs. I can run the code successfully with main. 
 The only oddity is that I am seeing this:

 Why is it underlining System.Random? Hovering over the underlined text, it says cannot find System.Random...

                              <span>Does fmap NewType [Int] have the same computational cost as fmap id [Int]?
 What is the computational cost of fmap id [Int]? Does it have the upfront time cost of O(n) or O(1)?
 What is the computational cost of this?
 fmap (\NewType1 x -&gt; NewType2 x) [NewType1] 
 Update: I guess I will just use coerce to save computations.

                              <span>Hi!
 I was looking into Haskell and I kept seeing the word &quot;monad&quot; pop up and I tried googling what it meant and just got more confused (idk what an endofunctor is either...). Can anyone explain what it is in an easier to understand way? 
 Thank you in advance!

 Thought I was going crazy, but upon closer inspection, some of the vertical lines of my tables are not aligned properly? It&#x27;s off by like 1px? Why is this happening? How do I fix it? I&#x27;ve &#x27;tabbed&#x27; the crap out of it, but nothing.

                              <span>I have couple of blogs on Wordpress and Tumblr. I want to convert them to static site with Hugo+Github. 
 I have started using emacs recently so I want to use emacs and org syntax to create and edit the files. 
 As part of this I want to export my posts from wordpress and tumblr to org format. Tumblr native export feature exports the posts in HTML format. 
 Are there any plugins which can export my posts from wordpress and tumblr into org format?

 - https://com-lihaoyi.github.io/fastparse/#3.0.0
 - https://com-lihaoyi.github.io/upickle/#3.0.0
 &quot;Doesn&#x27;t support Scala 3&quot; has been a big complaint for these libraries for a while, so now that that&#x27;s fixed I thought I&#x27;d publicize it a bit.

Lambda Calculus
 
Type Theory
 
Abstract Algebra
 
Category Theory
 
 If someone is a wanting to do functional programming for average use cases like websites, app development, data science, etc... and not for deep under the hood work of compilers, creating new programming languages from scratch etc... which of these topics hold applied value beyond intellectual appreciation of historical concepts related to functional programming?
 An example might be, has knowing lambda calculus or category theory ever helped you write out a plan for how you would compose your functions?
 Has knowing type theory helped anyone with using a type system for domain modeling?

                              <span>Hey r/haskell,
 I have an idea for an interesting hobby project and am scoping out writing it in Haskell. The architecture is not too complicated, it will be the backend for a mobile application. To start not needing more than Redis/server/lambda/postgres. It does not need to serve up html.
 As the title mentioned, I&#x27;m looking for a guide to Haskell backend engineering in the same vein as zero2production is to Rust.
 For those who haven&#x27;t had the pleasure of reading it, it achieves all of these in a pretty small span of time
  
Preferred installation and package management solutions circa 2022
 Informed and justified selection of key packages (BE web framework, [de]serialization, Postgres communication, redis communication, auth, session management, testing unit/integration, logging/tracing, validation, etc.)
 project structure
 development cycle
 build and deployment considerations (the deployment is less Rust specific)
  
To give you some idea of where I&#x27;m at technically, I&#x27;ve been a professional SWE for a few years now, and spent a semester in Haskell in graduate school, so I&#x27;m familiar, but not fluent with the language.
 My understanding is that in the last few years Haskell has seen a lot of development in practical engineering considerations. So I&#x27;m hoping you guys can share your industry wisdom or point me towards a book/guide you view highly.

I was wondering if there was a resource or site where I could do structured practice to quickly refresh on pre-monad Haskell. I still remember the concepts generally, just need to write some code for it to come back to me.

 (after! evil-mode (unbind-key &quot;C-t&quot;)

                              <span>Has anyone managed to integrate the vi shell editing mode (&quot;set -o vi&quot;) tightly with eat?
 I&#x27;ve just started to use eat myself, and while I love how fast it is, and how well it handles even &quot;graphical&quot; terminal applications like top, I can&#x27;t figure out how to get it to play nice with &quot;set -o vi&quot;
 In an ordinary terminal I can usually type ESC to get to normal mode, then k or j to bring the previous/next command from my shell command history to my shell prompt for editing, but that doesn&#x27;t work from evil&#x27;s insert mode in eat.
 The control-r keystroke that I usually use to search through command history in my shell in an ordinary terminal doesn&#x27;t work in eat either.
 Has anyone figured these out, or have any other tips for integrating evil and vi editing mode in a shell in eat?

                              <span>Hello all,
 First I wanted to say what a great community I think this is. Very knowledgeable and friendly. So excited to have dived into emacs and the reddit channel.
 I have a failry simple question but I couldn&#x27;t find the answer on the internet. I mainly program with python and now use company and flymake (thank you for suggestion via previous post). I think that very wisely emacs has them disabled at startup. If I wanted to write a letter I would have found it very annoying to have random exlcamation marks about indentation :-p
 So I want to assign just one key to enable both of them at the same time. I found how to assign them seperately with this:
 (global-set-key [f8] &#x27;company-mode)
 (global-set-key [f9] &#x27;flymake-mode)
 ​
 So I was wondering if there&#x27;s something like
 (global-set-key [f8] &#x27;company-mode &#x27; flymake-mode)
 ​
 Thank you all for your time

                              <span>Hi folks, first time poster. Nice to meet you!
 I&#x27;m at a bit of a loss here. I&#x27;ve configured company-mode via use-package as per the following:
 (use-package company
 :after lsp-mode
 :diminish
 :hook (prog-mode . company-mode)
 :bind
 (:map company-active-map
 (&quot;&quot; . company-complete-selection))
 (:map lsp-mode-map
 &#x60;(&quot;&quot; . company-indent-or-complete-common))&#x60; 
 :custom
 (company-minimum-prefix-length 1)
 (company-idle-delay 0.1))
 Comment: I had prog-mode in the hook as well. But for debugging purposes, I removed it.
 company-mode won&#x27;t kick in automatically in emacs-lisp-mode buffers. Activating it manually works like a charm though. By order of elimination I&#x27;ve identified lsp-mode interaction (mapping and load order) as the culprit. Without it, everything works as intended. I have a few guesses which I won&#x27;t utter because they&#x27;d probably make me sound like an idiot.
 This is my first time hand crafting an .emacs.d. I&#x27;m enjoying the experience very much so far and I can&#x27;t wait to continue, but I&#x27;d like to get rid of this issue first. I&#x27;ll also accept a &quot;you don&#x27;t really need the integration&quot; if applicable. Thanks in advance!

 but when I try C-M-i or TAB to do a completion there&#x27;s no popup and I get:

 The clangd is still there. In fact, several of them - a new one every time I try it.
 Any ideas?
 My eglot config is:
 (use-package eglot :ensure t :config ;; (setq eglot-ignored-server-capabilites &#x27;(:documentHighlightProvider :hoverProvider)) ;; (setq eglot-stay-out-of &#x27;company) (add-to-list &#x27;eglot-server-programs &#x27;((c-mode .

 By design, the navigation keys are on the home row, more balanced with both hands. At the mean time, the left thumb is naturally fallen on the alt position, which makes it convenient for forward and backward word. Some main prefix keys are maintained. And the layout is suggested with the letter frequency, allowing attention put on the home row regions without moving hands around. Anyway, this is just an experimental remapping, which I found is superior and more efficient than QWERT and Colemak for standard keybindings.
 See necessary stuffs if you wanna try out. Any suggestions are welcome!

                              <span>I am using doom emacs and I have multiple projects for projectile defined. Is there any way to have two projects side by side? I mean I want to split a frame and on the left window I have my one project and on the right window I want to have another project open. For example to copy code from parts of files of project 2 into files from project 1. 
 Is there any way to do that? When I open a project it always opens up a new workspace. And even though I can easily switch there it would be nicer if I could look at both at once. 
 Or is the only chance that I use two frames? And do the „split view“ with my window manager?

                              <span>Hey there! Guess what? I&#x27;m back on Emacs after 10 long years! :) I&#x27;m using the basic GNU Emacs distribution for Windows 64 and it&#x27;s pretty cool. But hey, I need some customization tips to make my work flow better. You know, some basic tips everyone who&#x27;s new to Emacs would want to do. So far, I managed to change fonts, window size, foreground and background colors by adding a few commands to &quot;init.el&quot; file. Yeah, it&#x27;s looking better now. 
 But you know what would be even nicer? Using the mouse for basic cut and paste from the clipboard. Is there any way to do that, by the way? Also, can we get a command history by using the up-arrow key, especially when we are in the command line? Hmm...I wonder! Anyway, do you guys have a list of top &quot;5&quot; things which I could do to make Emacs more fun and easy to use? Would love it if you could share some tips and tricks with me!

 How do I permanently disable the mode line? I have tried (setq mode-line format nil), but every time I open a new buffer, there&#x27;s the mode line. 
 Thank you for your time. Any help will be genuinely appreciated..

                              <span>The idea of having and maintaining a Zettelkasten has become increasingly popular since the »Zettelkästen. Maschinen der Phantasie« exhibition at Marbach in March 2013 and the appearance of the website zettelkasten.de in late 2013 and has grown significantly with the Cambrian explosion of a variety of digital note taking tools since 2018.
But here’s a fun little historical linguistic puzzle:
What was the first use of the word Zettelkasten in a predominantly English language setting?
In my own notes/research the first occurrence I’ve been able to identify in an English language setting is on Manfred Kuehn’s blog in Taking note: Luhmann’s Zettelkasten on 2007-12-16. He’d just started his blog earlier that month.
Has anyone seen an earlier usage? Can you find one? Can you beat this December 2007 date or something close by a different author?
Google’s nGram Viewer doesn’t indicate any instances of it from 1800-2019 in its English search, though does provide a graph for German with peaks in the 1850s, 1892 (just after Ernst Bernheim’s Lehrbuch der Historischen Methode in 1889), 1912, 1925, and again in 1991.
Twitter search from 2006-2007 finds nothing and there are only two results in German both mentioning Luhmann.
My best guess for earlier versions of the appearance zettelkasten in English might stem from the work/publications of S. D. Goitein or Gotthard Deutsch, but I’ve yet to see anything there. 
For those who speak German, what might you posit as a motivating source for the rise of the word in the 1850s or any of the other later peaks?

                              <span>Hi everyone. I&#x27;m just a beginner and I know nobody would recommend me this, cause I&#x27;m just a student and although I code a lot (follow tutorials, books and tinker what&#x27;s taught, CC/CP), I don&#x27;t have any experience in programming (projects or work with some org or company), but its my 4th sem in college and I found an app idea (won&#x27;t share cause you guys will hate me for such a common sh*t, hehe jk) and at first and still, I&#x27;m following tutorials on flutter and side-by-side java for building mobile applications. I wonder if I could develop an application in Scala. What framework or library I would require, what should be the roadmap for a guy like me and literally any kinda tip, trick, help, advice would be very beneficiary. I personally love Scala (actually learning enough java for scala) and Dart (cause its too similar to scala (Supports OO and FP) but is very optimized for FE (its framework, flutter)) AFAIK. Please feel free to correct me where you get the opportunity, links to resources, articles or whatnot will also be very helpful. 
 TLDR; I need proper guidance in developing mobile application using Scala, consider me an overall beginner (never done a project, but code a lot) but a Scala lover. Please take time to write long answer cuase sometimes I&#x27;m dumb and I need longer explanations. 
 Thank you so much for helping.

                              <span>Is there anything wrong in using a YYMMDDTMMHHSS timestamp as an ID for an org heading? I go with the presumption that I do not create two headings at the same second, so the IDs will be unique.
 As you probably already know the default ID generated by org-id-get-create is a longer UUID but I would like something shorter and human readable.
 Also, having an ID for each main heading can cause performance issues in an Org file?
 I do not use the IDs for now but I will probably use them in the name of image files on the filesystem so I know which image belongs to which note. I want the IDs because I consider adding them a good practice. Even paper and digital databases have an ID for each of their records. I would add IDs to each separate bookmark or contact I capture and store in an Org file. Like so:

 This little package grew from a discussion here several days ago. It turns the builtin rectangle-mark-mode (C-x SPC, by default) into a convenient modal interface for all the usual C-x r * rectangle commands. It also binds useful builtin functionality that wasn&#x27;t exposed before, like whitespace deletion, and adds some new things, like shifting the selection rectangle left/right, and restoring the position of the last used rectangle.
 But the coolest feature is enabled by something I didn&#x27;t even know about before (thanks u/oantolin): calc (the emacs calculator) can operate on matrices. With a little translation help from SpeedRect, you can grab one or more columns of numerical data into calc, do all kinds of operations on it there (pretty much anything), and then, once you are happy, yank it back into the buffer, over the top of the rectangle selection.

 Captee in the macOS Share menu 
 This past February, I started building a macOS app to help me work with Org mode for Emacs. It lets you share links and content from another app (typically Safari) via the macOS Share menu and format it in Org markup. It can also support Markdown links so you can work with other editors too. The app is called Captee and the video link below demonstrates it at work.
 Captee alpha demo
 Note that Captee is very much in an alpha/proof-of-concept/bleeding-edge state of polish right now. You’ll get the best results for Captee if you use the macOS Yamamoto Mitsuharu port of Emacs. It supports Org Protocol out of the box, otherwise you will have to use the system clipboard to share content.
 To capture selected text via org-protocol you’ll need to define a capture template on the Emacs side first before you use Captee. Here’s an example capture template that uses the placeholders described in the Org capture protocol.
 (setq org-capture-templates &#x27;( (&quot;a&quot; &quot;Captee Capture&quot; entry (file+headline &quot;~/org/captee.org&quot; &quot;Captee Captures&quot;) &quot;* %:description\n%:annotation\n%i\n%?&quot; :empty-lines 1) )) 
 Okay with all that said, I’m looking for testers. If you’re interested, you can get an alpha build of Captee via this TestFlight link. Please provide feedback via the TestFlight app. Also, I highly recommend you do a deep-read of the release notes before installing or using Captee.

                              <span>I am facing a strange issue when I byte-compile the following file
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; (defvar my/var 10)
 (defmacro my/macro-test () &#x60;(message &quot;%S&quot; ,my/var))
 (my/macro-test) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 using the command  emacs -batch --no-site-file -q -f batch-byte-compile test.el 
 I get an error test.el:9:2: Error: Symbol’s value as variable is void: my/var
 Which is strange since, clearly, I am defining my/var. Any idea why this is happening and what is the best way to enable compilation of this file?
 Note that I want the macro to be expanded to (message &quot;%S&quot; 10) as it does in my example and not (message &quot;%S&quot; my/var) or similar.

 I am a noob to emacs and a long-time Ach user(btw)!
 I mainly programme in python and need to get my head around how to have on the fly comments for errors in my code. Some of the info on the net seems old, like the need to install Melpa... Also, can&#x27;t seem to be able to install or maybe need flycheck (as flymake seems to do a fine job but not on the go)...
 Any advice?
 Thanks very much 😊

 https://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/pretest/windows/emacs-29/?C&#x3D;M;O&#x3D;D
 The new (emacs-29.0.60_2) files install/contain/are for 29.0.60, which will become 29.1 once released. (At some point in-between we&#x27;ll most likey get get at 29.0.90, signaling that we&#x27;re getting pretty close to official release of the first Emacs 29 as stable.)
 Anyway, please note there&#x27;s a new deps (and deps-src) archive as the set of DLLs provided now includes libtree-sitter.dll and libsqlite3.dll. This version is also (the first) built with --with-tree-sitter. Here are more complete configure and make recipes:
 ./autogen.sh &amp;&amp; ./configure --with-modules \ --without-dbus \ --with-native-compilation \ --without-compress-install \ --with-tree-sitter \ CFLAGS&#x3D;-O2 \ &amp;&amp; make install -j 20 NATIVE_FULL_AOT&#x3D;1

                              <span>Is there a possible way to disable input temporarily from keyboard in Emacs, to prevent what that I most of the time mistype unintendedly from keyboard?
 In Zim, I bound the action &quot;toggle_editable&quot; to &quot;Ctrl+&#x60;&quot;, so each time before I switch to doing other stuff or other worskpaces, I press this keybinding to turn off edition in Zim, and when I come back, I press it again to turn it back. It prevents me from mistyping in Zim, and lately using Ctrl+z to revert the changes can be prevented, it&#x27;s quite annoying.

                              <span>Hi guys! Trying to use magit to create a single patch file from a range of commits --the contents of my feature branch. 
 I did this yesterday! So i know its possible, &amp; not rocket science. Yesterday I made a patch file like this, with a nice auto-generated file name.
 0001-Add-fubar-to-whizbang.patch
 When I try and use Magit today to do the same with a different range, I end up with either a) multiple patch files, or b) a prompt for a filename for the patch file to be produced. Which is a sign I&#x27;m on the wrong track, because I did NOT choose the above filename yesterday.
 Can you advise?
 Thank you!

                              <span>Hi folks, I was wondering if emacs provides a canvas mode (something like obsidians new canvas mode) which allows you to have notes on notecards which can then be visually rearranged?

                              <span>This may be obvious to some of you, but I came across this just today, so wanted to lay this out clearly in case it helps others.
 git log has a mechanism to trace evolution of lines across commits - think of this as an even more fine grained version of seeing log for a single file. This &quot;-L&quot; arg in git takes the form of -L,: to restrict to certain line numbers or -L:: to restrict to a particular function. Magit has the &quot;-L&quot; infix argument to use this directly - but this interface makes you do the manual work of feeding in the input.
 Instead, you can use the direct options available in magit-file-dispatch bound to C-c M-g by default. To trace functions, use the t command (trace) to trace the function under cursor. To trace particular lines - mark region and then call C-c M-g l to see the commit history only for those lines.
 This last command is basically (magit-log-buffer-file) which you can bind directly to something more easy to use. If you use evil, something like the following will make this much easier to use:
 (define-key evil-visual-state-map (kbd &quot;;gl&quot;) &#x27;magit-log-buffer-file)

                              <span>Hello! I just started using emacs 29 with treesitter. 
 I wanted to write a function that I could use to highlight keywords like TODO, FIXME etc. in code comments using treesitter. 
 I know there is a package &#x60;hl-todo&#x60; that I can just import. But the package contains a lot more than I actually need. 
 I also wanted to get familiar with emacs font-lock, font-faces and treesitter. But the documentation for the treesitter used by emacs seems a bit spotty. I&#x27;d be grateful if someone could point me in the right direction here. I would also be grateful if anyone could tell me if treesitter is actually a good fit for this or not.
 The high-level plan was to make a query to treesitter to get all &#x60;comment&#x60; nodes and then search the text in the nodes to see if there are any keywords that need to be highlighted (it would be great if there is a query that could just return those keywords, but I couldn&#x27;t find such a query). But I&#x27;m not quite sure how to proceed from there. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!

 This is probably a question that&#x27;s been asked before, but i thought i&#x27;d get some fresh opinions.
 ​
 If you were to build a new emacs-type repl/editor, what would you differently?
 ​
 For example, I wouldn&#x27;t mind a more feature rich approach to what can be displayed. Treating everything as text in buffers is great, but I would love to write and quickly pull out my pen to draw a graph. (This was inspired by the recent post on editor engines)
 ​
 Subtle improvements are cool, but i want to know what you would do to radically alter the paradigm of how you interact with emacs.
 ​
 Best,
 Skye

 If you are familiar with org-modern, this package approximates the block &quot;bracket&quot; style of that mode, but it works with org-indent. It can be used with or without org-modern.
 This new version is a complete rewrite, and uses font-locking instead of deep hacking of org-indent itself. This enables styling of &quot;bulk-indented&quot; blocks with extra indentation, e.g. inside nested lists, and works well with org-src-block-faces.

 Then the keybinding will be (in general.el speak), something like:  &quot;D&quot; &#x27;(project-dired-ow :wk &quot;dired ow&quot;) 
 This, however, fails miserably :( I&#x27;ve tried lambda-based variations as well, but nothing seems to work. Been trying for almost an hour, and no dice. Any tips would be awesome, thank you !

I&#x27;ve really struggled with creating a template that helps me with work during my on-call shifts and I was hoping anyone might have some examples they&#x27;d be willing to share with me.
 I&#x27;ve recently started using the org-clock feature and adding notes to the currently clocked task. That&#x27;s been a huge help for me in capturing my thoughts and notes when I&#x27;m trying to investigate an issue with my brain at half-capacity after being woken up at 3 in the morning from a page (smh at you mongodb...). However, I am still having trouble getting everything started and then at the end of my shift (they last a full week, or 7 days) I have a large list of items (rather than headings) that I need to basically r…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m rebuilding my doom/custom agenda, and I&#x27;ve discovered: agenda* works much better than agenda for me.
 But when I try to built it into a block agenda, it stops work.
  (setq org-agenda-custom-commands &#x27;((&quot;A&quot; &quot;Appointments&quot; agenda* &quot;&quot;) (&quot;B&quot; &quot;Appointments + todo&quot; ((agenda* &quot;&quot;) (alltodo &quot;&quot;))) (&quot;C&quot; &quot;Agenda + todo&quot; ((agenda &quot;&quot;) (alltodo &quot;&quot;))) )) 
 “A” and “C” works perfect, but “B” one produces
  Wrong type argument: number-or-marker-p, nil Debugger entered--Lisp error: (wrong-type-argument number-or-marker-p nil) org-agenda-list(nil nil t) #f(compiled-function () #)() funcall(#f(compiled-function () #)) (let nil (funcall &#x27;#f(compiled-function () #))) eval((let nil (funcall &#x27;#f(compiled-function () #)))) org-agenda-run-series(&quot;Appointments + todo&quot; (((agenda* &quot;&quot;) (alltodo &quot;&quot;)))) org-agenda(nil) funcall-interactively(org-agenda nil) call-interactively(org-agenda nil nil) command-execute(org-agenda) 
 I could emulate agenda* with the simple agenda and a couple of filters but why?

                              <span>According to the documentation, you can make the exported HTML foldable.
 However, when I tried adding 
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 +INFOJS_OPT: view:info toc:nil
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 I found that although the document exported indeed simulates info files, when I toggled views, I can&#x27;t fold headlines. However, folding is indeed possible in the documentation of org-info.
 In the org-info-src.js file, the portion intended to locate the content under a headline is
  var folder &#x3D; document.getElementById(&quot;text-&quot;+t.BASE_ID); 
 where t.BASE_ID is the id attribute of the exported HTML file, e.g. org16a9dc9.
 However, there is no element with the id text-org16a9dc9 - possibly due to some change in Org Mode exporting schemes since 2010, when the script was supposedly last updated.
 Therefore, a small modification is required to make folding possible.
 I fixed folding by changing the above line to: (pardon my poor JavaScript skills)
  var folder &#x3D; t.BASE_ID ? document.getElementById(&quot;outline-container-&quot; + t.BASE_ID).querySelector(&quot;div:nth-child(2)&quot;) : null;

                              <span>A fascinating combination of office furniture types in 1906! 

The Adjustable Table Company of Grand Rapids, Michigan manufactured a combination table for both telephones and index cards. It was designed as an accessory to be stood next to one&#x27;s desk to accommodate a telephone at the beginning of the telephone era and also served as storage for one&#x27;s card index.
Given the broad business-based use of the card index at the time and the newness of the telephone, this piece of furniture likely was not designed as an early proto-rolodex, though it certainly could have been (and very well may have likely been) used as such in practice.
I totally want one of these as a side table for my couch/reading chair for both storing index cards and as a writing surface while reading! Bonus points for wheels that allow it to travel around the house.
As seen in:

                              <span>I&#x27;m using emacs 28.1 on Ubuntu. 
 After a recent reboot, I can continue to launch emacs in daemon mode. But I can&#x27;t connect with the client. 
  
When I do &#x27;emacsclient -c file.txt&#x27;, I get this back: 
 emacsclient: can&#x27;t connect to /run/user/1000/emacs/server: Permission denied 
 emacsclient: No socket or alternate editor. Please use: 
 --socket-name 
 --server-file (or environment variable EMACS_SERVER_FILE) 
 --alternate-editor (or environment variable ALTERNATE_EDITOR)
  
I&#x27;ve also noticed that the response to the command &#x27;emacs --daemon&#x27; is different as well. 
 Before my reboot, entering that command would result in some output and then the prompt returning. At the moment the prompt does not return. 
 But emacs is definitely running. If I do &#x27;ps auxw | grep emacs&#x27; then I can see an emacs process. 
 What could be happening here? How do I get my emacs client/server back?

                              <span>I&#x27;m new to Emacs and Org Mode and I just feel I&#x27;m doing something wrong. I take notes in bullet form exclusively, as a stream of consciousness. Some bullets I want to mark as TODOs. But only headlines can be TODOs, so I switched from everything-bullets to everything-headlines.
 But it seems the Emacs defaults don&#x27;t expect me to have dozens of levels of headlines deep; I need to adjust things like &#x60;org-refile-targets&#x60; to look deeper than 9 levels, and exporting to HTML gives me a bunch of ugly headings instead of bulleted lists.
 It really feels like I&#x27;m supposed to be using bullets or paragraphs, but I can&#x27;t see how I can easily throw a TODO here or there in either of those formats.
 What am I doing wrong?

                              <span>From my point of view, both Doom and Lunarvim are really good. Now, there are really two major differences because I need to debug remotely.
 For Doom
 I launch in emacsclient through mobaXterm with server X. It is really good to have the GUI and to do copy/paste easily on Windows system. But debugging is difficult. I tried Dap mode with vscode-cpptool, gdb, also realgud-gdb. But it is painful with slowness. I don&#x27;t know if using another tool that mobaXterm as for example Kitty could solve this slowness debbuging issue. I could use emacs in terminal but I would have the same that follow with Lunarvim.
 For Lunarvim
 I can launch it directly with mobaXterm. It is fast and debugging is good and fast too(dap or termdug). But all copy/paste is painfull because it is needed to use particular shortcut of maboXterm and it is not window related.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve got eglot set up with clangd, and i found the automatic documentation popups to be really distracting. so i customized &#x60;eglot-ignored-server-capabilities&#x60; with &#x60; (:hoverProvider)&#x60;, and now it stays out of my way.
 Now, if i do &#x60;C-h .&#x60; to get documentation at point, i get a blank minibuffer -- no actual documentation. has anybody seen this issue before? am i doing something wrong?

                              <span>My config is large and it pulls in, quite a few packages. With some packages, I wonder what parts of my config require those packages. So for debugging purposes, I figured, it would be useful to get dropped into the elisp debugger, when a certain package is loaded, required, etc..
 Question: Is there an (preferably easy) way to achieve that?
 An naive approach, early in my init.el, like:
  (defun my-drop-into-dbg-onto-require (feature &amp;optional filename noerror) (when (string-search (symbol-name &#x27;vimish-fold) (symbol-name feature)) (debug))) (advice-add &#x27;require :before #&#x27;my-drop-into-dbg-onto-require) (defun my-drop-into-dbg-onto-load (file &amp;optional noerror nomessage nosuffix must-suffix) (when (string-search &quot;vimish-fold&quot; file) (debug))) (advice-add &#x27;load :before #&#x27;my-drop-into-dbg-onto-load) 
 did not work out. 
 Notes: &quot;vimish-fold&quot; used in above code is just an example, I could have used another package name for this example. Also: bisecting my config can only be the very last resort.

 I am using neovim nowadays and want to try out Emacs. I tried Doom Emacs few months ago but I want vanilla experience and wants to build my own config. Would be grateful if you guys can share beginner friendly Emacs config as I learn by watching other people&#x27;s code and can&#x27;t focus on videos.

                              <span>Hello,
 I&#x27;m begin to using vterm for my daily work, but i have some questions about his behavior.
 When i want to copy some text, i&#x27;m ok to enter vterm-copy-mode , select , copy.
 But when i want to use the mouse to select, I don&#x27;t want to enter vterm-copy-mode with the keyboard before selecting with the mouse.
 ​
 Have you some ideas ? like maybe enter directly in copy-mode when i click for begin the selection ?
 Someone have some tips for configuration vterm to behave more like a normal terminal, or tmux behavior ?
 ​
 Thank you !

                              <span>Hey everyone, I&#x27;m wondering how to reimplement one of my yasnippet snippets in TempEL, but struggling with the following scenario (I didn&#x27;t find an issue, but don&#x27;t want to ping minad if I might just have overlooked or misunderstood it in the readme):
 In Haskell, I often write things of the form
 haskell newtype FooBar &#x3D; FooBar { unFooBar :: String } 
 In a snippet, I&#x27;d like to enter the FooBar once right after newtype and have it be the default value for the subsequent places. But I also want the 2nd and 3rd FooBar to be a &quot;stop&quot; where I can enter a different value.
 When using (s name) for the first, and name for the others, they get skipped. When using (s name) for the others as well, all three change simultaneously. So I tried using the form variants of (p ...), but to no avail.
 Here&#x27;s what I currently use, but it lacks the possibility to change locally:
 lisp (nt &quot;newtype &quot; (s name) &quot; &#x3D; &quot; name &quot; { un&quot; name &quot; :: &quot; p &quot; }&quot;) 
 Can you help me? [Ideally, I&#x27;d like to actually change the whole unFooBar in the third place, but that&#x27;s probably the same problem in disguise, just that the default value is calculated by a form.]

                              <span>Hey there,
 Does anyone know how to configure eyebrowse so that when a project is opened, the first &quot;window&quot; would be treemacz with a code buffer, while the next window layout would be two vterm frames split horizontally?
 ​
 An even better thing would be for the one vterm window to run &quot;rails s&quot; and the othe one to run &quot;npm start --prefix client&quot;
 ​
 I do this a ton for React and Rails projects so I figured I might make my life easier with this. Any help would be awesome.
 ​
 Thanks!

 Here&#x27;s a related screenshot:
 https://ibb.co/k5d9b85
 Can anyone tell me how I can adjust a theme I am creating so that the grey face on line 27 in the mini-buffer, aka that grey background highlight color?
 Also, how do I adjust the related match colors within the mini buffer as well?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hello, Is it okay to add an ID attribute to all headlines such as contacts, notes, and bookmarks?
 contacts.org
 * Contact Name :PROPERTIES: :ID: 20230310T141204 :PHONE: :ADDRESS: etc.. :END: * Contact Name :PROPERTIES: :ID: 20230310T141506 :PHONE: :ADDRESS: etc.. :END: 
 bookmarks.org
 * [[http://a-link.com][Bookmark1]] :PROPERTIES: :ID: 20230310T231302 etc.. :END: 
 Also, notice that I am using a YYMMDDTHHMMSS timestamp for IDs, similar to what the Denote package uses in its file naming scheme. Is that OK for an ID? I know there is an org function to generate a random hash but I think a timestamp is more readable.

                              <span>I have been looking for a good way to get hand drawn images into my org notes. I use mermaid for generating some flowcharts/images, but sometimes there is no replacement for a physical drawing. The last thread I saw on this was from 2 years ago, and org-mark and org-krita were mentioned, and look good but both have limitations. I was wondering if anyone has made/found other packages to get a hand-drawn image work flow with org?

I have a coordinate and possible values for that coordinate. &quot;1 and 2 are possible at (1,1)&quot; would look like (1,1,[1,2]).

 [(1, 1, [1, 2]), (1, 2, [3, 4])]

It has many features, including shuffling and playing categories of music; setting timers I can control; setting goals I can meet or fail on stream; controls via a one-handed keyboard I use like a Stream Deck (referred to in code as the &quot;MacroBoard&quot;, which is probably inaccurate); playing sounds and overlays when certain rewards are redeemed by viewers; and a lot more. https://bitbucket.org/Variadicism/variadassist-web-player
 But, this Haskell program commits what I know is a cardinal sin of Haskell: It has a bunch of mutable global state.
 I didn&#x27;t make that design decision lightly; I know that global mutable variables are revile…</span>

 I will write a small web application and I thought to learn a new thing is good :)
 So what is you advice for a web ui framework. Purescript-halogen/reflex/miso/ ?
 I have big experience with typescript + angular.
 The purescript-halogen seemed the best for me because I don&#x27;t want to struggle with the &#x27;nix, ghcjs&#x27; build/environment.
 What do you think ?

                              <span>When great speakers are banned from conferences just because they are uncomfortable it’s not good. People have different opinions about the future direction of Scala but it’s so infected. It’s better to be inclusive and allow people with different opinions. But I guess today’s cancel culture has won. But it hurts the Scala community especially when it really needs to show a good light. Java is becoming much better and heaps of developers are adopting Kotlin and TypeScript.
 Scala 3 is such a great language and it’s such a shame that things like this destroys the image of the Scala community.
 I work as a software architect and have great influence over technical choices. I take lots of factors in to consideration when technologies are chosen. Community is one of them. 
 Let people have different opinions and don’t cancel people just because you don’t agree with them. Try to set the bar high and don’t let feelings control you or your organisation.

 override val F: Functor[E &#x3D;&gt; *] &#x3D; EF 
 I can&#x27;t find any information online on what [E &#x3D;&gt; *] might mean, and how [E &#x3D;&gt; *] is valid for [F[_]]. It won&#x27;t compile when I try to do it myself.
 Anyone here happen to know?

                              <span>It&#x27;s Thursday, and here we go again. I&#x27;m telling you what I&#x27;m working on to inspire you to tell me what you worked on.
This week I practiced my onboarding of an idea spark into my ZK. For 6 of the ten new notes this week, I used the following workflow to get ideas for the stages they are at. Practice exposed a few gaps in my workflow, and I was able to correct them and practice more. The formatting and some of the housekeeping became automated and easy to complete making time for the fun of considering the idea&#x27;s connection.
This is not the only workflow I use, but the one I used several times this week. Books, PDFs, lectures, and YouTube videos are treated differently. Web articles sparked all six of these notes I&#x27;m describing.

                              <span>Topiary aims to be a universal formatter engine within the
Tree-sitter ecosystem. Named after the art of clipping or trimming
trees into fantastic shapes, it is designed for formatter authors and
formatter users:
Authors can create a formatter for a language without having to write
their own formatting engine, or even their own parser.
Users benefit from uniform, comparable code style, across multiple
languages, with the convenience of a single formatter
tool.
The core of Topiary is written in Rust, with declarative formatting
rules for bundled languages written in the Tree-sitter query
language. In this first release, we have
concentrated on formatting OCaml code, capitalising on the OCaml
expertise within the Topiary Team and our colleague, Nicolas Jeannerod.

 Hello guys I made a devicons theme for treemacs. This is inspired by nvim-web-devicons and vim-devicons. Here are some screenshots:
 treemacs-devicons in GUI
 treemacs-devicons in terminal
 Motivation: I have been using Emacs for years but I never really sit down and wrote any serious elisp code myself. This time things changed because I saw the nvim-web-devicons. I like trying various kinds of editors, and then I found this devicons from vim editor. I really like it especially because it works in the terminal. People always say Emacs is best within GUI but there are times when you have to edit something in a terminal and maybe some like me just like terminal aesthetics. I mean I really like this devicons theme from vim but I never really liked vim keybindings. I want it to be part of Emacs so bad so I finally decided to learn some elisp and make it happen.
 This is my first emacs package so please give it a try and provide some feedbacks!

 I want to change my LaTeX demarcation symbols from $$ $$ to [$$] [/$$]. This is to make my TeX cross-compatible with Anki.
 How can I do this?

 I do not find any provided function with dir/path argument.

                              <span>attached is a photo of buttons above the left and right arrows of my keyboard.
 I use exwm and I&#x27;m able to switch between emacs specific buffers (emacs&#x27;s shell, text editing buffer, scratch buffer) using the keys in the photo, but once I switch to a firefox or a another non emacs application these specific keys lose that ability to switch buffer and instead manipulate the firefox application is my best guess.
 My question is how to I make it that these keys retain the functionality they have when focusing on emacs specific buffers so when I&#x27;m in a fire fox buffer I&#x27;m able to switch to another using these keys.
 ​
 Thanks!
 keys above left and right arrows

                              <span>Dear community,
 who is willing to share their LaTeX setup with the rest of us so that we may get inspired?
 I am in the process of migrating to emacs but still cannot wrap my head around the correct setup for my LaTeX documents. I have been using LaTeX for years and would like to have full control over it while on the other hand profiting from the power of org-mode.
 So I decided to go with org-files for organising my projects (articles, books, worksheets, ...) and use blocks of LaTeX source code inside these documents that I then tangle to a TeX file and run luaLaTeX from the terminal on. While reading that, an emacs power user will probably turn pale, but that&#x27;s the way I do it for now since I am lacking a better alternative. So I am looking forward to your setups!
 As a beginner I resorted to (the for me very likable) DOOM Emacs with latex option (should include auctex and a sane company setup).

 I am struggling with exporting org-mode file to LaTeX. Org-mode exporter is adding this line to the TeX file:
  \usepackage[notquote]{hanging} 
 resulting in the error:
 &#x60;&#x60; ! LaTeX Error: Filehanging.sty&#x27; not found.
 Type X to quit or  to proceed, or enter new name. (Default extension: sty)
 Enter file name: ! Emergency stop.  
 l.29 \begin {document}M No pages of output. Transcript written on ./inspecciones.log. Latexmk: Missing input file: &#x27;hanging.sty&#x27; from line &#x27;! LaTeX Error: File hanging.sty&#x27; not found.&#x27; Latexmk: Log file says no output from latex Latexmk: For rule &#x27;xelatex&#x27;, no output was made &#x60;&#x60;
 Any idea how to remove that line?
 I already try to redefine a class using: 
  [NO-DEFAULT-PACKAGES] [NO-PACKAGES] [NO-EXTRA] 
 But is not working. Any ideas?

                              <span>I have a sufficiently idiosyncratic use-case that I think it is not worth annoying the various maintainers, so I thought I would ask here:
 I primarily use rmarkdown/polymode for school; but increasingly find myself using it for bash/python/ielm/etc in a fashion I imagine advanced org-ob users would find quaint.
 In order to keep the various modes consistent, I bound shift-ret to all of the various shell-send variants, including &#x27;elpy-shell-send-statement-and-step for python blocks. Most of the time this works perfectly, but on a significant number of occasions the statement sent to the REPL breaks out and includes a significant portion of my markdown ramblings, other blocks, etc. This of course leads the python interpreter to question my sanity.
 My question: I assume the problem lies in one of the various regexps used to define a statement/codecell/line; but I have not figured how to trace what is happening and where it is going wrong. Does anyone here have suggestions for how I might best play with these interactions?

                              <span>I use the orderless style with consult/corfu mainly, but I get the feeling I have some suboptimal patterns habitualized.
 I thought it might be interesting to:
  
see the completion styles others find most effective and/or nicest to use
 see how other consult/orderless users may do completions differently
  
For instance, say you need to type provide. Three are a few options that immediately come to mind assuming orderless completion:
  
Just type it
 prov M-i RET
 ( p M-i r v RET
  
I guess you could say I&#x27;m curious to see what patterns others default to and where they just type something versus completing it.
 If I want to type propertized-buffer-identification for instance, I&#x27;d almost certainly use autocomplete with one of:
  
( p M-i buf i RET
 ( p M-i iden RET
  
Then I think and wonder &quot;wouldn&#x27;t flex be more convenient for this? So I switch to it and my first attempt is:
  
( pbident M-i RET
  
I guess most efficiency is dominated here not by selecting optimal strategies, but muscle memory and aligning your and your completion systems intuition... but I&#x27;m curious to see others examples and opinions!

 Is there a better way?

 I recently decided to try switching to more built-in options such as the new built-in org-cite syntax. I am using the package citar for this (yes, I know org-ref can also be changed to use the new built-in syntax). 
 But how do I handle cross-reference suggestions? i.e. referencing a Table or a Figure using \ref{} in LaTeX. Org Mode has support for linking to these but I would like a package that suggests items in the document I can link to using the Org link syntax.
 Org ref supports linking but using its own syntax and not the org-mode one. 
 I found the package oxr from the author of citar which does this but it does not seem to have active development.
 ​
 Any suggestions welcome!

                              <span>Hello there,
 Ive recently gone back to emacs and tried to actually learn it. At first i was using doom emacs, i made a config for it, alls good. Then i tried to open up a project and start coding and i ran into all kinds of issues ranging from lsp not initializing to tab indentation being 2 spaces insted of 4 in half of the modes and completions not heaving any relevant suggestions. So then i switched to spacemacs because i thaught that it had better support for rust and was better integrated. Turns out it was a similar story, completions sucked lsp half of the time didnt initialize and i had to explicitly enable it with M-x lsp every time i opened a project. 
 Its now the third day that im just tinkering with emacs and i didn&#x27;t solve any of the issues listed above.
 Is emacs just bad developer experiance? Am i missing something? Am i just dumb and its a simple solution?
 I want to love emacs, but its making it real hard to do it.
 note: the lsp issue i could maybe live with, but the completions and indentation issues are really bad. A specific case when the completions are the worst at is for example somstructvar. or when importing (rust example use somemod::), the indentation is bad mainly in js/ts (rjsx) and json

Let&#x27;s say I want both the hover listing possible auto-complete and the information about the function to appear for elisp, both in, e.g., *scratch* and especially in org-mode babel elisp code blocks. I&#x27;ve found various init setups (like this one) and I think I have it working in just a scratch buffer, but how can I get it to work in an org babel code block of elisp code?

 Finally switched to vanilla from doom-emacs, in order to try out meow.
 Most of my immediate needs are sorted out, but still working on it. I am trying to get away from needing a project source-tree sidebar, but there are some scenarios where I am really missing it.
 I tried installing treemacs, but it doesn&#x27;t show up in my &#x27;package-install&#x27; list. Am I making some kind of trivial mistake, or is this a case where I would have to manually install the script?
 EDIT: resolved by ensuring that the melpa repo was added.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been using Org-Mode for 10 years. The more time passes, the more Org-Mode takes an important place in my digital world.
 Now I would like to start using zettelkasten to manage a subset of my org files, a subset related to knowledge self-acquisition.
 The issue that I have is that there are many options to do that, and I wasn&#x27;t able to find a benchmark.
 What would be your opinion on these options?
 Here is a first draft of a benchmark (to be updated):
 - DBI : Database indexation
 - SD : Availability of sub directories
 - NSO : Notes stored as org files
 - Speed when searching for notes : from @ (slowest) to @@@@@ (fastest)
 ​
  
 Package name DBI ASD SAO speed 
  
 denote no yes yes @@@@@ 
  org-roam yes    
  zk no    
  ekg yes  no  
  org-zettelkasten no

                              <span>I just watched a terrific video on FP in Scala and why it&#x27;s important. It echoes exactly what I was seeing in languages like ML, OCaML, and Haskell in the 1990s, what I hoped for procedural languages, and what Scala has become on the FP side.
 What did Functional Programming ever do for us software engineers? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;glDudJ3fqLk time: 00:52:26
 I think this video helps explain significant differences between some of the popular languages and why there has been a trend toward FP-type language capabilities and it distinguishes very well between those a typical programmer might want to use and where to leave off from those a library writer might need.
 He uses Scala for examples throughout, so it&#x27;s very familiar. My only complaint is that the sound volume is too low. For anyone wondering why we need FP features or what key language features allow us to do, this is a great introduction.

                              <span>Is there any way I can get (at runtime) a type tree (fields names and singatures) of defined (and possibly nested) entities like classes, traits, enums etc? The important part is that I want to establish the tree based on a definition of the type, not its concrete objects.

                              <span>I am not new to Haskell, but I found myself today torn between putting &#x60;get&#x60; in front of a function vs not doing it, and was hoping for some advice.
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; defaultDbUser :: String defaultDbUser &#x3D; &quot;defUser&quot;
 getDbName :: String -&gt; String getDbName appName &#x3D; appName  &quot;-db&quot; &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Here I didn&#x27;t put get in front of defaultDbUser, because it is not a function but a value, and that feels ok.
 For the second function, getDbName, I put get in front because it takes some inputs and then returns &quot;db name&quot;.
 This is where I am not sure if this is correct move. I am tempted to call it just dbName :: String -&gt; String, because get feels Java-ish. But, from experience, if I go with just dbName, I later get into trouble, for example when I want to call the function and store its value, something like let dbName &#x3D; getDbName appName, I would have a very hard time figuring out a name for that binding if I called the function dbName and not getDbName.
 So it feels like getDbName is reasonable, but then again, I can&#x27;t say I am fond of it very much -&gt; I don&#x27;t have a better idea though.
 What would you do in this case? Would you use dbName or getDbName? If not, why not? Would you maybe put something else?
 Btw, I do put verbs in general, but with most of the other verbs it is clear they should go there, beacuse you are doing some parsing, calculating, migrating, ... . But with get it somehow feels a bit tedious.
 Thanks!

                              <span>I&#x27;m learning Haskell, coming from the APL family. I&#x27;m familiar with point-free style and function composition and wanted to learn Haskell for a more pure functional experience.
 To get some practice i figured I&#x27;d write up the dot product and vector product functions. I haven&#x27;t begun looking at the vector product, but for dot product I quickly came to
 dot a b &#x3D; sum $ zipWith (*) a b 
 After toying around with composition (the B-combinator .), I couldn&#x27;t get it to work. I looked up the tacit solution in pointfree.io, and it gave me the short and sweet
 dot &#x3D; (sum .) . zipWith (*) 
 Now here&#x27;s my question: how is (sum .) supposed to work? I don&#x27;t get where the arguments implicitly go or how this makes syntactically sense. What is the order of operations?

 It should support Android 8+/API 26+ (the currently released version supports Android 10+/API 29+), but we only tested on 9 so far - so please let us know if you try it on 8, and also about any issues you experience.
 We did fix several limitations of lower android versions we could find, and we could not find any 32bit CPU-specific issues.
 It&#x27;s reasonable to expect bugs, but unless we hit some roadblocks it should be fully available in the next release this month!

                              <span>What is scala&#x27;s modern Web API framework?
 I like frameworks like nest.js in node.js where engineers are used to the framework.
 Is there a modern framework in Scala that is as binding as nest?
 And which is the most modern framework to begin with?

                              <span>Hello there,
 Another maybe rookie question but I am looking for having error from lsp positionned in the current buffer.
 I am using again whatever emacs + lsp + rust-analyzer, and it seems that the error decoration is not as verbose as it is in VSCode.
 I uploaded 3 images with context that should explain more what I am expected to get. Example are really simple but I face similar things elsewhere ...
 Expected behavior (VSCode)
 Not enough dude! Please tell me more (Emacs)
 Working behavior on some error (Emacs)
 Thanks again people!

                              <span>Is there some emacs function out there already that will bring me to the line a variable is declared on? For example: 
  void fooFunc(void) { int foo; ... ... x &#x3D; foo+1; // with cursor over foo, I would like to go to the previous int foo; line. } 
 I&#x27;m interested in using this for c code. I&#x27;m currently using GNU global which lets me do a symbol search, but, that&#x27;s not quite good enough.

                              <span>I&#x27;m new to emacs so please be kind. When I&#x27;m editing a file (for example a cpp file) and I want to access to a terminal, I enable eshell-mode but the problem is that is opens eshell in the current buffer, mixes the shell output with my file and makes the buffer unusable. So if I want to edit the file again, I have to close the buffer, then find the file again. And when I execute eshell-mode again to disable it, it has no effect as it looks like it opens another shell in the eshell. Also when I press C-d, it terminates the shell but it doesn&#x27;t return to my file. Js there a way to disable eshell mode so I don&#x27;t have to kill my buffer and open the file again? And how can I open eshell in a new buffer by default?

Philosophy papers often include a lot of specialise language and long, difficult-to-spell terms, which have to be typed out a lot. It would be great if I could add abbrevs for these terms, but such that they would only take effect in buffers visiting files relative to each paper -- so I want to setup file-local or dir-local abbrevs.
 I can&#x27;t find a way to do this though. Any ideas?

 Hello, everyone!
 Been new to emacs, have struggled to initially use it, one thing I missed alot from vim editors is hopping/jumping support. Options like avy &amp; ace-jump-mode didn&#x27;t seem very appealing due to various reasons written in the project readme itself. Hence I started writing my own plugin taking inspiration from hop.nvim and avy.el. And here we are!
 Note that there are still a few nitpicks mentioned at the bottom of the readme. Therefore, if anyone wishes to make improvements, including addressing those nitpicks or elsewhere (I&#x27;m new to elisp, so may not have written the most optimal script), they are more than welcome to do so.
 Thank you!

 In e.g table: when I click on row with &#x27;-&gt;&#x27; it will expand with code snippet.
 Is there any functionality/package that have this functionality already?
 If not how to start making it?

 I want to start from scratch and can&#x27;t find the command associated with C-x, it is a keymap? I know how to create a sparse keymap but how can I keybind it?
 I&#x27;d like to write my own elisp code for stuff I need starting with the bare minimum.

                              <span>So i&#x27;ve been using LunarVim for a few months now and the experience has been pretty good so far, but someone suggested trying emacs. Some features are pretty interesting but what really caught my eye was the org mode. So, do you think it&#x27;s worth a try or should i just search for a simular plugin in neovim?

                              <span>Hey there,
 I am adding kanban style notes to a web dev project I am working on, but am wondering if the following is possible:
  
Is it possible to somehow generate an Org mode table that lists all of the tasks in a given subheading with their task state as the column header for a given Kanban board swim lane?
  
Ex:
  
I have the following Org Mode headings present 
 Backlog
 In Progress
 In Review
 Completed
 
 With this in mind, I want to be able to do that when I move tasks between these 4 headings, they would show up under a related ASCII table hyperlinked to the task itself so that it looks in a similar fashion to how Jira tickets on a Kanban board would look like
  
Thanks!

                              <span>Hello there,
 Does anyone have an Emacs config that they could share that allows for IDE-like indentation on the fly, kind of like how VS Code handles projects with the following formats:
  
JSX
 Typescript
 React
 Angular
 Vanilla JS
  
​
 I don&#x27;t want to have to save the file every time I want this (aka I do NOT want to use Prettier). 
 I want this to just happen like it does in VS Code where indentation of code happens on the fly and correctly marks just a few spots for syntax errors.
 In the past, every time I have tried to configure Emacs for indentation, it messes up the whole file to cause a jenky mess of badly indented web dev type code, when it should only really be concerned with the current block you&#x27;re editing etc.
 Thanks!

                              <span>haskell-scope-highlighting.nvim is a Neovim plugin that does syntax highlighting for Haskell, which provides useful information about the variable scope.
 The original idea is from prof. Douglas Crockford, that he wants syntax highlighting to provide contextual information in functional programming. This idea has been expanded to provide dynamic highlighting under the cursor&#x27;s scope in Haskell.

                              <span>For the past months, I&#x27;ve been chasing down mysterious memory leaks in some of our services. But the graphs have baffled me a little bit (https://i.imgur.com/YguM1GA.png). And I have a few questions. 
 This particular service is compiled with GHC 8.6.5 (old, I know, but we have a large codebase we need to upgrade). It is an API service that deals with Postgres (using Opaleye), Redis (using Hedis) and serves data on a Servant based Wai/Warp HTTP server. The service is quite busy, serving in the range thousands of requests per minute (conservative). 
 The pattern of memory use looks very odd to me: it hovers around 10-20% for several days, and then it jumps to 60%+ percent. The service still doesn&#x27;t completely crash, but it seems to me that the memory use spikes out of nowhere and fails to fall. There are sudden falls, but that is due to AWS starting multiple instances of the service (auto-scaling). 
 The memory spikes also seem to occur on identical traffic patterns. 
 My questions here are:
  
Does this look like a memory leak? I&#x27;ve read previously that GC is not very &quot;eager&quot; unless tuned.
 If it does, what are the best ways to catch these early? These are quite problemmatic, obviously, and I&#x27;ve been hunting around for weeks without any success. 
 I have tried profiling to investigate leaks earlier, but in this case, I&#x27;ve been unable to reproduce the issue locally or on our staging environment.

 I believe it would be nice to have that coloring, that it would make it easier to read docs -&gt; any suggestions on where to look in order to add this? I am guessing some kind of contribution is needed somewhere to get that working? Is this something that could be done relatively easily, or is there a technical reason why it is difficult?
 EDIT: I think I was a bit quick to ask, as I think I have found a relevant issue on Haddock, I am guessing this is at the core of it: https://github.com/haskell/haddock/issues/742 , so I ended up asking a question there. I will leave this thread open though in case there might be some interesting discussion.

                              <span>Dear all,
 I&#x27;m happy to announce the release of Dunai 0.10.1 and Bearriver 0.14.1!
 Dunai is a reactive programming library structured around a notion of Monadic Stream Functions. Dunai can be used to implement other reactive and FRP frameworks on top, including Classic FRP and Arrowized FRP variants.
 Dunai comes with:
  
bearriver: API-compatible implementation of Yampa. (The Bear River is a tributary to the Yampa river.)
 dunai-test: QuickCheck-based temporal testing library that can be connected with the testing system haskell-titan.
  
See https://github.com/ivanperez-keera/dunai#features for details on Dunai&#x27;s features.
 This new release introduces a breaking change in Monadic Stream Functions&#x27; instance of VectorSpaces. Most code using that instance should work without changes but, i…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;ve noticed that many packages and libraries developed for emacs ar stored entirely in one huge file. For example I was just checking out the mpc source code and found out that it is a 2000+ lines file.
 Is this a normal and accepted practice? I&#x27;ve never coded professionally in lisp based languages, but from my experience I always try to make my files no more than 100 or 200 lines long at most. Otheriwise it gets hard to navigate the code in my opinion.
 Maybe in elisp this isn&#x27;t as bad of a practice? Are there ways in emacs that can help work with long files that I&#x27;m not aware of?

                              <span>Hello there,
 Back again to use Emacs to do some Rust with LSP and I find myself not enjoying at all some part.
 One thing I so much dislike is the way completion is working.
 I am using spacemacs: vim mode, evil blabla, auto-complete &amp; LSP
 And yes you have completion if you add some letters but I cannot see a way to trigger the famous popup of completion listing all possible function without typing a letter ... so unfortunately on complicated code I have to delete letter and add other.
 What a mess! In VSCode I would do Ctrl+Spc for triggering the popup. But here I really do not know how to achieve that, mostly also that I am at this stage in Edit mode.
 I am not expecting this to be rocket science but reading the doc I do not see how to achieve such feature.

                              <span>Hi all, with all the talk about tree-sitter in Emacs 29, I decided to give it a try. With everything set up, I can confirm that I&#x27;m running c++-ts-mode when I open a cc file. However, my previous indentations like c-basic-offset set via c-mode-common-hook are not being honored. How do I control the indentation when c++-ts-mode is enabled? Thanks.

                              <span>Inspired by the recent repeat-map discussions (thanks u/karthink), I immediately noticed that rectangle-mark-mode (C-x SPC) was the perfect target for single-key quick bindings. Why? Any time I explicitly activate rectangle-mark-mode, I do so only to call one of the various *-rectangle-* commands next. So why should I remember/type their prefixes? And what&#x27;s more, I can see that I have this mode active by the region shape &amp; left border.
 Repeat wasn&#x27;t the right approach, but it was simple to activate a transient map in rectangle-mark-mode-hook. Check this tiny gist. So C-x SPC, highlight your desired rectangle, then [k]ill [d]elete del-[] [c]lear [o]pen s[t]ring [w]-copy [y]ank [N]umber. I didn&#x27;t even know about the (unbound) command delete-whitespace-rectangle, but will use it often now that I don&#x27;t have to bind/remember it.
 The only thing I wish for is the ability to recall the region of the last marked rectangle (line+col; from, to), for when you&#x27;d like to do a series of rect operations in a row on the same columns.

                              <span>Hey y&#x27;all. Overnight my header spacing in org-mode changed. It used to look single-spaced, but now it&#x27;s got extra space between headings. My setq-default line-spacing has been set to 2 for a while now. Changing it doesn&#x27;t seem to affect this new behavior. On a new M1 Macbook Pro.

                              <span>Hi! In my dev work I have need to regularly create a handful of named shells, and then within each shell-buffer, I need to run a bash script.
 For example one of my shells has the buffer name of *myco-back-end-server*. In this shell I always run a script to start the server.
 How can I get the shell in *myco-back-end-server* buffer to run the bash script to start the server automatically? I mean, I want to write an interactive elisp function that looks something like this
 (defun my/start-development-session ()
 ( interactive )
 ( shell *myco-back-end-server* )
 ( ;; run bash script here to start the back-end server )
 ( shell *myco-front-end* )
 ( ;; run bash script to start front end )
 ( .. )
 ( etc )
 ​
 )
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hi all, is if there is some transcription of the Haskell docs into the Emacs Info format, so I can look at the them offline and within Emacs? Or honestly, any tips and resources on taking on the process of converting them myself if they exist in some other format, as I&#x27;d be happy to put in some work to that conversion and make the docs available via GitHub for others.

                              <span>I am on NixOS, and here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve been using for my vanity Haskell projects:
 $ cat default.nix { nixpkgs ? import  {}, compiler ? &quot;ghc924&quot; }: nixpkgs.pkgs.haskell.packages.${compiler}.callCabal2nix &quot;advent&quot; (./.) {} $ cat shell.nix { nixpkgs ? import  {} }: (import ./default.nix { inherit nixpkgs; }).env $ nix-shell $ cabal build ... etc ... 
 Note that ghc924 and the advent package name are wired in. Is there a better way?
 Also note that I am not a NixOS guru, I just enjoy the feeling that I understand the state of my system via /etc/nix/configuration.nix.

                              <span>Dear Haskell community:
 I wrote a blogpost about Monads to help Elm developers understand Haskell a little better and hopefully increase their desire to learn more Haskell.
 https://flaviocorpa.com/haskell-for-elm-developers-giving-names-to-stuff-part-3-monads.html
 Please, constructive feedback is always welcome, but have in mind that the goal is to drive more Elm developers into the warm hug of the Haskell language!

                              <span>Im currently looking for a job, and got pretty far along eith a company that uses purely Scala for their backend (even though I&#x27;m not experienced with it at all). Im seeing that Scala is loosing popularity and my question is - is it a good idea to work there, with the option of becoming a niche developer that is experienced with an unpopular lang, or should i progress with other companies that use more familiar languages such as node, python etc...?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hey all,
 When I kill buffers, I often get the message from the title. But when I diff-buffer-with-file, I often get Diff finished (no differences).
 What gives? This is super annoying if I&#x27;m closing a long-running session with numerous unsaved buffers. 
 I don&#x27;t want to just save everything without prompting, because sometimes I type accidental changes into a buffer or two. But manually checking these false positives is a pain in the ass. 
 Has anyone else dealt with/solved this? If the current buffer contents at the time of closing matches the file on disk, I don&#x27;t want to be prompted.

 when I copy a text from a ui application and paste to the emacs&#x27;s scratch I got the &#x27;UnicodeText&#x27; instead of the copied text ...
 Do you know why it is ? How I can set it up the emacs to solve this problem ?
 thanks in advance :)

 Has anybody figure out how to tell multiple-cursors to use the same cursor style as the default?

                              <span>For a fiction project I am working on I have been reading into parapsychology and branches of what I would consider pseudoscience. In digging into this work, I&#x27;ve found read some fascinating stuff from people who strongly believe in and/or participate in this kind of research. Their first-hand testimony is going to be valuable for some of the world-building and plot development I want to do in my speculative fiction.
Now, I want to track this information in my zettelkasten. But I also feel some small anxiety that I&#x27;ll be &quot;polluting&quot; my notes with some of this stuff. I&#x27;m curious about how others who do this kind of research handle materials that would not be the kind of thing you&#x27;d espouse yourself, but something you want to keep a record of for some other purpose.
Second: do you keep biographical information in your zettelkasten? In this same case, I&#x27;ve encountered a few recurring names that I would like to track. While my novel&#x27;s not going to be based whole cloth on any of these figures, I am drawing some inspiration from real life programs and work and events. My initial thought is to create a structure note related to the individual that I might put a smattering of biographical information in that can then spin off into some specifics about their life and work that matters to me. But again, curious about how others have handled this.</span>

                              <span>My journey to eMacs and orgmode started from Notion and Obsidian, so pardon my analogies. 
 Is there an equivalent feature to Notion Synced Blocks in Orgmode?
 My requirement: I journal every day and note down my interactions with people and entities in my journal. I also maintain a ‘people.org’ file for all my contacts. I want the note about a person, John Doe, that I wrote in my journal to also appear in people.org under John Doe.

                              <span>Hi,
 Would you pay for a yearly license for an Emacs distro preloaded with things such as Magit, lsp-mode, etc? Basically, a good out of the box IDE experience. The majority (80%?) of the proceeds could be donated to the devs of the packages. Basically, a nice value add that also benefits our package devs.

                              <span>I have trying out writing in org mode and exporting it as latex following this guide.
 I wrote the following org file to test it out and exported it to latex:
 ITLE: Org Latex Test #+SUBTITLE: /Straightforward Emacs/ #+AUTHOR: Jack #+SETUPFILE: ~/.emacs.d/jake-latex-standard.org * First Heading :noexport: Hello this is a test sample * Second headings This is another header with code block #+begin_src python print(&quot;hello world&quot;) print(&quot;This is a code block&quot;) #+end_src #+CAPTION: This is a Table | Name | id | Age | | Peter | 1234 | 50 | | Sue | 4321 | 54 | | | | | * Third Headings 
 But the code block in the pdf looks messy and I was wondering how I can properly format the code block in org mode so that when it gets exported to latex it looks professional?

                              <span>I know emacs has much better autocomplete (e.g. yasnippets) than Overleaf. However, I&#x27;ve found that simply defining new commands in overleaf goes a long way and provides similar benefits to using snippets. Also, org mode has the option to render LaTeX directly inside the editor instead of having one screen for the editor and another for the rendered output. I guess the bullet point features of org mode are also pretty cool. However, despite all of these cool features, I find when I use emacs I end up wasting a lot of time researching how to do stuff. In practice I find simply writing things up in Overleaf to be a lot faster. Does emacs eventually get faster if you&#x27;re good enough at it?

I was editing a tex document and when I pressed &#x27; followed by M-1 (because I wanted to wrap the previous word in a \mathrm{}), i got that error. I had not made any changes to any .el files, I was just editing my tex document as usual. My fingers may have spazzed out like they sometimes do when trying to input a complicated keychord, but it is weird that all of a sudden this is not working. Does anyone have any idea what to do? I restarted emacs but that does not solve the problem, and neither does re-evaluating the cdlatex.el file.

                              <span>Hi all, I&#x27;ve released ekg version 0.2. Why it feels like just yesterday I was release ekg version 0.1, and in fact it wasn&#x27;t that long ago.
 ekg is a note taking application for emacs that stores all data in sqlite, is very tag-oriented, and designed to be easy to extend.
 The changes for version 0.2 are:
  
Added hooks ekg-add-schema-hook, ekg-note-pre-save-hook, ekg-note-save-hook, ekg-note-delete-hook, and ekg-note-add-tag-hook to enable customization.
 New commands ekg-show-notes-latest-captured, &#x3D;kg-show-notes-latest-modified, for showing notes created or modified recently.
 Introduced variable ekg-notes-size to control the default page size for limited views such as ekg-show-notes-latest-captured.
 Added templating.
 Added embedding as an optional add-on, to enable note similarity and note search; requires an account at OpenAI or similar embedding provider.
 Added new function ekg-active-notes to easily get all non-trashed notes.
 Improved ability to have note list buffers that have flexible titles and operation, notably improving the ekg-show-notes-in-trash command.
 Standardized buffer names for ekg-notes-mode buffers, which all are prepended with &quot;ekg&quot; and surrounded by asterisks, to denote that they are non-file-based.
 Added documentation in texinfo, viewable via M-x info.
 Fixed bug interfering with completion at the beginning of the tag property line.
  
For details, watch the demo of 0.2 changes. I think the templating is done via a unique way that shows off the power of ekg, and embedding stuff is advanced, super useful, and virtually no other note app in any system has it. On the other hand, the embeddings costs a very small amount of money and has unfortunate privacy implications. I think it&#x27;s well worth it, and I hope that you enjoy this update.

                              <span>Hear me out here. Before you downvote me, I&#x27;m not advocating that any functional changes be made to Emacs regarding car and cdr. I&#x27;ve looked up a brief history of the terms and their origins. They have their uses and should be neither removed nor renamed.
 However, as someone who&#x27;s only recently learned about these terms, Emacs&#x27; self-documentation for these terms was not helpful at all to me. I saw the function being used in existing Elisp and thought, &quot;What&#x27;s car and cdr?&quot; So I looked it up inside Emacs, and it told me that car returned the car of LIST. Wow... super helpful...
 I&#x27;d offer to submit a pull request to update the documentation if the source code wasn&#x27;t managed via email, but it is. So, I&#x27;m just putting my opinion out here where someone else who contributes might read this. &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; car is a function defined in C source code.
 Signature (car LIST)
 Documentation Return the car of LIST. If LIST is nil, return nil.
 Error if LIST is not nil and not a cons cell. See also car-safe.
 See Info node (elisp)Cons Cells for a discussion of related basic Lisp concepts such as car, cdr, cons cell and list.
 Other relevant functions are documented in the list group.   cdr is a function defined in C source code.
 Signature (cdr LIST)
 Documentation Return the cdr of LIST. If LIST is nil, return nil.
 Error if LIST is not nil and not a cons cell. See also cdr-safe.
 See Info node (elisp)Cons Cells for a discussion of related basic Lisp concepts such as cdr, car, cons cell and list.

I think I&#x27;ve done what I need, but things aren&#x27;t working quite right—I have to manually enabled meow-global-mode, rather than having my init.el line auto-enable it, and meow-tutor is not avaliable even after I do that (most other meow commands seem to be).

For those who aren&#x27;t familiar, a VueJS single-file-component looks, for all intents and purposes, like an HTML file. You can view an example of what a Vue SFC file looks like here.. A  tag for the JS or TS code, a  tag for any component-specific styles, and a  tag wrapping the actual markup. Aside from some additional syntax in the  itself, Vue files are very similar to HTML files. However, getting good indentation, syntax highlighting, and LSP behavior can be...trying.
 In the past, I&#x27;ve used web-mode for highlighting and indentation and been mostly happy, although it can sometimes be hard to properly configure indentation, auto-closing tag conflicts, etc. Ther…</span>

                              <span>MacOS provides a native progress bar in Applescripts, which is extremely useful for displaying the progress of long-running processes. I can see the benefit of incorporating this feature into longer Elisp processes as well. However, controlling the progress bar natively requires the use of Applescripts, which can be difficult without the official IDE. As Emacs users, we naturally desire an Emacs Lisp binding. 
 I would greatly appreciate any guidance on how to create bindings for the described functionality (elisp  shell  applescript). Thank you very much!

                              <span>What are the secrets to high performance Haskell? I&#x27;ve met people who claim that Haskell code should perform around 5-10x slower than C, Tikhon Jelvis says that mildly optimized Haskell can perform around 3x C in time, kuribas claims that Haskell should perform at least at 50% of C, an acquaintance can get Haskell to half of Rust&#x27;s performance, and there&#x27;s libraries like Attoparsec and Streamly that claim 80-90% of C performance. And of course, there&#x27;s Don Stewart.
 ​
 What&#x27;s the secret to getting high performance Haskell? Are the ultra-fast libraries concurrency scams (i.e, C is single-threaded, Haskell is parallel)? Or are the ultra-fast libraries actually as fast as they claim, and that it&#x27;s possible to get Haskell to near-C speeds? 
 Because I love Haskell as a fun toying-around language, given how concise the language (and functional style) can be. Especially when you have defections to the Rust camp, keeping Haskell performant is a worthy goal, and I guess high-performance Haskell is joked about as &quot;only if you&#x27;re Don Stewart&quot; or &quot;dark magic, summoned by sacrificing puppies and kittens&quot;.
 ​
 Any tips, links, advice to get ultra-high-performance Haskell, other than, perhaps, inline-C? ;)

                              <span>Managing of todo lists has always been a pain in the ass for me.
 I tried evernote, but it depends on an account, it&#x27;s centralized and proprietary
 I tried discord, but besides other points, it doesn&#x27;t have UI needed for proper task management
 I heard about orgmode. I hang out in r/emacs and whenever someone asks &quot;why not vim/vscode/etc.&quot;, besides other points it&#x27;s orgmode. So I&#x27;ve been tempted to try it out. And I don&#x27;t regret
 My setup is neovim with orgmode plugin on laptop, orgzly on phone, syncthing to sync and git to back up.
 Works well so far!

                              <span>Ever since I started using emacs I have always had a problem with figuring out how to determine the cause of error. When I am programming in python or c++, the debug message is helpful as it points out what line the issue is on and why it occurred. However with emacs, when there is something wrong with my init.el file, I have run emacs with debug-init and the error message looks messy and difficult to interpret. What is the best practice or steps or tutorials on how to debug large files of elisp code or emacs errors?

                              <span>So I can’t seem to find an answer for this. Does anyone know if there’s something out there for string-rectangle (C-x r t), but for yanking text with the same number of lines without moving other lines? That probably didn’t make much sense. Say I have:
 a c e g i 
 And I have:
 b d f 
 I want to be able to use one copy and one paste to achieve this:
 a b c d e f g i 
 Basically if I have 5 lines of text in my kill ring, I want to use string-rectangle at the end of a different set of 5 lines and paste the 5 lines from my kill ring directly alongside without moving any of the other lines around. I hope this mess makes sense to somebody.

                              <span>Recently switch to Vertico, consult and friends, and as I have spotify in the background all day, I could use a way to control it from emacs. I&#x27;ve seen consult-spotify on MELPA, however no specific instructions are provided. I&#x27;ve set the client ID and Secret for the account, but running consult-spotify-find-track returns 0 candidates. It doesn&#x27;t work. Has anyone got this package working?
 ​
 Also espotify.el complains of nonexisting dbus service file for spotify, while Spotify DBus is clearly functional and I can use it from the command line. 
 It would be nice to have Spotify controls with vertico fuzzy search.

                              <span>I’ve been using emacs for 40 years, no kidding, and my .emacs has developed a lot of entropy. I’ve been using vscode but my fingers cry out for their old familiar chords. I’d like to declare .emacs bankruptcy and redo it, but I want to get the new stuff like completion without also getting vi-like behavior.
 Can anyone recommend a starting point for a new .emacs ?

 I want to install EIN package in spacemacs, I install normally from package-install, but whenever I close the program spacemacs doesn&#x27;t recognize it when using (require &#x27;ein) , is there any configurations I must use to download a package that is not associated with a layer ?

 “Binaries (and zip of sources) for Emacs 29.0.60 made today are now published to the alpha FTP server:

 This is my first (pre)release build of Emacs 29 so LMK what you suspect I&#x27;ve messaged up during packaging.”
 Sadly, it seems it has been build without tree-sitter support: ‘ ■ Warning (treesit): Cannot activate tree-sitter, because tree-sitter library is not compiled with EMacs’

                              <span>Hello,
 I understand that Emacs has TRAMP which allows working on a remote host via SSH. However, other editors are now offering better support for working with Cloud Development Environments, and there hasn&#x27;t been much discussion about this in the Emacs community. So, I&#x27;m curious if anyone has used Emacs with Gitpod or GitHub codespaces and how they set it up.
 Thanks.

                              <span>Hello everyone, I want to share a new package keepass-cli-rs I wrote recently (well actually, it&#x27;s last December).
 The URL for the repo is https://github.com/fuyu0425/keepass-cli-rs
 I am aware of previous keepass packages like the following, but that does not fit my need.
  
keepass-mode
 keepass.el
  
Some highlight for this new package:
  
based on hydra, so you can quickly switch entries
 use completing-read purely, so you can use your current completion engine.
 ICON!!! which is very important to me to find the entry I want.
 You can find some screenshots in the repo.
  
Some restriction:
  
It&#x27;s read-only (you cannot edit the database) and only tested by me now.
  
You can only build from source now (it&#x27;s not on crate.io and Melpa now) because I want some initial feedback!

                              <span>What is the fastest completion style?
 My thought would be emacs21. basic is also fast but seems to me that it might be slower. flex seems the slowest to me out of all the default ones.

                              <span>FYI I do have several learning disability and memory deficits so I know the road will be a challenging one especially with these key bindings.
 How do I save the configuration in order for it to take effect at startup because I thought everything was supposed to save into the .emacs,d folder. but its all just going to the home directory. I &#x27;d like to use org mode for taking notes for all my classes, is it preferred to just keep the notes under one file or is it a best practice to create different files for each subject?
 Is there a way to automatically save .org or config files in the same folder? I&#x27;m new to CS and we&#x27;ll be starting on python but I have no prior programming experience and I&#x27;ve gone over the navigation and watched several tutorials such as Systems Crafters and a few others, read Emacs Wiki, Org website Emacs reference and all the references under getting started for the last two weeks. Is it best to start out vanilla or should I go spacemacs or take copy a different theme. The default white background is blinding me.

 It&#x27;s excellent for understanding the roots and means by which certain languages came into the world and why they are imperative or OOP and/or FP.
 I think we identify an underlying theory of programming when someone starts to build the tool to do that kind of programming. Naturally there will be a lot of overlap with other languages which are also tackling similar tasks. Richard Feldman, in the video, describes a lot of that in a very clear and entertaining way.
 Scala&#x27;s place in this lineage and facing those issues
 The Scala community has to tackle those same issues. For example, what is the programing paradigm, what is the name of it, and what are the techniques &amp; parts…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;d like to announce Codd. 
 Codd is a tool that applies plain postgres SQL migrations atomically (when postgres allows it) and enforces schema consistency checks to ensure different environments have the same schema. It also helps by providing meaningful merge conflicts for when e.g. different developers modify the same DB objects, among other interesting features. Please check its GitHub for what it can do! 
 We&#x27;ve been using codd at PRODA for some months (though we&#x27;ve been using parts of it for far longer in a transition and test period) to apply our migrations, run schema consistency checks and manage our multiple environments&#x27; databases, from dev to staging, production and tests. I&#x27;d like to thank my friends at PRODA for their support and feedback all this time: it has been invaluable. 
 Now I find it&#x27;s time to release codd to a broader audience, and thought of this community because it&#x27;s written in Haskell. 
 I hope the documentation on GitHub explains reasonably how codd works and its nuances. I&#x27;m open to questions and feedback of all kinds here as well!

                              <span>I&#x27;m doing my masters in CS, and it won&#x27;t be long until I finish. It&#x27;s right now shy to 3 a.m. and I&#x27;ve been losing sleep recently about what I&#x27;ll do after graduating. To put it mildly, Haskell was everything that I used in the past 4 years. I&#x27;d say I&#x27;m in an intermediate level in utilizing Haskell. I did my bachelor thesis using Haskell, and doing my master thesis using Haskell again. I also had student jobs in which I taught and programmed using Haskell and Scala.
 I&#x27;m starting to ask myself what I&#x27;ll do after graduating. Do I look for a Haskell job? (I&#x27;m based in Germany, and everything I&#x27;m finding is requiring to already have many years of experiences in the field which I don&#x27;t have, and I also found other jobs in cyber security which are related to Functional programming but I have no expertise in that and they always ask for people with experience). This means I can&#x27;t help but to wonder what I will be doing for living.
 Do I ignore Haskell and fp in general for now? Which other it-jobs could be suitable for someone with my modest expertise? Which other languages should I concentrate at instead? Which IT-jobs should I keep an eye on if Haskell jobs are not within reach? Should I try to find a job in cyber security since many cyber security jobs ask for Haskell developers? Does anyone have a personal experience with my dilemma or any advice on what I must do next? Are there some special platforms for fp programmers who are looking for jobs? I feel right now like a child in the body of a grown-up.

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently trying out org-cite with a BibTeX bibliography, but I&#x27;m having trouble figuring out how to have URLs in my citations. I&#x27;ve tried both the url (which apparently is non-standard?) and note parameters in my BibTeX citation, but neither do anything. I&#x27;ve been referring to these two blog posts. I&#x27;ve never used BibTeX before and I&#x27;m quite new to Org mode and Emacs, so I might be missing something.
 Also, is it possible to have numbered citations?
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I am terribly sorry I am writing a second post today, but org mode changed my life since i am doing my GTD.
 In the years there was a lot of interest to move mindmap format to org mode and the other way around, i have an idea that could represent a solution to that. 
 Although I do not have LISP knowledge at the moment and for this idea is necessary an advanced knowledge because is about to KNOW the org code flow directly( not creating a third part project), so I would like to share the idea as a feature to consider for the most advanced devs. 
 Actually the good news would be that would be a really gradual work, with every minimal improvement bringing a lot of satisfaction to the org users, from day 1, without all the cons of the dedicated projects that already exist.

                              <span>I am using tags as links so that i can navigate in a row of a file that i need really fast.
 The problem is that if i use it like that:
 ​
  
** my head :myTag: 
 *** subHead1 
 **** subsubhead1 
 **** subsubhead2 
 //(a lot of sub heads 
 **** subsubhead1000 
 *** subHead2 
 *** subHead3 
 then when will run a myTag research I will have all the 1000 subsubhead items, this is not good I guess 
 Is this the &quot;right&quot; approach one should follow? Basically i could mark some sub tags in the children and then refine my research? 
 It would be possible to custom in the headers #+ of the file on top the level of nested tags that have to consider? In this way I would have a tag for the subHead but not for the subsubHead(the children of a subHead)

 If I had a little visual indicator in the margin, to remind me what the thing was I&#x27;m looking at, it would help a lot.
 Is there a way to make such an indicator and move it around easily? I&#x27;m not terribly interested in learning elisp just now. Maybe when the kids are grown up...
 [EDIT] Actually, it might not be critical for it to be visible. I might be able to use setting and swapping mark and point, except that that creates a region - which is an unwanted side effect for what I am trying to do.
 [EDIT] replaced mark with indicator to avoid confusion.

Is &quot;open-ended question&quot; what I hope it is? &quot;Closed question&quot; would be sth. that you can answer with yes, no, 100; an &quot;open-ended question&quot; would be sth to just talk about. Fits the Wikipedia definition, but is it really without end?

It even comes with library research tools with templates for e.g. PubMed, but which also worked with our local university library. Also supports export templates to quickly copy and paste in your favorite Markdown flavor.
For (some) Linux systems, there&#x27;s an open source app targeting GTK/GNOME that was shared in my interweb circles recently:

https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/citations/
It looks very minimalistic. Some scripting/automation features would be useful to more quickly generate (Markdown-compatible) citations.

                              <span>I noticed this GitHub post which basically means that WSL2 doesn&#x27;t yet support SVG based icons:
  
https://github.com/microsoft/wslg/issues/614
  
​
 That being noted, seeing Tux for every Linux application installed via WSL2 sucks.
 ​
 Here&#x27;s the workaround I used, posting here for anyone else for future reference:
 ​
 Related Workflow Notes:
  
I found the related icon here: 
 https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:EmacsIcon.svg
 
 More specifically, I used the &#x27;48x48 pixel&#x27; version here: 
 https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/EmacsIcon.svg/48px-EmacsIcon.svg.png
 
 I then downloaded it via just using Firefox in Windows as &#x27;EmacsIcon.png&#x27;.
 I then copied and pasted it to the &#x27;Linux &gt; Ubuntu-22.04 &gt; usr &gt; share &gt; icons&#x27; folder (This directory is &#x27;\wsl.localhost\Ubuntu-22.04\usr\share\icons&#x27; in File Explorer on Windows 10)
 The resulting file with path was the following 
 &#x27;/usr/share/icons/EmacsIcon.png&#x27;
 
 I then edited the &#x27;/usr/local/share/applications/emacs.desktop&#x27; file to include the following changes:

I have not seen any other configs that handle spelling and grammar like doom does.
 Most of the rest of the config I want to be more wholly my own.

 I am trying to do a (long) series of similar (not identical) text replacements over multiple files. 
 I will explain to you my specific issue because I think it will be more efficient than trying to generalize it from the start. Hopefully it will create a picture that can then be easily generalized, with a possibile solution ending up being useful for many different people. 
 I made some university (engineering) notes in .org format, in which I include a latex header using this:

                              <span>Hey moved from neovim to doomemacs and the more I learn the more I enjoy it. I am having an issue with magit where I can&#x27;t create a commit. When pressing c -S (my gpg key) c I get the following error which seems that I have well...the wrong keymap. This is confusing as my config is essentially barebone. I am at my wits ends on this issue.
  1 git --no-pager --literal-pathspecs -c core.preloadindex\&#x3D;true -c log.showSignature\&#x3D;false -c color.ui\&#x3D;false -c color.diff\&#x3D;false commit -- hint: Waiting for your editor to close the file... Waiting for Emacs... *ERROR*: Wrong type argument: keymapp, nil
 I can create a commit in the shell no problem and it will ask for my passphrase. I can push no problem with magit, just can&#x27;t commit and I believe its due to gpg.
 My gpg-agent.conf:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 #Do not ask me about entered passwords for 24h (during the same session)
 default-cache-ttl 86400 max-cache-ttl 86400
 pinentry-program /usr/bin/pinentry-tty allow-loopback-entry
 #Allow pinentry in Emacs minibuffer (combined with epg-pinentry-mode)
 allow-loopback-pinentry allow-emacs-pinentry&#x60;&#x60;&#x60; 
 Thanks for any help.

                              <span>Hi all!
 I often find myself in writing Elisp with a &quot;data-flow&quot; mindset, meaning &quot;this data should be processed like this, then like this, then like this&quot;. I could use some piping techniques, but what if I then need to reuse a partial result? Should I recompute everything? Of course not, let* to the rescue!
 Except that let* syntax is a bit too verbose, I&#x27;d like to have something similar to Rust&#x27;s let. Well, here&#x27;s my attempt, help yourselves:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; (defmacro rust-let (&amp;rest body) &quot;Allow to have a let Rust-like syntax in BODY.&quot;
 (cond ((not body) &#x27;()) ((atom body) body) ((listp body) (let ((current-form (car body))) (cond ((not current-form) current-form) ((atom current-form) current-form) ((listp current-form) (if (eq (car current-form) &#x27;rlet) (let ((,(cadr current-form) ,(caddr current-form))) (rust-let ,@(cdr body))) (progn ,current-form (rust-let ,@(cdr body))))) )))))  This allows to turn  (rust-let (rlet a-partial-result (some-func some-data)) (rlet another-partial-result (another-func a-partial-result)) (process-func another-partial-result) ;; but I want to return a-partial-result)  into  (let ((a-partial-result (some-func some-data))) (let ((another-partial-result (another-func a-partial-result))) (progn (process-func another-partial-result) a-partial-result))) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; Any suggestion is greatly appreciated!

                              <span>I can’t be the only developer who gets annoyed when emacs kills past &#x3D;, + or even new lines. However I was unable to find a package that does that.
 Also another very common task is to change part of a name written in camel or snake case. Both killing and navigating fast to the point where I want to kill would be great!
 However similar questions in stack overflow and the net often get shot down with “just code it yourself”. I probably will, but was just wondering if other people would like that itch scratched or know a canonical solution that’s already available (package)?

                              <span>How do I get out of text-mode? I was in eshell and wanted to scroll up (I don&#x27;t use a GUI, only emacs via terminal) and copy some text to paste elsewhere. I did M-x text-mode and it let me scroll up and copy text.
 ​
 However, i have no idea how to get back to the other mode (what&#x27;s the other mode even called)? I&#x27;ve looked at the entire eshell documentation and found not a single thing.
 ​
 https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/eshell.html#:~:text&#x3D;Eshell%20is%20a%20shell%2Dlike,those%20requested%20by%20the%20user.
 ​
 Further, I&#x27;d like to bind these mode to keys, but I first need to know what they&#x27;re even called...

                              <span>Something is odd in my settings because my emacs is now adding 4 spaces when ever I start a new line. This happens in most modes: text, fundamental, markdown, java, etc. I cannot find a variable which seems to control this. I&#x27;ve restarted several times so it is somewhere in my .emacs file (I think).
 I&#x27;m using emacs 28.2 (9.0) on an M1 Mac running Ventura 13.2. 
 What should I look for? This started happening about 1 to 2 weeks ago.

                              <span>Dear Zettelnauts,
I started a new book Weinberg On Writing: The Fieldstone Method and it is terrific. Funny, and it contains many insights. Weinberg&#x27;s &#x27;fieldstone method dovetails nicely with the zettelkasten method.&#x27; Before my time here on the forums, @ctietze mentioned Weinberg back in Feb of 2018 - Writing with the Zettelkasten is like building a fieldstone wall and Gerald Weinberg was brought up again by @chrisaldrich back in October - Review of “On Intellectual Craftsmanship” (1952) by C. Wright Mills, I&#x27;m slow on the uptake. Still, if you keep pounding away, I&#x27;ll finally get it.
Please tell me about your past week and what you are working on.

                              <span>Hello! I’ve started making an openBSD library for haskell. The idea was to add pledge and unveil, maybe also a single function for privilege dropping.
 But I’m very new to openBSD and haven’t actually written any software for it yet…
 So, for anyone who does, what would you like to see in the library?

                              <span>I would like to introduce the second release of Iris — a Haskell CLI framework that supports CLI Guidelines.
  
https://github.com/chshersh/iris
  
There were lots of changes since the initial release last year, so now would be a perfect time to try Iris!
 The most significant improvements are:
  
A complete tutorial about writing CLI apps in Haskell with Iris
 Lots of Haddock improvements
 Automatic detection of terminal colouring support
  
 See CHANGELOG for more details.
  
​
 I created Iris with the initial goal to provide mentorship to beginners in Haskell, FP, and Open-Source. And, as you can notice, most of the improvements were made by outside contributors. If you would like to contribute something to Iris, check out beginner-friendly issues!
 It takes a lot of effort and patience to help others, but in the end, I hope my guidance was helpful to them 🤗
 P.S. To add a few more positive news, today is also my 29th birthday 🥳🎂 Your best gift to me would be to support my Haskell Open-Source work via GitHub Sponsorship. Or you can just star Iris on GitHub, and this would encourage me to continue doing more Haskell OSS!

                              <span>Hello /r/haskell!
 I just recently found out that one can&#x27;t have something like this in servant:
 UVerb &#x27;PATCH &#x27;[JSON] &#x27;[ WithStatus 200 Foo, WithStatus 500 ErrorA, WithStatus 500 ErrorB] 
 Which confused me at first because the docs mentions this:
  
A variant of Verb that can have any of a number of response values and status codes.
  
This led me to believe that this was possible, but it seems to be limited to one per status code. Since eventually, all servant seems to care about is the status code, not exactly including the response body itself. The above becomes
 &#x27;[200, 500, 500] 
 Which GHC tells me about because genericServeT expects this list to be unique; any duplicate status code will fail regardless of the varying response bodies. 
 While I do understand that doesn&#x27;t make much s…</span>

                              <span>Hi all, I&#x27;m very happy to announce &quot;FP Web Conf&quot; - a series of talks and in person events covering topics related to Functional Programming and Web Development (both frontend and backend). The event is being organised by HasGeek, JSFoo, and Functional Programming India. Attendance is completely free for both remote and in-person events.
 The first talk will have George James talk about how Juspay used PureScript to implement a cross platform UI framework - https://hasgeek.com/jsfoo/fp-webconf/sub/use-purescript-and-build-your-own-ui-framework-TjroLrqjuZG8LCHk9XWo5U. Please register on the page to receive the meeting invite.
 We are also accepting proposals for talks and case studies! If you or your company has evaluated or adopted Haskell or any other functional programming technology in production, please consider submitting a talk proposal, and share your insights with the community. Tales of adventure with introducing Haskell into an existing codebase, or building Haskell capabilities within teams are especially welcome!

                              <span>I&#x27;m not even a beginner in Scala but recently it came to my attention the possibility to apply formal methods (preconditions and postconditions) in Scala. Do you guys use the Design by contract very often? Is this something useful on a production environment? If yes, what tips or references would give me?
 This is just an example I&#x27;ve written testing the preconditions and postconditions feature. Still, all these checks may throw an exception and it&#x27;s necessary to wrap then on a try-catch block wich would make the code less elegant, are there any solution to this? *If this feature is really useful.
 @main def run() &#x3D; print(decryptedToken(&quot;hsjj&quot;)) case class Token(userName: String, userEmail: String, userPermission: userPermission) type userPermission &#x3D; String def decryptedToken(token: String): Token &#x3D; require(decryptToken(token) !&#x3D; null) require(checkPermission(decryptToken(token).userPermission)) Token(decryptToken(token).userName, decryptToken(token).userEmail, decryptToken(token).userPermission) .ensuring(_.userEmail &#x3D;&#x3D; &quot;Email&quot;) def decryptToken(token: String): Token &#x3D; // Will decrypt token Token(&quot;Name&quot;, &quot;Email&quot;, &quot;Permission&quot;) def checkPermission(permission: userPermission): Boolean &#x3D; if permission &#x3D;&#x3D; &quot;Permission&quot; then return true return false

                              <span>I hired a company called Softobiz (through UpWork) to work on my website, and they were going fine until the hit my backend, which is written in Scala.
 They wrote to me today: 
  
Sorry for the delay, Team has a less experience in Scala tech. We are trying to setup and make it work and also we have aligned the recruitment team to hire the resource with the same expertise.
  
Which basically translated to - they need to hire a Scala dev before they can continue working on my website.
 If anyone is interested, then you can help me by working for them....
 Their Upwork profile is: https://www.upwork.com/agencies/~01edb0e09d72122edd/
 And their website is: https://softobiz.com/
 Personally, there may be a possibility for me to hire a Scala dev directly, but it&#x27;s not that straightforward since I am not very proficient in code, and my original dev who wrote the backend in Scala has flaked off (for the most part), leaving me trying to figure out how to proceed. That&#x27;s why I went to an agency rather than hiring directly. The original dev is still around per se, but it takes a week to extract any information from him. Albeit 50% of the info needed is document on Confluence.
 Nevertheless, thought I&#x27;d post if anyone was interested.
 Thanks.

                              <span>Hello,
 In the online tutorials I see examples of people scheduling tasks for particular days, and then the agenda view gives a great overview of tasks for the week.
 The question: What do you do if the day arrives and you are not able to complete many of the items? For me, this is _usually_ the case: either I am hit with an unexpected task at work, or I over-estimate how much I can do in a day.
 Specifically, do you delete the items and create new ones on the next day? Or change their date somehow? It seems like a lot of work to have to re-schedule tasks each day.
 ​
 ​
 Recently I asked this question about setting up an org/todo workflow that does _not_ use dates.
 https://www.reddit.com/r/orgmode/comments/1163k17/first_time_org_todo_user_fit_it_to_me_or_vice/
 The answer provided worked, but it would need some work to setup an agenda view, and I am wondering if I am just missing the right way to think about org.

 Currently
 I have the log view in my agenda set up to show both closed and clocked tasks by way of (setq org-agenda-log-mode-items &#x27;(closed clock state)). When a task is both clocked and closed, I&#x27;ll see something like this:
 13:30-14:38 Clocked: (1:08) DONE Read a book 14:00...... ---------------- 14:38...... Closed: DONE Read a book 
 I want to suppress the second entry.
 Fumblings
 I think I want something that behaves like org-agenda-skip-deadline-if-done, i.e. org-agenda-skip-done-if-clocked, but that doesn&#x27;t exist.
 I&#x27;m not sure how to do it with a custom org-agenda-skip-function either, because whether I want to skip it depends on whether it&#x27;s been shown already, and I don&#x27;t think that information is available.
 I thought about using org-agenda-finalize-hook but that seems like it would be hard and probably the wrong way to do it.

                              <span>When I write notes in org mode I&#x27;d like to add some eally little sketches drawn insanely fast to represent things that are too hard to be made with common diagram tools (e.g. graphviz). I use a bluetooth Wacom drawing tablet.
 ​
 I&#x27;ve seen both Krita-mode and Xournalpp-mode but both seem overkill for what i want to achieve: in particular, I dislike the fact that in Krita you have to specify width and height for the picture you want to create. Xournalpp, on the other hand, is more suited to make complete notes in A4 format, rather than quick sketches. 
 ​
 I&#x27;d like something that is more like a Whiteboard and is possible to embed in emacs with no issue, in whatever size it takes to occupy my sketches. Does anyone here uses something similar?

                              <span>I never be able to know what is the best for me.
 I used both alternatively because I think it is become better on the other side.
 There is always the easy vscode but not with full vim keybinding.
 I decided to share my personal comparaison. 
 Here, I share my point of view. 
 Why I prefer DOOM
  
 LSP (clangd, there the % progression of DB, I know that it is ongoing)
  GUI mode
  Call tree (available natively for C++)
  copy/paste (more easy because of the GUI)
  grep (ripgrep is better integrated for me, no plugin to add)
  find file (the same with fd)
  server mode (emacsclient)
  git (magit)
  Docker (included by default)
  Bookmark (easy to use by default)
  Org mode
  Fold (evil is working well by default)
  installation on windows
  
why I prefer Lunarvim
  
 Comment (simple  shortcut)
  Treesitter (by default first)
  DAP debug (better integrated even in terminal)
  Terminal mode (expected for…)
  C-i/C-o navigation
  Explorateur (nvimtree)
  project (more easy to mksession)
  show invisible char
  git lens
  search &amp; replace(inccommand&#x3D;split)
  undo (as I want by default)
  configuration (more easy with lua)
  escape key (I can use ’ù’)
  highlight (It is highlighting a word everywhere)
  mergeconflict (thanks to lazygit integration)
  speed
  
Do you have a similar behavior from one to another ? why ?

 (custom-set-variables &#x27;(eldoc-documentation-strategy &#x27;ignore) &#x27;(eldoc-idle-delay 0.1) &#x27;(eldoc-minor-mode-string &quot; nil&quot;) &#x27;(global-eldoc-mode nil) )

 but that doesnt help. Any other ideas? Ideally, I would only like to have errors displayed there upon point over a red squiggly line

                              <span>By default, when I add a tag with C-x C-q to an item, the tag is added to the end of heading/item:
 C-x C-q tag
 * Item :tag: 
 I want it to show at the beginning, like this:
 * :tag: Item 
 Because sometimes I have long headings, and the tags get misaligned or in a different line of the item (if visual-line-mode is on). So, I thought that having the tags at the beginning of the item would make the document more organized, since my tags are usually shorter and about the same size.
 Is there a way I could do that? Suggestions are welcome.

This has lifted my spirits quite a bit. I was starting to think that it might not be feasible anymore to continue on my current path. It was also a bit overwhelming, thus my late response.
 It all began on Sunday, when I realized I was likely to loose many sponsors, due to GitHub&#x27;s decision to stop accepting donations made through PayPal. I quickly send an update to existing sponsors urging them to update their payment method, which got &quot;leaked&quot; in parts.
 My post contained an appeal to also encourage other users to contribute, so the leak is perfectly okay with me. I wasn&#x27;t really expecting it to be posted verbatim, but had I wanted to prevent…</span>

 I would like to highlight the status area (this is the same area that displays C-u 135 when entering numerical args to anything) when entering numeric arguments so that it is more obvious that is what I am doing. Can this highlighting be easily done? It&#x27;s hard to investigate the face settings of the status bar.

                              <span>Today I wanted to calculate some costs in an org buffer. I heard that calc was powerful and convenient but found it unintuitive when I tried it the last time.
 I gave it a second chance today and had fun using it, entering formulas in the org-mode buffer then marking them with a region and letting calc evaluate the formulas and pasting it back into the buffer. But I needed too many key presses to do this really comfortably, so I made something for the next time, which should be more fun:
 ​
 (global-set-key (kbd &quot;C-c c&quot;) &#x27;calc-insert-result-with-equal-sign) (defun calc-insert-result-with-equal-sign (this-prefix-arg) &quot;Evaluate the expression in the active region using &#x60;calc&#x60;, insert an equal sign and the result.&quot; (interactive &quot;p&quot;) (calc-fix-notation 2) (if current-prefix-arg (calc-fix-notation this-prefix-arg)) (let ((expression (buffer-substring-no-properties (region-beginning) (region-end)))) (if (string-empty-p (string-trim expression)) (message &quot;Region is empty.&quot;) (let ((result (calc-eval expression))) (goto-char (max (region-beginning) (region-end))) (insert &quot; &#x3D; &quot;) (insert result) (deactivate-mark))))) 
 ​
 Mark a formula in any buffer, press C-c c to insert &quot; &#x3D; result&quot; to the right of the region. This will insert the result with 2 digits after the decimal-point. If called with C-u number C-c c it will insert the result with the specified Number of digits after the decimal point.

                              <span>A common task I have when refactoring some code is to search for an occurrence of some text in the codebase and then look at or update the code at that point. For example, I might want to check every use of a certain library is being used in a thread-safe manner.
 So I search for this string - e.g. using consult-git-grep - and I get a list of results. I go to the first result, then do my thing. Now I want to go to the second item in the search and I have to search again.
 Emacs of course makes this as painless as possible since I can do M-p to yoink the previous search term, but it&#x27;s still a bit inconvenient to have to search again multiple times. I also lose my place in the search list.
 I was wondering if there was a better way of doing this. E.g. is there a way of telling the minibuffer to stay open, so if I search for something I can go through the list methodically?
 Or maybe there&#x27;s a package that handles this nicely, or is there a better way of using the tools?

                              <span>Hello guys :) 
 I&#x27;m trying to make dev env for programming with typescript
 I used &#x60;tide&#x60; and &#x60;flycheck&#x60;.
 To get popup window when my cursor hovers error part, I also installed &#x60; flycheck-pos-tip&#x60;.
 I was able to get popup window; however, I am only able to config its background, foreground color.
 ​
 popup with error message
 Even if I enlarge text in buffer by using &#x60;cmd-+&#x60; only text in buffer gets larger but text in popup stays in same size.
 Which config should I touch to get bigger error message?
 Thanks for reading

 Is this possible to achieve this somehow?

                              <span>I am trying to build an AST using tree-sitter and I found related nodes which seemingly has what I need. 
 Edit: I am basically redoing this since I made some progress but am getting unexpected results.
 Here is a function that I believe should be getting the parent type, starting/ending position and the parent node. That being said, my output isn&#x27;t actually giving me the parent node. My output is 
 Parent node:#, type: modifiers, start: 46, end: 59
  (defun testing/AST-parent () &quot;Return parent node of the tree-sitter node at point.&quot; (interactive) (setq get-parent (tsc-get-parent (tree-sitter-node-at-pos (thing-at-point &#x27;symbol)))) (if get-parent (progn (setq parent-type (tsc-node-type get-parent)) (setq parent-start (tsc-node-start-position get-parent)) (setq parent-end (tsc-node-end-position get-parent)) (message &quot;Parent node:%s, type: %s, start: %s, end: %s&quot; get-parent parent-type parent-start parent-end)) (message &quot;No parent node&quot;))) 
 Edit 2: Solved it! Below is the code that will get the parent node of the node under the cursor. If anyone more knowledgeable on tree-sitter has a better idea to solve this then I&#x27;m all ears, but for now this is what I got: 
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; (defun testing/AST-parent () &quot;Return parent node of the tree-sitter node at point.&quot; (interactive) (let ((node (tree-sitter-node-at-pos))) (if node (message &quot;%s&quot; (tsc-node-type (tsc-get-parent (tsc-get-parent node)))) (message &quot;No parent node at point&quot;))))

                              <span>XFTP is a new file transfer protocol focussed on meta-data protection - it is based on the same principles as SimpleX Messaging Protocol used in SimpleX Chat messenger:
  
asynchronous file delivery - the sender does not need to be online for file to be received, it is stored on XFTP relays for a limited time (currently, it is 48 hours) or until deleted by the sender.
 padded e2e encryption of file content.
 content padding and fixed size chunks sent via different XFTP relays, assembled back into the original file by the receiving client.
 efficient sending to multiple recipients (the file needs to be uploaded only once).
 no identifiers or ciphertext in common between sent and received relay traffic, same as for messages delivered by SMP relays.
 protection of sender IP address from the recipients.
  
You can download XFTP CLI (Linux) to send files via the command line here - you need the file named xftp-ubuntu-20_04-x86-64, rename it to xftp.
 Send the file in 3 steps:
  
to send: xftp send filename.ext
 to share: pass the generated file description(s) to the recipient(s) via any secure channel, e.g. via SimpleX Chat.
 to receive: xftp recv rcvN.xftp
  
Please let us know what you think, what downsides you see to this approach, and any ideas you have about how it can be improved.
 We are currently integrating the support of XFTP protocol into SimpleX Chat that will allow sending videos and large files seamlessly and without the sender being online - it is coming soon!

 sfOffice name &#x3D; if lastName  nyOffice &quot;sf&quot; -&gt; sfOffice &quot;reno&quot; -&gt; renoOffice _ -&gt; (\name -&gt; (fst name) ++ &quot; &quot; ++ (snd name)) addressLetter name location &#x3D; locationFunction name where locationFunction &#x3D; getLocationFunction location &gt;&gt; addressLetter (&quot;Bob&quot;,&quot;Smith&quot;) &quot;ny&quot; &quot;Bob Smith: PO Box 789 - New York, NY, 10013&quot; 
 The author then writes the following:
  
Now that you’ve separated each function needed for generating addresses, you can easily add new rules as they come in from each office.
  
While I&#x27;m understanding the code itself, I have problems to apply what the author has written.
 Where would you add new rules? Would you write a new rule function and pass it down to the nyOffice for example? This approach doesn&#x27;t seem to scale well if you add several rules.

                              <span>https://hackage.haskell.org/package/sorting-network repo: https://github.com/Javran/sorting-network (PRs are welcome!)
 I have this idea of using TH to turn sorting network into partial sort functions for small lists (2 - 16 elements) for a while. Not many resources turn up with I searched Haskell topics on this so I got my hands dirty. I&#x27;m happy with the performance (see some benchmark output below) with my proof-of-concept code, so I decided to turn this into a package (apologies that I didn&#x27;t spend much work on documenting, in my defense I&#x27;m quite excited to share it - expect quality to improve in future releases).
 To use this, import Data.SortingNetwork to bring into scope functions like sortList4By :: (a -&gt; a -&gt; Ordering) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [a] (partial function) and sortTup4By :: (a -&gt; a -&gt; Ordering) -&gt; (a, a, a, a) -&gt; (a, a, a, a) (supporting list / tuple of 2 - 16 elements, but TH module is exported so you can generate more).
 To explain how it works, the implementation took some inspiration from https://doisinkidney.com/posts/2018-05-06-sorting-small.html. For a input size 3, a sorting network (more specifically, my package uses https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batcher_odd%E2%80%93even_mergesort - I&#x27;ll try to try to have optimal network and other varieties in future releases) would compare and conditionally swap a-b, a-c, b-c in that order (I&#x27;m kinda relying on optimization to figure out data dependencies and take advantage of parallelism). And the TH generates function like below (name shadowing is intentional for demostration, although in code I do ensure that all new variables are fresh):
 sortTup3By &#x3D; \cmp (a, b, c) -&gt; let sw &#x3D; \u v f -&gt; if cmp u v &#x3D;&#x3D; GT then f v u else f u v in sw a b \a b -&gt; sw a c \a c -&gt; sw b c \b c -&gt; (a, b, c) 
 Unit tests are complete coverage based on 0-1 principle.
 Benchmark output is available: https://gist.github.com/Javran/95cf757866668e43fe188d70f25c1c05 (comparing with Data.List.sort)

 Over the past weeks I&#x27;ve posted about state machines in the context of testing, supervision, hot-code swapping and async I/O.
 Today I&#x27;d like to share an experiment in how we can combine state machines into parallel pipelines in a declarative way:
 https://github.com/stevana/pipelined-state-machines#pipelined-state-machines
 I&#x27;ve tried to structure the readme as a self-contained blog post, with motivation, commented code, suggestions for possible extensions and questions that I don&#x27;t know the answer to yet.
 I hope you find it interesting and I&#x27;m looking forward to hearing your feedback!

 Since it only uses high school algebra and basic arithmetic, certain liberties have been taken. Some things have been handwaved. This is intentional. 
 If you have suggestions on how to improve this, please keep in mind the high school algebra limitation. It should either be things that remove unnecessary parts so there&#x27;s less to remember or things that explain it in even plainer language. The people who didn&#x27;t get it were having trouble with the functor section, so I know that needs to be reworked. Please don&#x27;t say I need to add natural transformations. That …</span>

                              <span>I have been trying to learn scala using YouTube tutorials, and ALL I WANT is to be able to open a page, write scala in it, and run it to get an output. I cannot do this, and it&#x27;s driving me nuts!
 There&#x27;s often some jiffy about a build something or other, or it just says &#x27;internal error&#x27;.
 I have metals installed and do open a new scala project on that tab, and import the build it suggests in the pop-up, but I simply cannot work out how to open a worksheet and just write the language and get it to run. I feel seriously stupid xD
 Any help would be very much appreciated indeed.

                              <span>The current version of Veautiful and Doctacular have been tagged as 0.3.0 and released to maven central. (Substantially the same as 0.3-M6, but with a non-milestone release version number)
 com.wbillingsley %%% veautiful % 0.3.0
 com.wbillingsley %%% doctacular % 0.3.0
 Docs here: https://www.wbillingsley.com/veautiful/
 API here: https://javadoc.io/doc/com.wbillingsley/veautiful_sjs1_3
 https://javadoc.io/doc/com.wbillingsley/doctacular_sjs1_3 
 Veautiful is a &quot;low level control, high level ease of use&quot; front-end library
 Doctacular is a set of components/classes for it that are particularly useful for building teaching materials (e.g. interactive slide decks and tutorials, teaching sites driven by a table of contents)
 They are substantially the same as 0.3-M6.
 Our (southern) autumn teaching trimester has just started, so my focus switches a little from updating the library to the sites that are built using it. i.e. the next release might not be for a few months, as the current one has enough for what I&#x27;m teaching at the moment.

                              <span>I just started using org mode for a way to structure my thoughts and plan programming features (for writing design docs / RFCs).
 When doing that, I often end up realising I need to pop a TODO in the middle of a thought / text. Now, I do understand that I can make a header be a TODO -&gt; but in this case I will often be in the middle of the bullet point list, or middle of paragraph, and I Just want to pop a TODO there to work more on that piece or to reconsider something later. Kind of like leaving breadcrumbs for later, since I usually do many passes through this document until I completely refine it.
 Of course, I can just write TODO, but then it is not recognized as a TODO by org, and I would like to be able to get a list of all TODOs, mark them as done, move from one to the other, have them nicely syntax highlighted, ... .
 Any advice how to go about this? Should I be doing this in Org in some other way?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Curious as to how I can do this better.
 I&#x27;m using a Windows client to access various headless, Linux-based development servers. In many cases I want to edit a file on the remote server, using Emacs.
 Currently, I have just been using SSH (PuTTY) with X11 forwarding enabled. I simply SSH to my target, open the file, and voila Emacs is drawn on my local/Windows client. When I&#x27;m on the same local network as the development servers, this works fine.
 When I&#x27;m connecting remotely (VPN), oftentimes a much slower connection, this can get a little ugly. It works, yes, but can be painfully slow. For example, hitting page up inside Emacs may take a couple of seconds to draw. This creates the need for some very delicate typing/selecting of text.
 How can I improve this setup? I have started to research emacsclient (to run in Windows) to potentially connect to Emacs on the Linux side (running in daemon mode), but I&#x27;m not sure that this is actually the correct approach. It doesn&#x27;t totally make sense to me, as the file I&#x27;m trying to open is located on the daemon/Linux side (not Windows). Any help is appreciated!

                              <span>When I do ctrl + space to begin selecting a region of text sometimes a nasty bug happens. When I press the up arrow or down arrow to extend the selected region, it sometimes gets &quot;locked&quot; and continues forever as if the arrow key has been held down constantly. This locks out the emacs window as it goes on scrolling up or down forever increasing the selected region. It does not respond to any user input or a ctrl -g break. Any ideas what&#x27;s wrong ? Usually once it&#x27;s reached the top or bottom of the buffer the control eventually returns to the user.

                              <span>Hello, 
 I&#x27;ve just joined a new company and the code is indented with only 2 spaces which hurts my feelings, and doesn&#x27;t help readability in my opinion. 
 Since I can&#x27;t really change this, is it possible to use 2 spaces as the indentation style but makes it appear wider? For ex: 2 spaces could look like 4 (only for indentation spaces)

                              <span>A few years ago there were a few attempts to get Emacs to run in a browser. These were exploratory and did not seem to go anywhere. Has something more sophisticated emerged? The idea of running a fully fledged Emacs in my browser appeals to me, especially when considering portability. I would appreciate some ideas and suggestions along these lines. 
 Many thanks.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been using the Hyper modifier for ages, as a place to put personal bindings. I have xkb rules set up to remap a physical key to the modifier.
 Long story short, since upgrading to Emacs 28.2, the Hyper modifier hasn&#x27;t been working right. Certain combinations, like H-e work fine, while other combinations like H-i do not. C-h k shows that Emacs gets an unmodified i, but a correctly modified H-e. xev shows that the Hyper keycode is being emitted consistently.
 If I change my X session to start an xterm instead of Emacs, then launch Emacs from the xterm, the modifier works perfectly. But when it&#x27;s started directly in my session, it works inconsistently.
 I haven&#x27;t changed any other part of my setup, other than upgrading Emacs.
 Any thoughts what might be wrong here?

                              <span>Hey there,
 What I Did:
  
I first made sure I had WSL2 installed, and updated, etc.
 I then installed &#x27;Ubuntu 22.04&#x27; from the Microsoft Store (had to hit Ctrl-C to get it to prompt for the username and password part of the installation, but it worked).
 I then followed this guide:
 https://emacsredux.com/blog/2021/12/19/using-emacs-on-windows-11-with-wsl2/
  
​
 Current Issue:
  
My current issue is that I don&#x27;t see the default Emacs icon appear in the Start Menu on Windows 10.

 Related Output:
  
Here is the related output for any of the &#x27;.desktop&#x27; icons that are present on that Ubuntu-22.04 WSL2 install:

 If I misspell either of them in the list, it doesn&#x27;t actually throw the error, which leads me to believe that whatever matching is necessary for this to work is going on, I&#x27;ve just done something weird.
 Here&#x27;s the code, for reference. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve done anything particularly weird, and I&#x27;ve stared at this for a while with no luck. The transient actually works, it&#x27;s just that the incompatibility doesn&#x27;t, so I&#x27;m still manually setting and unsetting the client and server flags. Not …</span>

                              <span>I often find emacs not responding recently after leaving it idle for a while. I would press CTRL+G a few times, and emacs would be back to normal. 
 I would like to know what exactly got cancelled when I pressed CTRL+G. how do I do that?

                              <span>For those who watched Vitalli Honta presentation about ZIO + Temporal.io in the last Functional Scala (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;8MUnEahr5tk), I started playing with it and set a sample app which aims to follow the original Temporal examples and adding functionality on top of it.
 Vitalii helped me on some points I was struggling but I&#x27;ve managed to make an app which has three modules, one as the worker, another a CLI client and last a REST server which listens to an API using zio-http and fires workflows to the Temporal cluster. The app also publishes Prometheus metrics using zio-metrics.

 The code is at: https://github.com/carlosedp/zio-temporal-hello and I look for feedback and ideas.

 Randomly stumbled on this part of the org mode manual:
  
11.4.2 Time-of-day specifications 
 Org mode checks each agenda item for a time-of-day specification. The time can be part of the timestamp that triggered inclusion into the agenda, for example 
  
 Time ranges can be specified with two timestamps: 
 -- 
 In the headline of the entry itself, a time(range)—like ‘12:45’ or a ‘8:30-1pm’—may also appear as plain text.
  
Which means I don&#x27;t have to fiddle with timestamp creation to adjust my times for tasks/events and I don&#x27;t have to worry about going in to a file after capturing something to finish putting in a time range. All I need is a date stamp on a headline and this will work automatically. (You can disable this behavior by setting org-agenda-search-headline-for-time to nil.)
 Somehow I hadn&#x27;t come across this feature before. I&#x27;ve recently gotten more into managing time/time blocking in my org agenda and this was a useful enough discovery that I thought I&#x27;d share!

                              <span>I wanted to get hands dirty of calling GHC Wasm Module from browser, here is what I got and I&#x27;d like to share my experience. I might be rebuilding some wheels here, please let me and everyone know!

 Browser to Haskell Wasm Reactor Module Communication Example
 Setup Using Nix
  nix shell https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc-wasm-meta/-/archive/master/ghc-wasm-meta-master.tar.gz 
 Read more about GHC Wasm: https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc-wasm-meta.
 Run the Demo
 Build
  $ make 
 Serve
 Using python http.server:
  $ make serve 
 Test
 Visit http://localhost:8000/ from your browser and open console.
 You should see the output:
  echo: hello world client.js:67:12 size before 0 client.js:68:12 size after 2 client.js:71:12 a&#x3D; 42 client.js:72:12 b&#x3D; 21 client.js:73:12 c&#x3D;  
 What Was Done
  
A toy Store.hs providing a wasm-independent save2/load2/size2 API globally.
 A WasmComm.hs module that exports Store.hs module through FFI.
 It uses wasm32-wasi-ghc to build a wasm reactor module that exports for Javascript VM to use.
 Browser client library uses browser_wasi_shim to communicate with the module.
  
Javascript String Hurdle
 The biggest challenge is that in order to pass Javascript string between the Wasm Module and Javascript VM, we need to play with the linear memory model of wasm.
 This example creates a few ad-hoc wrapper function to help with the alloc/free memory management convention for the functions exported by the Haskell wasm reactor module.
 Here is an example of how to wrap the Haskell save function as store_save for Javascript usage:
 haskell foreign export ccall save :: CString -&gt; CString -&gt; IO () 
 javascript function store_load(k) { return fromCString(withCString(k, k &#x3D;&gt; inst.exports.load(k))); } 
 Check the client.js for more information about how fromCString and withCString is implemented.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been looking at various options for a little while, in particular regarding an SQL solution like Postgres or SQLite.
 From my browsing I stumbled upon a list of libraries which I&#x27;m currently taking into account.
  
selda (Postgres, SQLite)
 persistent (Postgres, SQLite, MySql, MongoDB)
 beam (Postgres, SQLite)
  
Do you have experience with one or multiple of these libraries? Let me know what you prefer.
 From looking at the manuals quickly I liked selda the best, but maybe you know better than me :)

                              <span>I&#x27;ve wanted to have a reason to do Haskell for some time now, the type system and guarantees are just too good. I have used some Haskell-like languages and I liked it. I also prefer functional programming to others. However, I came to realize, having a dynamic type system is a headache and missed type guarantees. 
 So now, I want to try to give Haskell a try. I read a little on DataHaskell, but not sure yet.
 I just want a language that can replace python as my exploration language. I mainly use the jax (functional-style) library anyway. I&#x27;m not going to do big neural networks (I plan to use another language for that case), and my interest lies in small machine learning scales (think of toy problems).
 With this, is haskell okay for this? 
 Further background: I have been trying languages here and there (for varying purposes) and I usually go back to a non-functional language just because of the lack of libraries or development or !documentation (Elm, ML-based languages, etc).
 Maybe Haskell, being very rich in types... can it type check matrix types(shapes) (or can I write them my own)?

                              <span>Left folds are by default defined via right folds in base, because this way left folds play better with fusion as explained in the Call Arity paper:
  
Call Arity was devised mainly to allow for a fusing foldl, i.e. a definition of foldl in terms of foldr that takes part in list fusion while still producing good code.
  
E.g. the default definition of Data.Foldable.foldl&#x27; is 
 foldl&#x27; :: (b -&gt; a -&gt; b) -&gt; b -&gt; t a -&gt; b foldl&#x27; f z0 xs &#x3D; foldr f&#x27; id xs z0 where f&#x27; x k z &#x3D; k $! f z x 
 On the other hand the default definition of Data.Foldable.foldl1 is this:
 foldl1 :: Foldable t &#x3D;&gt; (a -&gt; a -&gt; a) -&gt; t a -&gt; a foldl1 f xs &#x3D; fromMaybe (errorWithoutStackTrace &quot;foldl1: empty structure&quot;) (foldl mf Nothing xs) where mf m y &#x3D; Just (case m of Nothing -&gt; y Just x -&gt; f x y) 
 Why not something like
 foldl1 :: Foldable t &#x3D;&gt; (a -&gt; a -&gt; a) -&gt; t a -&gt; a foldl1 f xs &#x3D; foldr step (const id) xs (const id) $ errorWithoutStackTrace &quot;foldl1: empty structure&quot; where step x k f&#x27; z &#x3D; k f (f&#x27; z x) {-# INLINE step #-} {-# INLINE foldl1 #-} 
 ? The latter seems like it would play much better with fusion. I didn&#x27;t check, but perhaps it&#x27;s more efficient too? Both versions generalize trivially to foldl1&#x27;, which would be great to add to base if only to define maximumBy and minimumBy in terms of it. Those are currently defined as
 maximumBy :: Foldable t &#x3D;&gt; (a -&gt; a -&gt; Ordering) -&gt; t a -&gt; a maximumBy cmp &#x3D; fromMaybe (errorWithoutStackTrace &quot;maximumBy: empty structure&quot;) . foldl&#x27; max&#x27; Nothing where max&#x27; mx y &#x3D; Just $! case mx of Nothing -&gt; y Just x -&gt; case cmp x y of GT -&gt; x _ -&gt; y {-# INLINEABLE maximumBy #-} minimumBy :: Foldable t &#x3D;&gt; (a -&gt; a -&gt; Ordering) -&gt; t a -&gt; a minimumBy cmp &#x3D; fromMaybe (errorWithoutStackTrace &quot;minimumBy: empty structure&quot;) . foldl&#x27; min&#x27; Nothing where min&#x27; mx y &#x3D; Just $! case mx of Nothing -&gt; y Just x -&gt; case cmp x y of GT -&gt; y _ -&gt; x {-# INLINEABLE minimumBy #-} 
 Or am I missing something?

Using an external keyboard works but i would prefer not having to carry one around all the time. Therefore im looking for a way to force Android to show the virtual keboard permanently. Any ideas on how to do so?

                              <span>Hey there,
 So basically, the Emacs theme I created is fine for Org Mode and some modes, but it sucks for vterm usage, especially for &#x27;curses&#x27; style terminal programs where its just blindingly bad.
 I don&#x27;t have the time to configure the theme correctly, so I would prefer the following:
  
Is it possible to just set a different theme for &#x27;vterm&#x27; vs have a different theme for &#x27;Org Mode&#x27; etc?
  
​
 Thanks!

                              <span>Pretty much the title. I&#x27;m considering moving away from Kitty to Emacs, and I saw some cool things with eshell. However the video seemed to imply that eshell is a shell and not a terminal. But it seems vterm doesn&#x27;t really provide support for doing stuff like capturing output like eshell does. So I&#x27;m kinda confused.

                              <span>Let&#x27;s say I have two files: A and B. There is a org mode subtree in A, and it is a TODO item.
 A file contains the original TODO subtree, and I want to display that subtree in the buffer of B in a particular place. When the task is over, for example, if I was to change the state to &#x27;DONE&#x27;, I would like the changes to be reflected to the buffer of B file. How should I go about this?
 Maybe a better explanation would be this: I want to reference a subtree from another file, where the changes I make on one would be reflected on the other.
 File A... * All Tasks ** TODO my task 1 node id: 123123123 buy some important stuff ------------------------------------------------------------ File B... * Some tasks about household ... reference subtree 123123123 ... (The buffer should display this as:) ** TODO my task 1 node id: 123123123 buy some important stuff

                              <span>Hi everyone !
 I struggled to find some resources on the subject, so I&#x27;m looking for help.
 In org-mode, i would like to export in pdf a document with and without headlines tagged differently in two or more separated files.
 For example, if we considered this file, named a_dumb_example.org :
  
# Headline one :foo: 
 Some contents 
 # Headline two :bar: 
 Another contents
  
I would like to export it in two files :
  
a_dumb_example_foo.pdf : containing only the contents of the first headline
 a_dumb_example_bar.pdf : containing only the contents of the second headline
  
It&#x27;s seemed like you can do almost anything with elisp, but i can&#x27;t manage to find anything. Theses days, as I mentioned in another post (https://www.reddit.com/r/orgmode/comments/10fyjyc/comment/j5edzha/?utm_source&#x3D;share&amp;utm_medium&#x3D;web2x&amp;context&#x3D;3) I do everything this manually, but I want to speed up the process. 
 Any hints ?

                              <span>I know I can set for the whole document like this:
 #+TODO: TASK | IN-PROGRESS | IN-REVIEW | DONE 
 But I want some subtrees to have different TODO sequences/keywords, so they would be scoped to a subtree.
 One way I found was to set the sequences I&#x27;d use in the document like this:
 #+TODO: TASK | IN-PROGRESS | IN-REVIEW | DONE #+TODO: TODO | DONE 
 This way the TODOs would have both sequences, but maybe there&#x27;s a better way to achieve that?
 Ideally, it would be a property where I could set the steps/keywords there, like I can do with :LOGGING: so I would avoid cycling the wrong sequence in the subtrees.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been an org-mode user for a long time, but have really under-used one of its major features: tags.
 Now after all these years, I&#x27;m starting to get in to heavy tags usage, and wanted to ask the emacs community what are some of the most useful, efficient or interesting ways to use, search, or manipulate tags?
 Are there any exceptionally useful workflows or extensions to tags or tag search/creation/manipulation out there?

 When I do org-roam-ui-open, it opens the url http://localhost:35901/ in firefox.
 Has anyone able to open this url into an emacs buffer ? I was unable to open it even with eww.

                              <span>Emacs newbie here, be gentle. I&#x27;m rewriting my config and trying to keep packages to a minimum. Since I want to use emacs as an IDE, I want to install eglot for the LSP client and company to have a better completion UI. I went with eglot over lsp mode because I have previously used lsp mode and it seemed slow. Plus, eglot is shipping with emacs 29 by default, which means it is good enough to be included in emacs, so I might as well use it.
 Anyway, I do the typical thing. M-x package-install RET eglot RET. Gets installed from elpa as expected. Same with company: M-x package-install RET company RET. They both work, all is good, but upon restarting, they&#x27;re not longer there.
 After some head scratching I realized they are not being initialized. After running package-initialize they both work again. If I add that same function to the end of my init.el, then it works. But why? The package-enable-at-startup variable is set to true, as it should.
 Here&#x27;s my config, it&#x27;s not very big.
 Also as an extra. Anyway to move the eln-cache folder? Thanks.
 EDIT: I know the packages.el file isn&#x27;t being loaded. That&#x27;s fine, I&#x27;m not done with it yet. I have installed the packages manually with the built-in package manager.

 I want to exclude the hidden directories. Can I achieve this with directory-files-recursive? It seems the regexp is only applied to the basenames, without the paths. 
 Thanks.

                              <span>I&#x27;m 8 year web developer mainly in JS/TS. I really enjoy learning scala and realize I can use it to model a problem in a more clean, abstract way, and it gives more customizability than JS/TS can ever give.
 Now with some burnout from web dev I want to explore backend development but I have very limited experience on that domain. So I&#x27;m thinking maybe getting a certificate can help me start, need some suggestions.

                              <span>Hi all!
 Tried to come up with fs2-kafka study case that touches:
 1. ADT-events serialization with self-crafted lib.
 2. at-least-once consumption and idempotent writes.
 3. offset commitment optimization.
 I hope it&#x27;ll be helpful for somebody :)

                              <span>I&#x27;m sure many people are familiar with Li Haoyi&#x27;s excellent article, &quot;Benchmarking Scala Collections,&quot; which can be found at https://www.lihaoyi.com/post/BenchmarkingScalaCollections.html. However, the article was written six years ago for Scala 2.11 and an unspecified version of the JDK. Time flies so fast! Regardless, I have taken the time to update the old benchmark to Scala 3, added some new tests, and run it on Scala 3.2.2 and JDK 19.0.1.
 Here are results: https://gist.github.com/scf37/36a86427697bcf1fdae161edbc2bb2c9
 Some conclusions:
 - mutable.Map and mutable.Set are no slower than their immutable counterparts on all operations
 - Lookups on immutable Maps/Sets are 5 times slower
 - foreach is good enough on Scala collections but is horrible on arrays
 - Vector lookup performance is much closer to HashMap than to mutable.Buffer
 - mutable collections are as fast as their Java counterparts

                              <span>So, there I was moving along, minding my own business, not doing anything that should cause this error, and then shazam. I am now unable to execute the function &quot;org-insert-heading&quot;. 
 Debugger entered--Lisp error: (wrong-type-argument listp t) 
 org--blank-before-heading-p(nil) 
 org-insert-heading(nil) 
 funcall-interactively(org-insert-heading nil) 
 call-interactively(org-insert-heading) 
 org-meta-return() 
 hsys-org-meta-return() 
 eval((hsys-org-meta-return)) 
 actype:act(hsys-org-meta-return) 
 apply(actype:act hsys-org-meta-return) 
 hact(hsys-org-meta-return) 
 smart-org() 
 eval((smart-org)) 
 hkey-execute(nil)

 action-key() 
 hkey-either(nil) 
 funcall-interactively(hkey-either nil) 
 call-interactively(hkey-either nil nil) 
 command-execute(hkey-either)
 Does anyone have an idea what is causing this? I know this is a type error, but I do not understand what could be causing it?

                              <span>Q1: Is it possible for a given type idea to determine the necessary methods to create an Algebraic Data Type using a standard method? Put the other way around, is it possible, using any standard method, to create all the methods needed to have a complete ADT?
 Q2: Is there, in the abstract, some complete set of method factors to create a complete ADT without knowing much of anything about the type?
 I know what I&#x27;m asking is sort of like how one goes about solving a Rubik&#x27;s cube having seen only the final position desired and knowing how the cube can be moved. But, any input on this may be helpful.

                              <span>I had done some search here and on the internet, finding some talks, articles resources such as [1][2][3][4]. While they are good, somehow I feel something is missing based on my current level - a person who has experience and works on Scala projects, but still feels himself lacking of &quot;something&quot; or advance knowledge.
 For instance, [1] is nice which helps me get started in understanding the differences between OOP and FP when applying related concepts. [2] is also good that points out some usages that I was not aware of like case class&#x27;s copy. [3] and [4] are probably the resources that are closest to my expectation because I am looking for materials that I don&#x27;t need to rely on third party library, and can build/ design the artifact of my own after learning; however, [3] seemingly is not finished while [4] looks like a starting point.
 So I would like to know if any recommended resources (doc, links, videos, and so on) of such topics that fill in this gap? Or diving the library such as cats is the only way to go? I appreciate any suggestions, and commentary.

 also if I do have to rewrite by variables do I have refactor only the user inputs into C and then convert them into regular scala types or do I have to refactor all the variables in my code?

 His PPA seems to be the one suggested in every &quot;how to install Emacs&quot; guide. Is there a fork or recommended alternative that is maintained?

I&#x27;d like to replicate what they do but in vanilla emacs, but am having trouble following and understanding what exactly is going on in his org file. Are there other resources which explain this and are geared more towards beginners?

 Although I haven&#x27;t actually tested them, I consider the logic right, it is the logical and execution semantics that I suspect may be wrong. 
 If one or both is correct then what could be improved about them.

                              <span>I just got a message from Tarsius because I&#x27;m sponsoring him. This is what it says:
 &quot;Recently GitHub announced that GitHub Sponsors is going to abruptly stop accepting PayPal payments on February 23, 2023.
 &quot;In the three days since, I have already lost a dozen sponsors. If this continues at this rate, I am going to loose over half my sponsors on this platform.
 &quot;This is a huge issue for me. These donations are not just a nice extra but how I make a living. I already have to get by with an income that is way below minimal wage, so losing sponsors in great numbers really hurts. I receive about 80% of all donations through Github Sponsors, losing between 50% and 75% of that, would mean I cannot pay my bills anymore.
 &quot;If you are currently using PayPal, then please take some time to switch to another payment method, either here on GitHub, or by using one of the many other options donation options.&quot;
  
My personal opinion as a professional developer and one among many donators is that I couldn&#x27;t survive my work without the help of Magit. It allows me to be really effective and to find new Git tricks.
 If you are using Paypal as a payment method in Github, please switch to another way of donating. And if you&#x27;re not donating, this would be a great time to start.
 Donate to Magit!

                              <span>Hello, the use-package documentation says that we should use the :init keyword to execute code before the package is loaded. In the use-package documentation, those are usually variables set before the package is loaded, but can be functions to enable a certain mode as well.
 However, I&#x27;ve noticed for example on the Vertico GitHub page, vertico-mode is enabled in :init but it works perfectly fine when enabled in :config as well. The package is not deferred so I don&#x27;t see a reason to put vertico-mode within :init.
 There are situations when using :init makes sense because the package is deferred. For example :bind automatically defers a package.
 (use-package ef-themes :init (load-theme &#x27;ef-summer t) :bind (&quot;&quot; . ef-themes-select)) 
 If I wouldn&#x27;t use :init in this situation, the theme wouldn&#x27;t load until F9 is pressed.
 Please correct me if I&#x27;m wrong. Also, is it true that overusing :init can cause Emacs to start a little slower? I&#x27;ve seen it mentioned by someone here on Reddit, but I don&#x27;t have the link anymore.

I have several nerd fonts (supporting ligatures) installed using Arch packages from the Nerd Fonts repository:
  
FiraCode
 
Jetbrains Mono
 
Cascadia Code
 
 They work as expected with other applications. In particular Firefox is fine, my terminal (kitty) and OpenOffice Writer are all fine too.
 However under emacs from time-to-time the characters will become extremely squashed together, overlap and have minimal character width.
 This happens with all of those fonts, although I&#x27;ve found Fira Code to be more volatile than the others. I&#x27;m using Mickey Petersen&#x27;s ligature package with the following configuration:

                              <span>Yesterday, I watched a talk by Tony Buzan at Poland&#x27;s SWPS University, which I came across on YouTube, reminding me of the importance of colour in understanding and recall.
Whilst at school several decades ago, I became very keen on Tony Buzan&#x27;s methods popularised by his 1974 BBC television series Use Your Head, in which he encouraged people to use colourful mindmaps and speedreading, among other techniques, to better understand and remember anything they were studying.  At the time, I was a failing student.  So, even though most students and staff saw his techniques as weird, I decided to give them ago.  To my astonishment, by applying just a couple of his key techniques, I quickly started getting top marks and with less effort.  So, I have no doubt Tony&#x27;s methods have merit.
It would therefore be beneficial to introduce coloured text into The Archive app by using some simple markup code.
Even a limited pallet would be helpful, perhaps just red, green and blue, although the more colours, the better.  Something like for red text, for blue text, etc., would be enough.  But hex codes would allow for a more extensive pallet.
Would coloured text in The Archive app be possible?
Tony Buzan&#x27;s talk at SWPS University can be seen here:  https://youtu.be/QEokHNWf-Qg.
And his 1974 BBC television series Use Your Head, is available here: https://youtu.be/EgG8GuQHHIs.</span>

                              <span>I write notes in org mode and I like using special blocks for theorem environments. One thing I was interested in was defining custom indentation for an &quot;algorithm&quot; special block. The idea would be to define a list of keywords that, if typed within a block, that after pressing Enter on that each subsequent line the cursor would be indented until the an end keyword is reached at which point the indentation would stop. I know of psedudocode-mode (although I do not know if this can be used in an org file), but the idea would be to do something similar to that. Any guidance would be appreciated. Thanks.

 I made a highlighting tool, so I can more comfortably emphazise text in org-mode. I wanted to have this functionality when I started using org-mode and finally came across a way to implement it.
 https://preview.redd.it/og7xv5anmeka1.png?width&#x3D;3076&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;95997bb91b22e1c495c23c276f29d0e87ad790c3
 The functionality has been realised with a slightly modified version of org-extra-emphasise to use less intrucive emphasize symbols then in the unmodified version and hydra to get the pop up menu.

                              <span>Hi everyone!
 In my humble opinion, the design of NANO Emacs by u/Nicolas-Rougier is probably the best one out there. However, I could never really use NANO Emacs because I require Doom Emacs, which, on the other hand, has the best configuration framework :)
 Hence, I decided to port the NANO modeline and themes for Doom Emacs. The former is adapted to display information about the Evil state. The latter uses the Doom themes framework, making everything work out-of-the-box in Doom Emacs.
 If you want to try, those are the repository:
 https://github.com/ronisbr/doom-nano-themes
 https://github.com/ronisbr/doom-nano-modeline
 These are works in progress and probably have many bugs and inconsistencies.

                              <span>Can anyone help me figure out what I&#x27;m doing wrong? I recently upgraded to Emacs 28.2 on two machines and while native compilation works when I run it manually, it doesn&#x27;t seem to work automatically with packages installed through package.el or with any of my personal libraries. I&#x27;ve left all the relevant variables at their default values and still haven&#x27;t seen any package compiled natively in either installation. Is there something else I can do to get it to work? Any help would be much appreciated!

                              <span>I&#x27;m wondering if anyone has experience or examples of generating PowerPoint files from org mode outlines?
 In theory to this is possible with ox-pandoc, but the output I got had quite a few formatting problems. But maybe it&#x27;s possible to tune the org file to optimize this?
 Basically I want to make the bullet points and outline for my slides, then move to pptx to tune the appearance, layout, add some pictures, etc.
 Has this been done?

                              <span>I have tried to shift a chunk of my online media consumption to elfeed, so that I can quickly check out blog posts, webcomics, arXiv papers, podcasts and YouTube videos. However, this has meant that updating my feeds has become quite resource intensive, and runs for a few minutes.
  
 My current setup involves 60+ feeds, 20 of which are podcasts and 10 of which are YouTube channels and playlists.
 Playing around with my settings, I now use 
  (elfeed-set-timeout 90) (setq url-queue-timeout 5) (setq elfeed-curl-max-connections 8) 
 and elfeed-search-fetch takes about 5 minutes to run, at about 25% CPU usage across my 4-core i7. I&#x27;ve have the elfeed timeout at 90 seconds as otherwise some feeds simply time out when I try to update them.
 Is there anyway to speed this up, or do I just have far too many feeds (some of which only update e.g. every month)?
  
 One course of action I do is to go to a particular filter setting (which I have stored as a bookmark and access via a shortcut) and do elfeed-search-fetch-visible. I do this for feeds tagged as podcasts for instance, which I check more often than blog posts.
 An alternative that I haven&#x27;t started working on yet is to write something that updates some subset of feeds. I use elfeed-org to manage my list of feeds and their tags, so perhaps there&#x27;s an elegant solution that ties that package into a new fetch function.

                              <span>Writing this down for others because it wasn&#x27;t obvious...
 Usecase: I wanted to take the contents of description lists in a consistent format, have them export normally and use an export filter to parse up the list&#x27;s content for input into a program. After trying numerous export filters (https://orgmode.org/manual/Advanced-Export-Configuration.html), the common ones weren&#x27;t satisfying as they lost formatting on export or would&#x27;ve caused me to write a significantly more error-prone filter than I wanted.
 The solution: wrap each section in a special block (https://orgmode.org/manual/Special-blocks-in-LaTeX-export.html) so you keep formatting and can group all the text together.
 Relevant aside: my usecase would&#x27;ve been trivial if either of orgmode supported either of the following:
  
multiline table cells in the default table type.
 a way to feed table.el tables to src blocks as a parameter.

 Shouldn&#x27;t that prevent flycheck from producing reference to free variable errors?
 When the defvar statements are added directly to file B the errors go away.
 Shouldn&#x27;t the require statements be similar to include commands in other languages in Emacs lisp or is it down to some fault in my configuration?

 I do all my development in a directory that I&#x27;ve named, unsuspringly, /Idevelopment.
 On some of my computers, this might be symlinked to another directory that I may have, say, on a zfs drive. 
 Problem is, Emacs changes the symlink to the canonical form, so when I pull the configuration to another computer, it goes to the wrong place!
 How do I tell Emacs to retain the paths as they are and not go to the canonical versions? After all, I put thoes symlinks there for a reason!

 I read a book and it has examples in Pascal, thus I want to create Pascal snippets.
 Installed FreePascal and it seems like Emacs has a pascal-mode but there is no babel function for it.
 So when I have
 #+begin_src pascal
 #+end_src
 It will not work.
 Any idea? It seems like one has to define the org-babel stuff to trigger the pascal compilation?

                              <span>Currently I am using org roam to manage my knowledge base and add notes from my laptop. But I am now thinking of transitioning my note taking on a tablet or iPad where I can type and draw to take notes. But unfortunately I can&#x27;t use emacs on this and converting my notes is also a hassle. I was looking at other posts comparing emacs to obsidian and logseq, but they always go on tangents and talk about how emacs can do so much more rather than simply focusing on the note taking aspect between emacs and the other applications. So I am uncertain about emacs capabilities just for note taking with tablets and iPads. I was wondering if anyone uses a tablet for their note taking and how they integrate it quickly into their org roam? Or is this best left for obsidian which has an app on the tablet?
 Currently I&#x27;m thinking I take notes in obsidian in tablet/iPad which automatically syncs to my computer where I have a script running to convert it to org. This seems like the fastest and most efficient way of doing things

 When opening emacs, it connects to the repos and the *Messages* buffers indicates org is already installed, so for some reason it doesn&#x27;t want to install the latest version from gnu elpa, which is version 9.6.1, local version for emacs 28.2 is 9.5.5.
 Calling list-packages and installing org manually from there solves the problem. Any ideas on how to make use-package install the gnu elpa version automatically?

                              <span>Org-attach is very useful for embedding images and other files into org headings, especially with the ID flavor, which makes attachment painless. But the hard-coded attachment directory locations creates the real potential for the links to go stale. I think a couple of small additions would go a long way towards hardening org-attach against eventual &quot;stale ID link syndrome&quot;: 
  
It would be very useful to be able to specify the org-attach-id-dir as a file-level setting, ala #+ATTACH-ID-DIR or similar. This would allow you to keep &quot;separate stores&quot; of id-based attachments, so you could move them around. You could do this with a relative path for org-attach-id-dir (though see below), but maybe for some documents you want all their attachments in a fixed location (e.g. ~/org/.attachments) but for others you want them &quot;packaged together&quot; for portability. Maybe this is already possible? The org docs don&#x27;t seem to have a single place documenting all the #+CONFIG: val settings that can appear at the top of the file. 
 
Another related wish which I don&#x27;t think is yet possible: an option to set org-attach-id-dir based on a locate-dominating-file search. So you could have a structure as below, and all the note&#x27;s attachments would be stored and live in the top .attachments/ directory. Then you could happily move portable_dir around, send it to colleagues, etc., and attachment links would never go stale.

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;ve sadly hit a snag in my collaborating-with-Word-users-while-staying-inside-org workflow.
 I have been exporting an org-mode manuscript via &#x60;ox-pandoc&#x60; with good results, but now I need to produce Word &#x27;comments&#x27; from my org source. Pandoc understands these comments, so running pandoc on a &#x60;markdown&#x60; buffer using HTML syntax like this works
 comment This is the text that is commented on.  
 but the same syntax in an org document naturally just inserts the HTML source into the document.
 I&#x27;ve also tried &#x60;#+begin_export pandoc&#x60; block, but that also just inserts the raw source. 
 It seems like pandoc needs something that it understands as org syntax but I&#x27;m stumped.
 Does anyone have any idea if or how this could be achieved?

 Any help or pointers are much appreciated.

                              <span>I am happy to announce the latest release of the Generic-Persistence library!
 A few weeks back I wrote a blog post about my initial ideas for a Haskell persistence layer that uses generics.
 I got positive feedback and some very useful hints. In the meantime, I have been busy and have been able to implement almost all of the suggestions.
 Of course the library is still in an early stage of development. But all test cases are green and it should be ready for early adopters use. 
 Several things are still missing:
  
A query language
 Handling auto-incrementing primary keys
 coding free support for 1:1 and 1:n relationships (using more generics magic)
 schema migration
 ...
  
Feature requests, feedback and pull requests are most welcome!
 The library is available on Hackage:
 https://hackage.haskell.org/package/generic-persistence
 The source code is available on Github:

 I&#x27;m really, really excited to announce the release of Ogma 1.0.7!
 Ogma is a NASA tool that facilitates integrating runtime monitors or runtime verification applications into other systems. Ogma extends Copilot [1], a high-level runtime verification framework that generates hard real-time code.
 In spite of the small increase in the version number, the feature included in this version is big: we now generate monitors for Robot Operating System (ROS 2) applications.
 Use cases supported by Ogma also include generating monitors directly from requirements specified using a structure natural language framework, and producing NASA Core Flight System (cFS) monitoring applications.
 For more details, including videos of monitors being generated and flown in simulators, see: https://github.com/nasa/ogma
 Monitors generated from natural-language requirements using Ogma, running inside X-Plane Flight simulator.
 Releases
 Ogma is released as a collection of packages in Hackage. The entry point is https://hackage.haskell.org/package/ogma-cli.
 Code
 The github repo is located at: https://github.com/nasa/ogma.
 What&#x27;s coming
 The next release is planned for March 21st, 2023.
 Ogma is currently undergoing the qualification process necessary for NASA Class D Software. Apart from the changes required by that process, we also have the following in our roadmap:
  
Extend ROS 2 monitors with further information about sources of violations.
 Add tests to generated code.
 Simplify NASA cFS monitor generation process.
  
Happy Haskelling!

Currently I&#x27;m doing something like this
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;scala val q &#x3D; Q.query[(Int, Int, Int, Int), (Int, String, String)]( &quot;&quot;&quot;SELECT id, first_name, last_name FROM table1 WHERE col1 &#x3D; ? AND col2_uid &#x3D; ?

 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; I don&#x27;t think this is the correct way of doing. In case the query is quite long in case I&#x27;ve to use param repetitively. Please suggest any solution.

                              <span>I learned long ago to use find | xargs grep from a book about Reading Open Source code. Now I often use git grep. Since last year I was working on the ReactJS application and I often used git grep to find something inside the codebase. Sometimes I copied the path to file from Google Chrome dev tools. Those urls often had webpack:// in front.
 I use to copy the path and edit it to open in Emacs. With this code You can just copy and press C-c C-f if the previous file shares a path.

 the force-keys function was created because I was too lazy to edit my other code that used C-c C-f in my .emacs file.

 I have recently discovered that the author, github user nonsequitur, has not updated it in almost 7 years. 
 Is there a more up-to-date fork that other people are using? If there isn&#x27;t, I&#x27;ll create one and maintain it myself.

                              <span>Since we&#x27;ve been talking a lot about completion systems lately, I thought I&#x27;d ask this one. Vertico and icomplete-vertical seem very similar on the surface: they both give a vertical completion system that uses Emacs&#x27;s built-in completing-read, meaning they are both compatible with things like Marginalia and Orderless. icomplete-vertical ships with Emacs, while Vertico is a third-party package. So my question is: why would I use Vertico instead of icomplete-vertical, when they seem to offer basically the same features?

                              <span>I have the following code (not my own) currently which lets me save and export my org file using F5...
  (defun org-export-as-pdf-and-open () (interactive) (save-buffer) (org-open-file (org-latex-export-to-pdf))) (add-hook &#x27;org-mode-hook (lambda() (define-key org-mode-map (kbd &quot;&quot;) &#x27;org-export-as-pdf-and-open))) 
 This is ok, but I&#x27;d prefer to have the pdf preview render on autosaves and the autosave to trigger with each change to the org-file. I&#x27;d also want the pdf preview to automatically scroll to the position that I am typing at. If the same thing could be done with a .tex document (no linked org file), that would also be amazing. Does anyone know how to do this? I am using pdf tools. Thanks.

                              <span>Hello guys, I&#x27;m currently a nvim user and wanted to try emacs because having a gui and lots of non-term based features using keyboard commands seems more convinient for certain jobs.
 I know that emacs is incredibly complex (more than nvim or at least that&#x27;s the consensus) so I wanted to see someone working with it (preferably the doom version) to get a taste of what it can do ane at what speed. 
 I haven&#x27;t been able to find any footage that shows how the emacs workflow goes to judge if it&#x27;s interesting and that&#x27;s basically what I&#x27;m asking for, thanks in advance.

 The awesome part is that building buffers out of an easy-to-select storage (something MANY hate in this community) is damn effective: text is easy to read but not easy to combine on the fly and that&#x27;s an issue no files&amp;dirs text tools can solve, org-ql, org-transclusion are excellent examples of very good tools who can&#x27;t give the same outcome of spit out text from a backend DB.
 The not-so-exiting part is that while notes can be org-mode, they are not actually real org-mode, yes, they got rendered, but I still can&#x27;t manage attachments properly, use a drawer as in org-mode and so on.
 My dream? Simply a note-taking solution that allow FULL Emacs/org-mode features but out of a flexible solution that allow dynamic result buffers out of queries, like notmuch/mu for emails, like ekg for notes and so on, because while text is super flexible is still also limiting in some aspects.
 The purpose of this post is reiterate this long running not so accepted but definitively felt topic on notes seeing the regular evolution of tools who try to be kind-of query-driven (like search&amp;narrow vs menus/taxonomies) and periodically fail to complete the game. I hope a day enough people would accept such storage concept and we will finally see an Emacs-based storage who is actually a kind of DB directly managed in Emacs, with of the flexibility of a DB and the power of elisp. Oh, and I hope to be clear in this quick description as well!

 speedbar-find-file 
 function of speedbar. How to modfiy it to allow opening the new buffer in the PREVIOUS ACTIVE Frame and not the frame speedbar was started from?
 I know how to keep in variable last visited frame, excluding the speedbar frame.
 (defvar my-recent-frames nil)
 ​
 (defun my-frame-record-selected ()
 &quot;Record the currently selected frame. Add this to the focus-in-hook.&quot;
 (let ((f (selected-frame)))
 (if (not (string&#x3D; (frame-parameter f &#x27;name) &quot;Speedbar&quot;))
 (setq my-recent-frames f)
 ;;(print my-recent-frames )
 ​
 ))
 )
 ​
 (add-hook &#x27;focus-in-hook #&#x27;my-frame-record-selected)
 ​
 (defun my-goto-most-recent-frame ()
 &quot;Jump to most recently active frame before the current frame.&quot;
 (interactive)
 (unless (null my-recent-frames)
 (select-frame-set-input-focus my-recent-frames)))
 ​
 ​
 Problem is: where to put the frame restoration code WITHOUT damaging the existing code mechanism.
 ​
 (defun speedbar-find-file (text _token indent)
 &quot;Speedbar click handler for filenames.
 TEXT, the file will be displayed in the attached frame.
 TOKEN is unused, but required by the click handler. INDENT is the
 current indentation level.&quot;
 (let ((cdd (speedbar-line-directory indent)))
 ;; Run before visiting file hook here.
 (let ((f (selected-frame)))
 (dframe-select-attached-frame speedbar-frame)
 (run-hooks &#x27;speedbar-before-visiting-file-hook)

 (speedbar-find-file-in-frame (concat cdd text))
 (speedbar-stealthy-updates)

                              <span>When I press M-. this gray popup opens up, and I can type inside it. Pressing enter will commit its contents to the buffer, M-. or Escape will make it disappear. 
 What is it? Does it have a name? It is preventing me to use this keybinding. Happens even when I run emacs as emacs -q (no config). Picture below.

 I would like to believe it is safe as it is under a reputed repo which is emacs-tree-sitter which recently had tree-sitter merged into main line emacs. 
 Is they any particular reason it is not on public package repos?

                              <span>Hello Emacs Community!, this will be a big post with a lot of questions, that perhaps will show the love I put into this workflow with Emacs.
 -&gt; I use Emacs Doom, version GNU 28.2 in MacOS Ventura 13.2.1. emacs-mac variant installed in it.
 I&#x27;ve worked a lot with Emacs, with a lot of workflows and all, and right now, this is my current workflow with org-mode:
 ​
 - When I get a task, I create an outline with the task description, as well as the timestamp of its creation.
 - I then work into a small description and some checklists - [ ] that I need to work on.
 - Most of my work is remote, and even so, through a middleware server. I use shell sessions for this, which may have some downsides as some garbage string in the result, but usually work pretty fast. Normally I would:

 (setq
 backup-by-copying t ; don&#x27;t clobber symlinks
 backup-directory-alist
 &#x27;((&quot;.&quot; . &quot;~/.saves&quot;)) ; don&#x27;t litter my fs tree
 delete-old-versions t
 kept-new-versions 6
 kept-old-versions 2
 version-control t)
 This sets up a backup for your init file in the directory &quot;~/.saves&quot;. It creates a new copy every time you modify your init file, so if you ever make a mess of things, you will always have a backup. 
 Now go out there, find inner peace and eternal happiness.

                              <span>Just a moment ago, I was working on some statistics homework. And it was all just boring rote confidence interval calculations. Mostly busy work. After doing about two problems, I wasn&#x27;t satisfied with the pace at which I was completing the homework, so I fired up GHCi in my terminal. In theory, what I am describing here can be done with any language with a REPL, but Haskell&#x27;s syntax makes for extremely fast prototyping (in my opinion).
 First I created a function that would map some common confidence intervals to it&#x27;s corresponding z-score. I.e. 0.9 -&gt; 1.645. Took 10 seconds.
 Next I created a function that would take some sample mean as an argument, number of samples, and variance as an argument and it would return a function which, when given a z-score, will return a tuple that represents my confidence interval. 
 Next, plug and chug. A homework that could have taken me an hour and a half took me 15 minutes. Next step is to integrate it with LaTeX so it will automatically write out the answers for me :) 
 Maybe this is a trivial example but I was just really impressed with the ease and speed with which I could quickly slap together a &quot;custom&quot; calculator and start plugging in the values I care about.

                              <span>I came across this interesting discussion at the bottom of the Let vs Where article: Problems with Where. I couldn&#x27;t understand for a bit just how these two functions had different runtime behaviours:
 -- Supposedly fast fib &#x3D; (map fib&#x27; [0 ..] !!) where fib&#x27; 0 &#x3D; 0 fib&#x27; 1 &#x3D; 1 fib&#x27; n &#x3D; fib (n - 1) + fib (n - 2) 
 -- Supposedly &quot;considerably slower&quot;??? fib x &#x3D; map fib&#x27; [0 ..] !! x where fib&#x27; 0 &#x3D; 0 fib&#x27; 1 &#x3D; 1 fib&#x27; n &#x3D; fib (n - 1) + fib (n - 2) 
 These fib implementations come from a 2010 mailing list: https://mail.haskell.org/pipermail/haskell-cafe/2010-October/084538.html.
 So I spent a while reading through the discussion, and also reading about floating names, and also trying to understand under what conditions the full-laziness optimisation could help.

 I&#x27;m working on this, because it seems somewhat trivial. Initial feedback, obviously, has been negative, and I guess the package needs a parser to convert existing .hs files to use the clearly idiom instead.
 ​
 The intended use is to make Haskell readable for newbies, when I think everyone reading this is at the level wherein, excepting maybe &#x60;timesDo&#x60;, none of the functions are necessary.
 ​
 
 ​
 And to be totally honest, this is 100% a clone of Flow, taylorfausak&#x27;s extremely popular (sarcasm) operator library, except deliberately using semi-verbose function names instead with declarative programming / readability being the aim.

                              <span>I am in the process of configuring Emacs as my daily driver and love org-mode so far!One of the most important tasks for me is creating LaTeX documents (reports, papers, exercise sheets, proposals, ...)I like how literate programming works for my Sage worksheets and would like to also incorporate it into my document writing with LaTeX for boosting the org-component of creating such documents.
 Obviously (at least for me as a layman), I want to have multiple LaTeX codeblocks, say for different sections of my document. My first codeblock contains the header and a \begin{document}. However, when I do not write \end{document} into the same codeblock, Emacs appears to not accept the codeblocks end #+end_src and throws an error on running org-babel-tangle. If I include an additional \end{document} in the first codeblock, all LaTeX codeblocks in my orgfile are recognised as such on tangling and correctly exported. Then, however, I have to go into the generated TeX-file and delete the superfluous \end{document} from the export of the first block manually. That does not feel right.
 Is there an elegant solution to that problem? In particular, how may I allow a codeblock to be exported properly by org-babel-tangle, even if it contains environments that are not properly closed in the same codeblock?
 PS: As far as I understood from a simple web search, org-export does not deliver what I want without additional setup, as I basically want to write a LaTeX file and manage the org stuff around it without exporting it.

 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; Following this page: https://orgmode.org/manual/Capturing-column-view.html.
 But when I try to add a filter using match or exclude-tags, it doesn&#x27;t create the table, and instead shows the column view as if calling org-columns on the entire file.
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;org
 +BEGIN: columnview :hlines 1 :id global :max-level 3 :match &quot;+DEADLINE&#x3D;{.+}+SCHEDULED&#x3D;{.+}-repeat/!-DONE-CANCELLED&quot;

 What&#x27;s funny is that it was working before, and I have a filtered table, but now it doesn&#x27;t want to function properly. 
 Any advice?
 EDIT:
 Looks like this bit +DEADLINE&#x3D;{.+}+SCHEDULED&#x3D;{.+} is the cause of the issue.
 Anyone knows how to achieve this filter?

                              <span>So, I recently upgraded my emacs version. I&#x27;m now in 29, and I&#x27;ve noticed it automatically switching to warnings to show me things like 
 Warning (comp): dockerfile-mode.el:180:2: Warning: docstring wider than 80 characters 
 I don&#x27;t care what the mode thinks (it&#x27;s not even my Dockerfile) and don&#x27;t want to see Warnings automatically. How do I turn this off?

 I was watching this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;HQYsFshbkYw
 and at one point i noticed a wild mario walking on the tool bar, so I asked myself: 
 Is there a way to have something like this in Emacs too?

                              <span>Just to get this out of the way, this is obviously not a criticism in any facet, I know people develop org-roam, and much else, in their free time. It is what it is, in any case. But before I consider using the software, I want to get a realistic idea of what&#x27;s going on in a descriptive sense, without judgement. It seems on a superficial view that the project has slowed down quite significantly. The latest release was in April of 2022, currently open bugs seem to be fixed or even considered at a very slow pace, whereas in the past a lot of bugs have been closed swiftly.
 Has org-roam simply reached a state of maturity, where the main functionality works fine and is stable, such that everything else is either details or some minor stuff that&#x27;s hard to fix? Or has development and improvement stalled involuntarily because the maintainers don&#x27;t have a lot of free time to put into the project? Any insight is welcome.

While the font size is ideal for my laptop screen, when I connect it to an external monitor, because of its resolution, the font size is too big. I&#x27;d like to have some code that I could use to change Emacs&#x27; font size and back again with a key chord (without having to restart Emacs). Does anyone know if this is possible and if so, how I could go about it?

                              <span>Recently, I made the switch from Doom Emacs to building my own configuration. I&#x27;m amazed at how fast Emacs can be without sacrificing any functionality.
 After benchmarking my Emacs configuration using (emacs-init-time), the TTY starts up in just 0.32s on a Mac M1 and 0.73s on a cloud VPS with 1 core CPU and 1GB RAM. Even the GUI starts up quickly, taking only 0.44s on a Mac M1. In fact, you can export EDITOR&#x3D;&quot;emacs -nw&quot;!
 My configuration includes all the essential parts of a &quot;modern&quot; Emacs experience (total 106 packages installed), such as:
  
A modern minibuffer completion experience powered by vertico+consult+orderless+embark+marginalia family bucket.
 Modal editing ecosystem everywhere, powered by Evil and many other extensions.

                              <span>Why is it that when I (sometimes) copy from one buffer and try to paste to another, by the time I get to the pasting, what I copied is gone and Emacs pastes something else. To obviate this problem I have to go back and copy directly to the register. This has been a long standing problem for me in Emacs. I would like to know what causes it and how I can fix it permanently.

 It works as expected, but the figure of actual width is just too big.

 How could add &quot;#+attr_html: :width 350&quot; to be after the &quot;#+RESULTS&quot; and ahead of the image automatically.

                              <span>Hello everyone. I&#x27;ve recently tried out Emacs and enjoyed it a lot, but I can&#x27;t seem to get my color scheme working, no matter the many different methods I use.Before, in Vim, I set it to use my terminal(st) colors, and I was very happy with that. A picture of what a .cpp file looks like is below.
 https://i.imgur.com/C3R6Ikv.png
 I use Emacs Gui mode, and I was looking to use these terminal colors, but I can&#x27;t find a way to port the Vim colors over(even though they are terminal colors). I&#x27;ve tried creating my own Emacs color scheme(using autothemer), but the lack of faces for some things prevent me from fully creating the theme, and my lack of knowledge about Emacs Lisp is hindering me as well.
 I&#x27;m not sure how st(suckless terminal) and/or Vim uses the colors specified in the st config, but I think it is Xresources-related. Below is a picture of the 16 colors I use in my st config.
 I am considering porting this over to Vim(as these seem to be somewhat general) and then to Emacs, but again, I have no idea how these colors are used and applied.
 https://i.imgur.com/FAEcuer.png
 (I can&#x27;t remember when I made the theme, but I believe it was based on something online, but I&#x27;m not sure how prevalent it is)
 In the end, any pointers on how to implement this theme in Emacs or anything about the way st uses these colors will help greatly(or any other places I should cross-post this in). Once I figure out how to use this color scheme in Emacs in beyond, I plan on releasing it or such, as I think many might find it interesting.

                              <span>Scala CLI v0.2.0 has just been released and a few more noticable changes are included along with the minor version bump. 
 All the advanced and experimental features are now hidden behind the --power launcher option, as was already the case for the scala distribution for a while. This includes things like package, publish and others. So to package something, you&#x27;ll now have to :
 scala-cli --power package . 
 Of course, the power mode can also be set globally.
 scala-cli config power true 
 Other notable changes include:
  
support for script inputs with no file extension via the shebang sub-command
 support for JSON exports of project configuration
 dropping ammonite imports syntax
 improving the readability of individual sub-commands&#x27; --help and --full-help outputs
 and more, refer to the release notes for details

                              <span>Struggling with understanding what a monad is, I asked chatGPT to explain what a monad is in cowboy lingo, hoping that it would make the explanation easier to understand. Is he right when he says that: 
 ​
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 A monad in programming is made up of three parts, also known as the three laws of monads:
  
Unit (also known as &quot;return&quot; or &quot;pure&quot;): This is the function that wraps a value into a monadic context. In cowboy terms, you might think of this as the cowboy who rounds up a calf and brings it into the corral.
 Bind (also known as &quot;flatMap&quot; or &quot;chain&quot;): This is the function that applies a function to a monad and returns a new monad. It allows you to chain operations on the monad. In cowboy terms, you might think of this as the cowboy who takes a calf from the corral to the branding iron, then from the branding iron to the castrator, and so on.
 Associativity: This is the law that says the order in which you chain the operations with the bind function should not matter. In cowboy terms, you might think of this as the cowboy code that says you should always ride in the direction of your destination, no matter what order you do your chores in.
  
Together, these three parts make up the monad. In cowboy terms, you might think of it like a group of cowboys who work together to round up and process cattle. Each cowboy has a specific job to do, and they follow a set of rules to make sure they get the job done right.

 This compiles/builds/runs fine. I&#x27;m using cabal and have added text as a dependency for all libraries and functions. 
 yet I still get 
 Could not load module ‘Data.Text’ It is a member of the hidden package ‘text-1.2.5.0’. Perhaps you need to add ‘text’ to the build-depends in your .cabal file. 
 as an error.
 this means that I can&#x27;t ctrl+click on anything and get no type information by hovering over functions.
 how would I approach solving this issue?

 I kindly ask community for a feedback. What should be fixed, what have I forgot to mention in three written texts? Why an isomorphism of a corepresentable functor is called &#x60;tabulate&#x60; in &#x60;representable-functors&#x60;?
 In next post I will try to cover monoidal functors, second next will be devoted to monoids in all three defined monoidal categories.

                              <span>I am currently trying do learn Haskell with this course
 Apparently this course lectures are &quot;published&quot; every week since the 30th January 2023 and will end up with 17 Lectures (currently 8 are available)
 This course was already completely available in 2021 and 2022.
 But every year he removes the videos &quot;I&#x27;ll be releasing the videos week by week as my class for Nottingham students progresses. They are the same videos as previously with some minor updates.&quot;
 The YouTube videos are either one or two years old so i just think he unlists them. Even the lectures slides are already available A few people had the same problem last year So I wanted to ask if someone knows where the lectures are still hosted? I really prefer this course over the other introduction resources, but I only have the next week off so I want to watch them soon.

Thought for the week
In the classic Greek sense, we should make more time in our lives for leisure. Slow productivity is a combination of incremental work and tangential work. It is incremental because it is made of micro-actions accumulating over time. Tangential, in the sense that it sometimes is work or play that seems unrelated but actually moves the needle forward. A walk in the woods might be an example of tangential productivity.
Writing has taken priority. My course assignment is to write a creative non-fiction essay modeled after the works we discussed in class. My Zk has been a joyous and surprising resource for ideas. I&#x27;m using my ZK by creating search queries and using the highlighting feature to find where I&#x27;ve already written answers to the query in my own voice. They become snippets directly into my essay. In a sense, I&#x27;ve already written my essay. I just have to find all the pieces and put them together. In truth, this is only a first draft and still needs work.
What I&#x27;ve found to be key steps to creating a rough draft.
—
My review routine has again surfaced something wonderful in my ZK. I had no idea I was curating ideas on the value of practice. I started a secondary hub with 18 entries, hung off of the main hub titled The Art Of Living A Good Life [[202105102006]]. 

  
Basic learning preps. What am I doing that is practice? How else do I expect to improve unless I practice? The best continue practicing even after achieving success to push themselves, not become complacent, and reach new heights. Practice Different - by Stephen Vafier - Carolina Stories

Building real-world Haskell applications using Tagless-Final and ReaderT by Amogh Rathore
I have been learning and playing with Haskell on-and-off for a couple of years now. However, I was still not very confident that I could write a real-world application in it.

— or, dare I say, a delegation — to FOSDEM23 and
CfgMgmtCamp23 (Config Management Camp if, like me, you can’t
read through so many consonants). Tweagers Bryan Honof and
Théophane Hufschmitt, together with Ryan
Lahfa, Julien Malka and Matthew
Croughan from the Nix community, got us the first Nix DevRoom
at FOSDEM. And not the last, as you can see from the picture below; the room
just couldn’t handle the Nix fame!

      
    
  
  
    

      
    
  
  
    
Our involvement didn’t end there. At FOSDEM:

                              <span>Hello everybody,
 i&#x27;ve used from years emacs for directly edit ftp directory but recently i&#x27;ve passed to arch linux (and tested emacs even with a new ubuntu version) and now is nomore possible.
 as always i write:
 /ftp:user@ftp.hostname.tld:/
 It prompt me asking for password and after that (i assure the password is the correct one) it prompt something like this:
 [..]
 ftp&gt; ls -al /tmp/ange-ftp7uuOKj
 200 PORT command successful
 425 Could not open data connection to port 54765: No route to host
 ftp&gt; ls -al /tmp/ange-ftp7uuOKj
 200 PORT command successful
 425 Could not open data connection to port 45623: No route to host
 cd /
 ftp&gt; 250 OK. Current directory is /
 ftp&gt; ls -al /tmp/ange-ftpVU0r1x
 200 PORT command successful
 425 Could not open data connection to port 52941: No route to host
 ftp&gt; ls -al /tmp/ange-ftpVU0r1x
 200 PORT command successful
 425 Could not open data connection to port 42783: No route to host
 [...]
 ​
 It continue as well till i interrupt the execution.
 Am i the only one can&#x27;t use emacs ftp on Arch? Is there anyone who can help me with this problem?
 ​
 Thanks in advance

                              <span>Recently I&#x27;ve noticed a problem within the community. The Vertico-based completion stack is gaining popularity, but there is no easy way to refer to the whole thing. Just &quot;Vertico&quot; doesn&#x27;t tell the whole story, while &quot;Vertico + Orderless + Embark + Consult + Marginalia&quot; is quite a mouthful.
 For example the way this question is phrased, the technically correct the answer would be &quot;little to none&quot;. Vertico itself offers no feature parity with the aforementioned alternatives. The answer the OP actually expects is about the advantages of the whole stack, but that increases the friction as it requires convincing everyone interested that each part of the stack is worthwhile (and often just plainly needed), even though originally they only planned on using Vertico.

                              <span>Assuming there is no way to configure a bidirectional sync with external softwares like rclone, would it be possible to access remote files using TRAMP but also guarantee some functionalities when the device is offline? 
 For example: the device is offline but I asked to access a file on a WebDAV server. Emacs already showed me that file previously so it shows me a cached copy of that file.
 Another example for writing: I&#x27;d like to write on a file using TRAMP. The device is offline, so Emacs will store this modified file for later and save it whenever it is possible.
 This is basically synchronization but done on Emacs, i guess. Is it possible?
 EDIT: Logseq, a famous notetaking app, has implemented an interesting sync mechanism that tells you if a file has been synced or not. Can someone like this be made in Emacs?

To provide an example, Iwould like to have spaces inserted around operators without the need to manually call M-x eglot-format. Something like a hook on save would be ideal (before switching to eglot, when using elpy, I used (add-hook &#x27;elpy-mode-hook &#x27;py-autopep8-enable-on-save) )
 Bonus question: How do you configure your init.el to have eglot and company start on all supported file types?

                              <span>I&#x27;m curious about using org-mode for language learning (currently working on Spanish, German, and French). Particularly, I&#x27;m trying to build up vocabulary as well as try my hand at reading / translating.
 In the past, when I was translating, I worked in a cryptpad and just wrote the translation in another text color and then went back to make corrections in yet another color. It was pretty time consuming. I&#x27;ve used org-remark for annotations on text and think it would be a good tool for this purpose. But maybe others have experience and suggestions for other tools or workflows.
 As for vocabulary, I think I&#x27;d like to do spaced repetition flashcards. I had used Anki for awhile, but it eventually got overwhelming. I couldn&#x27;t really make a habit out of it.
 I haven&#x27;t used any flashcard tools in org yet. Preferably I&#x27;d like something easy to use. I&#x27;m also wondering how to get vocab lists into org. It might be educational to do it by hand but I would prefer an automated solution, especially since I&#x27;m looking for &quot;top 1000+ common words&quot; lists. For example, taking an Anki set and converting to org. 
 Any suggestions and tips are appreciated.

my heading (reference)

 If I link to it [[#my-custom-id][Project Reference]] emacs returns no match for custom ID: my-custom-id
 If I link it as a heading [[my heading (reference)][Project Reference]] note no * after [[ - it links fine
 I have other custom-id links in my org-file which work fine (that&#x27;s where I yanked the properties from)
 Any ideas what&#x27;s happening?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been an org-mode as my organisation tool, and emacs as my &quot;OS&quot; as a &quot;beginner&quot; for 2+ years. I happily use Org to do some GTD-alike organisation, and to collect my thoughts on topics in Org-Roam.
 **tldr;** I&#x27;m trying to dynamically generate org-headings for each (new) subdir of a directory. I think a shell script is the best way to achieve this (so it can run independently of an open emacs session) - but may be wrong. In any event I don&#x27;t script very often and am very confused.
 *What I&#x27;m trying to do:*
 I edit video for fun. 
 I use syncthing to sync my scratch (editing) folder and my org-files across two machines:
  
my old i7 machine (effects and rendering); and 
 my dual boot surface go (basic and on-the-go editing, footage ingestion etc).
  
I work on my org-files in DooM emacs on those machines and orgzly / logseq (for roam) on my android phone (occasionally using termux too, but not if I can help it).
 My video editing software creates a folder for each video project. As a result I have a folder structure like &#x60;~/scratch/live_projects/video_X&#x60;
 I&#x27;m getting to the stage where I need to use notes in org-mode to keep track of various aspects of videos (scripts, b-roll, assets etc).
 It would be lovely if each time I create a project (and a directory is generated) it would pop a heading into my org-file where I could keep notes. 
 *What I&#x27;ve done so far:*
 I&#x27;ve managed to manipulate an org-file checklist using shell scripting in Tasker (on my phone). Mostly just checking / unchecking boxes via a menu. E.g. using sed to replace &#x60;/]&#x60; with &#x60;X]&#x60;.
 I&#x27;m struggling to google how to interact with directories in bash:
  
When I google the answer to this as keywords Org and Directory together get me lots of hits. 
 Maybe I need a better boolean search fu - but that is a different question.
 
 I also use fish, so when I test I hit &#x60;$(...) is not supported&#x60;. 
  
So as you can see, not much progress has been made.
 Any pointers would be greatly appreciated.

I mainly intend to use org mode for QOL purposes such as To-Do lists, Calendar and personal productivity uses.

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently studying for a final exam and I messed up my markdown by accidentally pasting the string &quot;(In Notebook)&quot; before the space between the leading ## and the title. When I clicked on this to correct it I was linked to an empty search (because TA thought it was a tag), and when I went back to the main page my document was gone. The file still exists in the Finder but it&#x27;s empty. What the heck happened?
Thankfully I had a backup of this document in my Apple Notes app (but without the annotations the Archive version had...) but it&#x27;s scary that a document can just disappear like that due to malformatted tags. I still have The Archive open, so I can force it to generate whatever logs could help debug this issue. For the time being I&#x27;m going to move to Notes until I&#x27;m done studying for my exam.</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been having an issue with pattern matching and guards leading to an &quot;incomplete patterns&quot; warning. Without the guard all is well, with the guard (three conditions: &#x3D;&#x3D;, ) I get a warning. What have I missed as a novice Haskeller?
 module HaskellFunny where -- foo compiles with no warnings in ghc 9.4.4 with &#x60;ghc -Wall haskell-funny.hs&#x60; foo :: [Char] -&gt; [Char] -&gt; Int foo _ [] &#x3D; 1 foo [] _ &#x3D; 2 foo (c : _) (d : _) &#x3D; length ( c:d:[]) -- silly but suppresses unused warning -- bar emits a warning on the same ghc invocation: -- haskell-funny.hs:41:1: warning: [-Wincomplete-patterns] -- Pattern match(es) are non-exhaustive -- In an equation for ‘bar’: -- Patterns of type ‘[Char]’, ‘[Char]’ not matched: (_:_) (_:_) bar :: [Char] -&gt; [Char] -&gt; Int bar _ [] &#x3D; 1 bar [] _ &#x3D; 2 bar (c : _) (d : _) | c &#x3D;&#x3D; d &#x3D; 3 | c  d &#x3D; 5 
 Any explanation gratefully received, I&#x27;ve been scratching my head on this.

                              <span>A while back, I started to transcribe my mother&#x27;s old recipes written on 3×5&quot; note cards into a digital format. Portability is important to me, as I wanted to be able to send them to friends and family and not have to worry about apps needed to view them. I initially opted to write them in Markdown. Then I became an Emacs user. 🤩 I like the idea of being able to write the recipes in org files and exporting to whatever format convenient for family, like perhaps PDF. Hosting a little website for them might be a neat project for a future date.
 ​
 I installed org-chef, but as far as I can tell, it&#x27;s meant for scraping recipes from websites. I don&#x27;t need functionality to adjust proportions, either. Being able to generate a shopping list might be useful someday, but it&#x27;s not currently something I need to do. I&#x27;ve written a few recipe files in org-mode, but I&#x27;m not sure if this is the mode I should be using. I also experimented with using markdown-mode, but wouldn&#x27;t it be better to write in another mode and export to Markdown? I&#x27;d prefer to have the recipes in separate files, rather than one big file, but I&#x27;m open to good reasons why I might not want to do that.
 ​
 I&#x27;m currently writing them with a few keywords and some tags for metadata. I searched a lot online, here on reddit, as well as asked ChatGPT (it worked well till it gave me a bunch of what seems to be incorrect advice 🫠), about how to create a basic template, but I haven&#x27;t been able to figure out how to do it on my own. I&#x27;m currently using a file that I fill my stuff into and then save with a new name. That works well enough, but it seems to me like there&#x27;d be a more elegant way to do it.
 ​
 So, that&#x27;s where I&#x27;m at. Part of me is starting to wonder if I should instead try to learn some database software for this... Though I really only want to be able to search for titles and basic tags, so a database sounds like overkill. Any advice and direction pointing is appreciated.

                              <span>Hi! 
 I want to use some of my org-roam files like a “database” (not in the strict sense), to keep some metadata about my files. 
 In this spirit, I want to save in the PROPERTIES drawer some information, which I want to put it in a table. My idea is to do the same process with several files and copy/paste those small tables into another (a large one) with all this information. 
 The problem with this approach is the visibility and navigation around the tables. 
 This example
 * test :PROPERTIES: :TOPIC: test :column_A: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Morbi quis vehicula mi. Maecenas laoreet bibendum augue, ac faucibus leo euismod in. Suspendisse elit nunc, cursus eu mollis vel, rutrum in metus. Nulla posuere nisl eu lorem euismod, quis gravida lacus convallis. Ves…</span>

 Does anyone know if it is possible to &quot;roll-up&quot; (I can&#x27;t think of a better word) TAGS in the columns view.
 ALLTAGS seems to &quot;push tags down&quot;, or inherit tags, but I want to push them up (the way {+} or {:} will sum something.
 an e.g.
 org * Project ** Task 1 :tag1: ** Task 2 :tag1:tag2: ** Task 3 :tag3:  
 in column view could display as
 org | Project | :tag1:tag2:tag3: |

 Neorg (Neo - new, org - organization) - https://github.com/nvim-neorg/neorg
 Its description says it&#x27;s a is a Neovim plugin designed to reimagine organization as you know it. Grab some coffee, start writing some notes, let your editor handle the rest. 
 The first point of its philosophy is to
  
 Revise the org format: simple, extensible, unambiguous. Will make you feel right at home. Alternate markup formats have several flaws, but the most notable one is the requirement for complex and slow parsers. What if we told you it&#x27;s possible to alleviate those problems, all whilst keeping that familiar feel? Enter the .norg file format, whose specification can be found here. The cross between all the best things from org and the best things from markdown, revised and merged into one.

                              <span>For some time I&#x27;ve been having this weird issue where some asterisks are showing in some heading levels as they were, it seems, emphasis markers... I&#x27;m not sure what is happening, since using SPC h &#x27; shows they have org-hide as face and only those in headings multiple of three have this issue. Any tips on how to find the cause of the problem?
 ​
 Some headings have their \&quot;bullets\&quot; showing wrongly
 org-hide-emphasis-markers does not change the situation. Even when using describe-char, it says the asterisks are being shown as just the background.
 ​
 describe-char of the two incorrect asterisks in each heading.
 Some things point towards emphasis markers, Only the headings which have a multiple of 3 asterisks suffer from this problem, the middle asterisk is higher than the other two (although no boldness is indicated by describe-char), the left one and the last one in the affected lines are a little closer to the middle one and not centered.
 I have no idea on how to pursuit this problem... any tips?

 I don&#x27;t need anything fancy, I just want to be able to install modules and be able to work with them in emacs&#x27; python REPL or other in-emacs interpreter.
 I&#x27;ve tried to just use pip install, but packages installed that way are still not available from the REPL.
 feeling exhusted :/
 Edit to add: I do have pyright configured, and it seems like it&#x27;s working, if that gives more information.

                              <span>Hi r/emacs!
 I would like to share with you my humble project - library for creating and managing tray icons Emacs-Appindicator.
 ​
 https://preview.redd.it/yn9vdccnqkja1.png?width&#x3D;532&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;b90dfa4f2e477d10b79ec7751d0a8a8e430e9217
 ​
 You can hide/show icons, labels, create context menus with lisp callbacks for each menu item. The library uses svg-lib so you can use icons from various online collections supported by it. Under the hood it has tiny daemon, written in C that interacts with system tray via libappindicator. So, at least for now, the only supported OS is Linux.
 I planned to keep minor modes in separate repo - Emacs Appindicator Modes. For now there is only icon for pomm.el , but I plan to add more useful packages soon.
 I will be glad to hear your thoughts about package. Also I suppose it is the good time to change something in api, so if you have any idea - please share it!

 Checking the load-path variable shows that it contains the directory.
 Can symlinks affect the behaviour?

                              <span>Typically in my workflow, when I switch branches, I run git submodule update --init --recursive on the command line to sync/init/update all my submodules in one command. Is there a way to do this in magit?
 What I have tried:
  
open the submodule transient with o
 specify the --recursive infix with r
 sync all submodules with c-u s
 init all submodules with c-u p
 update all submodules with c-u u
  
This effectively does the same as the git submodule update --init --recursive, but requires 3 separate commands, each with a prefix argument.
 I&#x27;m looking for a way to create another entry in the submodule transient (under the &quot;All modules actions&quot; section) to run git submodule update --init --recursive. If that can&#x27;t be done, is there a way to more easily run all three commands (sync, init, update)?

                              <span>Hi all! 
 I&#x27;m a beginner in emacs configuration. Please excuse me if the answer here is obvious, but I am unable to find the solution online :/ I am having trouble configuring org-roam-dailies. I want each daily note to be pre-populated with the contents of a template file. My current configuration is as follows: 
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;elisp
 (defun note-path (subpath) (let ((note-directory &quot;/Users//Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/notes&quot;)) (file-truename (concat note-directory subpath))))
 (defun org-template (filename) (note-path (concat &quot;/templates/&quot; filename)))
 (use-package org :ensure t)
 (use-package org-roam :ensure t :config (setq org-roam-db-update-on-save t) (setq org-roam-directory (note-path &quot;/&quot;)) (setq org-roam-dailies-directory &quot;&quot;) (setq org-roam-dailies-capture-templates &#x27;((&quot;d&quot; &quot;default&quot; entry (org-template &quot;daily-note.org&quot;) :target (file+head &quot;%.org&quot; &quot;#+title: %\n&quot;)))))
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 My issue specifically is with the last statement: setq org-roam-dailies-capture-templates. I expect this to read the content of daily-note.org and create a new note with this as the content. However, it simply creates an empty note. I have ensured that the value of (org-template &quot;daily-note.org&quot;) is correct; substituting it for an absolute path (e.g. ~/test.org) behaves the same way. 
 Are any of you kind people able to see where I&#x27;m misunderstanding?
 EDIT: fixed code formatting

  (evil-define-key &#x27;normal dired-mode-map (kbd &quot;SPC&quot;) nil) (evil-define-key &#x27;normal Info-mode-map (kbd &quot;SPC&quot;) nil) 
 This feels redundant, and frankly very non lispy. I tried to write a better way:
  (dolist (var &#x27;(Info-mode-map dired-mode-map)) (evil-define-key &#x27;normal var (kbd &quot;SPC&quot;) nil)) 
 However it does not work. Can&#x27;t seem to debug this at all, any help is greatly appreciated.

                              <span>Usually C++ source files automatically set c++-mode, but every once in a while I have a source file that does not. Today, I wanted to find out, but I&#x27;m a bit of an emacs noob, so I turn to you!
 From my experiments it seems to have to do with the filename. I have a bunch of identical files containing some c++ code:
 [~] $ cat importfromdesktop.cpp #include  int main() { return 0; } [~] $ md5sum *.cpp 1824f46236ad646997b49e6414e1ed10 importfromdesktop.cpp # no good 1824f46236ad646997b49e6414e1ed10 importfromdeskto.cpp # no good 1824f46236ad646997b49e6414e1ed10 importfromdesk.cpp # no good 1824f46236ad646997b49e6414e1ed10 importfromd.cpp # no good 1824f46236ad646997b49e6414e1ed10 importfrom.cpp # WORKS! 1824f46236ad646997b49e6414e1ed10 importfro.cpp # WORKS! 1824f46236ad646997b49e6414e1ed10 importfr.cpp # WORKS! 1824f46236ad646997b49e6414e1ed10 fromdesktop.cpp # no good 1824f46236ad646997b49e6414e1ed10 verylongfilenamehereman.cpp # WORKS! 
 When opening the first importfromdesktop.cpp, c++-mode is not started (this was the original filename that was problematic, when I copied the file&#x27;s contents to a main.cpp it worked, so I started testing the filename).
 I kept removing a letter from the end and starting from importfrom.cpp, c++-mode would engage. So I thought maybe it has to do with the filename length? But testing doesn&#x27;t show that either.
 Nothing different shows in the messages buffer in all these cases. How do I debug this?
 Thanks!

 I use Helm. I would like to understand if I should make the switch to Vertico. What does Vertico do better than Helm or Ivy?
 And is Ivy even worth trying out at this point or should I just jump straight to Vertico?

Client defines orphan instance. If a package defines an orphan instance, it MUST depend on the minor version of the packages that define the data type and the type class to be backwards compatible.
  
I don&#x27;t really understand why this is required. Can anyone understand this?

                              <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;ve implemented a small prototype of type-safe remote hot-code swapping using Arrow-based (or more accurately, Cartesian-category-based) state machines of type input -&gt; state -&gt; (state, output):
 https://github.com/stevana/hot-swapping-state-machines#hot-swapping-state-machines
 The readme is written a bit like a blog post and contains code for how hot-code swapping is done in Erlang, how it&#x27;s done using the prototype, implementation details and a couple of ideas for possible extensions and refinements.
 I hope you find it interesting and I&#x27;d be curious to hear your thoughts!

                              <span>I have been testing emacs 29 using eglot/eldoc for viewing documentation through LSP.
 I noticed that documentation is not formatted correctly in the minibuffer or the eldoc buffer (e.g. after calling &#x60;eldoc&#x60; manually).
 I see the literal markdown text instead of the formatted version, like this:
 left is typescript file, right is the eldoc buffer (it also shows the same way in the minibuffer)
 Is this expected? My eglot/eldoc configuration is essentially vanilla, just with these additions:
 (setq eglot-ignored-server-capabilites &#x27;(:documentHighlightProvider)) (setq eldoc-echo-area-use-multiline-p nil) 
 edit: solved needed markdown mode thanks

                              <span>How would I go about implementing something like transliteration? For ex, when in translit-mode, inserting &quot;j&quot; into text file would instead &quot;й&quot;, however, appending another &quot;a&quot; to it like &quot;ja&quot; would instead remove whatever was inserted, and insert &quot;я&quot; instead.
 If I would implement this naively, I would just keep a buffer with original text in latin alphabet, while only showing to user transliterated form.
 But I am asking because there is a chance something which does the job has already been implemented?

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I&#x27;ve been working on the ekg package, the Emacs Knowledge Graph. Simply put, it&#x27;s a note-taking system, but also a system that can store lots of kinds of interlinked data, not just notes. Here&#x27;s a few things at a glance to know about it:
  
Stores all data (including the note) in a sqlite database
 Uses a &quot;triple&quot; schema, which is a way to store a variety information as a graph favoring extensibility, ease of introspection, and two-way links between data, but not maximizing efficiency
 Uses tags instead of in-buffer links and backlinks, where tags can be multi-word
 Notes have no title, so in general small notes are easier in this system
 Designed to be easy to integrate with; so if you want to auto-generate notes when, say, you finish an org task, that&#x27;s trivial to write

                              <span>Ok so I have a bit of a mystery. On one of my computer&#x27;s Emacs installs, if I type an ampersand it gets underlined and shows what I assume are completions in the modeline. Annoyingly, it completes them without confirmation. So if I type &amp;ke it gets replaced with け. This is really annoying when typing &amp;key in Common Lisp since it gets replaced with けy. And oddly, it only happens on one of my computers, despite me sharing my .emacs folder between my computers using a git repo.
 I have no idea what this is or how to turn it off. I can&#x27;t find anything about it online, and I&#x27;m at a loss as to how to find it within emacs (helpful-key says the ampersand is a self-insert-command, and pressing C-h while the ampersand is underlined exits out of whatever this is).
 What do?

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;m planning to set up an Emacs configuration for somebody writing books and stories who is not familiar with technology that much.
 There are nice looking distraction-free setups with https://github.com/joostkremers/writeroom-mode or https://github.com/rnkn/olivetti or https://github.com/joaotavora/darkroom or https://github.com/rougier/nano-emacs
 However, as far as I&#x27;ve read (I haven&#x27;t set up them except nano), they do not offer a very reduced and visually appealing recentf-open-file alternative.
 I&#x27;m thinking of a screen that pops up when booting Emacs that only shows the files I was working on recently in large font (maybe as buttons to click on). The file extension should be hidden, so that I may use it with Orgdown files that have long, descriptive file names (most probably within the same directory).
 Something like:
  
The Picture of Dorian Gray (that points to &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray.org&quot;)
 1984
 Notes about The Picture of Dorian Gray
 ....
  
Does that ring a bell for anybody here? Is there some similar functionality out there?
 Bonus for support for an easy to use file creation process like &quot;add a new book&quot;, &quot;add new notes&quot;, &quot;add new short story&quot; in combination with, e.g., a template mechanism. 
 Thanks

After turning on (helm-mode 1) I managed to restore the behavior of find-file by &#x27;(add-to-list &#x27;helm-completing-read-handlers-alist ..., but this doesn&#x27;t restore completions e.g. for interactive shell-command and any other command that complete paths. So is it possible to revert to plain emacs path completions everywhere?

 (setq-local completion-at-point-functions
 (cons #&#x27;tempel-expand
 completion-at-point-functions)))
 ​
 (add-hook &#x27;prog-mode-hook &#x27;tempel-setup-capf)
 (add-hook &#x27;text-mode-hook &#x27;tempel-setup-capf)
 (global-tempel-abbrev-mode))
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 When i go into a prog-buffer the lsp-completion get to the top of the completion function and moves the tempel expand completion below lsp completions.
 I tried moving the prog-mode-hook to lsp-mode but the tempel expand still got added before lsp-completion-at-point

 ​
 Is there a way to emit a warning if the user uses an annotation in the wrong place( that I define), or like an error ?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve written an extensive series (link) about various aspects of binary search, starting with the basics but then going quite a bit deeper, all in Scala. Each part addresses a separate topic, hopefully as a bite-sized chunk.
 Just to set appropriate expectations, this series is not about Scala--it&#x27;s about binary search--so I&#x27;ve tried to make the code as readable as possible even to people who don&#x27;t know Scala, which means that there&#x27;s a lot of imperative loops. (But higher order functions do show up starting in Part 6.)

                              <span>I already tried to explain why the Haskell/JS story currently IMHO sucks: https://old.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/115csmc/my_main_beef_with_haskelljs/
 But it turns out that it won&#x27;t suck for much longer, and the reason is that &quot;foreign export&quot; is coming. I wasn&#x27;t aware of this. Please accept my humble apologies. https://engineering.iog.io/2023-01-24-javascript-browser-tutorial/
 Here is why Haskell/JS won&#x27;t suck anymore after &quot;foreign export&quot; is here:
  
I will be able to code a standard HTML/CSS website that mostly works even on text-based browsers and Tor Browser without JS enabled. Users of text-based browsers will get graceful &quot;&quot; placeholders. To code this website, I will obviously use Haskell on the backend.
 If the user has JS enabled, I can have a link on the site that says &quot;activate interactive JavaScript features (5 MB download)&quot;. It is IMHO incredibly disrespectful to activate this mode by default, shoving something down the user&#x27;s throat he didn&#x27;t ask for. (Maybe the user is running a slow computer, or e.g. Qubes with lack of nice GPU integration and prefers the simple site because it has all the needed info.)
 Once clicked, a nice download indicator now spins for half a second.
 Boom!!
 The JS parts are now live. Static JPG images (previously rendered on the server) have turned into interactive HTML canvases with websockets support. A text counter that previously required a website refresh is now updating live through websockets. And so on.
  
This is the way. This is the future. This is the only way to stop the web from becoming an increasingly ugly place. (If you don&#x27;t get it - if you e.g. really believe the new Reddit is better than old.reddit - you&#x27;re lost and beyond saving IMHO, sorry.)

 /damage/*{Action} DamageR GET POST 
 action has following code
 data Action &#x3D; Create | List deriving (Show, Read, Eq) instance PathMultiPiece Action where fromPathMultiPiece ... toPathMultiPiece ... 
 I can add edit method like this 
 data Action &#x3D; Create | List | Edit Int64 deriving (Show, Read, Eq) 
 It is possible to have parameter in data constructor more generic?
 So that there is no need for operations with persistent use the transform function?
 For example toSqlKey.

 It contains functions that search forward or backward for the first element that passes a test. If the test is whether a list element is an item instead of a separator, it can skip list separators when you move up or down a brick list.

                              <span>Can someone suggest an rpc lib that&#x27;ll let me call a function on a remote server, say via a socket, and give what that function returned? The arg / return types I need it to carry are normal scalar types (Int/Float/ByteString), as well as records. Both the client and server are my haskell code.
 I&#x27;ve been trying to use msgpack-rpc-conduit but I have no idea how to make it work with records. It&#x27;s &quot;experimental&quot; though so wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if it didn&#x27;t support it at all, and there&#x27;s zero documentation at all. I guessed all the usage from tests.

                        <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/orgmode/comments/1176vfs/are_the_name_of_headlines_called_title_or/">

                              <span>I created some capture template in which I&#x27;m using {Description} placeholder even though I&#x27;m not sure if that is the proper wording.
  (defvar my/capture-template-note (concat &quot;* %^{Description}\n&quot; &quot;:PROPERTIES:\n&quot; &quot;:Created: %U\n&quot; &quot;:END:\n&quot;) &quot;Note&quot;) (defvar my/capture-template-task (concat &quot;* %^{Description}\n&quot; &quot;:PROPERTIES:\n&quot; &quot;:Created: %U\n&quot; &quot;:END:\n&quot;) &quot;Task&quot;) 
 I&#x27;m not a native English speaker so I&#x27;m a little bit confused about it, even though I know it is a trivial thing. It&#x27;s just a placeholder that gets replaced anyway with typed text. I was wondering if &quot;title&quot; is more appropriate, though.

                              <span>I need to parse slightly dirty XMLs, and while I could roll my own parser, I want to first explore other solutions.
 It doesn&#x27;t have any non-closed or wrongly nested tags, but the escaping isn&#x27;t handled correctly.
 E.g. it has:
 Procter&amp;Gamble 
 ... where the &amp; symbol is not escaped correctly (thus &quot;expected a semi-colon after the reference for entity&quot; error).
 I don&#x27;t control the companies generating those XMLs so I cannot influence the data quality or format at the source.
 Some of the files have![CDATA[ and proper escaping and some don&#x27;t.
 I currently use xs4s.XML.loadString to parse it to scala.xml.Elem.
 I also tried to use ruippeixotog/scala-scraper to handle it as XHTML but some of the tags are 
 which are considered as empty tags by JSoup so it lost the data in them.

                              <span>Hi all, I am new to Scala. I worked with Java, JS, and Python before. I am learning Scala for my new job.
 I went into some basic Scala material and now I am trying to solve Leetcode problems that I solved before using Python to get more used to Scala. The question I have is about the Two Sum problem. I am submitting the following solution and getting a compile error.
 ​
 object Solution { def twoSum(nums: Array[Int], target: Int): Array[Int] &#x3D; { var res &#x3D; Array[Int](2) var idxs &#x3D; Array[Int](2) for ((num, index) &lt;- nums.zipWithIndex) { var remainder &#x3D; target - num if (remainder &#x3D;&#x3D; num) { for (j &lt;- 0 to (nums.length - 1)) { if (nums(j) &#x3D;&#x3D; remainder) { // idxs +&#x3D; j idxs :+ j } if (idxs.length &#x3D;&#x3D; 2) { return idxs } } } else if (nums.contains(remainder)) { // res +&#x3D; i res :+ index // res +&#x3D; nums.indexOf(remainder) res :+ nums.indexOf(remainder) } if (res.length &#x3D;&#x3D; 2) { return res } } } } 
 The error
 Line 8: error: type mismatch; (in solution.scala) found : Unit required: Array[Int] for ((num, index) &lt;- nums.zipWithIndex) { ^ 
 I don&#x27;t understand why i am getting it. I understand that the return is not an Array as expected. However, both res and idxs are arrays. Any help will be appreciated, thanks.

                              <span>hello everyone, currently i work on doom emacs and sometimes i switch to another distro like prelude or just vanilla to experiment and i have noticed that there is certain setting i want in all distros i.e. config indepently of a distro. So I would like to know how you handle this situation and also what cloud service you use for that. I want to have my configuration files in the cloud for fast setup in others computers. Is GitHub good for that?, what would be a great approach?

 Below is my code. It did what it&#x27;s supposed to do (making Arabic text show in Amiri), but when I change the font names (or anything), nothing changes. It&#x27;s Fira and Amiri all the way. not sure why. Can anyone spot an error?

 (set-face-attribute &#x27;default nil :font my/font :height 120) (dolist (charset &#x27;(arabic)) (set-fontset-font (frame-parameter nil &#x27;font) charset (font-spec :family my/font-ar))))

                              <span>I have written notes in Apple notes and these notes only contain text and images. Currently, I would have to create a new note in my org roam directory, and then copy the Apple notes text into it and save it. As for the images, I would have to store them in some directory and make a reference to it in my org file. Is there already a way to automate the whole procedure?
 It doesn&#x27;t have to be about moving notes from Apple notes to Org files. I believe the process would be similar for moving notes from words to Org as well.

                              <span>Hello there,
 Recently i moved from doom emacs to GNU emacs.
 In doom emacs &#x60;RET&#x60; key in org mode perform different action based on content which is under the cursor 
 I would like to recreate that funcationality in pure emacs. 
 These are the points which i want to happen 
  
Open link at point on pressing *RET* when on a link
 
Check a checkbox on pressing *RET* when on a checkbox or on the checkbox description
 
Mark a TODO as DONE on pressing *RET* when on the heading
 
 ​
 Thanks for the help and happy emacing

                              <span>I see compiler (and flymake) errors of this sort all the time. Consider the common pattern:
  
A.el - main code, requires and uses a.el.
 a.el - a “module” or component of a.el. Its only entry anywhere is via being required and used in A.el. Makes use of some of A.el&#x27;s functions and variables.
  
How to handle this dependency to try to satisfy the compiler:
  
Non-solution: obviously you cannot (require &#x27;a) in A.el and (require &#x27;A) in a.el.
 Just forget about it and put a.el inside A.el. Leads to large and harder to maintain files.
 defvar nil and declare-function everything that the compiler complains about in a.el. I see this a lot. Ugly, hard to maintain.
 Just ignore the compiler warnings. Lots of people do this, alarms users, encourages ignoring linters.
 Factor out the bits of A.el you need in a.el into some A-common.el and require it in both places. Maintenance headache.
  
What I want is to tell the compiler: this feature will only be required in A.el, which is its parent. I do not require it, it requires me. Compile me after compiling my parent, and consider its symbols as fully available to me.
 Anybody have a better strategy?

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to get into emacs again, but I can&#x27;t seem to break many of the habits I&#x27;ve built up using Vim for so long. Any file I&#x27;m editing is guaranteed to have some combination of hjkl or any number of Vim&#x27;s normal mode bindings littered through it. 
 I&#x27;m realizing more and more that I prefer the flexibility of modal editing. That being said, I&#x27;m really enjoying the robustness of emacs in many other ways. I know evil mode exists, but I also don&#x27;t want to just turn emacs into Vim, and it seems like evil swings too far in that direction.
 What would be a good way to make emacs a more modal editor

 ---edit---
 I think what I actually want to do is change the indentation level of body text and the headlines so that it is flush with the left margin of the buffer.

 All are collaped by default. And when i do counsel-org-goto AB
 it&#x27;s shown as
 * A... ** AB My note -, point 1 -, point 2 -, point 3... &lt;&lt;&lt;this * B... * C... 
 As you can see point 3 (last line in header) has 3 dots, and if i try to edit note after saving and reopening buffer eddits are scatered all over file outside AB header - basically they somehow placed in this 3 dots.

                              <span>Hello,
 I have been using org mode for notes but I never used or understood the todo list features.
 Now I am trying to use org for todo lists, but having trouble fitting to my mental model. Maybe it can be configured, or you can tell me why my approach is wrong.
 What I tried is (foolowing tutorials) to make some tags HOME,WORK,then make some project topics in an outline like
 * TODAY ** TODO ask reddit // tag this with @HOME * TOMORROW ** TODO finish that thing * WEEK * SOMETIME * IMPORTANT ... 
 ​
 In this view, the tags are &quot;where&quot;, and the list provides &quot;what&quot;.I can easily move items from IMPORTANT to TODAY using C-c C-w.I can filter by home or work. Good so far.
 Now, I would like to see an adjenda view that shows at least the TODAY view, and hopefully a view of selected other categories. However, this requires assigning dates. I don&#x27;t want to do that because dates do not mean much. In fact I rarely need to think about dates. I look at the calendar and note that something is due on &quot;Wednesday&quot;, not caring about the date.
 a) my TODAY list is a &quot;goal&quot; not a contract. Some days I will make a list, then learn of an unexpected task will change everything, with no time to get back to the org mode undil end of day. And most days I find that I do not complete everything on TODAY&#x27;s list. I want those uncompleted things to automatically carry over to tomorrow&#x27;s version of &quot;TODAY&quot;.
 b) I will use a calendar for things that have a particular associated time.
 c) I do not want to waste time deleting dates and adding new dates that mean little,or constantly moving tasks from one date to the next. Just leave them under TODAYuntil either they are done, or I move them to another category like SOMEDAY.
 In short, I think I do not want the calendar features for now, just a todo-list sorted by categories and with a configurable view and hot ckeys.
 Is this possible? Or, what _should_ I be doing?
 Thank you for your advice (and note that I really am a beginner).

 This fontifies a org-special-block of the proof type ie...
 #+begin_proof This is my proof #+end_proof 
 in the following way....
 Proof. This is my proof ⏹ 
 The issue is that if I change my window width, the alignment of the QED symbol (⏹) changes. Does anyone know how to fix this?

                              <span>Hey all,
 So I just made some modifications to one of my favorite packages, evil-easymotion, and wanted to share:
 https://github.com/Overdr0ne/holymotion
 What is it?
 Basically, it’s just Evil-easymotion, purged of evil.
 My take: think of a movement command, like forward-word. Rather than repeating that command four times to go four words forward, you can turn that into a holymotion/easymotion, and press a single, home-row character, and jump straight there. For those familiar with Avy, it’s much the same(and uses avy under the hood), but generalized to work with any movement command, and the ability to restrict the scope of an avy motion to look only within some lisp object, like a buffer, a sentence, or a line. This will tend to give you short, usually one/two-character targets. In my…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been working on a part-time iOS app. The Xcode is driving me crazy, I kept pressing wrong key bindings. I spent quite some time investigating LSP and similar options, and tried a few. None of them make me feel &quot;comfortable&quot;. I admit I may be overly obsessed with cleanliness. 
 I want to use eglot with iOS project, keep it consistent with my experience with other programming languages. 
 Here is how.
 Firstly, we need to install swift-mode, and set up eglot with sourcekit-lsp
  (require-package &#x27;swift-mode) (with-eval-after-load &#x27;eglot (add-to-list &#x27;eglot-server-programs &#x27;(swift-mode . (&quot;xcrun&quot; &quot;sourcekit-lsp&quot;))))

 I am modifying to to show an abbreviated code for the project directory for projects which have them and a code for those that don&#x27;t.
 How can I add a tooltip to display the full path of the project when the mouse is hovered over the abbreviation?

                              <span>Hi there! This has been bothered me for a while and I haven&#x27;t found similar posts about this. I use tui emacs 28.2 on Gentoo linux. At first it happened on my urxvt terminal, and then I tried on st terminal, the problem is still there. Some times the characters are a few ones scattered on the screen, some times they align in a line, and you can&#x27;t select and delete them. They only disappear when you close and reopen the buffer. I also didn&#x27;t find there is an operation pattern that triggers this. Anyone knows why, and how to solve this problem? thank you very much.

 That would enable one to have a canvas in a buffer that you could draw or hand write in. Excalidraw seems to be svg based, so you can put links, search text, etc. 
 I could live with a way that showed a preview of svg in emacs, but clicking on it would open it in a browser for editing, as long as the svg is locally stored. 
 Any ideas?

                              <span>Hi all,
 To scratch a personal itch, I created a little package that integrates perspective-el into the built-in tab-bar.
 Emacs showing perspectives as tabs in the tab-bar
 Adding and removing perspectives using the &#x27;x&#x27; and &#x27;+&#x27; buttons just works.
 It&#x27;s not on any repo yet, as I&#x27;d like some feedback first ;)
 You can find it here: perspective-tabs
 Let me know what you think!
 addition:
 Credit where credit is due: 
 When building this, I had a long hard look at Bufler by alphapapa, especially the implementation in bufler-workspace-tabs.el
 I&#x27;m only hacking, while sitting on the shoulders of giants. Thanks! \m/

 Then months or years later, How could refile all the done tasks under heading of Plans to GetThingsDone heading in one single command? 
 Current solution is first to use occur to popup all the done tasks &quot;C-u M-s .*DONE.*&quot; in a narrow to subtree window, then copy them to heading of GetThingsDone; 
 Second to delete them under Plans heading with regex in the previous narrow window.

                              <span>Hi!
 I&#x27;m using Company with the company-tng-mode and I would like to trigger the completion on the selected item with  when the completion window is open.
 This is how I configured the package
 elisp (use-package company :bind (:map company-active-map ([down] . nil) ([up] . nil) ([return] . company-complete-selection)) :config (global-company-mode t) (delete &#x27;company-dabbrev company-backends) :custom (company-minimum-prefix-length 2) :hook (after-init . company-tng-mode) :init (setq company-dabbrev-downcase 0 company-idle-delay 0)) 
 For some reason, when the completion menu is active, I select an item and I press  the editor creates a newline.
 Is there something I&#x27;m doing wrong? I tried different things but I&#x27;m totally lost

 I know about the following two revisions from the related Emacs Rocks episode on Dired mode:
 (add-hook &#x27;dired-mode-hook &#x27;dired-hide-details-mode) (setq dired-dwim-target t) 
 However, how would I be able to replicate the ASCII table look for each side of Midnight Commander, as well as the top of the ASCII table section and the bottom section that displays the file name or directory?
 ​
 Thanks!

 Are you using singular or plural for Org tags?

                              <span>Why is org-mode difficult to use on Microsoft Windows?
 Org-mode is a highly versatile and powerful tool for organizing notes, tasks, and documents. While it was originally developed for use with the Emacs text editor on Unix-based operating systems, it can be used on other platforms as well, including Microsoft Windows.
 However, using Org-mode on Windows can be more challenging than using it on other operating systems for several reasons:
 Emacs installation: Emacs, the text editor used to run Org-mode, is not included in Windows by default, so users need to install it separately. This can be a complex process, especially for users who are not familiar with command-line interfaces or Unix-based software.
 Compatibility issues: Some of the advanced features of Org-mode, such as exporting …</span>

                              <span>For those who implement the GTD with Org mode, do you put your work related tasks in a file like &quot;work.org&quot; and personal life related tasks in &quot;personal.org&quot;? or you just put all them in a single file and use headlines and tags to separate them, like so?
 * REPEAT Weekly Review - [ ] checklist here * Captured - Captured stuff * Personal :@personal: ** House stuff *** NEXT Task 1 *** TODO Task 2 ** PROJECT Title of Project *** WAITING Task 1 *** TODO Task 2 * Work :@work: ** Category 1 *** Task 1 *** Task 2 
 I read that splitting up Org files is not always a smart idea. I was thinking if I should put all them in one file and eventually create &quot;custom agenda views&quot; to separate the personal and work tasks in case things start to get crowded.

                              <span>Hello beautiful people! I recently wrote a program in Haskell to download/sync wallpapers from wallhaven and learned a lot about structuring real-world applications with tagless-final, ReaderT, and three-layer cake patterns. I have summarized my learning in a new blogpost on fpunfold.com. Please check it out and provide feedback. :)

                              <span>My current opinions (subject to change):
  
Most websites should mostly work without JS enabled. (In fact, they should mostly work even on text-only browsers.)
 Most &quot;single page apps&quot; (SPAs) could easily be ordinary websites that mostly work without JS enabled.
 Most SPAs therefore suck (because of the fact that they are SPAs to begin with).
 Calling Haskell functions it not possible from the standard JS/DOM on an ad-hoc basis, is it? (Only in this way is it possible to enrich a website that mostly works without JS enabled, with certain features in cases where JS is enabled.) Note: Rumors of one or two individuals doing it with some obscure trickery does not count. It should be supported by the ecosystem as a fully fledged feature.
 Therefore, you are confined to SPAs when using Haskell/JS.
 Therefore, Haskell is simply not a suitable language for web development in general and that&#x27;s just the way it is. (Apps that are legitimately SPAs only are a rare minority and that&#x27;s not what I&#x27;m talking about here.)
 This is precisely where PureScript shines.
  
Someone please debunk the above, because I really would love to be wrong so I could use Haskell for everything.

                              <span>Some might have seen my post there and there, a few days ago I started to upgrade some of my projects to a more modern LTS and encounter the UnliftIO, runSqlPoo problem. This simple problem in apparence led me down the rabbit hole and I learnt quite a lot in the process even though quite a few questions remain without answer.
 In short the following code 
 haskell runDB :: AppSql a -&gt; App a runDB query &#x3D; asks getPool &gt;&gt;&#x3D; runSqlPool query 
 stopped working, due to an MonadUnliftIO constraint which has been added at some point on runSqlPool (from the Persistent package).
 The project uses Servant and persistent, so the full type of runDB is
 haskell runDB :: _ backend &#x3D;&gt; ReaderT backend (ReaderT Config Handler) a -&gt; ReaderT Condif Handler a  with Handler (from Servant) being a wrapper around…</span>

                              <span>Dear Zettlers,
inspirated by this thread I thought that perhaps we might be able to collect case studies successes and failures (&#x3D;learning experiences!) of AI-supported knowledge work.
My hypothesis is that it is to early to move above the layer of phenomenology. The best method to access such an unknown field is trial and error.
So, I am collecting individual use cases (or perhaps even: instances). Whenever I try something I document it and leave it there. Occasionally, I will write add hypothesis to it. I will add an example to show what I mean.
If my notes on this matter reach a level that is worth publishing I will bring everything together to a document that will be available as donationware.
If you have any case study, successful interaction or failure or thoughts in general, I&#x27;d be happy if you share it.
Live long and prosper
Sascha</span>

 If I check with M-x org-lint I get : Incorrect contents for PROPERTIES drawer.
 My header :

 Tried this, not working :

 Same error :
 :PROPERTIES: :header-args:sql: :engine postgresql :dbhost localhost :dbuser xxxxx :dbpassword xxxxx :database xxxxx :dbport 5432 :END: 
 Also not working :
 #+PROPERTY: header-args:sql :engine postgresql :dbhost localhost :dbuser xxxxx :dbpassword xxxxx :database xxxxx :dbport 5432 
 But if I declare block level properties, it&#x27;s working :

 I&#x27;m helpless…

In the screenshot below, the staged inbox.org is there only because I went to the file and staged it from there.
 I checked magit-status on a different repository, and everything works as it should - it showed unstaged changes just fine.
 I turned on toggle-debug-on-error, but calling magit-status doesn&#x27;t return any errors. I checked my git config and didn&#x27;t see anything (I found this issue but the solution doesn&#x27;t help me: https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/54041/unstaged-changes-not-appearing-in-magit-plus-other-oddities)
 Did I toggle a setting somewhere to hide the list of unstaged files? Anyone have any insight?

 Example uses: - don&#x27;t run a mode hook in some directories/projects - Change a variable in some directories/projects

 The result is that, in an org document, something of the form...
 #+begin_proof Contents of proof. #+end_proof 
 gets rendered as
 Proof. Contents of proof. ⏹
 This is pretty cool, but I&#x27;d really like for the QED symbol (ie. the square) to be displayed below the contents of the proof and right aligned, like this (just replace periods with white space)....
 Proof. Contents of proof.
 ............................................................................................................................................................⏹
 Does anyone know how I can accomplish this?

                              <span>I moved Ctrl/Cmd to capslock about 15 years ago when I started to get pinky pain. But am just picking up Emacs now and committed to getting over the hump. Enjoying it so far. Except I&#x27;m picky about my modifier keys..
 I settled on a layout that I love:
 - Capslock as Ctrl
 - Enter (when held) as Meta.
 It&#x27;s symmetrical, and feels identical whether using my macbook pro&#x27;s keyboard or mechanical split keyboard with array of thumb keys which would otherwise be great modifiers. Enter still works as usual newline if you tap it.
 When navigating with something like C-f, I appreciate my left hand doesn&#x27;t have to move to go from C-f to M-f.
 I use Karabiner to make this possible. 
 On macos
 .config/karabiner/assets/complex_modifications 
 Create a json file 
 (omit &quot;conditions&quot; - I use this to only apply this modification for built-in macbook keyboard. My mechanical keyboard is programmable and has it&#x27;s own configuration to achieve this function which is a little smarter but same effect)
 { &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Hold Enter for Option&quot;, &quot;maintainers&quot;: [ &quot;myself&quot; ], &quot;rules&quot;: [ { &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Hold Enter for Option&quot;, &quot;manipulators&quot;: [ { &quot;conditions&quot;: [ { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;device_if&quot;, &quot;identifiers&quot;: [ { &quot;product_id&quot;: 832, &quot;vendor_id&quot;: 1452, &quot;is_pointing_device&quot;: false } ] } ], &quot;type&quot;: &quot;basic&quot;, &quot;from&quot;: { &quot;key_code&quot;: &quot;return_or_enter&quot;, &quot;modifiers&quot;: { &quot;optional&quot;: [ &quot;any&quot; ] } }, &quot;to_if_alone&quot;: [ { &quot;key_code&quot;: &quot;return_or_enter&quot; } ], &quot;to_if_held_down&quot;: [ { &quot;key_code&quot;: &quot;right_option&quot; } ], &quot;parameters&quot;: { &quot;basic.to_if_alone_timeout_milliseconds&quot;: 300, &quot;basic.to_if_held_down_threshold_milliseconds&quot;: 0 } } ] } ] }

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been invited by one of the contributors of org-mode to help with the documentation of org-mode Babel. Unfortunately, I&#x27;m a beginner with elisp, having spotty experience with CL only. How can I really get up to speed with elisp? What path of study would you suggest? What I&#x27;ve seen with elisp is that it&#x27;s very close -- always seems to be getting closer -- to CL -- buuuut it has its own &quot;best practices&quot; realm, i.e., you can&#x27;t just take your CL code and CL mentality verbatim into elisp. I&#x27;ve also heard that the traditional An Introduction to Programming in Emacs Lisp hasn&#x27;t really been updated to include the lexical scoping yet -- which is a game-changer that can&#x27;t be avoided, i.e., you&#x27;re learning/doing it wrong if you don&#x27;t work with lexical scoping. Any ideas how to chart a course of study to become a competent elisper?

                              <span>Nothing but anecdotal data, but when a newcomer is faced with a choice between Emacs or Vscode, they will very likely choose Vscode, one of the reasons being that Emacs has a rightful reputation of having a steep learning curve. The idea of having to install a dozen packages to get modern IDE-like features and write Elisp right away in order to customize them can be daunting and overwhelming. Personally, it took me a couple of years before I even bothered to start learning Elisp to become a more advanced user.
 By providing a more streamlined and user-friendly way to customize Emacs, we can help make the platform more approachable and welcoming to new users.
 One approach could be to provide a series of customizable templates or configurations that new users could choose from when first setting up Emacs. These templates could be designed for different use cases (e.g., programming, writing, project management, etc.), and could include pre-installed packages, keybindings, and other customizations that are tailored to the user&#x27;s needs. This would allow new users to get started with a powerful and customized Emacs setup without having to dive too deeply into the details of Elisp code.
 Another approach could be to provide a more user-friendly interface for customizing Emacs, such as a graphical user interface (GUI) or a set of interactive prompts that guide users through the customization process. This would make it easier for users to discover and experiment with different customization options, and would help them feel more confident and in control of their Emacs setup.
 I think we need to put some work and effort on this.

                              <span>I really like corfu, especially how it can be integrated with orderless to customize candidate sorting.
 However, one thing in corfu require more effort than company is how we can select candidate with corfu-index mode. 
 In company, to select 1st candidate, I can press Alt-1, 2nd candidate is Alt-2. But in corfu, we have to press Alt-1 RET to select 1st candidate, Alt-2 RET to select 2nd one...
 Is there anyway I can configure corfu to behave like company?

 how to achive this type of behavior since i try to bind evil-next-line with no luck. also is there any important binding to M-hjkl or C-hjkl

                              <span>Hey everyone,
 First and foremost I am super new to emacs. Specifically I am using Doom Emacs and I just got a new system up and rolling and installed Doom Emacs. I have done this many times before and have never had a problem. After Emacs is installed I usually go into the init.el to add the languages that I will be using along with editing the config.el file to change the font as well as the theme of emacs. This time I am getting an error anytime I try to open a file https://imgur.com/a/1BTOvrh - I have never seen this and I can&#x27;t seem to find anything via a google search. I am sure that I haven&#x27;t given enough information so if that is the case let me know and I will share anything that is needed!
 Appreciate the help in advanced.

 I&#x27;m getting an error from evaluating the last block. Wrong type argument: sequencep, 10. I&#x27;m guessing that alist is not actually an elisp list?

                              <span>Hi All,
 I started a podcast focused on Emacs and plan to release one episode a week. I&#x27;ve never done anything like this before, so I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a lot of room for improvement :-). I&#x27;ve made a Git repository that contains the show notes, for those who aren&#x27;t interested in listening to the podcast or me.
 In the fist episode, I discuss how I make use of locate, to recursively find files based on the current projects scope. You can read the episodes show notes here. Let me know if you have any questions, thanks!

 I tried &#x60;global-linum-mode&#x60; instead of global-display-line-numbers-mode.
 (setq linum-format &#x27;dynamic) (global-linum-mode t) 
 It works and displays the line number aligning correctly, but the Emacs suddenly become very very very slow.
 How could align the line number with global-display-line-numbers-mode on? (Emacs-28.2 on Kubuntu-22.10

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been wanting to try out deno but I&#x27;ve run into problems configuring my lsp-mode to work with the deno language server. I use web-mode &amp; the typescript-language-server for my day-to-day work, so I already have an LSP server bound to &#x60;*.ts&#x60; files. What I need is some what of specifying (probably in a directory e.g. with project.el) that the project &#x60;*.ts&#x60; files I&#x27;m working on are in fact deno files and need to initialize lsp-mode with the deno language server.
 Does anyone have guidance for configuring lsp-mode to work in this situation? I effectively want the default to be my current configuration, using typescript-language-server. When I&#x27;m in a deno project, I want to use the deno language server.
 Here you can see my web-mode configuration specified for &#x60;*.ts&#x60; files:
 (use-package web-mode :ensure t :mode ((&quot;\\.ts\\&#x27;&quot; . web-mode) (&quot;\\.js\\&#x27;&quot; . web-mode) (&quot;\\.mjs\\&#x27;&quot; . web-mode) (&quot;\\.tsx\\&#x27;&quot; . web-mode) (&quot;\\.jsx\\&#x27;&quot; . web-mode))) (use-package lsp-mode :ensure t :hook ((web-mode . lsp)))

 To be exact, I have a file tasks.org with two second-level headings (&quot;Shortlist&quot;, and &quot;Longlist&quot;) with tasks as third-level headings within those lists. I&#x27;d like my custom agenda view to show only the tasks under &quot;Shortlist&quot;. How do I do that?
 Right now my custom agenda view is as roughly as follows. It shows a block labeled &quot;Tasks&quot; but that shows all the TODOs in tasks.org not just the ones in the short list:
  ((&quot; &quot; &quot;Agenda&quot; ((agenda &quot;&quot; ((org-agenda-span &#x27;week) (org-deadline-warning-days 365))) (todo &quot;TODO&quot; ((org-agenda-overriding-header &quot;To Refile&quot;) (org-agenda-files &#x27;(&quot;inbox.org&quot;)))) (todo &quot;TODO&quot; ((org-agenda-overriding-header &quot;Tasks&quot;) (org-agenda-files &#x27;(&quot;tasks.org&quot;)))) nil)))

                              <span>For the :export keyword this docstring states the following:
 Function that accepts four arguments: - the path, as a string, - the description as a string, or nil, - the export back-end, - the export communication channel, as a plist.
 When nil, export for that type of link is delegated to the back-end.
 Can someone explain to me what is meant by the export communication channel here and possibly what it would be for the html back-end? TIA.

                              <span>Let&#x27;s say I teach classes from 16 to 20 hs. This is shown, in the agenda view, as:
  Friday 12 June 2022 8:00 ┄┄┄┄┄ ┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄ 10:00 ┄┄┄┄┄ ┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄ 10:47 ┄┄┄┄┄ ← now ─────────────────────────────────────────────── 12:00 ┄┄┄┄┄ ┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄ 14:00 ┄┄┄┄┄ ┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄ 16:00-20:00 Teaching 16:00 ┄┄┄┄┄ ┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄ 18:00 ┄┄┄┄┄ ┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄ 20:00 ┄┄┄┄┄ ┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄ 
 This can be rather confusing at a glance, as it might lead to think that I could arrange a meeting at 18:00. Moreover, it doesn&#x27;t help visualizing easily how much time an activity (such as Teaching, in this case) demands. 
 How would I go from that (above) to this (below):
 Friday 12 June 2022 8:00 ┄┄┄┄┄ ┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄ 10:00 ┄┄┄┄┄ ┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄ 10:47 ┄┄┄┄┄ ← now ─────────────────────────────────────────────── 12:00 ┄┄┄┄┄ ┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄ 14:00 ┄┄┄┄┄ ┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄ 16:00 Teaching 18:00 Teaching 20:00 ┄┄┄┄┄ ┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄ 
 so I can see how much of my time is blocked by activities?
 Thanks in advance for all your help.

 Is there something like org-hide-emphasis-markers for links?

                              <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;m a product guy with non-prod-levels of previous coding experience (HTML/CSS, Python) and I&#x27;m learning Scala with the intent of making it the first language I&#x27;m proficient in to the degree that I can write software in it.
 Looking at the big picture - obviously Scala is multi-paradigm and sets me up for tackling a lot of different use cases by itself, but what language(s) do you consider to be the best ones for matching with Scala once I&#x27;ve mastered it?
 (I appreciate that the simplest answer to this is probably &quot;Depends what you want to work on!&quot; I&#x27;m still mulling my options in that sense, so getting a sense that &#x27;Scala + x &#x3D; Great prospects in y&quot; would be incredibly helpful).
 Thanks!

2.13.11: https://contributors.scala-lang.org/t/scala-2-13-11-release-planning/6088
 2.12.18: https://contributors.scala-lang.org/t/scala-2-12-18-release-planning/6089
  
We want to ship JDK 20 support and Scala 3.3 support, and also it&#x27;s just been a while (Sep/Oct 2022), so it&#x27;s getting to be time.

I tried to &quot;remove&quot; the ExceptT part of a &#x60;ReaderT Config Handler and convert between the ExceptT version and the Either version. I came up with this
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;haskell fromHandler :: ReaderT ctx (ExceptT e IO) a -&gt; ReaderT ctx IO (Either e a) fromHandler h &#x3D; ReaderT $ runExceptT . runReaderT h
 toHandler :: ReaderT ctx IO (Either e a) -&gt; ReaderT ctx (ExceptT e IO) a toHandler h &#x3D; ReaderT $ ExceptT . runReaderT h &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 This ReaderT ... runReaderT pattern looks life fmap but is not. Is there a simpler way to do so (Also, I can figure a way to make it point free.

                              <span>Hello, I want to manually capture links, without clipboard or external tools such as org-protocol.
 I came up with this because I couldn&#x27;t use org-insert-link. I didn&#x27;t work for me. Maybe I used org-insert-link wrong in the template. This one works fine:
 (&quot;b&quot; &quot;Bookmark&quot; entry (file+headline ,(concat org-directory &quot;/bookmarks.org&quot;) &quot;Bookmarks&quot;) &quot;* [[%^{link-url}][%^{link-description}]]&quot;) 
 However, I&#x27;m not sure if this method is proper.

                              <span>I&#x27;m using Doom Emacs with emacs version 28.2. I want to use emacs to write all of my php code using php-mode and all the utilities it brings but the indentation is not what I want. When I type ENTER after a function I want to write the left curly brace with the same indentation as the function definition. Something like this:
 https://preview.redd.it/fmcbgnisnjia1.png?width&#x3D;591&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;124a72aa69244a781bf6f401b191522d6003b224
 But instead when I hit enter after defining the function the brackets are like this:
 https://preview.redd.it/mo15f4tonjia1.png?width&#x3D;515&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;a00399089263bdbd643330c1bea409c0a71b60d0
 I guess php-mode is doing this but I&#x27;d like to change it. I&#x27;ve tried overriding the c-set-style to &quot;linux&quot; and many other styles but it doesn&#x27;t work. Does anyone know how to do this without rejecting php-mode and use web-mode instead? I really like php-mode.

                              <span>I&#x27;m having trouble navigating jupyter notebooks with EIN. I&#x27;m trying to navigate to the next/previous cell, and I understand from https://tkf.github.io/emacs-ipython-notebook/ that this is done with &#x60;widget-forward&#x60; / &#x60;widget-backward&#x60;. However this doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything. I don&#x27;t know if this is because I&#x27;m also using evil too?
 Thanks for any help!

I&#x27;ve found this snippet: Using M-up and M-down to transpose paragraphs : however it moves the whole org-element (for example a paragraph), and I want something simply line-based. I&#x27;ve tried to define this hook: (add-to-list &#x27;org-metaup-hook (lambda () (interactive) (prog2 (transpose-lines 1) (previous-line 2)))) (add-to-list &#x27;org-metadown-hook ⠀ (lambda () (interactive) (progn (next-line 1) (transpose-lines -1) (previous-line 1)))) But is doing strange things and I don&#x27;t understand transpose-lines very well. It seems like there is no way for the cursor move along with the line you are moving up and down. Is there a simpler way to do this?

                              <span>This is a newb programming question, and unfortunately Googling has failed me. I see this kind of code all the time in minad&#x27;s packages where an anonymous function is put inside a named function:  (defun tempel--completion-table (templates) &quot;Return a completion table for a list of TEMPLATES. The completion table specifies the category &#x60;tempel&#x27;.&quot; (lambda (str pred action) (if (eq action &#x27;metadata) &#x27;(metadata (category . tempel)) (complete-with-action action templates str pred))))  What would be the purpose of doing that? My guess is that the named function is later going to by applyed or apply-partiallyed, and the other function that will do the applying wants to influence the result in some variable way with an argument to the named function, and the lambda inside the named function only accepts a fixed number of arguments (because that’s how the underlying lisp code that is being hacked was written), and so there needs to be this middleman named function. 
 Am I close, or hopelessly far off? Are there any other reasons one might put a lambda inside a named function?

 (let ((citekey-regex &quot;@[a-zA-Z0-9\\-\\:?]+&quot;) (files (denote-directory-text-only-files))) (mapcar #&#x27;xref-match-item-summary (xref-matches-in-files citekey-regex files))) 
 This snippet provides decent results, but it contains a lot of metadata. Can I extract a list of just strings?

 Anything between these tags will not get syntax highlighted.
 I tried setting the engine web-mode to php but no luck.

 It only works, however, if I automaticallly execute it. How can I make it so that the desired effect occurs automatically. I have a similar issue with changing the face style of org-blocks. Thanks.

 --edit--
 The following worked...
 ​
  (defun org-fontify-proof-blocks () (add-to-list &#x27;font-lock-extra-managed-props &#x27;display) (let ((margin-format (format &quot;%%%ds&quot; left-margin-width))) (font-lock-add-keywords nil &#x60;( (&quot;^#\\+begin_proof.*?\\(\n\\)&quot; 1 &#x27;(face nil display &quot; &quot;)) (&quot;^\\(#\\+begin_proof.*$\\)&quot; 1 &#x27;(face nil display (,(concat (propertize &quot;Proof.&quot; &#x27;face &#x27;(:inherit bold))) append))) (&quot;\\(\n#\\+end_proof.*\\)$&quot; 1 &#x27;(face nil display (,(concat (propertize &quot; ∎&quot; &#x27;face &#x27;(:inherit bold))) append))) ))) (font-lock-fontify-buffer)) (add-hook &#x27;org-mode-hook #&#x27;org-fontify-proof-blocks) 
 I&#x27;d like to make it so that the ∎ appears on the line below and is right aligned though. Any help on that would be great.

 Dear all,
 I just want to send you all a quick note to let you know that we have an opening for a student internship, on-site at NASA Ames Research Center, this summer:
 https://stemgateway.nasa.gov/public/s/course-offering/a0B3d000000y6o5EAA/onsite-improving-testing-capabilities-for-cfsrosfprime
 The student, if selected, will be working on extending our capabilities to test cFS/ROS/FPrime applications, especially those using Ogma and/or Copilot for monitoring. Both Ogma and Copilot are open-source software written in Haskell.
 Applicants for this internship must be U.S. Citizens and meet a minimum 3.0 GPA requirement. Prior experience is not required. Knowledge of the following will be considered a plus: Haskell or other functional languages, C/C++, Bash, git, Docker, Linux, NASA Core Flight System, Robot Operating System, FPrime. Please note that the academic level listed in the opening is merely indicative and students at other levels (e.g., PhD) will also be considered.
 For further details, or if you have any questions, see intern.nasa.gov and the specific listing at https://stemgateway.nasa.gov/public/s/course-offering/a0B3d000000y6o5EAA/onsite-improving-testing-capabilities-for-cfsrosfprime.

                              <span>I’m learning Haskell and have an environment setup with vscode , stack and the Haskell language server extension. It works great and is certainly a great assistance to learning , but is there a way to silence the “declared but unused” warning and yellow underlining? 
 Maybe I’m misunderstanding how it’s supposed to work but I like to develop functions in a module ( I start with a skeleton Lib.hs from a stack project and add new functions to this file and then load and test them in ghci repl in a terminal. I get warnings from hls that say the functions are not used . So what ? There are plenty of cases where you want to define a function but not use it , so I’m guessing I’m doing something else wrong .

                              <span>Hi,
 I have a set of annotations and a case class as follows:
 import scala.annotation._ class GreaterThan(level: Double) extends StaticAnnotation class SmallerThan(level: Double) extends StaticAnnotations case class Quantity(@GreaterThan(0) x: Double, u/SmallerThan(1) y: Double, n: String) 
 I would like to access each field of the case class, its type, its annotation(with value) in order to do something with this information.
 Like I would like to know that there is x in Quantity, that is Double, that is annotated with GreaterThan, where the value of the annotation is 0. 
 Is there a way to achieve that in Scala? I know reflect could achieve part of what I want, mainly the fields and the types. But the annotations .. Can&#x27;t find a reference for that!
 Many thanks
 ​

                              <span>opam is a source-based package manager for OCaml. It is the de-facto
standard for package management in the OCaml ecosystem. opam’s main package
repository contains over 4000 individual
packages, on average spanning 7 versions each.
Like many other language-specific package managers (e.g. cargo, cabal, etc.), opam
performs four main tasks:
Download the sources.
Resolve the needed dependencies of a package.
Provide those dependencies such that the build system can find them.
Run the build system.
It is pretty good at this. However, there are some problems with step (4):
The build is not properly isolated: it can (in theory) fetch arbitrary things
from the network, access arbitrary files on the filesystem, and even modify
other packages. This allows for irreproducible builds, and makes it ea…</span>

 I have two issues:
  
I end up with emphasis across manually broken lines, ie.This_lineText betweenThis_lineWill result in the line &quot;Text between&quot; getting emphasized. I thought by adding \n to the list of forbidden characters that this would be fixed, but it is not.
 I cannot mix emphasis properly ie.*T*his *should* be *bold* should bold &quot;T&quot;, &quot;should&quot;, and &quot;bold&quot; but instead bolds &quot;This should&quot;

 example of how that usually works:

 *closes journal*
 &quot;don&#x27;t forget, the project details are in here, don&#x27;t forget don&#x27;t forget don&#x27;t forget--&quot;

                              <span>This is a long-shot, but where else to ask but here? So the situation is org-mode Babel&#x27;s ob-prolog (https://github.com/ljos/ob-prolog). Prolog is unique in that it&#x27;s like a database where you enter &quot;facts&quot; into a running REPL, then do queries on those facts in the running REPL. This means a Babel, in order to be useful, must be able in one code block to add new facts to the REPL, then give answers to a code block acting as a query. Just the normal prolog-mode will only allow you to write out a database of facts in a buffer, then pose the queries in the the running REPL -- not both together. (This is not dissimilar to any other interpreted language with code and REPL separated.) Again, Babel should offer both in the same buffer. Unfortunately something like child(jane, fred). is a database…</span>

 I have seen a lot of screenshots of the dashboard package. So I decided to install it today. 
 I read the documentation and there is a lot of about how to configure it. But this might be a very stupid question: 
 how do I display it? 
 what is the command that will show me the dashboard?

 I use python a lot at work, and usually I debug my code using very primitive approaches, I am slowly moving to pdb. 
 Someone could share his experience or workflow with eglot and debugging, specifically with python?
 Also, should I have a python lsp server per computer or per project?
 I apologize if both are silly questions

                              <span>I&#x27;ve used to use Line mode in Vim, which allows select which kind of whitespace is emphasized/marked - leading, trailing, tabs, general, multispace etc.
 Tried to achieve similar behavior with the builtin whitespace-mode module but to no avail. Need to mark leading and trailing whitespace characters only, however Emacs puts space mark replacement everywhere:
 Emacs screenshot
 For a comparison, the same file opened in gVim, with whitespace mark only at beginnings and ends of lines:
 Vim screenshot
 Is there a way to tweak whitespace-mode to not put replacement · mark outside of leadining/trailing parts? Is there an alternative 3rd party mode which can do this?
 Thanks in an advance.

                              <span>Hi, 
 I do have a problem when Emacs is trying to load the Dashboard package.
 I have configured in my .emacs file to show the most 10 recent files that I have used, 5 bookmarks, 5 agenda entries and 2 registers. 
 It used to be working but now I do not know what I have done that it does not display the 5 agenda entries neither the 2 registers.
 I only have the following message:
 dashboard-agenda--set-face-when-match: Invalid regexp: &quot;Unmatched [ or [^&quot;
 I read the dashboard package documentation but I could not find any solution. 
 If someone is can help me with this I will be grateful.
 Thanks.

                              <span>I use emacs for email, but it polls my emails every 5 minutes. This works great in general, but I would like to use it with Delta Chat as well (something as grand as Telega is not expected), which would mean having an IM-level of responsiveness for wherever I have my chat set up. DeltaChat is FSF, too, so I have hopes; but nothing seems evident at https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/CategoryChatClient . Does anyone know of a good solution so that I can keep DeltaChat similar to how I keep my Telega in emacs?

 I added pixel-scroll-precision-use-momentum t
 Does anyone have a smooth experience with using this new mode on MacOS?

                              <span>Hey reddit,
 from time to time my (spac)emacs is slow, which I try to resolve using the internal problem. However, it seldomly points me a in a useful direction. Most recently, one of the lags occurred when I tried opening an org-roam node using helm. Typing characters in helm was slow, so I profiled it
 ​
 CPU profling
 ​
 Memory profiling
 It points (unsuprisingly) to Helm and org-roam, whereas I was hoping that there is a third component involved (like a minor-mode) that&#x27;s making problems.
 ​
 My question is essentially: How would you go from here to identify (and mitigate) potential underlying issues?
 Best,

                              <span>Can anyone point me to a modern setup process for getting Haskell to work in vscode or equivalent IDE ? I have everything installed with stack and I can edit code in vscode using the hls plugin for syntax which works well, but for evaluation, I open a terminal and use ghci to load the working file from disk after saving in vscode. It’s not a bad workflow but I was looking for something that would provide more interaction with the repl and do code evaluating in the editor . Does that exist ? Thank you

                              <span>Is there a way to write a function with: fastpow::Integer-&gt;Integer-&gt;Integer using bitshifts?
 It needs to calculate X^p.
