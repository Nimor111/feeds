                              <span>I just grabbed the NOV package from MELPA, and an EPUB-format copy of Moby Dick from Gutenberg.
 Nov mode works fine with the EPUB document, and the major mode is named &quot;EPUB&quot;. Org-noter doesn&#x27;t start up, probably because it&#x27;s looking for a buffer in &#x60;nov-mode&#x60;. 
  
Does anyone use these packages together?
 
When did NOV change its major mode from &#x60;nov-mode&#x60; to &#x60;EPUB-mode&#x60;?
  
I am one of the maintainers for org-noter, but I only use it with PDFs.

                              <span>Link buttons in EWW for example are implemented as text-property buttons with a &#x27;follow-link&#x27; property and a &#x27;help-echo&#x27; property that encodes the URL to follow. (button-at (point)) when on such a button, returns a marker as the button object; let&#x27;s call it &#x27;linkbut&#x27;. But (button-activate linkbut) fails due to the lack of an &#x27;action&#x27; property. If this is considered a button as determined by button-at, then I would suggest that button-activate be updated to utilizes the follow-link property and activate the link appropriately.
 One simple way to resolve this is to start adding an &#x27;action&#x27; property to follow-link buttons.

                              <span>Hi,
 I would like to mark all long words (say: &gt; 20 chars) in the current buffer.
 My Google-fu didn&#x27;t help me much. Is there already something for this out there? If not, how could one build a elips script for selecting the words and marking those?

 Why is this happening?
 Is there any way show the options right away?
 OS: Arch Linux
 Emacs version: 28.1
 I have the same issue in emacs -Q, although the completion works differently in vanilla Emacs. I am using the consult/vertico/orderless framework.
 Here is the test code that you can run in your emacs config or in emacs -Q. In my case the result is the same. The new frame does not show options right away. I have to insert a character or press tab to see them.
 (defun test-miniframe-completing-read () &quot;Test miniframe completing read&quot; (interactive) (with-selected-frame (make-frame &#x27;((name . &quot;emacs-miniframe&quot;) (minibuffer . only) (width . 120) (height . 33))) (unwind-protect (let ((choices &#x27;(&quot;first&quot; &quot;second&quot; &quot;third&quot;))) (completing-read &quot;Select: &quot; choices)) (delete-frame)))) (test-miniframe-completing-read)

                              <span>Hi everyone, I had some enquiries about b2b scala job offers. What I understand is the developer should own his own company so that the contracts is between the two businesses ie the client and the developer. And in some cases there&#x27;s a talent recruitment firm in the middle. 
 My question is does the job application process differ from normal employment job offers. 
 Does the job application require you to apply as a business or individual say my company is scalaconsults. 
 What if you are a 3 man outfit. All partners in your business, can you still apply for such job contracts. How does the interview process go now that you are more than one.
 Incase of b2b scala jobs on linkedin where do I show that this is my business, this is my crew, this is what I&#x27;ve done. Coz on linkedin it seems like an individual process not business.
 Once your employed can you subcontract the work.
 Sorry for the many questions. Hope there&#x27;s a kind soul here who can clarify this whole b2b thing for me.

                              <span>I&#x27;m planning to start blogging. It seems the following two options are best for my use case:
  
org-publish: systemscrafters YT, it&#x27;s show note
 ox-hugo documentation site
  
 My use case of blog: 
  
Planning to writing multiple documentations of small projects I work on
 Tutorials of the projects, Tips &amp; Tricks
  
 My Concerns:
  
I&#x27;d prefer minimal, (org-publish seemed bit more minimal, but not 100% sure)
 
I want to use separate org-files (on ox-hugo prefers single file for all site)
 I know nothing about HTML/CSS. (I&#x27;ll face some problems on theme-ing org-publish)
 I&#x27;ve heard about hugo is fast at parsing when there are many files. Would org-publish lag when there is hundreds of files?
 (not necessarily) I&#x27;d like to integrate org-roam&#x27;s back-linking, if it&#x27;s possible
  
What are your opinion and experience?

                              <span>Hi folks,
 I want to explore the Erlang style concurrency model library in Haskell which is the cloud haskell project. My first step is to use it in a toy project to send ping-pong messages between two processes.
 I add distributed-process as a dependency and in extra-deps in stack.yaml file, but I get dependency errors. After adding the recommended dependencies, I am finally stuck with incompatible versions of base. The one in the stack lts version and the one in the library hashable do not match.
 I see that there&#x27;s a config setup for lts-19.28 here, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to work for me when I create a new stack project with 19.28 resolver.
 Is there any other way I can get this to work? I am using GHCup for managing my Haskell installation and these are the versions if it matters.
 GHCup 0.1.19.2
 Stack 2.9.3

                              <span>Hello,
 if I understand correctly, then the lambda calculus consists of just variables, function application and abstraction.
 Given the term &quot;λa. (λ b. a b) a&quot; can you help me to understand what exactly the amounf of subexpressions of this lambda expression are?
 The lack or use of parentheses both still confuse me. I have read that sometimes most parentheses are ommitted and that the abstraction chooses its body greedily, that is, extends itself as far right as possible. My idea is:
  
The expression itself is a (not proper) subexpression
 The first lambda body extends over all the remaining symbols (?) meaning that we have an abstraction of the form λa. M where M a subexpression.
 M itself is an application again (λ b. a b) a
 a is a subexpression of M
 (λ b. a b) is another one
 Lastly, this is λ b. M&#x27; for some M&#x27; which in this case is a b. Now is a b an application? It has to be since the language doesn&#x27;t contain something like Var Var, but it does contain the application (X Y) for some terms of the language, right?
  
​
 It&#x27;s still a little confusing for me, could someone maybe point me to the right solution? I am sure if I understand this example I should be able to understand most of them. Thank you in advance!

                              <span>I just figured out how to encode pattern matching into &quot;De Bruijn Notation as a Nested Datatype&quot;:
 {-# LANGUAGE GADTs #-} module NestedPattern where import Control.Monad import Data.Functor.Compose import Data.Traversable import Data.Void data Term x where Var :: x -&gt; Term x App :: Term x -&gt; Term x -&gt; Term x Lam :: Traversable f &#x3D;&gt; Pattern f -&gt; Term (f x) -&gt; Term x data Pattern f where Bind :: Pattern Maybe Pair :: Pattern f -&gt; Pattern g -&gt; Pattern (Compose f g) instance Functor Term where fmap &#x3D; liftM instance Applicative Term where pure &#x3D; return () &#x3D; ap instance Monad Term where return &#x3D; Var Var x &gt;&gt;&#x3D; f &#x3D; f x App e1 e2 &gt;&gt;&#x3D; f &#x3D; App (e1 &gt;&gt;&#x3D; f) (e2 &gt;&gt;&#x3D; f) Lam pm e &gt;&gt;&#x3D; f &#x3D; Lam pm (e &gt;&gt;&#x3D; traverse f) instance Foldable Term where foldMap &#x3D; foldMapDefault instance Traversable Term where traverse f (Var x) &#x3D; Var  f x traverse f (App e1 e2) &#x3D; App  traverse f e1  traverse f e2 traverse f (Lam pm e) &#x3D; Lam pm  (traverse (traverse f) e) left, right :: Term Void left &#x3D; Lam (Pair Bind Bind) (Var $ Compose $ Just $ Nothing) right &#x3D; Lam (Pair Bind Bind) (Var $ Compose $ Nothing) 
 For those unaware, De Bruijn Notation as a Nested Datatype shows to use nested data types to encode debrujin indexes in the type system. In the encoding, an abstract syntax tree is parameterized by their free variables. Lambdas in this encoding simply add an extra inhabitant to their child term.
 My extension here uses GADTs (and HKTs) to make this work with patterns as well. A pattern in this encoding is something that describes how to map free variables, so Bind just adds an extra inhabit like what a normal lambda would do and Pair composes the maps of other patterns.

If it stops hanging after this point, it will then hang on package frefresh done (for 3-4 minutes). I did not change anything related to this in my configuration prior to this issue starting. This also happens w/ emacs -Q and a test configuration. I have tried adding (custom-set-variables &#x27;(gnutls-algorithm-priority &quot;normal:-vers-tls1.3&quot;)) based on this forum post but the issue persists. Any help is appreciated.

                              <span>I’m using the native Windows emacs app, and SyncThing to sync files between computers that I move between throughout the day, and I want the files to automatically stay in sync without having to revert-buffer all the time. 
 I used to use just the following for my auto-revert-mode config:
 (global-auto-revert-mode 1) 
 but I noticed it wasn’t consistent in catching changes. So I did some research and found some suggested changes here and here that I tried in my config:
 (custom-set-variables &#x27;(auto-revert-remote-files t) &#x27;(auto-revert-interval 10) &#x27;(auto-revert-verbose nil) 
 This seemed to work more consistently, but I still notice inconsistency in files getting auto-reverted. 
 The one change I haven’t tried is setting auto-revert-use-notify to nil, but I was wondering if I’m missing something obvious in my setup. 
 Thanks for any help!

                              <span>So, I like everything about the new built-in treesitter except for how it overrides mark-sexp, backward-up-list and other sexp bindings, especially in C++ it completely breaks the otherwise pretty good sexp navigation. Is there a way I can retain the navigation functionality from the old c++-mode while keeping other treesitter functionality like highlighting, indentation etc?
 Note that when I describe key, bindings like C-M-Spc don&#x27;t seem to be bound to other custom functions upon enabling treesitter, so I am not sure what&#x27;s changing their behavior.

 Edit: I should clarify that I want to complete language symbols and project-specific module/function names. I do not need shell command completion - that is a solved problem.

                              <span>hi!
 I am trying to forget about standard terminal emulators, and to work 100% in emacs.
 how shall I open files when I am working in vterm. In my regular terminal emulator (alacritty), I would edit the files with emacsclient. but how when I am already in vterm in emacs?
 How you people do in that case? Open another emacsclient instance from within vterm?
 Thanks for sharing

                              <span>TITLE FIX: In elisp, how do I use consult to get the user&#x27;s selection from a list of items?
 Suppose I have the following list:
 (setq elements &#x27;((&quot;apple&quot; &quot;fruit&quot;) (&quot;train&quot; &quot;vehicle&quot;) (&quot;cherry&quot; &quot;fruit&quot;) (&quot;bycicle&quot; &quot;vehicle&quot;))) 
 How do I use consult and all the completion goodies to get one of the entries of the elements list?
 I would like to be able to select based on the name of the entry, which would be the first element of the list. But I would like to get the list as the selection.
 Is it possible?
 Is there a better way to structure the entries of the elements list? Maybe something like this:
 (:type &quot;vehicle&quot; :name &quot;train&quot;) 
 Sorry if this should be obvious, I am still learning elisp and I am struggling with it. I tried to read the code of the consult-buffer but I could not figure how is the plist SOURCE structured.
 SOLVED: completing-read function is the answer. There is a very nice guide here: https://howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/alt-completing-read.html

                              <span>I use Doom which packages better-jumper and binds better-jumper-jump-backward to C-o. I use this binding extensively in my workflow and it mostly works well, but there are a few scenarios where jumping backwards doesn&#x27;t seem to work.
 First, when I&#x27;m in Org Agenda and press Enter on a todo item (org-agenda-switch-to) to go to the corresponding org file, I&#x27;m unable to jump back to the Org Agenda buffer - C-o takes me to a seemingly random location. I tried fixing this with advice:
  (advice-add &#x27;org-agenda-switch-to :before #&#x27;better-jumper-set-jump) 
 but the location in Org Agenda still doesn&#x27;t seem to be in the jump list.
 Second, when in helpful mode (when looking up docs with e.g. helpful-key or helpful-callable) I can&#x27;t figure out how to go back after following a link in the docs (i.e. after pressing Enter over a link). In helpful mode better-jumper-jump-backward just doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything and I&#x27;m at a loss as to how I&#x27;m supposed to navigate.
 I&#x27;d really appreciate any help from those more familiar with setting up these libraries than I am.

For some reason, when I scroll with my mousepad slowly, if I try to scroll past the current line number, it will jump back to the original position that the screen was in. i am wondering if anyone else has encountered a similar issue and if there is any way to fix this. This seems to only happen in evil non-insert states. Thanks.

 I am writing a paper, and I need to use a specific CLS file. I don&#x27;t want to add it to my init.el in the list org-latex-classes, is it possible to using .dir-locals.el for this? Couls you show me an example?
 Thanks in advance
 Update: confused CLS with CSL

                              <span>Hi there,
 I&#x27;ve been recently spending a lot of time inside docker containers (or Podman in my case), and because of this, project.el has picked up a project and stored it in the projects file. If Emacs reboots and the container is no longer there, project attempts to open the file in TRAMP, and TRAMP hangs until I press q to allow tramp to exit.
 I can think of two ways to hypothetically fix this:
 The first is by modifying the project-find-functions list. It&#x27;s a list of functions which are ran in succession until one of them returns a truthy value. My current project-find-functions is (project-try-vc project-try-local). I believe in my case project-try-vc is returning t.
 The second is by telling TRAMP to move on after a failure, allowing the boot to complete even when some projects are not accessible. I&#x27;m thinking an advice might be necessary to achieve this.
 Are there any other options? Does anyone out there have a solution to this already?
 Thanks!

 Hardware and OS
 CPU : Ryzen 5800X OS: Windows 11 Pro 10.0.22621
 Mostly CPU is the only relevant hardware here.
 Emacs environment
 Custom-built binary: Emacs master branch, commit a57a8b. I built using the configure flags in this guide: https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/131354i/guide_compile_your_own_emacs_to_make_it_really/
 Prebuilt binary: Download the official website, commit bc61a1: https://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/pretest/windows/emacs-30/
 I tried to build from source with the same commit, but it failed. Both differ not too much anyway.
 Both run the same .emacs.d and all built-in Elisp libraries are compiled to eln.
 Benchmarks
 Fibonacci 40
 Elisp code, tested in scratch buffer:

 Is there any easy way to keep projects and their subtasks grouped in the agenda view, even if the priority of them is different? I.e. this is how it is without priorities set https://imgur.com/1QML6US (I assume based on the order the files are processed) And this is what it looks like after changing the priorirty: https://imgur.com/Dfven4b
 And this is what I would like for it to look like: https://imgur.com/NUwAy8K or https://imgur.com/lsire7C

                              <span>Hi,
 I have based my emacs config on Emacs Prelude from u/bbatsov, because I did not trust starting from vanilla emacs.
 When starting my emacs, I get a warning saying the the package dash-functional is no valid anylonger and must be replaced by the package dash from the same author,
 Is it some thing I can dom or only the author of Prelude?
 So far, I have installed dashm but it does not seem to fix the problem. Thx for your insights,

Which shortcut should I use? Or what are the general rules? C-c, C-x, C-i or something else?.
 
How to rebind it? I often struggle with that simple keybinding stuff because of different modes and keymaps. I didn&#x27;t get the concept of it and often fail of rebind keys.

                              <span>I use TRAMP a lot to access remote Linux machines (from a local macOS machine), usually without any problems. I try to do the same to access remote macOS machines, but I have never managed to get it to work.
 From within Emacs using vterm I can ssh into remote macOS machines just fine. But if I try to connect to the same machine using TRAMP to open the remote user&#x27;s home directory in Dired it always fails. Or, more correct, it takes ages to complete, never actually connecting.
 This is true for all remote macOS machines I have tried to connect to using TRAMP. None of them uses any fancy oh-my-zsh, the prompts are standard macOS zsh prompts.
 Is there anything specific with remote macOS that messes up TRAMP?

  (setq ns-function-modifier &#x27;hyper) 
 and it works perfectly fine on my GUI Emacs on MacOS, but it becomes a problem in terminal emacs, where it doesn&#x27;t recognize the key. I was wondering how to fix this, or what the best way is to have my own command prefix.

                              <span>I am tinkering with EXWM again and I would like to be able to access to the keybinding space activated by the &#x27;general prefix key&#x27;. I use Evil package and the prefix key is SPC when in normal mode. The problem is that this prefix is not available in Firefox and such because SPC gets intercepted.
 So, my question is, how do I add C-SPC as an additional prefix key so that both SPC and C-SPC act as viable ways to activate the which-key minibuffer? I would use SPC in Emacs buffers and C-SPC in xorg clients.
 Side question, related to EXWM: Does anybody know why the media keys do not work in full screen videos played in firefox? If the video is not in fullscreen the media keys work, which is really weird. First time I see something like this.

                              <span>Hi, I tried everything.
 I have org setted up with elpaca like this:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;elisp (use-package org :config (font-lock-add-keywords &#x27;org-mode &#x27;((&quot;^ *\([-]\) &quot; (0 (prog1 () (compose-region (match-beginning 1) (match-end 1) &quot;•&quot;)))))) (electric-indent-local-mode -1) (org-babel-do-load-languages &#x27;org-babel-load-languages &#x27;((clojure . t) (cpp . t) (elisp . t) (haskell . t) (python . t) (scheme . t) (shell . t) (C . t))) (require &#x27;ob-python) :hook ((org-mode . org-indent-mode) (org-mode . variable-pitch-mode) (org-mode . visual-line-mode)) :init (setq org-agenda-files &#x27;(&quot;~/Notes&quot;) org-babel-default-header-args:python &#x27;((:results . &quot;output&quot;)) org-confirm-babel-evaluate nil org-edit-src-content-indentation 2 org-ellipsis &quot;  &quot; org-fontify-quote-and-verse-blocks t org-hide-block-startup nil org-hide-emphasis-markers t org-image-actual-width nil org-pretty-entities t org-src-fontify-natively t org-src-preserve-indentation t))
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 I tried moving org-babel-do-load-languages to :init.
 I tried moving it at the end of my configuration after (elpaca-wait).
 I tried putting it inside (eval-after-load &#x27;org).
 If I go to an Org file (and I see that the configuration is getting loaded, because things like org-agenda-files appear), and I do C-c C-c on a Python source file, I receive the message No org-babel-execute function for python!.
 The only way it works is if I do ielm and either manually do the org-babel-do-load-languages thing, or I run (require &#x27;ob-python).
 It&#x27;s been all day and I can&#x27;t get it to work inside my configuration file.
 Can somebody help me please?

                              <span>Hey guys!
 I&#x27;m studying CS and currently attend a course that involves creating a small project using REScala to give a little introduction to functional-reactive programming (in addition to doing all the necessary research and writing a small paper about it).
 My professor added, that everything we intend to demonstrate during our presentation should not be something trivial like a &#x60;Hello, world!&#x60; programs or similar, so I figured I might ask here if anybody has some small project ideas that are feasible for a Scala and FRP newbie yet ideally impress my professor.
 Thanks in advance for any help! 
 EDIT:
 I might&#x27;ve added that I am not new to functional programming in general and definitely know my way around (have some experience using various languages, mainly Haskell).

                              <span>Hi Scala Peeps,
 I wrote a new blog about some of the not-so-obvious and common features of SBT, especially for the newbies. Here is the link: https://yadukrishnan.live/unlocking-the-power-of-sbt-a-beginners-guide-to-understanding-not-so-common-features
 With this, I am hoping that I can help some of the new comers to SBT to use these powerful features of SBT. 
 Please do read the blog and let me know if you find it useful and informative. 
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hi All, 
 Im a Univeristy Student currently studying Computer Science at the University of Southampton, and as apart of my Dissertation / Thesis i have created a proof-of-concept tool that combines ideas from the Functional Language Haskell with the Block-Based visual paradigm.
 Ive spent alot of time and effort on this project, and whilst i havent managed to achieve all my goals, im still proud of its outcome and am here to share it!
 You can find the project at https://blockell.netlify.app/, where you can create small programs using blocks to declare functions and generate haskell code. Unfortionately, there are no tutorials for the tool, and to run the code you have to copy it into a haskell file and run it locally on your machine. :( 
 Anyways, if you like the tool, or have any comments, suggestions or improvements feel free to comment them below or answer this anonymous feedback form here: https://forms.office.com/e/nd6sJ3Gq0U 
 Any and all commments with be tremendous help to my project, but also Im just proud of this language and want others to see it :)

                              <span>This is a very technical note. A somewhat mathematical, even.
On a meta-level, it&#x27;s interesting to me because category theory is a field for which I have 0 (zero!) formal knowledge. I only know some practical applications from programming patterns. That makes writing a note among the lines of &quot;WTF is a functor&quot; a permanent work in progress:  I can only start with my superficial knowledge and expand on it.
That means I&#x27;ll be keeping one foot in the realm of the known (programming) and one in the unknown (category theory).
While the realm of the known expands with every article I read, I can make amends to this note. This, in turn, means that malleability of these notes pays off very quickly!
Feedback questions:
The title is just &quot;Functor&quot;.    Not sure what to change that to, if at all.

                              <span>OK, I never have completely left but I have been trying other options and let me tell you - it is not better on the other side!
 I tried Helix - too limited for now.
 Neovim - not wanting to do things on my own, I tried pre-built configurations and nothing worked, even after having to upgrade to a PPA to get an up to date version.
 Kate - still too limited but getting there.
 VSCode - ok, this is my fallback for when I need something now and Emacs is not there. It could be my main driver but I don&#x27;t like Microsoft &#x27;s approach to open source and the fact that keybinds are not the same in Linux, Windows and Mac!
 I am using Spacemacs and it mostly works, I just have to work on getting some layout and behaviour the way I like it!
 It looks like I am getting to the point where Emacs will finally become my main (if not only!) editor. Quite a change for someone who has tried many, many times!

                              <span>I&#x27;m on Windows 11. Emacs installed via Msys2. Everything was working fine for months until about 6 weeks ago. Now my emacs appears to hang when waiting for an external process to respond. I can most consistently repro with M-x package-refresh-contents. My emacs then hangs with the &quot;Importing package-keyring.gpg...&quot; message and never responds. Fortunately, C-g gets it to respond again. Here is my backtrace: 
 epg-wait-for-completion(...) epg--import-keys-1(...) epg-import-keys-from-file(...) package-import-keyring(&quot;c:/msys2/mingw64/share/emacs/28.2/etc/package-keyring.gpg&quot;) package-refresh-contents() 
 This is on my work PC and I thought for sure something must have changed in my environment that&#x27;s causing this (even though I haven&#x27;t changed anything in my emacs config). I&#x27;ve used emacs for years but I&#x27;m a novice when it comes to debugging it. After having no luck troubleshooting for hours, I decided to install Msys2 and emacs on my home PC to compare my work PC to a working emacs install. To my surprise, it is broken in the same way on my home PC even after being freshly installed with no custom configuration.
 Anyone have an idea on what the issue could be?

 As explained in the manual, I have installed TDLib with pacman (the package is called telegram-tdlib).
 When starting telega, I get the following error message:
 telega-server-build: TDLib is not installed into &quot;/usr/local&quot;. Set ‘telega-server-libs-prefix’ to the TDLib installion path 
 ​
 Question: I am not sure what I must look for.
 I have listed the dependencies and files installed by the package
 [fred@fredartix /usr/lib]$ yay -Ql telegram-tdlib telegram-tdlib /usr/ telegram-tdlib /usr/include/ telegram-tdlib /usr/include/td/ telegram-tdlib /usr/include/td/telegram/ telegram-tdlib /usr/include/td/telegram/Client.h telegram-tdlib /usr/include/td/telegram/Log.h telegram-tdlib /usr/include…</span>

 I&#x27;ve tried every recipe I can find online, and I seem to be able to download and build the grammar libraries, but my emacs denies the libraries exist.
 I tried
 (add-to-list &#x27;treesit-language-source-alist &#x27;(python &quot;https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-python/&quot;)))
 I then used M-x treesit-install-language-grammar and selected python.
 And then when I run python-ts-mode, I get:
 ⛔ Warning (treesit): Cannot activate tree-sitter, because language grammar for python is unavailable (not-found): (libtree-sitter-python libtree-sitter-python.0 libtree-sitter-python.0.0 libtree-sitter-python.so libtree-sitter-python.so.0 libtree-sitter-python.so.0.0) No such file or directory
 I can see the built library &quot;~/.emacs.d/tree-sitter/libtree-sitter-python.so&quot;, but still Emacs can&#x27;t find it.

 I tried WSL2 and while it is fast, there are some problems:
  
WSL2 cannot not modify Windows NAS drives, even if you mount. A deal breaker for me.
 The Emacs GUI can&#x27;t be repositioned using Windows hotkeys like native windows.
  
I tried the pre-compiled Emacs on Windows, but it is slower than WSL2. Typing latency is not as good. Trying this sample benchmark, with pre-compiled Emacs, it took 6-7 seconds to finish. With my compiled Emacs, it took 2.6 seconds.

 (setq native-comp-speed 3) (native-compile #&#x27;fibonacci) (let ((time (current-time))) (fibonacci 40) (message &quot;%.06f&quot; (float-time (time-since time))))

                              <span>I do not know if it makes sense. But I am not a programmer. I just write academic articles using markdown and latex. I tried different editors and really liked emacs. I just copied a few people&#x27;s setup files for my emacs, and I&#x27;ve already lost track of those pieces. 
 I would like to learn some basics in LISP so that I can not only understand some of those setups but also be able to create some quick modifications of my own. 
 Is this going to be a waste of time? Is there a quick guide for someone who has almost zero knowledge of programming? (A computer scientist told me LISP was actually hard to use nowadays, so I should not spend time on this. I should just keep using others&#x27; setups for my own purpose.)

                              <span>Has anyone figured out how to render HTML emails in notmuch using xwidget?
 Running xwidget-webkit-browse-url on the saved HTML file works, so it should be be possible. The problem with that is it opens in a dedicated buffer.
 Ideally Emacs would render the HTML with xwidget inside the text/html drawer of the notmuch-show-mode buffer.

 I am using emacs-29 (./configure --with-native-compilation --with-json --with-x-toolkit&#x3D;lucid --with-imagemagick --with-x --with-mailutils) on artix.
 I use emacsclient -n -c -a &quot;&quot; to open a new frame.
 why are the separations of my windows so ugly? I get a wide grey divider, when using dirvish, it is even worse (2 separators!!!)
 How can I only get a line to separate these? or anything else prettier (examples with screenshots welcome!!!)

                              <span>I want to use a function to do the following and bind it to a key combo to call it conveniently when outlining in Org mode:
  
If point is on a heading that has a visible subtree, call org-cycle to fold that subtree.
 If point is on a heading that has a folded subtree, call org-cycle to unfold that subtree.
 If point is on a heading that has no children but is not a top-level item, call outline-up-heading to go to its parent heading, then call org-cycle to fold the subtree that contains the item at point.
  
This would provide an all-purpose &#x27;toggle-visiblity-at-point&#x27; command. Maybe outline-hide-subtree / outline-show-subtree / org-show-children would be more efficient in all or some of these cases than org-cycle?
 I could probably cobble something together myself, but having only the most rudimentary grasp of Elisp, it would take me a good deal of browsing forum posts about how to determine heading states / levels plus trial and error so I&#x27;m hoping someone here will bite and help me out.
 Many thanks!

 I have two files, file1 with day-to-day todos, and file2 with recurring annual todos. C-c a n only shows the todos from file1 in date order. The todos from file2 do show up, but as a list underneath the agenda view.
 How can I get the entries in file2 to show up under the correct dates along with the ones in file1?
 Hope that makes sense! Thanks.

 It works setting the same property in a headline property drawer but I&#x27;d prefer to set it at the file level to remove the property drawers and thus not repeat myself. This file only contains my habitual tasks. Thanks in advance

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 so I would like to know why as well as why the message supposedly makes sense.
 Here are two examples:
 hungry &#x3D; \ x -&gt; hungry weird x &#x3D; x x 
 I am going to focus on the &#x60;weird&#x60; function first because the type is a bit nicer.
 My GHC 9.4.2 produces this error:
 • Couldn&#x27;t match expected type ‘t1’ with actual type ‘t1 -&gt; t2’ ‘t1’ is a rigid type variable bound by the inferred type of weird :: (t1 -&gt; t2) -&gt; t2 at hungry.hs:10:1-13 • In the first argument of ‘x’, namely ‘x’ In the expression: x x In an equation for ‘weird’: weird x &#x3D; x x • Relevant bindings include x :: t1 -&gt; t2 (bound at hungry.hs:10:7) weird :: (t1 -&gt; t2) -&gt; t2 (bound at hungry.hs:10:1) | 10 | weird x &#x3D; x x | ^ 
 Older versions used to talk about occurs check failing.

 I find the wording - &#x60;rigid type varia…</span>

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;m trying to setup a haskell.nix project, however I&#x27;m having trouble trying to add an external dependency.
 The project requires the z3 smt solver.
 I&#x27;ve tried adding z3 to the extra-libraries section in the cabal file as described here. And this adds the executable to the development shell correctly.
 However, when running the result of the build (from a shell other than the development shell) this dependency is not available, and I get an error thrown.
 Thanks for any help

                              <span>Hey Friends of Haskell,
 ZuriHac 2023 is getting closer and we&#x27;re excited to announce that we will offer a number of 20 minute lightning talk slots to those participating in-person:
 https://zfoh.ch/zurihac2023/#lightning-talks
 Traditionally we&#x27;ve only done invited talks but several people have expressed strong interest in this so we&#x27;re happy to try it out this year. We welcome submissions for this until the 12th of May.
 We&#x27;re also still looking for sponsors for this year&#x27;s ZuriHac! If you are working at a company that&#x27;s using Haskell, please check if they&#x27;re interested and get in touch with us -- ZuriHac is one of the best places to recruit Haskellers.
 For more information on the event see https://zfoh.ch/zurihac2023/. Hope to see some of you there!

 So I created a function that takes in a list of lists and returns the list with the shortest length.
 For example, 
 short [[1, 2, 3], [1, 2], [1, 2, 3, 4], [1]] &#x3D; Just [1]
 Problem is I need it to work for infinite lists too.
 For example,
 short [[1, 2, 3], [1, 2..], repeat 5, [1, 2, 3, 4], [1]] &#x3D; Just [1]
 How should I go about it?

 I went through the Elm in Action book and want to start building my own front ends but have attempted to go through Will Kurt Get Programming in Haskell and will do so again but getting a bit tired of repeating the exercises so want to learn Servant and write a simple backend of a few api endpoints but a search on O&#x27;Reilly Safari Online comes up empty.

 TL;DR: How does this code work? Specifically, the runRepl function. (And a follow-up question: is this normal, &quot;good&quot; code? Or to put it another way: is this intuitive to experienced Haskell folks?)

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m new to scala and Im learning it now. I bought a &quot;Hands-On Scala Programming&quot; book by Li Haoyi. I realized that he is using his own libs in project described in book. I&#x27;m just wondering if these libraries are actually popular and worth learning. Especialy as a first contact with basic things like managing files, sending requests, connecting with DBs etc.

Announcing ical: A pessimistic iCalendar (RFC 5545) library by Tom Sydney Kerckhove
RFC 5545 is a widely used specification for calendar data exchange on the internet. It defines a data format for representing calendar events, such as appointments, meetings, and reminders.
Drawing trees functionally: Reingold and Tilford, 1981 by William Yaoh
Functional programmers often work with trees; for explanatory or debugging purposes, it is useful to be able to visualize them. I explain one such algorithm for drawing m-ary trees, the Reingold-Tilford algorithm, which runs in O(n) time.

                              <span>In case some haven&#x27;t been watching, I&#x27;ll mention that Simon Winchester&#x27;s new book Knowing What We Know on knowledge to transmission was published by Harper on April 25th in North America. For zettelkasten fans, you&#x27;ll note that it has some familiar references and suggested readings including by our friends Markus Krajewski, Ann Blair, Iaian McGilchrist, Alex Wright, Anthony Grafton, Dennis Duncan, and Mortimer J. Adler to name but a few.
Many are certain to know his award winning 1998 book The Professor and the Madman which was also transformed into the eponymous 2019 film starring Sean Penn. Though he didn&#x27;t use the German word zettelkasten in the book, he tells the story of philologist James Murray&#x27;s late 1800s collaborative 6 million+ slip box collection of words and sentences which when edited into a text is better known today as the Oxford English Dictionary.
If you need some additional motivation to check out his book, I&#x27;ll use the fact that Winchester, as a writer, is one of the most talented non-linear storytellers I&#x27;ve ever come across, something which many who focus on zettelkasten output may have a keen interest in studying.</span>

                              <span>Computing is all about transforming data.
A wide variety of domains, such as multimedia, securities trading or compilers,
allow decomposing the corresponding transformations into a sequence of well-defined steps.
Moreover, these steps can be combined in different ways,
perhaps omitting some or changing the order of others,
producing different data processing pipelines tailored to a particular task at hand.
Consider your favorite compiler: it consists of a lexical and syntactical analyzer, a possible preprocessor,
some optimization passes (which can be turned on or off),
various optional static analysis features, a code generator, and so on.
Yet, some of these steps might depend on each other,
and some warnings might only make sense before certain other optimizations have happened.

                              <span>I recently needed to recreate a wsl and since I did it, it seems my emacs, using wslg does not find any remote binaries like before.
 Using nix and direnv in my repo it provides all require things like cargo or rls. 
 Running emacs -nw works but without it opening the ui in windows, even if I see direnv loaded … emacs does not found anymore rls or even cargo.
 I really do not get what I am missing here …

                              <span>I’m a long time vimmer and having sparsely used spacemacs in the past and later doom emacs, have set out to write my own vanilla config.
 I’m trying to define leader based keybindings similar to doom and spacemacs with SPC as the leader.
 It seems that general.el is the preferred package for this. But I found that evil mode also presents evil-set-leader and allows for configuring prefix based commands. Further we can customize text for which-key prefixes which changes +prefix to +custom_text for instance.
 I’m considering setting up the entire leader based keymap with evil’s existing support. Is there any shortcomings to this? What can general provide me with that I cannot get with evil’s leader support? 
 Appreciate any advice on this.

                              <span>Does anyone know of any ebook reader that allows for adding notes in books which would be usable with org-mode? The way I would image a PERFECT solution would be an open machine with Emacs, where e-books are opened via something like nov.el and notes are added as org-docs with reference to a book position. I don&#x27;t think anything allows for this (fingers crossed for Pine Note!).

                              <span>My workflow uses an e-ink tablet for reading (textbooks) and rough note taking (lectures, exercises). My rough notes sync from my e-ink device to my laptop, where I use Obsidian to transform my e-ink notes into more fleshed out notes (Evergreen notes).
 I like being outside and work/study from different places and one hurdle I run into is I don’t have a way of accessing my nice fleshed out Obsidian notes on my e-ink device. Usually I have to have my laptop/phone next to me and reference my notes from there, which is not ideal. 
 Now, this has me wondering if I can warrant myself switching to emacs and org to have my computer notes (org files) easily accessible on my e-ink device. 
 I have been doing a bit of searching and I guess org-publish and then accessing a website on my e-ink device could work. Perhaps mass exporting all my .org files as pdfs/epubs and then syncing them to my e-ink device. (I don’t know if that method could keep backlinks)
 But as I have never used org and this is just my speculation I came here to ask: Is this feasible? Do any of you have a similar setup? 
 Thanks.

                              <span>I occasionally get this warning while running eshell:
  Warning (comp): tramp-loaddefs.el.gz:745:2478: Warning: reference to free variable ‘tramp-remote-path’ 
 and was wondering how to fix it. According to the docs, in most cases, it is not necessary for tramp-remote-path to be set, and I am actually not using tramp when this error occurs, so I am wondering what&#x27;s going on and perhaps how I can investigate.

                              <span>When writing, I would like to have a tool that would tell me if the word I&#x27;m writing has already been used (and where) in the current paragraph, so I know I have to search for a synonym or an alternative way of expressing the meaning that what I want to convey. I&#x27;m not talking about repeated words just as typos or mistakes (e.g., repeating &quot;the the&quot; or similar). I mean some package that, in a paragraph like:
 &quot;This is important as the peaks are mirror images of one another. Upon further inspection, these images show another interesting features. The most important [position of point]&quot;
 would point me/highlight the fact that the &quot;important&quot; I&#x27;m writing is a repetition within the active paragraph. Knowing this, I could easily think of a synonym and instead of writing &quot;interesting&quot; I would write &quot;relevant&quot;. This could seem like a simple task that the user can perform without aid, but the point is that in long paragraphs, this repetitions are hard to spot without re-reading the whole thing, which usually breaks the flow of writing.
 Does anyone know of a package (or a way) to accomplish such a thing?
 Thanks in advance for all your help.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve recently noticed a trend in my workplace where Scala is losing its footing in favour of alternative languages like Golang. Our latest projects no longer use Scala, and we&#x27;ve even gone so far as to refactor some complex legacy Scala code into more streamlined Golang. 
 As someone who loves Scala, it&#x27;s been a bit disheartening to see this shift in adoption. Has anyone else experienced a similar transition within their organizations? And for those who have, what do you think are the driving factors behind this change?

                              <span>Dupin is a minimal, idiomatic, customizable validation Scala library. https://github.com/yakivy/dupin
 Parser[F[_], E, A, B] - is a parser from type A to type B, represents a function A &#x3D;&gt; F[IorNec[E, B]], especially could be useful for fans of parse don&#x27;t validate style.
 Btw, I remember that several months ago somebody asked about validator type that can accumulate failures and proceed with validation, this is exactly what Parser.liftToTraverseCombiningP method does. I put more or less real complex validation scenario here: https://github.com/yakivy/dupin#complex-example.

                              <span>Email Self Defense guide from FSF and Use plaintext email from sourcehut provide great tips for using email clients in a secure and ethical manner. The former provides examples for the Thunderbird client, and details are missing for the latter. Based on these resources, I would like to use the Gnus client in Emacs to handle email. How can I translate these guides to work with Gnus? I have a working IMAP and SMTP mail configuration, but I&#x27;m unsure about &quot;Wraps text or format&#x3D;flowed&quot; and handling messages correctly when someone sends me HTML mail. Can anyone help?

                              <span>I edit a lot of LaTeX and use xenops to generate LaTeX previews.
 Recently I&#x27;ve been wanting to change themes sometimes, but xenops generates snippets with bg/fg colors based on the currently set theme. I&#x27;d like to be able to change the bg/fg colors dynamically based on the current DOOM theme. 
 I&#x27;ve successfully written a function that changes the XML data to the new bg/fg color of the xml in-place, and hooked it to doom-load-theme-hook. However, xenops still renders a new preview for the exact same text.
 For example, say i have a xenops LaTeX snippet 
 \(S^1\) 
 generated for the theme doom-zenburn.
 I can change the theme, and the XML file for the associated to the above snippet has its colors updated. In fact, if the preview is visible inline, and I change the theme, the preview changes its colors. This is expected behavior.
 However, when I enter the LaTeX snippet and exit it again, xenops regenerates the snippet for the new theme. Is there a way to prevent this? I don&#x27;t want to generate new snippets per theme as this would take up unnecessary disk space and compute resources.
 My gut tells me it&#x27;s not possible. Xenops seems to generate svgs with random names, but I&#x27;m not sure how it decides to choose which svg to show in-buffer. Anyone have any ideas?

                              <span>I&#x27;m 4 months into a new job and have struggled a fair bit, mostly in my own personal time, to set up a developer environment that doesn&#x27;t involve completely dropping my personal values.
 This mostly led me down the path to the simplest Vim on WSL2 install I could manage while trying to use Window&#x27;s sometimes unreliable WSL2 interop. Things don&#x27;t always work easily in this manner, especially when the rest of the team knows how things work one way, and I&#x27;m on a completely different track.
 Well, I&#x27;ve installed my old friend Emacs as a native app on Windows and was gobsmacked by how little I had to change to get things productive.
 Why use a VM when I can just install the Emacs operating system inside of Windows?
 I know proprietary software is a touchy subject with GNU folks. I just wanted to express my gratitude for being able to help feed my family with a shred of software freedom.

                              <span>(info &quot;(emacs) Find Init&quot;) tells me that emacs looks for initialization instructions in ~/.emacs.el, ~/.emacs, and ~/.emacs.d/init.el in that order. Then it goes on to say that the XDG-compatible location is in ~/.config/emacs. This is all well and good, and I want to use the XDG-compatible model, but I still have ~/.emacs.d which appears to contain my elpa, melpa, and org libraries that I&#x27;ve installed. I&#x27;m just getting going with this config, so I haven&#x27;t installed much yet.
 Is there a way to make the packages install somewhere else? I&#x27;d rather have them in $XDG_DATA_HOME, which for me is in ~/.local/share. Or do I just accept that ~/.emacs.d will be there always and use emacs -l $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/emacs/init.el to startup my emacs?

                              <span>I have three (admittedly crude) lines of elisp in my config to be able to switch themes via command line:
 (cond ((member &quot;--light&quot; command-line-args) (setq doom-theme &#x27;nano-light)) (t (setq doom-theme &#x27;nano-dark))) 
 They get the job done and apply dark theme by default and light theme when I launch emacs --light ,but somewhere after applying all my configuration, init stops with Unknown option &#x27;--light&#x27; instead of opening the splash screen. As I said, the config is applied correctly and everything works as expected, but it feels bad.
 How do I resolve this?

 I did a very basic configuration, and projectile is doing something silly with the files but can&#x27;t understand how to stop it, the file will basically not open if I try:
  (use-package projectile :ensure t :diminish projectile-mode :bind ((&quot;C-c p f&quot; . helm-projectile-find-file) (&quot;C-c p p&quot; . helm-projectile-switch-project) (&quot;C-c p s&quot; . projectile-save-project-buffers)) :config (projectile-mode +1) ) (use-package helm :ensure t :defer 2 :bind (&quot;M-x&quot; . helm-M-x) (&quot;C-x C-f&quot; . helm-find-files) (&quot;M-y&quot; . helm-show-kill-ring) (&quot;C-x b&quot; . helm-mini) :config (helm-mode 1) (setq helm-split-window-inside-p t helm-move-to-line-cycle-in-source t) (setq helm-autoresize-max-height 0) (setq helm-autoresize-min-height 20) (helm-autoresize-mode 1) (define-key helm-map (kbd &quot;&quot;) &#x27;helm-execute-persistent-action) ; rebind tab to run persistent action (define-key helm-map (kbd &quot;C-i&quot;) &#x27;helm-execute-persistent-action) ; make TAB work in terminal (define-key helm-map (kbd &quot;C-z&quot;) &#x27;helm-select-action) ; list actions using C-z ) (use-package helm-projectile :ensure t :config (helm-projectile-on)) 
 And when I try opening a file through projectile-find-file I see the ansi color escape codes appearing. Anyone knows how to fix this thing?

                              <span>I was wondering if it was possible to use Emacs basically the same way you&#x27;d use VSCode (vs something more similar to vim), just a regular GUI IDE. If it makes a difference, on windows.
 By possible, I mean a decent comparable experience.

                              <span>So I know that Man-notify-method controls this, but I like to have the option to open it in the same window. By default, I have it to pushy. Currently, I have:  (global-set-key (kbd &quot;H-m s&quot;) &#x27;man)  and I would like to have  (global-set-key (kbd &quot;H-m o&quot;) &#x27;man-other-window)  I am very new to Elisp, but I think it should be something as simple as:  (defun man-other-window () &quot;open a &#x60;man&#x60; in a new window.&quot; (interactive) (let ((Man-notify-method &#x27;friendly)) (man)))  but I get an error to do with wrong number of arguments, but when I pass an argument to the function, it doesn&#x27;t behave the way I like it. How can I get the behavior so that it would behave as:  M-x man-other-window RET relevant-man-page RET  just as M-x man does?

                              <span>The Haskell functors have mostly focused on mapping types and type constructors. Types are usually mapped by functions 
  
(-&gt;) :: Cat Type (for covariant mapping)
 () its opposite category (for contravariant mapping)
 (~&gt;) :: Cat (Type -&gt; Type) &#x3D; Nat (-&gt;) (-&gt;)
  
while type constructors are mapped by natural transformations.
 Functor &#x3D; FunctorOf (-&gt;) (-&gt;) Contravariant &#x3D; FunctorOf () Bifunctor &#x3D; FunctorOf (-&gt;) (-&gt;) (-&gt;) Profunctor &#x3D; FunctorOf () (-&gt;) HFunctor &#x3D; FunctorOf (~&gt;) (~&gt;) Rank2.Functor &#x3D; FunctorOf (~&gt;) (-&gt;) 
 This generalization of Functor abstracts over the source/target arrows, resulting in a mostly categorical account of functors: FunctorOf.
 But what of GADTs, there is no way to define a Functor instance for G even though it is Type-ind…</span>

                              <span>So my question is - why does http4s have already ~3 years of development time for its 1.0 version?
 Also bonus question - why does it have such a poor performance in these benchmarks? I know that those aren&#x27;t everything but the difference is very huge and I would like to know if there is a post or comment somewhere(or anything) from a person that did a deep dive into it and could explain why the performance is what it is.
 Also, can anyone share an experience of using http4s in a prod environment? What are the specs of vm it needs to handle 1000 rps?

                              <span>Hi r/orgmode!
 I&#x27;m seeking some advice on how to effectively use org-roam. I&#x27;m particularly interested in hearing how others utilize org-roam in their workflows.
 I&#x27;ve developed a system where I create index pages for each major subject. These org-roam files are tagged with :index: and usually left empty. 
 For instance, if I were learning Python, I&#x27;d create three index pages: Python, Theory, and Examples, with the last two having backlinks for the first one.
 When I take notes related to a particular subject, I create a new note and insert a backlink to the corresponding index page. This way, when I need to find a specific note, I can simply visit one of the index pages and review its backlinks, instead of trying to remember what name i gave to the specific note.
 While this method has been somewhat effective for me, I&#x27;m wondering if there might be a more efficient or more organized way to approach this. I&#x27;d love to hear about any tips, tricks, or workflows you use in org-roam when learning new topics.
 Thanks

 Hi there! I&#x27;ve been trying to troubleshoot this issue for several hours but I haven&#x27;t got any success.
 My code in my init.el is like this:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 (setq org-directory &quot;/Users/myname/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Org/&quot;)
 (add-to-list &#x27;org-agenda-files &quot;/Users/myname/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Org/tareas.org&quot;) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 However, when starting emacs I get this:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; Warning (initialization): An error occurred while loading ‘/Users/myname/.emacs.d/init.el’:
 Symbol&#x27;s value as variable is void: org-agenda-files &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 I have double checked my path but I&#x27;m still getting that same error every time I start emacs.
 I have this in my org-agenda-files variable description:
 org-agenda-files is a variable defined in ‘org.el’.
 Its value is (&quot;/Users/myname/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Org/tareas.org&quot;) Original value was nil
 I&#x27;m completely able to see my agenda because tareas.org is recognized correctly, but only after I go to my init.el and manually evaluate the function. When I start emacs the agenda is empty. 
 Thanks!

                              <span>I may be missing something stupid. When I put links in Org-mode files they appear normally, i.e. the whole [[/link][caption]] thing is hidden and I just see the caption with an underline, can click on it, etc.
 I also have my Emacs configured (somehow) to color characters overflowing my fill-column something jarring, and I usually use auto-fill-mode and have no problems with that.
 For example if I have fill-column set to 3 and have a line abcde, de will be colored to mark they&#x27;re over the line limit.
 However, it seems that whatever&#x27;s coloring my isn&#x27;t taking into account what Org-mode does to hide links. So if I have a link [[/link][caption]] which has 18 characters in its raw form but only 7 (caption) are getting displayed, those 7 characters count as 18 characters towards the line limit!
 For example if I have fill-column set to 20 and have a line [[/link][caption]] foo, I expected to see no characters marked as over the limit because I&#x27;m seeing just caption foo, but in fact the final oo are marked as over the limit because in that regard it counts as a 22-character line.
 Sorry for the verbose explanation. Does anyone have a solution for this? I could make the color less jarring but this is lowkey driving me crazy.

                              <span>Hello,
 I have started using editorconfig in emacs, without issues, to program in python and c++. First, I used use-package. Now, I am using doom emacs with the :tools editorconfig setting. All works when I open .cpp and .py files. But, when I am editing and org file, and I use org babel to edit a cpp file, the editor config settings are not read when I use ctrl-c ctrl-&#x27; to edit the file. How can I use editorconfig in org babel?
 Thanks in advance

                              <span>I am trying to get back into using Org Agenda, but I am not sure how to set it up to make it easy to edit entries. Right now I basically have a few files that are TODO/DONE/WIP.org so then that way I can minimize my clutter. I feel like any time I try to have just one file it almost immediately gets messy and not worth editing.
 ​
 What are your approaches and stuff you use? I have been using org-hyperscheduler and that has been really nice!
 ​
 Also, when using TODO/DONE they get highlighted. How do I add more words to that list?

However, when I try to change the option in config.el using (setq mac-command-key-is-meta t) nothing seem to happen — both option and command key work as meta. Could someone point what is wrong?

                              <span>I have a peculiar habit where I use the shell from inside of emacs (as opposed to C-x d) to open another file in emacs. Ex., I do M-x shell RET and then:
  $ emacs somefile 
 and this has the unfortunate effect of opening another emacs frame with the file I requested, instead of using the same emacs sessions and adding another buffer or the like. I was wondering how I could configure this to add another buffer with that file in my current emacs session.
 I&#x27;ve been looking into emacsclient and it seems this may do what I want, but I wanted to ask if anyone has any experience with this. My emacs is lightning fast (native-comp), so outside of avoiding duplicate emacs instances, I would have no other use for it (simply a convenience thing).

                              <span>Hello Emacs community!
 I&#x27;ve recently developed my first Emacs package called say-region.el
 , and I would appreciate any feedback or suggestions you may have. This package allows users to send a selected region of text to speech synthesis (&#x27;say&#x27; command(, which reads the text out loud using the default text-to-speech voice. 
 I would be grateful if you could provide any comments, improvements, or suggestions you may have. Please feel free to submit pull requests, report bugs, etc
 say-region.el
 An Emacs package that sends a selected region of text to be read out loud using the default text-to-speech voice. 
 https://github.com/smoge/say-region.el
 Installation
 ​
  
Clone the repository or download the say-region.el
 file.
 Add the following lines to your Emacs configuration (init.el
 or .emacs
 ):
  
​
 (add-to-list &#x27;load-path &quot;/path/to/say-region.el&quot;) (require &#x27;say-region) 
 Replace /path/to/say-region.el
 with the actual path to the say-region.el
 file.
 Usage
 ​
  
Enable say-region-mode
 in a buffer:
  
​
 M-x say-region-mode 
 ​
  
Select a region of text in the buffer.
 Press C-c s
 to send the selected region to the say
 command, which reads the text aloud.
 To stop the speech, press C-c k
 to kill any running say processes.
  
Limitations
 This package is designed for macOS and uses the macOS-specific say
 command. For the moment, it is not compatible with other operating systems without modifications.

                              <span>Thanks for reading folks!
 I&#x27;ve just updated to an experimental Emacs build (30.0.50) and prayed on first run .. but my existing massive .emacs came up pretty well, only a couple of gnits. One of the warnings was not to use docker-tramp anymore due to the built in tramp-container.el
 At a quick glance of the .el and errors it produces, I&#x27;m getting the feeling that was designed around local containers (Docker running locally with the Emacs), but not for a remote container
 For example, I use Tramp via multi-hop, so that I can ssh to a server where the containers are running, and run the docker ps and open a shell within the images _over there_
 So a bookmark would look something like:
 /ssh:[foo@someserver.com](mailto:foo@someserver.com)|docker:bar@container:/path/within/docker
 tramp-container.el looks like the same syntax (/docker) as docker-tramp, but I wonder if it only works locally?
 I&#x27;ll have to try docker-tramp again and see if remote still works there, or am I out of luck on this astoundingly handy behaviour. (or perhaps a local docker daemon can reach out to remote docker daemons, or I can run some ssh tunnels to pretend local is remote, or something..)
 edit: Looks like I had a defcustom override for the docker tramp so it was using &#x27;sudo docker&#x27; on the target very old system; so I added a override tramp-docker-program for the new module, but still no dice. (Currently experimenting with things like /ssh:foo@someserver.com|sudo::|docker:bar@containername:/path but still no dice)

 I have friends I would love to chat with, either using Android or IOS phones, I am trying to push them to use other chat / IM protocols than iMessage or Whatsapp, and I would like to chat from my emacs (last resort, from my terminal)
 What chat/IM protocols are the better supported in emacs (28 - 29) that offer good support on mobile apps?
 - Signal Messaging (send-only from emacs so not optimal)
 - any other??
 Thanks for your feedback

                              <span>I&#x27;m super tired and frustrated from tinkering and &quot;fixing&quot; my config. basically, I want to make it much harder for me to do that. I was thinking along the lines of encrypting the files in a way that will require a long password I&#x27;ll have to copy from another file. Any suggestions?

                              <span>And by run I mean that:
  
you&#x27;re using systemd --user and the provided emacs.service
 it dies after about a minute or so after starting (and then restarts because SystemD)
  
​
 sudo dnf install systemd-devel 
 ...before you build (and librsvg2-devel if you want treemacs to work) and all will be well.
 if you don&#x27;t, then because the service is set up as polling, SystemD will start up the daemon and wait for it to say &quot;I&#x27;ve started&quot;. Emacs, not having been built with SystemD support will never send that message, and so SystemD then kills it after a time-out (and then restarts it, which is only polite).
 If you don&#x27;t want to build SystemD support into Emacs, but still want to run it as a daemon via SystemD (for whatever reason, I&#x27;m not judging) change the type flag in the emacs.service file from notify to simple.

                              <span>In SRC blocks, if I write a piece of code then decide to insert a line break in the middle of it, every line of code gets indented. The desired behavior would be that the code after the broken line gets placed at the correct indentation level, while each other line of code remains in the same position. Is there a fix to this issue?

I decided to take the dive and start learning haskell, but using the repl with ghci keeps putting the output on the same line as the input. I can&#x27;t seem to find any information regarding this anywhere, so I&#x27;m hoping the official subreddit might be able to help me out.

 splitImpl :: Eq a &#x3D;&gt; a -&gt; [a] -&gt; [a] -&gt; [[a]] splitImpl _ [] splat &#x3D; [splat] splitImpl sep (x:xs) splat | x &#x3D;&#x3D; sep &#x3D; splat:(splitImpl sep xs []) | otherwise &#x3D; splitImpl sep xs (splat ++ [x]) split :: Eq a &#x3D;&gt; a -&gt; [a] -&gt; [[a]] split _ [] &#x3D; [[]] split sep xs &#x3D; splitImpl sep xs [] 
 How do you like it? Can it be made more efficient or concise? Can you somehow get rid of the splitImpl function and do everything in one function (without showing it into a lambda)?
 I become from imperative languages.

 ​
 It&#x27;s not such an interesting video; the immediate impression I get from the video is that the firm had a spaghetti Python codebase, were looking for something to migrate into, and they coincidentally had a moderately-skilled Haskeller on the team who was able to Just Do It and hack together something that worked, whereas the Rust attempt got stuck at the borrow checker and OCaml didn&#x27;t have the libraries available for the task.
 ​
 On the negative side, they were unable to deal with Haskell&#x27;s laziness semantics and had to enable strict for everything. Same thing happened with NoRedInk; they just wanted Elm for backend, Elm&#x27;s BDFL locked down the compiler and kicked all the backenders into Haskell, and NRI ended up putting Strict into their Cabal / Stack files.
 ​
 You can also tell that there&#x27;s some level of tension; the Haskell engineer is relatively bubbly, but her boss seems offput and somewhat horrified that they went with Haskell and that&#x27;s messed up their power dynamics.

                              <span>Hi!
 I teach Haskell at the university. Every year I have a problem setting up everything on school computers. Especially for testing during midterms and finals.
 So I made a small repo with scaffolding for GitHub Classroom. It includes devcontainer. So it can be used in browser with complete Haskell environment (in codespace). No need for any local installation. Of course it can be used locally with VS Code. Also autograding GitHub action is set up. It uses HSpec for testing.
 If this is useful to anyone you can find repo here:
 https://github.com/Idokorro/haskell-exam-autograding
 It&#x27;s nothing much. It&#x27;s an empty project. But it took me a while to set everything up. Maybe it can save someone some time.

                              <span>Hi newbie question. I am coming from OOP background and have some difficulty understanding how Haskell treats what in other languages I would call &quot;functions overload (by return value)&quot; 
 The following code does not compile 
 foo 5 &#x3D; &quot;5&quot;
 foo 5 &#x3D; 5 
 Compiler tells that it &quot;cannot deduce ...&quot;. OK, get it. The compiler infers the function type from first foo definition and cannot match second definition with this type. However consider this. I can define infinite instances of say type Applicative Functor a for different types a, with multiple function definitions of &quot;pure&quot; that takes operator and returns something of type Application Functor a. Eventually it is the same multiple functions definitions which only differ by return value. 
 Why then it is allowed?

                              <span>Hey there, I am a student just recently starting out with functional programming through Haskell. I have worked already with it on my university&#x27;s computers but want to install it on my own to practice more. I hope this question isn&#x27;t too obvious and makes sense, but I saw the command needed to install said it must be done by a non-root/non-admin user. I use the main user on my own computer so I have admin permissions and would prefer to just install it there for practicality. So my questions mainly are, am I understanding the requirement right? Will I have to switch users to install it? What would happen if I just do it on my regular main user session? Would appreciate it if anyone can help. Thank you!
 For reference, I work on a Macbook with Ventura

                              <span>I&#x27;m a Typescript programmer by day, but I am learning Haskell by night, I have just finished reading Learn you a Haskell and I&#x27;ve built a simple blog using Scotty and Blaze, and I also worked a little with Aeson. That&#x27;s all my experience with Haskell. And having experience working with Typescript, which has a lot of really cool typing features, I&#x27;m wondering if one can replicate them in Haskell. Specifically, my question is about type mappings and conditional types. In Typescript, one can define an interface (basically, a record type):
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;ts interface Person { name: string; age: number; married: boolean; }
 interface Profile extends Person { friends: Array; job: { title: string; salary: number; onVacation: boolean; }; } &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 And then it&#x27;s possible to create a new type out of this one by recursively replacing all numbers and boolean with strings:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;ts // This type gets a type argument T and recursively replaces all its boolean and number fields with strings type AllStrings &#x3D; { [Key in keyof T]: T[Key] extends number ? string : T[Key] extends boolean ? string : AllStrings; };
 function parseBadJSON(badJSON: AllStrings): Profile { // mapping logic } &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Moreover, you can see record type inheritance with extends keyword.
 I had a task at my job where I needed to parse a JSON that stores all values as strings, and I needed to map it to a JSON with numbers and booleans, where they were supposed to be, so that&#x27;s how I achieved the correct typings for my mapping function (parseBadJSON). How would you do that in Haskell?

                              <span>I&#x27;m familiar with flymake and similar packages which invoke the compiler on your code in background to highlight errors, etc
 Is there anyway easy to set up a system to incrementally compile+RUN your code and display your program&#x27;s output in an updated emacs window as you are editing it? Basically the equivalent of some of the web compiler explorers except using your local system+compiler+editor instead of a web page?

                              <span>so I&#x27;m trying to create a function that uses emacs-requests to access and API. the function looks like this:
 (defun call-api-function () (json-parse-string (request-response-data (request &quot;&quot; :type &quot;GET&quot; :sync t ))) ) 
 then I use another function to to parse the output from the call-api-function
 (defun parse-output-function (callback) (let* ((content (call-api-function )) (output (gethash &quot;output&quot; content)) (finish (gethash &quot;finish&quot; content))) (when (&#x3D; finish 1) (cancel-timer my-timer) (apply callback (list output)) )) ) 
 then a third interactive function to run the parse-output-function
 (defun query-api () (interactive ) (setq my-last-point (point ) my-timer (run-at-time 0 1 &#x27;parse-output-function &#x27;callback))) (defun callback (output) (save-excursion (goto-char my-last-point) (insert output ) ) ) 
 when I move the cursor to anywhere in the buffer and start typing the function parse-output-function suddenly stops printing anything which means it has stopped working, but its entry in the list-timers is still there.
 I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m doing wrong here but I guess it is just a basic pooling where I keep requesting content from the API until the finish flag is set, then I cancel the timer, but this all suddenly stops when I go somewhere else in the buffer and start typing anything.
 Thanks in advance.

All I&#x27;ve done is uninstall and reinstall my emacs via homebrew (was trying to get rid of invalid image type: svg unsuccessfully). Here is my init.el:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; ;; the next two lines make tabs into 4 spaces
 (setq-default indent-tabs-mode nil) (setq-default tab-width 4)
 ;; the next lines are intended to make &#x27;man-mode&#x27; easier to use
 (global-set-key (kbd &quot;M-o&quot;) &#x27;man)
 (defun shell-other-window () &quot;Open a &#x60;shell&#x27; in a new window.&quot; (interactive) (let ((buf (shell))) (switch-to-buffer (other-buffer buf)) (switch-to-buffer-other-window buf)))
 (global-set-key (kbd &quot;M-p&quot;) &#x27;shell-other-window) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Specifically, when I type M-o RET read(2), I would like it to open in a new window to the right, not below. I have my Man-notify-method set as friendly.

Either fix this, or re-configure with the option &#x27;--without-ns&#x27;. 
 I was wondering for advice on how to fix this. I began this journey because my brew install --cask emacs was giving me a invalid image type: svg error, and now, I am trying to obtain the best version of emacs I can for MacOS Ventura 13.3.1. Any information or advice is appreciated. Additional performance and good options to --configure are also appreciated.
 I do have the Appkit.h on my machine. I found it in Finder.

 ChatGPT provided me a few organization maintained configs (below), but I haven&#x27;t been able to find any of them so far. Could it be that these are not publicly available (anymore)? 
  
Here are a few examples of organizations that maintain Emacs configurations for their employees: 1. Google: Google has a large and active community of Emacs users who maintain a shared Emacs configuration called &quot;emacs-config.&quot; This configuration includes a variety of packages and tools that are optimized for Google&#x27;s specific needs, including integration with the company&#x27;s internal systems and tools. 2.

                              <span>Just switched to elpaca and was pleasantly surprised how fast it was to spin up a new installation (minutes down to seconds). But I&#x27;m surprised to see how much faster startup time is. I had spent a lot of time tuning my config with use-package, and was pretty pleased with a seven second startup. I use emacsclient, so this only really mattered when tuning the config and restarting - but still acceptable.
 But with elpaca, my startup time is just over a second! (measured via time emacs --eval &quot;(save-buffers-kill-terminal)&quot; It&#x27;s possible that some of this is due to no longer loading things that have been added into Emacs over the time that my configuration has grown (when was org-mode made native??) - and a side benefit of elpaca is that it complained about this and made me fix it.
 But does multi-threading improve both installation time AND start-up time?

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I am currently using nov.el to read some e-books in Emacs and I am having trouble justifying the text. I have tried using the justify-kp package but the code provided on https://depp.brause.cc/nov.el/ doesn&#x27;t seem to work for me.
 I was wondering if anyone could help me out with this issue or provide me with some working code for justifying text in nov.el using justify-kp. Any help would be greatly appreciated!
 Thank you in advance.

                              <span>Greetings!
 Have been working on a side project to test out various FP libraries and how they could interop with each other: https://bitbucket.org/mucaho/ceffbanx
 Hope this provides some inspiration in case you ever need to interface between various FP-related libraries yourself, or at least highlights some lesser-known tools you could leverage in your future project.
 Keep in mind, this was created for educational purposes solely, and there are certainly better ways to go about such interop.
 Libraries used:
 * cats * cats-effect * cats-mtl * eff * scala effekt * izumi bio * fs2 * tofu
 Let me know what you think, any feedback would be much appreciated

                              <span>I am learning cats effect 3 through this doc: Async | cats effect docs and this API doc: Async | cats effect api docs, but I can&#x27;t find enough examples to explain the usage and the worth of async and async_ functions.
 The only example is function fromFuture, it turns IO[Future[A]] to IO[A] but throws Throwable if Future failed, giving no way to handle error. So why not just using IO or Defered instead of fromFuture?
 Can you give me some examples or explanations about this? Any viewpoint will be appreciated.
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 I write a demo code to describe how async be used, but it doesn&#x27;t work.
  @Test def testAsync: Unit &#x3D; val completableFuture &#x3D; CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() &#x3D;&gt; { Thread.sleep(2000) 5 }) val secondIO: IO[Int] &#x3D; Async[IO].async(cb &#x3D;&gt; Sync[IO].delay { // action: call this callback // Invoke the callback with the result of the completable future val stage &#x3D; completableFuture.handle { case (a, null) &#x3D;&gt; cb(Right(a)) case (_, e) &#x3D;&gt; cb(Left(e)) } // val: a finalizer // Cancel the completable future if the fiber is canceled Some(Sync[IO].delay { println(&quot;cancel on Async&quot;) stage.cancel(false) }.void) } ) val attempt: IO[Either[Throwable, Int]] &#x3D; secondIO.onCancel(IO.println(&quot;cancel on MonadCancel 1&quot;)).attempt val trace: IO[Unit] &#x3D; attempt.onCancel(IO.println(&quot;cancel on MonadCancel 2&quot;)).flatMap(value &#x3D;&gt; IO.println(value)) val task &#x3D; for { fiber &lt;- trace.start _ &lt;- fiber.cancel outcome &lt;- fiber.join _ &lt;- IO.println(outcome) } yield () task.unsafeRunSync() // throw an AssertError Assert.assertTrue(completableFuture.isCancelled) () 
 The finalizer doesn&#x27;t work, why?

                              <span>I have made several notes on papers in my Org-roam directory which I can access with C-c n f and they contain the :ROAM_REFS: tags in the :PROPERTIES: heading. When I run citar-open-notes, it displays all the references in my .bib files but is not showing me all the notes for those references in my org-roam directory even though they exist. Strangely enough, it only detects two notes in the org-roam directory that correspond to two references in my bib files.
 How can I get citar to detect my org-roam notes for all the references in my bib files? Currently, if I execute citar-open-notes it asks to create a new note for that reference, even though the note already exists.
 EDIT: So it seems I need to enable citar-org-roam-mode everytime I open emacs. How do I make this the default behaviour…</span>

                              <span>I just added the following line to my init.el:
  (global-set-key (kbd &quot;M-o&quot;) &#x27;man) 
 but it is not enough. Before, if I wanted to perform the shell command equivalent to man 2 read I would do M-x man RET 2 read. Emacs doesn&#x27;t like the numbers and spaces, and takes multiple seconds to load it up, whereas M-x man RET read is instantaneous, but not what I want. 
 What is the easy way to grab a specific numbered man page?
 Something where I can see all the reads would be ideal, so that I could do something like M-n within man-mode to browse through my options, or even something that can see whether I&#x27;m in a shell buffer, or in C mode and grab the relevant man page.

                              <span>Last weekend I rewrote some hacky elisp that’s been in my config for over a decade into a much less hacky package:
 https://github.com/jimeh/yank-indent
 It’s the first package I’ve written in years, so I’m more than happy to hear any feedback and/or criticism, as I’m fairly out of the loop :)
 My goal was for the package to be something you install and enable once and never have to think about again, as it enables itself in relevant buffers only, and ignores buffers (YAML, Python, Makefile) where it would cause issues.
 If anyone is curious of the hacky solution I used to have in my config, here is the comment where I initially replaced it with an earlier version of yank-indent.

                              <span>How do I dynamically hide or show certain infixes in transient, based on the current argument values of other transients?
 In the example below if the user selects an ice cream I want to show the ice cream options and hide the pie options. If the user selects a pie I want to clear the ice cream selection, show the pie options and hide the ice cream options.
 (transient-define-prefix restaurant-menu () [&quot;Main Course&quot; (&quot;m&quot; &quot;main course&quot; &quot;main-course&#x3D;&quot; :choices (&quot;hamburger&quot; &quot;cheeseburger&quot; &quot;chicken sandwich&quot;))] [&quot;Dessert&quot; (&quot;i&quot; &quot;ice cream&quot; &quot;ice-cream&#x3D;&quot; :choices (&quot;chocolate&quot; &quot;vanilla&quot; &quot;strawberry&quot;)) (&quot;p&quot; &quot;pie&quot; &quot;pie&#x3D;&quot; :choices (&quot;apple&quot; &quot;cherry&quot; &quot;pumpkin&quot;))] [&quot;Ice Cream Options&quot; (&quot;c&quot; &quot;chocolate sauce&quot; &quot;chocolate-sauce&quot;) (&quot;s&quot; &quot;sprinkles&quot; &quot;sprinkles&quot;) (&quot;w&quot; &quot;whipped cream&quot; &quot;whipped-cream&quot;)] [&quot;Pie Options&quot; (&quot;r&quot; &quot;crumb topping&quot; &quot;crumb-topping&quot;) (&quot;w&quot; &quot;whipped cream&quot; &quot;whipped-cream&quot;)] [&quot;Order&quot; (&quot;o&quot; &quot;order to dine in&quot; order-food-dine-in) (&quot;g&quot; &quot;order to go&quot; order-food-to-go)]) 
 I tried :if predicates, but it seems they only evaluate upon initial prefix setup, not when values change.
 I also experimented with the Setting up another transient manually in the Transient Showcase, using transient-setup to dynamically replace the current prefix with a new similar one, but with ice cream or pie options. It looks like the same transient with the dessert options dynamically changing. The problem there is that it nests the child transient, so you have to type C-g twice to exit. It&#x27;s also a little inelegant as I copy and paste most of the transient definition into the two variations. It seemed like the wrong tool for this job.
 Is there a way to dynamically hide and show infixes in transient based on the current argument values of other infixes? Or is there a more appropriate UX pattern to use for this scenario with transient?
 Thanks!

                              <span>A literate org mode document that tangles, using noweb an org file into a theme file is a nice way of organizing themes by the files and sections they customize instead of by the sections needed by the file. See: https://gitlab.com/stefan.koch.micro/dotfiles/-/blob/master/emacs/stefan-theme-tangle.org
 Details:
 I spent the weekend setting up my own color theme. What I did not like about how this is done is that the color theme file is broken into sections by the need of the functions to define it. What I wanted to do was to setup the theme organized by the mode or functionality. Since others sharing has helped me in the past, I thought I would share this with the community. (See: The Proximity Principle at https://kula.blog/posts/proximity_principle/)
 I had been using the following techniques anyway, so I was most of the way there:
  
Used GNU Stow to manage my dotfiles (Brandon Invergo&#x27; Using GNU Stow to manage your dotfiles: https://brandon.invergo.net/news/2012-05-26-using-gnu-stow-to-manage-your-dotfiles.html
 Used literate config file using org-babel. This lets you write an org file with emacs lisp source code blocks that are saved to an .el file when it is tangled.) See Literate Programming here: https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/intro.html#literate-programming
  
But, this still made me sequence the code in the sections that the theme file required. I did not want that. So noweb came to the rescue. Using noweb, you can have a source block that will include references to source blocks defined in other areas of the org file. This allowed me to organize the file the way I wanted to. The top of the file is the skeleton for the theme file with the sections defined, and the sections below each add to the theme section as they need.
 In case you missed it above, see https://gitlab.com/stefan.koch.micro/dotfiles/-/blob/master/emacs/stefan-theme-tangle.org for the full details.

                              <span>I&#x27;m using Emacs 28.2 on GNU Linux Arch with centaur-tabs.
 I would like to simply be able to save opened tabs (buffers) into lists, so I could reopen them easily as one does in Chromium or Firefox with Tab Manager Plus.
 There seem to be many packages that manage sessions (bookmarks, bookmarks+, desktop, desktop+, burly, persp-mode, etc.).
 ​
 What would be the simplest implementation of the following functionalities:
 ​
 - Saving opened buffers into a list with a given name
 - Opening buffers from a list by selecting the name of this list
 - Deleting a list of buffers by selecting its name (not deleting the files, just the list)

                              <span>Been struggling with this for a while so I caved and just run my code from shell rather than the Python buffer.
 What my current process is:
  
Open Shell buffer
 Navigate to the folder my .py file is in
 python3 -m venv myenv
 source myenv/bin/activate
 Return to Python buffer
 m-x pyvenv-activate
  
Step 6 above will only work the first time I set it all up, after that it doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything! Only way to get it working again is to delete the virtual environment and set it up again, I don&#x27;t want to do this every time I re-open my program. So as I said, I&#x27;ve been just been going to shell buffer and doing source myenv/bin/activate every time and then just running my code from there rather than the Python buffer.
 Any advice how I am supposed to do this?

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I&#x27;m having an issue with my Haskell code and I was hoping someone could help me out. I have two methods, a and b, both of which use the space function that accepts zero or more spaces. The a method works correctly by skipping over any spaces and then parsing the input &quot; a&quot;. However, when I execute the b method with the input &quot; a&quot;, it gets stuck in an endless loop.
 I suspect the issue has to do with the use of the &quot;many&quot; function in &quot;space&quot;, which is causing the endless loop when b is executed. However, I&#x27;m not quite sure why this is happening.
 If anyone could shed some light on this issue and explain why the b method is causing an endless loop, I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you in advance!

                              <span>My main programming language in undergrad was Haskell (long story, I was single-handedly taught the majority of my computer science courses from an elderly Canadian professor in the UK who loves Haskell/functional programming and is squarely in academia). However, whenever I‘ve told people that I know Haskell they’d either: a) laugh and ask why that was my main programming knowledge or b) joke I should work in a “Haskell basement shop” (?). I’ve never personally applied my Haskell knowledge after I graduated college or thought to.
 So this may seem like a dumb question, but I’m genuinely curious, what do all of you here use Haskell for in real life, not including for school/academics?

 Hello Haskell community, I&#x27;m making a desktop program in Haskell (mainly for fun and type safety) as a frontend for another GPL licensed program. However I&#x27;m not very good when it comes to licensing.
 GHC and almost all Haskell libraries use BSD style licenses. I do not know if I can use these BSD libraries on my program that is distributed under GPL. I would like to distribute my program under GPL due to it&#x27;s copyleft nature. Is it legally possible?
 Can someone please help me clarify?

                              <span>Hello, it is a bit (to say the least) frustrating. I have two libraries: one is using UTCTime from Data.Time, another TimeSpec from System.Clock. I&#x27;ve searched through Hackage/Hoogle and could not find any easy way to convert between them. The only way I can come up with is to base calculations on current time which is both inefficient and convoluted.
 Does anyone have any ideas?
 EDIT: some context.
 I am trying to cache JWT token validation results using https://hackage.haskell.org/package/cache. Cache expiry has to be specified using TimeSpec. JWT tokens are parsed and validated using JOSE which in turn provides token expiry using UTCTime.
 EDIT2: rant. I am new to Haskell but it is sometimes a frustrating experience (although I am positively surprised in general: Nix + Haskell Flake + HLS + VSCode is a pretty nice interactive dev environement) - compositionality is one of the main advertised advantage of the language. In practice it is very often difficult to combine different libraries as they are based on some incompatible concrete types (in this case cache could have abstracted away the actual time representation as it is not really important to its operation)

I&#x27;m trying to get my final list of outputs to be Doubles. My simple function here calculates multiplying an investment and removing some % profit, outputting a list of net profit as repeated each of n times:
 mtp x y z &#x3D; [ ( investment * ((flip*percent)^n)) | n  Double -&gt; Double -&gt; [Double] 
 but still giving me those long decimals
 Help would be much appreciated, thanks :)

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to create a transient with transient-define-prefix and I&#x27;m stumbling in a couple of difficulties.
 The first one is the one mentioned in the title. I&#x27;d like to make sure some cleanup code is executed when leaving the transient, however that may happen, with transient-do-quit or with C-g, whatever. But I can&#x27;t seem to find a way to do that. I even tried to create a suffix overriding C-g but couldn&#x27;t get that to work. I also tried (desperate measures...) to advise the transient and wrapped it in unwind-protect itself, without success. So, is there a way to ensure some code is executed after the transient? 
 The second is that I&#x27;d like to let bind a variable while the transient is active. Is there a way to do that?

                              <span>Hi yall, in Magit, when merging from branch B to branch A, it will default the merge commit message to:
  
Merge branch &#x27;B&#x27; into A
  
When I perform a squash merge, I&#x27;m not really a fan of the default message (sorry, I don&#x27;t have it on hand). I keep the commit log that it includes, but I usually give it a commit message something like:
  
Squash merged branch &#x27;B&#x27; into A
  
I was wondering if any of yall knew how to change the defaults. I&#x27;m not sure if this is a Magit-related configuration, or if it&#x27;s a Git configuration.
 Any and all help would be appreciated!

 M-x rg RET Regexp search for (default -*-): SEARCH_PATTERN -g !*.log 
 But I get the results as
 rg finished with no matches found at Fri Apr 21 10:23:12 
 I am probably not passing the correct args to exclude certain file types or dirs?
 Can someone point me to how to do it the correct way?

 Are there attempts, plans or something for implementing smooth scrolling over images in emacs?
 Or has this already been solved in 29?

                              <span>Hi,
 I use EWW as a browser in emacs but sometimes I need a browser that is more GUI oriented. I stumbled on two such browsers that can be used in a terminal: Carbonyl and Browsh
 My knowledge of elisp is still very limited and I was wondering if anybody had succes using such a browser inside emacs. Is this possible and how can this be achieved?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hi fellas, I am playing around with cape and corfu. Then I notice it doesn&#x27;t work well with slime. 
 I found cape has an easy way to connect it with the company backend. Just use the cape-company-to-capf. And I found there is a company backend slime-company already there. I think maybe I can connect it with cape. 
 First, I tried:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;lisp (use-package slime :config (straight-use-package &#x27;slime-company) (setq slime-contribs &#x27;(slime-fancy slime-repl slime-scratch slime-trace-dialog slime-cl-indent slime-company))
 (add-to-list &#x27;completion-at-point-functions (cape-company-to-capf #&#x27;company-slime)) ) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 it works &quot;well&quot; except every time cape appear with the company mini buffer at the same time when I am trying to do complete. 
 Then I find the define-slime-contrib slime-company actually jus…</span>

                              <span>Hi everyone, I use emacs with eglot+clangd to do C++ with projectile and ivy/counsel/swiper combo.
 I had a problem: every file I open has a delay of up to 5 seconds before I even saw it. This is definitely an issue with eglot+clangd because when I disable it completely everything works just fine. Then I set eglot-sync-connect to 0 and it helped with opening the first file of a project.
 How can I speed up opening other files in a project? This is my profiler report for opening a file with projectile + swiper. The delay before I can interact with emacs was about 3-4 seconds.
 ​
 P.S. lsp-mode + clangd has the same issue.

 With nerd-icons.el, you only need to install one nerd font (e.g. from https://www.nerdfonts.com) instead of installing a bunch of fonts that just do one thing (display icons).
 Nerd-icons.el also provides unified experience in TTY and GUI.
 Nerd-icons currently supports dired, minibuffer-completion, treemacs, doom-modeline, and more on the road...
 As a heavy user on both mode, this is a killer feature to me.

                              <span>Without polluting the Emacs mail lists, I thought that this discussion is better suited for the Emacs subreddit.
 Do you know what are the workflows of the key contributors of Emacs? I am talking about key role people like Eli Zaretskii and Po Lu.
 I know that Richard Stallman has expressed it here:
 https://stallman.org/stallman-computing.html
 But, I did not find much about other key contributors.
 I am specifically interested in their approach at using Emacs and I am asking because that might teach me something new or perhaps help me re-evaluate how I use Emacs.
 Do they use the default Emacs keybindings?
 What packages do they rely on?
 For which tasks do they use Emacs?
 What other software do they use and why is Emacs not suitable for covering those needs?

This is different from the usual behavior where, if a tree doesn’t contain a match, the entire tree is collapsed and the level 1 heading is still visible.
 This would be useful because some of my documents have a LOT of headlines, and I currently have to scroll a lot to see the matches of org-sparse-tree. Is there a package that does this? If not, any rough idea of how to hack org to do this?
 Thanks for any help!

                              <span>I bought this book, and love it. Super clear and a great learning resource for ZIO. Of course, as everyone knows (and is clearly stated on the website) it’s a work in progress. They did say updates are weekly but I haven’t seen any in over a month. How are they distributed? If I bought the book will I get an email? I’m sure the authors are busy guys but I hope they can go rent a cabin for a week or two and knock out the rest.

                              <span>I assume you’ve heard of property-based testing. Has it ever seemed annoying, impractical, or unclear? 
 Give it another chance. I promise to keep it practical and not talk demonstrate overused examples like reverse(reverse(list)) shouldBe list.

                              <span>Is there any quick way to make the HTML export use a more &quot;outline-ish&quot; rather than &quot;numbered-section-ish&quot; style?
 Ideally, I&#x27;d like something like the Emacs UI; hierarchical bullets, which are collapsed by default and that you can toggle on and off. &quot;Expand all&quot; and &quot;collapse all&quot; would be nice to have too.
 Another nice bonus is if I could this just by importing some JS in the generated HTML header, without requiring any extra package.

  $ emacs -f org-agenda 
 opens emacs to the org-agenda dispatcher where I have to either type a, n, or one of the other options. I then need to type n to get the view I want, but how can I pass it directly so it opens my agenda view without the extra keystroke?
 The command
  $ emacs -f org-agenda-week-view 
 doesn&#x27;t work (definition is void), I guess because org-agenda isn&#x27;t started yet.

                              <span>Hi there! 
 I recently bought a course in udemy for org mode, I think it’s the only one there in that platform. Considering I’ll be using beorg I think I have a long way to go and learn. 
 I won’t ask for resources as there are plenty. However, I’ll ask for some successful cases of people that aren’t in the CS field or are developers. This because I just want to organize my life in plain text and use some of the other perks org provides. 
 So, how long did it took you? How do you use org mode? 
 Thanks!

                              <span>Dear all,
 I&#x27;m really excited to announce the release of Dunai 0.11.0 and Bearriver 0.14.2!
 Dunai is a reactive programming library structured around a notion of Monadic Stream Functions. Dunai can be used to implement other reactive and FRP frameworks on top, including Classic FRP and Arrowized FRP variants.
 Dunai comes with:
  
bearriver: API-compatible implementation of Yampa. (The Bear River is a tributary to the Yampa river.)
 
dunai-test: QuickCheck-based temporal testing library that can be connected with the testing system haskell-titan.
 
 See https://github.com/ivanperez-keera/dunai#features for details on Dunai&#x27;s features.
 This release has addressed mainly styling issues. All library code now conforms to the main rules of the style guide we follow (which is publicly documente…</span>

 Official Repo Official Documentation
 EDIT: I forgot to mention that the docs site is broken on mobile for now. Please view on Desktop if possible.
 TL;DR - Okapi, a web framework that I started working on last year, now uses an Applicative instead of a Monad. This has made the framework a lot more consistent and easier to understand. It also makes it possible to automatically generate OpenAPI specifications from your endpoint definitions. It should be possible to generate clients as well, but I haven&#x27;t worked on this yet.

                              <span>Hello!
 I&#x27;m currently taking a Functional Programming course, and we are using Haskell. I had a really hard time setting everything up, but I think I finally have something that is somewhat working. I&#x27;m using a M1 Mac so I decided to install ghcup using brew. I then installed everything else haskell related using ghcup (stack, cabal, ghc, and hls). When I then started working on my assignment the code had some imports like Random and HUnit. So in order to get that to work I tried to install those using Cabal. At this point I noticed that I also needed llvm so I installed llvm@13 using brew and added the path to $PATH. I then did cabal install --lib random and it worked! However, I have found out that this is probably no the preferred way of using cabal and I wanted to switch to a stack project which leads me to my question.
 Is there a good way to remove this libraries that I installed? I have found that the files are installed in the .cabal/store/ghc-8.10.7. In this folder I have HUnt-1.6.2.0-18526221 and rndm-1.2.1.1-c70f7c08. Can I just remove those files? Or is there a better way to do it? I basically do not want random and HUnit to be installed for every Haskell projekt I&#x27;m working on moving forward. Some noteworthy things might be that when I do cabal list --installed they don&#x27;t show, but I can compile the code without any issues.
 I hope I was able to explain my issue and appreciate any help I can get. If there are any issues with the way I installed llvm or haskell stuff that would also be extremely appreciated. It feels like I have spent way to much time on just setting stuff up and would need to start doing some actual programing...

                              <span>I&#x27;m pretty much a Haskell fanboy, but I&#x27;d like to ask this of production users: why Haskell instead of Rust, why Haskell instead of Python?
 ​
 These two languages come up because they&#x27;re enormously popular languages with large ecosystems that recapitulate many of the benefits of Haskell, and for which hiring is relatively easy.
 ​
 Rust, for instance, captures much of Haskell&#x27;s correctness, missing only HKTs, although the development of Generic Associated Types promises to duplicate much of the capability of Haskell higher-kinded types.
 ​
 What&#x27;s more, Rust has stable memory use and performance characteristics, and while the black art of pushing Haskell to C speeds hasn&#x27;t wholly died, Rust in general outperforms Haskell both in time and space complexity.

                              <span>I&#x27;m beginning the process of writing a JIT compiler for a custom DSL that will be embedded in a commercial product. Though I come from the Rust world, I figured this would be a great opportunity to learn and use haskell for my compiler.
 2 days later and I&#x27;m still failing to get a project to build with the LLVM bindings. The repository seems fairly inactive, is many versions behind modern LLVM, and recent github issues documenting build issues have been met with silence. This seems like a very basic package for a language that is supposed to be well suited to writing compilers. I did not expect to have this issue at all. Even flipping Python seemingly has more up to date LLVM bindings.
 So I&#x27;m sadly considering abandoning using haskell for my project. Are there other bindings I&#x27;m not aware of? Is there some other way people do code generation?
 I would love a solution because I was looking forward to learning haskell.
 Thanks for the advice.

                              <span>no-littering used to set backup-directory-alist so that all backup files are created in ~/.config/emacs/var/backup/.
 (Even if you don&#x27;t use no-littering, check the value of that variable. I suspect that many users have themselves customized that variable to put all backup files in a single directory, in which case they would also be affected.)
 If you use emacs/emacsclient as EDITOR and an external tool opens an unencrypted file containing some sensitive data in a directory on a tmpfs file-system, then the backup file would by default be created in the same directory, so it would not hit a disk and be discarded after a reboot.
 Note that this only affects you, if the visited file is not encrypted. So if you, for example, visit ~/.authsource.gpg, then the backup file is also encrypted, regardless of where it resides.
 Please update to release 1.3.0 or snapshot 20230420 and delete all files ~/.config/emacs/var/backup/!tmp!... and ~/.config/emacs/var/backup/!dev!shm!....
 This gets you back to how Emacs behaves by default.
  
The default isn&#x27;t so great either. No backups are created for files in /tmp, but for files in /dev/shm backups are created. To prevent that you would have to use a custom backup-enable-predicate function. (If you don&#x27;t do that, then the backup files sticks around until a reboot, but at least then they get discarded.)
  
This issue was discovered a day ago (https://lonely.town/@wasamasa/110227701055899570) and was reported an hour ago (https://github.com/emacscollective/no-littering/issues/200).
 In the future, please report security issues privately.

                              <span>I would like to build a package to show stocks history comparisons in charts. I have read that it is not possible to produce plots from pure Elisp.
 I never build a package, so I was wondering what would be the best way to generate (modern looking with fast (light) and smooth integration) charts in an Emacs buffer. 
 Note: I usually use Plotly Python for my dataviz, but I know JS offers more possibilities, so I&#x27;m considering learning how to use some JS dataviz libraries (like d3.js) .

 I&#x27;m using Emacs version 29.0.90 (Development version 2b10e1827d3b) and I keep encountering the issue in subject when I install a package. That is, Emacs seems stuck (I waited for multiple hours) while scraping files for loaddefs. If I stop the process (C-g) and restart Emacs, I get the error:
 Error loading autoloads: (file-missing Cannot open load file No such file or directory /home/marcop/.config/emacs/elpa/
/-autoloads)
 Do you have any suggestion on how to debug?
 Cheers
 --- EDIT 1 – 2023-04-20 12:26
 Actually, not all packages create this issue. So far, I identified csv-mode, ess, org-contrib, and polymode as problematic packages.

Emacs 29.1 will not be released tomorrow or the day after. We still have at least several weeks till then, with at least one more pretest. 
  
(This was in the discussion of bug #62720, which is working out (maybe) fixes for package.el to prevent breakage and eliminate confusion when updating core packages from an ELPA.)

                              <span>I’m just getting started with org-mode in Emacs and am looking at options for keeping my org files in sync between computers — specifically, between two Macs. A complication is that on one of the Macs I am limited in what software I can install, for work-related reasons (for example, syncthing might not be an option, Dropbox is probably OK, as is iCloud Drive).
 It’s most important to me that the syncing should be robust, reliable, and secure. I’d like to have files sync automatically in the background, rather than having to trigger a sync manually before leaving one machine or starting on the other. Similarly, it would be good if I don’t have to remember to close all buffers before I leave a machine (i.e. if conflicts and simultaneous editing aren’t a problem, or at least that resolving conflicts doesn’t risk losing data). Also in terms of avoiding data loss, I’d like to be able to make backups of the files, ideally with versioning in case I need to go back and fix something.
 End-to-end encryption would be desirable if it’s cloud storage (which might make iCloud Drive preferable to Dropbox). Being able to sync to an iOS app like Beorg would be nice too, but is less important.
 However, one concern I have about iCloud (apart from some suggestions that it&#x27;s not always reliable) is that it seems like you can’t always guarantee that all files are really stored locally on the Mac, rather than only in the cloud, even if you don’t select “optimize storage&quot; (see for example https://eclecticlight.co/2022/02/21/can-you-back-up-icloud-documents/ ). So, it seems that backup solutions aren’t guaranteed to be able to see and backup the files stored in there (if they happen to be online only). Otherwise, I’d be happy to do my own backups of the directory with something like rsync to my NAS.
 Are there any solutions that fit my wishlist, or am I being too demanding in what I’m looking for? Any pointers would be very welcome!

                              <span>I&#x27;ll go first again. But please take all this as an invitation to share your adventures. As you see, mine are boring and you are probably doing more interesting stuff.
Typical of when I&#x27;m in class, my note take is slowed. More accurately, my refactoring of notes into atomic-sized notes has slowed. I will add as many words to my ZK, but each note is bigger. Because of the speed of the class, I don&#x27;t feel I have time to refactor the notes I&#x27;ve captured from reading, say, &quot;Read Hot Epic.&quot; I keep all the ideas captured from the story in a single note, hoping to atomize the note sometime. In the meantime, I have all the ideas, and because of my search skills, the ideas are not lost.
@Sascha&#x27;s article Why the Single Note Matters is a real eye opener. Care and attention must be paid to each and every note. The effort in this practice is what is called zettelkasting. The rewards are a supportive ZK partner. If you consider this a downside, the downside is that this activity siows time. You will naturally slow down. In a non-pressure environment, this is a good thing. Not so sure it works in a classroom setting with a schedule to keep up with.
I&#x27;ve started a list in my journal of projects to advance once I&#x27;ve completed the food writing seminar. That way, they can be off my mind and safely on a list. (Classic GTD principle)

                              <span>I recently watched the documentary Aby Warburg: Metamorphosis and Memory (Wechsler, 2016) via Kanopy (for free using my local library’s gateway) and thought that others here interested in the ideas of memory in culture, history, and art history may appreciate it. While a broad biography of a seminal figure in the development of art history in the early 20th century, there are some interesting bits relating to art and memory as well as a mention of Frances A. Yates whose research on memory was influenced by Warburg’s library.
Of specific &quot;note” is the fact that Aby Warburg (1866-1929) had a significant zettelkasten-based note taking practice and portions of his collection (both written as well as images) are featured within the hour long documentary. You&#x27;ll see it in the opening scenes in t…</span>

GHC 9.4.5 is now available by Zubin Duggal
The GHC developers are happy to announce the availability of GHC 9.4.5. This release is primarily a bugfix release addressing a few issues found in 9.4.4.
concurrency and Performance by Nicolas Trangez
Testing concurrent code using DejaFu requires the use of MonadConc and MonadSTM instead of plain IO and STM. Is there any performance impact, and if there is, can it be recovered?

As scary or awe-inspiring as it is, one can’t deny the great impact AI can have when applied to fields with positive social value, such as healthcare.
The MedTech industry is buzzing thanks to a continuous stream of innovation, promising to be more precise, efficient and accessible than ever.
In particular oncology, a branch of medicine that focuses on cancer, could benefit immensely from these new technologies, which may enable clinicians to detect cancer earlier and increase chances of survival.

                              <span>Hej fellows,
 I am trying to get skewer-mode to work, in particular, I want to see changes I make to html files in emacs to be automatically updated in the corresponding browser window. I have tried to follow the descriptions on the package&#x27;s GitHub page and also this Emacs Stack-Exchange post, but neither of these affords me the &quot;live change&quot; I seek, and most other guides don&#x27;t regard HTML, but only CSS or Javascript (which I&#x27;ll also need, but that&#x27;s for later).
 Do you know of any good guide that you can recommend, or do you have personal experience with this package and care to share some insights?
 Also, while I&#x27;m at it, I am also open for tips when it comes to webdev. I currently use &#x60;eglot&#x60; and &#x60;tagedit&#x60;, which makes editing quite a bit less of a hassle, but I still miss the coziness of editing lisp with &#x60;sly&#x60; and &#x60;paredit&#x60;.
 Have a good day, folks :)

 Long time user of emacs (since 1994 or 5 using emacs in terminal on a sun sparc workstation) but not a long time init.el file customizer. But now I&#x27;m trying to fix some things that really bug the crap out of me and this is one. I use which-key (because my memory sucks), but as you see from the gif, it shifts the buffers in the main windows. Is there a way to prevent this so that when the side window goes away, the buffers (and cursor position) remain at their original position?

                              <span>On two different laptops on different networks, with or without .emacs, it just freezes for a couple of minutes. I feel like it has only been in the past year or so that I have experienced this. 
 I&#x27;ve used the profiler, but there&#x27;s nothing to see, it&#x27;s just opening/saving the file.
 I&#x27;ve looked at task manager and I&#x27;m spotting any culprits (the two machines have different AV setups).
 I&#x27;m using the 64 bit 28.2 version on both machines. 
 I&#x27;ve chased all over the internet looking for things to try and nothing seems to make a difference. I&#x27;ve been using emacs in one version or another since the 80s and this is the first time I&#x27;m considering giving up on it. 
 Using docker or cygwin is a possibility on one of the machines, but not the one I use for client work.
 Any ideas?

                              <span>I am still trying to get two-way sync&#x27;ed calendars working in Emacs (it seems to me this is the most under-developed aspect in the Emacs eco-system).
 I found vdirsyncer which seems like a nice and promising idea similar to maildir which I already use with notmuch, even though it seems too opinionated and the support for Google calender seems largely untested/unsupported.
 More annoyingly, Microsoft Exchange calendars do not support CalDAV which means one must use tools like davmail. I&#x27;ve had little success getting DavMail to work with two-factor authentication and vdirsyncer also warns that davmail can lead to data loss or strange issues (davmail seems too big, being in Java, for me to hack around). 
 Has anyone had success using Exchange calenders in Emacs? What is your workflow?
 Is anyone using vdirsyncer with Google and/or Exchange? Any hints you can share?
 Thanks!
 PS: I&#x27;ve asked a similar question before and I know of org-caldav, which still requires a CalDAV proxy and org-gcal, which only works for Google.

                              <span>Just want to praise a package called jinx, it provides a spell checker for Emacs, which is really fast.
 Back when I discovered flyspell, it was (for me) a big leap forward in usability and speed. I&#x27;ve used it since, until now. Even so flyspell is nice, it still made editing feel a bit sluggish. Therefore I enabled it only, when editing prose and never while coding.
 But jinx is so fast and non-disturbing, I keep it globally enabled all the time.
 You might like it, too. :)
 (I&#x27;m using it on Linux, and do not know how well it works on other OSes, since it utilizes libenchant.)

 Or maybe there&#x27;s iBuffer command to quickly jump to one of the rows in IBuffer, similar to how imenu works. Then I&#x27;d just remap imenu to that command.
 Update: Found it. (ibuffer-jump-to-buffer). If you want to see only visible buffers in the list: (setq ibuffer-jump-offer-only-visible-buffers t).
 Doom:
  (map! :after ibuffer :map ibuffer-mode-map [remap imenu] #&#x27;ibuffer-jump-to-buffer)

 Remote work is possible, but Houston candidates are preferrable. Or if remote then as close to the CST time zone as possible.
 If you do not have linked in account you can email resume to vverdi at masterword dot com.

                              <span>Fourmolu is a formatter for Haskell source code. It is a fork of Ormolu, with upstream improvements continually merged.
 0.12 comes with some pretty notable changes: * GHC 9.6 support * A new single-constraint-parens option for disabling the feature of adding parentheses to contexts with one constraint * A new column-limit option for breaking lines at a given length (as much as possible) * A new --print-defaults CLI flag for generating a default fourmolu.yaml config file
 With this release, we&#x27;re also excited to announce a new website: https://fourmolu.github.io! The website contains a web app where you can paste in Haskell code, change configuration values, and see the result. It also contains docs for each of the configuration options with examples. As this is the first release of the web app, there are bound to be bugs and things that could be improved, so please write an issue for anything you find in the web app!

                              <span>Let&#x27;s define a function:
 dummyFold :: (Foldable f) &#x3D;&gt; f a -&gt; Int dummyFold &#x3D;  const 0 
 where  is a place holder. For example if f is the good old [] (list) type then  could be replaced by, foldl&#x27;.
 Now the question is, if I want to write the function dummyFold in such a way that it works for all (hopefully) Foldable type instances, how should I go about it? Is there a generic way to do it? I know there exists the package ListLike, however, I wanted to know the haskeline way.
 Thank you!

                              <span>I was reading about &quot;storyboarding&quot; as a useful way to arrange research and prepare to write. The book (Turabian) said the utility of a storyboard versus an outline, is that you can easily move information around. This made me think of org mode, which I already use productively for outlining. 
 So I know it already can do the basic task of storyboarding as is. However, I was curious about whether org mode could display information more like a &quot;storyboard.&quot; Either horizontally or (maybe better for not having to scroll so much) tiling.
 I imagine this would work with the top level heading defining a card / unit and then units would be displayed horizontally or in a grid, rather than a vertical list.
 Is this something that already exists?

                              <span>Hello,
 I am writing elisp code to programatically assign a property to a heading.
 I use the API to parse the buffer and I select headings for further processing:
 (let ((buffer-ast (org-element-parse-buffer))) (org-element-map buffer-ast &#x27;headline (lambda (hl) (when (&#x3D; (org-element-property :level hl) 1) ...))) 
 Here hl is a headline, and I want to get and set its properties (the stuff in the :properties drawer). I am reading the documentation for the API (API documentation link) and the Syntax (Org syntax link), but I don&#x27;t get how to get or set a property.
 Thanks for your help
 Mirko

                              <span>This Release Candidate version of Indigo (a Scala 3 pixel art 2D game engine for Scala.js) is the result of six months work and will hopefully become a full release after undergoing a bit more testing. Feel free to take it for a spin! 🚀
 It contains a good number of general improvements that are based on real usage during the production of our biggest demo to date, hopefully coming soon-ish!
 The main bulk of the work is a total replacement of all GLSL based shaders in favour of programs written using Ultraviolet. Ultraviolet is a Scala 3 shader program writing library that is currently aimed at WebGL + GLSL. The purpose of this work is to begin to separate Indigo from Scala.js and WebGL, so that the project can look at supporting other rendering technologies (WebGPU is the next likely target), and one day, other platforms like the JVM and/or Native. Custom GLSL shaders will still be supported for the for the foreseeable future, but existing shaders will require very minor modification to be compatible.
 Indigo&#x27;s website is slowly going through a necessary rebuild, so for now it&#x27;s advisable to check out the release notes below if you decide to try this version out. Alternatively, do come and say hello on our Discord server if you need any help, or even just to show off what you&#x27;re making. 😁

 I try to change window url as a side effect with basic Tyrian&#x27;s counter app. But then I obtain errors inside browser. 
 case Msg.Decrement &#x3D;&gt;
 (
 model - 10,
 Cmd.SideEffect(

 Errors:

 Would be glad for any help :)

 I can&#x27;t find any ZIO documentation for this specific case or any way to handle websocket connection manually like a WebSocketBuilder. Currently, I&#x27;m using the standard way of opening a WebSocket channel with ZIO:

                              <span>Hey, 
 I tried the Helix editor today (I know, I know...) and out of the box it has this really nice looking feature where it not only colors the keywords for syntax highlighting but also give certain keywords a different font. 
 See here for an example: https://abload.de/img/screenshot2023-04-181tzc7w.png (the fn and the main keyword)
 Now, the same code snippet in my emacs looks like this: https://abload.de/image.php?img&#x3D;screenshot2023-04-181ksiav.png
 Does anyone know how to get these?
 I am using Doom Emacs with emacs 29, I installed the treesitter package from doom. (I know it is built in in emacs 29, but this was still active from my config from emacs 28)
 I active treesitter with &#x60;(global-tree-sitter-mode)&#x60; and &#x60;(add-hook &#x27;tree-sitter-after-on-hook #&#x27;tree-sitter-hl-mode)&#x60; in my config.el.

                              <span>There was a problem that intrigued my mind which i solved lately.
 I have many org files under a Dropbox directory. And also i have a scratch.org file on my desktop. I have wanted an easy way to refile all headings from scratch.org file to files in dropbox. I thought of an elisp form at the top of the file which will act like a button by evaluating with eval-last-sexp command.
 I also wanted this refiling thing for the files in Dropbox. Every file would refile to a specific file.
 I couldn&#x27;t create those elisp forms that will act like buttons easily. It was harder than i thought. I found org-refile function hard to work with programmatically. 
 After wasting so much time about this problem, i found a rather simpler and maybe even intuitive solution.
 I add local variables to each org file. An org-refile-targets and org-archive-location variable for every file. This solution doesn&#x27;t give a one click way to refile all headings to a file, but it does give a simpler and focused way to refile and archive headings to specific org-files. 
 I found this solution very satisfying for my workflow. If is there anyone wasting 4 months in order to setup their essential org workflows, i hope this helps.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve found my GTD someday-maybe file hard to manage. So I want to try a new trick to improve things:
  
Capture someday-maybe items as entries with a date 2 weeks in the future
 I evaluate everything in that file every week. If I want to keep the item, I promote it by either moving it to another file, or removing its timestamp.
 For each item, if I haven&#x27;t promoted it by the time its timestamp rolls around, then org-mode deletes the entry
  
This means I want a plugin or a command or something that will delete items with expired timestamps. I looked through the org manual, and found C-u C-u C-c C-x C-s (https://orgmode.org/manual/Moving-subtrees.html) that will archive items under these circumstances. I want to delete them.
 I suppose I could set up the archive file to be /dev/null ! I&#x27;ll try that and see what happens.
 [EDIT] I tried to set #+ARCHIVE: /dev/null::%s at the top of the file in question (someday.org), but when I archive using C-c C-x C-a it sends it to ./someday.org_archive instead.
 [EDIT2] I just made it re-read the file and tried again, this time I got the answer that /dev/null isn&#x27;t going to work :( File exists, but cannot be read Copied: Subtree(s) with 19 characters funcall-interactively: Buffer is read-only: # 
 [EDIT3] I&#x27;ve made peace that someday.org_archive is workable - I&#x27;ll just think of it as landfill. So where I&#x27;m stuck currently, is to make org&#x27;s capture template set a date 2 weeks in the future when I capture an item to someday.org. I looked through the org manual&#x27;s entries on capture templates again, but it doesn&#x27;t look like there&#x27;s an answer for this.

 This feature is present in Doom Emacs, and when I switched to GNU emacs, I found that I was quite fond of that feature, so I made it here. You can finally do [[https://gaodean.me/gen/cat.jpg]], and have it display inline just like local images. The code here is adapted from the Doom Emacs codebase, and I just thought to make a small plugin to make it simpler to use for GNU emacs users.

                              <span>For the last year or so I&#x27;ve been trying editors and environments to see what fits me. 
 I installed doom emacs and really quite fell in love with it. But I couldn&#x27;t make an Emacs config from scratch. Just wasn&#x27;t a task I could do. It would take maybe a week worth of effort to me.
 Just this weekend I decided I&#x27;ll give neovim a chance. I started making my config from scratch and found it MUCH easier. Followed some videos and after 2 days I have something I really like and more importantly I understand every snippet of code that went into the config.
 I miss some things. The commands pallete on doom was amazing. Every command, every keymap all just there. Magit is a godsend. So is org mode.
 I have no doubt I will eventually hop back to emacs but neovim has given me the confidence to be able to write my own config. 
 What do you guys think?

                              <span>Hi again!
 I&#x27;d like to have project.el only add &amp; remember project root directories that I explictly ask it to. Ideally I&#x27;d like to disable using any project root heuristics. Is this possible in emacs 29?
 Note that I don&#x27;t want to use projectile because I&#x27;m reliant on eglot, which integrates with project.el, and I&#x27;d also prefer to avoid another dependency if I can.

                              <span>Hi Haskell community!
 I am quite stuck with trying to think of a way to implement a createDecisionTree function. But first, some background!
 Here&#x27;s the DecisionTree datatype, which is pretty much just a Rose Tree
 data DecisionTree a &#x3D; DecisionTree a [DecisionTree a] deriving Show 
 I am trying to explore the Decision Tree of a game by modelling the different states one can take from a particular state
 possibleGameStates :: GameState -&gt; [GameState] 
 There&#x27;s a possibility of a lot of overlapping GameStates, so I introduced a Set into the picture
 uniqueGameStates :: SET.Set GameState -&gt; GameState -&gt; ([GameState], SET.Set GameState) uniqueGameStates alreadyExplored g &#x3D; let allPossFiltered &#x3D; filter (\x -&gt; not (SET.member x alreadyExplored)) $ possibleGameStates g newSet &#x3D; SET.union (SET.fromList (g : allPossFiltered)) alreadyExplored in (allPossFiltered, newSet) oneLayer :: SET.Set GameState -&gt; [GameState] -&gt; ([[GameState]], SET.Set GameState) oneLayer s [] &#x3D; ([[]], s) oneLayer s (g : gs) &#x3D; let (iRes, newSet) &#x3D; uniqueGameStates s g in (iRes : fst (oneLayer newSet gs), newSet) 
 I want to write a createDecisionTree function 
 createDecisionTree :: SET.Set GameState -&gt; GameState -&gt; DecisionTree GameState 
 But I have no idea how to compose oneLayer together with uniqueGameStates to create the DecisionTree. Oh, and btw, I have a inEndState :: GameState -&gt; Bool function as well for the base case of createDecisionTree. I have no idea what the recursive case looks like. Help!

                              <span>I might be in a little over my head as I&#x27;m just playing around with my first few non-tutorial lines of PureScript.
 I want to parse a simple line with a Regex.
 Regex match will return a Maybe (Array (Maybe String)). I&#x27;d like to lift the inner array. Is there a library function that does Array (Maybe a) -&gt; Maybe (Array a) (or even Array m a -&gt; m Array a)? I can&#x27;t find anything with that exact signature on pursuit, but I&#x27;m not crazily experienced using it... ;)
 Also, is this a very bad approach? My target files have some lines matching the regex and others that don&#x27;t. A valid line will match all groups, and I need to access all of those groups individually in the next step.
 I&#x27;m also not that fluent yet in the group theory speak...

I press the + (plus) to zoom in and scrolling still works fine at a good speed, however once I start zooming out by pressing the - key, then scrolling becomes laggy and continue to be like that until I close the PDF. Any idea why this happens?

 Eventually I ended up creating a top-level menu that redirects to one of two transient menus depending on state. It feels ugly but I haven&#x27;t found a better way to do this. Is this how it&#x27;s done? Did I miss a critical feature of transient somewhere? (we can ignore the discrepancy with the &quot;stop processing&quot; for this conversation).

The issue is it doesn&#x27;t update when a buffer is opened or closed. So I added in (add-hook &#x27;buffer-list-update-hook #&#x27;my/display-buffers) which I thought would call my function and update it when a new buffer is opened. Though after adding this I can&#x27;t use any command (C-x C-f, M-x, etc) and it causes Emacs to freeze. What am I doing incorrectly here?

                              <span>I&#x27;m a new convert from vim and am so far quite enjoying my time in emacs. I&#x27;m managing connections between several pieces of software for knowledge management (Zotero and logseq ATM, maybe org-roam later on) and have cobbled together some search and replace regexes that I&#x27;ll use repeatedly and are long enough to not want to retype, so I&#x27;m wondering if emacs has a way to save these as a function or something similar. I can use the command history with up &amp; down, but that could be mighty slow if I haven&#x27;t used them in a while. An example would be something like: 
  %s/.zotero.*page&#x3D;\([^&amp;]+\).*)/)\n:PROPERTIES:\n:ls-type: annotation\n:hl-page: \1\n:hl-color: yellow\n:END:/g 
 if I could give this a simple name or even turn it into a function that I could tab-complete down the line, I would be a very happy guy. Any ideas?
 Thanks!

                              <span>I’m a total beginner with emacs, but liked the aesthetics of Doom and decided to give it a go.
 After installing Doom, I un-commented the &#x60;minimap&#x60; line in &#x60;init.el&#x60; to enable the package, ran &#x60;doom sync&#x60; in my terminal, started emacs again and enabled the minimap inside emacs with &#x60;minimap-mode&#x60; but all I’m getting is a small buffer at the right of the window, with an exact duplicate of the main buffer.
 Tried this with various files, same result. I’m using iTerm2 on macOS with Emacs 28.2.
 Any idea what’s wrong?

 I&#x27;ve tried LSP so many times and I&#x27;m too frustrated with how difficult and hard it is to configure. Trying to look at other people&#x27;s configs for this is a nightmare.
 I wanted to ask: Does anyone have an Emacs config that configured LSP or Eglot mode along with proper indentation that &#x27;just works&#x27; for the following modern web development frameworks and languages:
  
React
 Vue
 Ruby On Rails
 JavaScript
 TypeScript
 Python
 HTML
 CSS
  
​
 Anything related would be wonderful as I&#x27;m sick of trying to fight Emacs to even get this to work properly, even when indentation is concerned.

 I&#x27;d like to be able to continue from a session (window/tab layouts) when I reconnect over ssh.
 Is there some way to get emacs to save the previous session so that when I ssh back (after disconnecting) I could continue from a previous emacsclient session the way tmux allows attaching to an existing session?

                              <span>I know TRAMP slowness is a recurring topic here, but I didn&#x27;t see a suggestion on this particular phenomena yet, so asking for advice.
 When I connect to a host at work, TRAMP is trying to find version control configuration all over the file system on the remote host. Git / Bzr / Hg / Svn, in current directory, one directory up, and up, and up... I can trace it in the debug buffer it is taking more than a minute to finish this process which is awkward. I am working from Eastern Europe via VPN, and the remote host is in the US, so it takes a couple of hops while one command completes.
 Is there any way to prevent these checks? I care about version control on my local machine only.
 Thanks.

                              <span>I am using emacs28-nativecomp under Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS in WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) on Windows 10, with their bundled X server. One inconvenience is that when I run &#x60;helm-find-files&#x60; under a Windows mount (e.g. /mnt/c/Users/me/Downloads) once, then I later add a file under that folder, and then I run &#x60;helm-find-files&#x60; again, the latter doesn&#x27;t seem to update and show the latest files added. Dired and shell work correctly. Also regular files under ~/ work as expected. What could it be? And how could I have an up-to-date output with &#x60;helm-find-files&#x60; even in mounted dirs? Thanks!

                              <span>In a Vanilla Emacs config, i see some bootstrap messages (Like load *package*.....done) and then i can use Emacs. 
 ​
 In Doom Emacs, the frame appears as soon as Emacs becomes ready for usage. How is that? Doom Emacs says it took 0.7 seconds to startup, while my vanilla emacs config took 0.37 (i already tweaked early-init), so i guess the DOOM Emacs&#x27; devs have configured it so that either the messages do not appear in the echo area or the frame appears only when emacs becomes ready for usage. 
 ​
 How is it possible?

                              <span>For my own reasons, I&#x27;ve come to use the di- prefix to mean half, in opposition to bi- meaning twice. This has affected me in that difunctor seems to be an older / alternative term with the same meaning as profunctor, as is evidenced by the Profunctor class itself:
 haskell class Profunctor p where dimap :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; (c -&gt; d) -&gt; p b c -&gt; p a d lmap :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; p b c -&gt; p a cw rmap :: (b -&gt; c) -&gt; p a b -&gt; p a c 
 It is actually quite awkward, this straddling of both pro- and di-. The type class name uses the pro- terminology (as in pre, and post), but the functions use the di-, l-, and r- terminology. This is unfortunate, as the Profunctor thus claims essential parts of both terminologies.
 For quite some time, I&#x27;ve actually thought of these in my head as promap, premap and postmap, as I have my own orthogonal use case for the di- nomenclature, having derived another dimap (and rmap, lmap) - but they clash in name with the existing profunctor functions, even though prodifunctor and prodimap in my nomenclature are actually sensible classes worth exploring. Privately I&#x27;ve been content with masking this, as I have alternative ways of deriving names, but I thought it was worth discussing with the community.
 What are your thoughts on the positives and consequences of changing the Profunctor nomenclature such that dimap &#x3D; promap, lmap &#x3D; premap, and rmap &#x3D; postmap?

                              <span>Hi,
 I am curious as to what colors you use for the different levels of headings and if there is some logic behind it...
 Do you simply pick random colors based on gut instinct or do you subscribe to some color theory?
 Or do you differentiate the different levels in another way - using different font-sizes maybe? Or maybe different fonts AND different colors?
 What is your style and why (I am looking for some inspiration...)?
 Many thanks!

                              <span>I recently migrated from straight to elpaca. I&#x27;m generally very pleased with the results, but there is one issue I don&#x27;t know how to resolve, even after reading the manual and trying various searches online. The issue is pretty simple: I don&#x27;t seem to be able to get elpaca to load updates to any use-package expression after Emacs has started.
 For example, let&#x27;s say I want to set the value of the user option org-hide-emphasis-markers to t in my config file. I then add (setq org-hide-emphasis-markers t) to the use-package section of org-mode:
 elisp (use-package org :demand t :config (setq org-hide-emphasis-markers t)) 
 (Assume for simplicity that I have no other org-mode customizations.)
 To test the effects of this change, I run eval-last-sexp with point at the end of the macro. However, nothing happens: the new value is not set.
 I thought this may be related to the asynchronous nature of how elpaca handles packages. But evaluating (elpaca-process-queues) has no effect.
 Apologies if I&#x27;m missing something obvious.

 🤮 What is this indentation style?!
 And trust me, I&#x27;ve tried every possible value for c-ts-mode-indent-style; I&#x27;ve tried gnu, k&amp;r, linux, and bsd. Ideally, I would like emacs to indent my code like this:

 A LOT better
 How would I achieve the indentation style of the lower image?

 How do I adjust the vterm specific colors for my custom theme so that ncurses programs like Midnight Commander don&#x27;t create such blinding color combos?

                              <span>For anyone who might be interested, the folks over on the Tinderbox forums are proposing to have a Zoom meeting about using Tinderbox for a Zettelkasten.  See: https://forum.eastgate.com/t/tinderbox-meetup-sunday-april-23-2023-what-does-it-mean-to-use-tinderbox-as-a-zettelkasten-tool-or-tool-for-what-ever-method-we-individually-might-use/6599/1.
They have expressed interest in getting contributions from @christian and/or @Sascha if possible.

                              <span>Hi all, I was wondering how scala can be applied to have some fun with the hardware embedding SoC like Raspberry PI, Orange PIs, Jetson nano and similar devices.
 Specifically, a C/C++ programmer may have some fun using OpenCL, vulkan or coda on NVIDIA hardware. I know that there are bindings for scala to many of these libraries but honestly I don’t see using them in a functional context to add much wrt the imperative way, instead they tend to be more limited in scala.
 Even more, recent devices like rk3588 are equipped with a NPU, is there a way to have fun with it with Scala?
 What’s your thoughts about this? ZP

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;ve been playing around with recursion schemes and I have a question regarding re-using logic between different folds.
 For example, say we have a simple expression language...
 data Expr &#x3D; Num Int | Add Expr Expr | Mul Expr Expr makeBaseFunctor &#x27;&#x27;Expr 
 We can define a &quot;debug print&quot; for an Expr which prints its tree structure. Taking inspiration from the example from the recursion-schemes docs, we can use an effectful fold in Reader that keeps track of the current depth:
 type Depth &#x3D; Int debugPrint :: Expr -&gt; String debugPrint e &#x3D; runReader (cata debugAlg e) 0 where debugAlg :: ExprF (Reader Depth String) -&gt; Reader Depth String debugAlg e &#x3D; do depth  (&quot;Num &quot; ++ show n, []) AddF e1 e2 -&gt; (&quot;Add&quot;, [e1, e2]) MulF e1 e2 -&gt; (&quot;Mul&quot;, [e1, e2]) ss…</span>

 Failed to verify signature markdown-mode-2.5.tar.sig: No public key for 0*************** created at 2022-02-11T16:05:05-0600 using RSA Command output:gpg: keyblock resource &#x27;~/.emacs.d/elpa/gnupg/pubring.kbx&#x27;: No such file or directory 
 When I went and checked the folders, there was no ../elpa/gnupg/ folder, only the folder ../elpa/gnu-elpa-keyring-update-2022.12/ was there. I tried the solution suggested here, but the same error persisted.
 After that I tried package-refresh-contents, and I began to receive Failed to download &#x27;melpa&#x27; archive and also package Not found errors. So as a result of this I am unable to install any packages on my Mac M2 Air.
 Please help me fix this

 I get a hyperlinked TOC where each item in the TOC is colored blue. I know I could replace #+options: toc:t w/ #+latex: {\hypersetup{linkcolor&#x3D;black}\tableofcontents} but I&#x27;m wondering if there is something I can put in my configuration file to make this automatic. Thanks.

                              <span>There are packages that contain multiple .el files (*features*). One example is org mode.
 ​
 There are also built-in features that are considered packages from &#x60;(package-installed-p)&#x60;. One example is delsel:
 ​
 (package-installed-p &#x27;delsel) -&gt; non-nil
 ​
 Is there a way to get the package that owns a certain feature? Also, why do some built in features count as packages?

  - aeson - text - bytestring - unordered-containers - attoparsec - req - Win32 &gt;&#x3D; 2.13.4.0 
 and this resolver: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/commercialhaskell/stackage-snapshots/master/lts/20/18.yaml
 but then stack complains about adding Win32-2.13.4.0 to extra-deps, which results in bunch of errors like this
  In the dependencies for aeson-2.0.3.0: time must match &gt;&#x3D;1.6.0.1 &amp;&amp;  aeson-2.0.3.0 
 after adding all that to extra-deps i get
  Dependency cycle detected in packages: [Cabal,Cabal-syntax,Cabal,entropy,crypto-api,RSA,authenticate-oauth,req,script] In the dependencies for Cabal-syntax-3.6.0.0: Cabal dependency cycle detected: Cabal, Cabal-syntax, Cabal, entropy, crypto-api, RSA, authenticate-oauth, req, script needed due to script-0.1.0.0 -&gt; Cabal-syntax-3.6.0.0 
 I would be very thankful if someone could offer some ideas on how to try to solve this.

                              <span>A new release of SBV is now on hackage, supporting quantifiers, quantifier alternation, quantifier elimination, and skolemization. This allows users to express and prove first-order logic theorems. (Of course, the underlying solver---typically z3---may not be able to determine theoremhood, since first-order logic is semi-decidable. However, modern SMT solvers can handle most instances that come up in practice.)
 Here&#x27;s a simple example:
 Prelude Data.SBV&gt; :set -XDataKinds Prelude Data.SBV&gt; sat $ \(Forall @&quot;x&quot; x) (Exists @&quot;y&quot; y) -&gt; y .&#x3D;&#x3D; (x + 1 :: SInteger) Satisfiable Prelude Data.SBV&gt; sat $ skolemize $ \(Forall @&quot;x&quot; x) (Exists @&quot;y&quot; y) -&gt; y .&#x3D;&#x3D; (x + 1 :: SInteger) Satisfiable. Model: y :: Integer -&gt; Integer y x &#x3D; 1 + x 
 A set of first-order-logic examples are included in the release. As usual, bug reports, comments, and contributions are most welcome at the github repo.
 Happy proving!

                              <span>I&#x27;ve developed pure Haskell quicksort on mutable vectors while aiming to match performance of std::sort from C++. While not really hitting that bar, the result is within around 20% in sequential mode and is faster in parallel mode.
 In addition, the package exposes reasonable default sort for most users suitable for just importing and sorting without thinking twice what&#x27;s going on under the hood.
 Parallelisation is implemented via both sparks and threads and the method is selectable. Unfortunately threads don&#x27;t show much speedup but users can define ther own, hopefully faster, methods to parallelise. Sparks-based parallelisation is much faster but unfortunately will use all available capabilities at runtime so it&#x27;s less controllable.
 The repository is https://github.com/sergv/vector-quicksort and the benchmarks are under https://github.com/sergv/vector-quicksort#benchmarks.

                              <span>I defined an assignment to make an alias for switching some functions. 
 So I wrote a code like below.
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;hs -- Please ignore details of function body. This code is just for my interest but not for production
 fun :: Eq a &#x3D;&gt; [a] -&gt; Bool fun xs &#x3D; xs &#x3D;&#x3D; reverse xs
 -- This is my intention funAlias &#x3D; fun 
 data1, data2 :: [Int] data1 &#x3D; [1, 2, 3] data2 &#x3D; [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]
 data3 :: [Char] data3 &#x3D; &quot;madmimadam&quot;
 main :: IO () main &#x3D; do print $ funAlias data1 &#x3D;&#x3D; False print $ funAlias data2 &#x3D;&#x3D; True print $ funAlias data3 &#x3D;&#x3D; True &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 And I got errors.
 sh src/06.hs:19:17: error: • Couldn&#x27;t match type ‘Char’ with ‘Int’ Expected: [Int] Actual: String • In the first argument of ‘solve’, namely ‘data2’ In the first argument of ‘(&#x3D;&#x3D;)’, namely ‘solve data2’ In the second argument of ‘($)’, namely ‘solve data2 &#x3D;&#x3D; True’ | 19 | print $ solve data2 &#x3D;&#x3D; True | ^^^^^ 
 I (maybe) understood I can&#x27;t define an alias of polymorphic function but I can&#x27;t figure out what is happend actually. 
 Please show me what is wrong. And making an alias of function is bad manner in Haskell?

 I have come across Alex(https://serokell.io/blog/lexing-with-alex) and Happy which are libraries for scanning tokens and parsing but as a beginner I would like to look at code that uses Haskell directly. There is a toy grammar for this.My goal is to learn FP for this use case so that I can use the new pattern matching features using records in Java.
 I can compile and execute Haskell( or Ocaml ) in Spacemacs.
 Is there a book for that ? I know about Appel&#x27;s books. I am particularly interested in patterns like zipper which I have already coded. Are similar patterns useful for parsing and scanning ?
 ​
 Thanks.

In my case they&#x27;re hardware specs for computers, but the general idea is take a two-column (| key | value |) table from a bunch of independent org files and combine it into one big table.
 Some of the examples I found before used #+INCLUDE statements to grab the table like:
 #+NAME: calamity-hw #+INCLUDE: ./calamity.org::#hardware :only-contents t 
 but I didn&#x27;t like having to keep this list updated even though it only required executing re-executing a code block. It also required passing each table as a variable into the code block for generating the big table like:
 #+BEGIN_SRC elisp :var chaos&#x3D;chaos-hw devil&#x3D;devil-hw ...

 https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/tyrian/releases/tag/v0.6.2
 If you want to see Tyrian in action, check out the amazing all new Rock the JVM &quot;The Typelevel Rite of Passage&quot;* course to watch the build of a full-stack web application from scratch! It&#x27;s an excellent introduction to Scala.js.
 https://rockthejvm.com/p/typelevel-rite-of-passage
 Also keep an eye out of Daniel Ciocîrlan&#x27;s recent Scalar Conference 2023 talk when hits YouTube. (Hopefully soon, I hear good things and can&#x27;t wait to see it!)
 If you&#x27;d prefer to read about it, Gabriel Volpe&#x27;s brilliant new book &quot;Functional Event-Driven Architecture&quot; includes a bonus chapter featuring Tyrian, in which he ports his trading app from Elm to Tyrian.
 https://leanpub.com/feda
 https://github.com/gvolpe/trading/tree/main/modules/ws-client
 Tyrian&#x27;s giter8 template has also been brought up to date, meaning that you can get your first Tyrian app up and running in five minutes flat! Give it a try, what&#x27;s the worst that can happen?
 sbt new PurpleKingdomGames/tyrian.g8
 Many thanks, as always, to Tyrian&#x27;s contributors and community. I love it when people drop into our little Discord server to show us what they&#x27;ve been building!
 (* Please note that while the course and book mentioned above are both based on the Typelevel and Cats Effect ecosystem, Tyrian works with any compatible effect type, and we have a small but growing number of Tyrian+ZIO users too.)

                              <span>Hi everyone!
 I&#x27;m trying to find a concise name for a special pattern of using return type values as a place to collect evidence about an underlying implementation.
 The essence of the pattern is to replace what would usually be Unit with a new, distinct type. On the trait definition level, the return type is kept abstract, so that each implementation can decide for itself what it means for it to be correct. On the implementation level, however, the type is defined such that it enumerates what evidence is necessary to consider this specific implementation correct. When multiple levels of traits/implementations are at play, the evidence is propagated from level to level in its abstract form.
 The following example should give you a general idea of what I&#x27;m talking about:

 What is Iron?
 Iron is a library enabling developers to attach constraints (also called &quot;refinement&quot;) to types. These constraints are evaluable at compile-time and/or at runtime:
 scala val x: Int :| Positive &#x3D; 5 //OK val y: Int :| Positive &#x3D; -4 //Compile-time error! val z: Int :| Positive &#x3D; -4.refine //Runtime exception. Variants for &#x60;Option&#x60;, &#x60;Either&#x60; etc... exist 
 Check the Github page for more information.
 Features of v2.1.0
 New error messages
 Iron now has enhanced compile-time errors, clearer and more explicit.
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;scala def log(x: Double :| Positive): Double &#x3D; Math.log(x)
 log(-1)  scala -- Constraint Error -------------------------------------------------------- Could not satisfy a constraint…</span>

                              <span>Hi! I&#x27;m looking to migrate to vanilla emacs, and I thought I&#x27;d kick things off by asking you all for advice.
 I&#x27;m terrible at emacs, but I&#x27;ve been managing to limp along with it as my primary driver for a good number of years now. I used vim for many years, but then I switched to spacemacs for some time and moved on to doom a little while back. I absolutely love the idea of a modal space menu, and the evil integrations have been fantastic for me.
 BUT. Even though they&#x27;re great projects, I&#x27;d really like to be done with things like spacemacs and doom. They&#x27;ve been a great way for me to see what&#x27;s out there, but all the built-in customization makes it really hard for someone like me to understand where various behaviors are actually coming from, and at least a few times I&#x27;ve discovered that after much hair-pulling what I thought were plugin bugs were actually problems with the customization layers. I feel like I always end up stripping away as many of the customizations as possible.
 My use case is essentially solid support for C++, maybe some python and glsl, and that&#x27;s pretty much it. I know eglot &amp; clangd/ccls work well for the c++ part, which i feel covers quite a bit of what I need. With eglot and things like use-package becoming a part of emacs in 29, I&#x27;m really getting the itch to just build things up from vanilla emacs, so that I know exactly what is custom and what isn&#x27;t.
 External things I know I&#x27;d like:
  
spacemacs-style menu (is this a package?)
 magit
 ranger for file browsing
 evil integration everywhere possible
  
What major headaches do people see lurking here if I&#x27;m keeping things pretty minimal?

                              <span>Dear All,
 I am running emacs on a Linux machine in terminator with a dark background. The default colors are hard to read, with dark blue on black being used for certain faces and I believe emacs is misunderstanding the background color.
 I think I should be able to set frame-background-mode to help with this. I tried adding (set-variable &#x27;frame-background-mode &#x27;dark) or (frame-set-background-mode &#x27;dark) to my .emacs file, and still when I go into emacs it shows the variable value as being nil.
 Any advice on this, and whether this is the right approach?

I need to get projectile to stop throwing an error every time I navigate to a different file. I&#x27;ve tried googling it to no avail, and the M-x customize window didn&#x27;t have any useful information. How do I tell Projectile to use a different command? And what command do I tell it to use?
 Edit: My emacs config: https://gitlab.com/yramagicman/stow-dotfiles/-/tree/master/config/emacs
 Edit 2: Solved. I have Git Bash installed and was able to add the binaries from that to my Emacs path. Don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t think about that previously, but it worked.

 ​
 1) Run an interactive command with arguments. The problem I&#x27;m trying to solve is to repeatedly load a file. (Yes, I know about M-x eval-buffer). In vim, I can call the :source command with an argument, for example:
 :source ~/.vimrc
 I can then even type : and hit the up arrow, or :so and hit the up arrow and it will recall from my history similar to bash&#x27;s Ctrl-r.
 In Emacs, M-x load-file (or :load-file since I use evil) doesn&#x27;t seem to accept an argument. I&#x27;m forced to hit RET, and then the name of the file. Let alone not having…</span>

                              <span>Hi!
 there&#x27;s a specific type of buffer where I can&#x27;t view non latin characters (hebrew in my case). In all other buffers and minibuffer pop-ups hebrew characters are presented fine, but I&#x27;m using prot&#x27;s &#x60;denote&#x60; package, which creates a backlinks buffer (nvm exactly what that is if your unfamilliar) using xrefs - and the text in that buffer gets displayed withe characters&#x27; numbers, but not the actual letters.
 I have the following in my config file:
 ;; UTF-8 as default encoding
 (set-language-environment &quot;English&quot;)
 (set-language-environment &quot;UTF-8&quot;)
 (set-default-coding-systems &#x27;utf-8)
 (set-keyboard-coding-system &#x27;utf-8-unix)
 (set-input-method &#x27;hebrew-full)
 ;; do this especially on Windows, for python output problems
 (set-terminal-coding-system &#x27;utf-8-unix)
 And I&#x27;m using Doom emacs on windows.
 Thanks for any help!

                              <span>Hi,
 If I have a running emacs and connect to the computer with remote desktop (mstsc.exe) on Win10.
 I found the the font is obscure and I have to restart emacs and font rendering will be okay again.
 Do you have any idea how I can solve it without close and run my emacs session ?

                              <span>Today, my emacs started having all sorts of problems connected to utf8 characters. I think I traced the problem back to emacs not opening my init.el with utf8 encoding for some reason. I set utf8 characters as the values of several variables in init.el, and this causes problem in other buffers even when emacs determines the encoding of these other buffers correctly.
 I tried using #&#x27;recode-region and #&#x27;set-buffer-file-coding-system to reencode init.el, but if I restart emacs it keeps detecting the file as &quot;no-encoding&quot;. I also tried using (prefer-coding-system &#x27;utf-8-unix) but that didn&#x27;t help either.
 I&#x27;m out of ideas. Does anyone have suggestions for what else I can try?

                              <span>I have a very simple toy project using spago. I&#x27;d like to add the purescript-postgresql-client library as a dependency, but it apparently doesn&#x27;t exist in the package set.
 I apparently need to add this package, along with its dependencies, to packages.dhall. Should I just be copying the list of dependencies out of the Spago.dhall file from the package&#x27;s repo? If so, why can&#x27;t Spago just do that for me when it gets the package and builds it?
 Also, what happens if the package gets updated upstream and the dependencies change? How am I supposed to keep the list in packages.dhall up to date?
 I&#x27;m mainly used to the Cargo/crates.io ecosystem so apologies if I&#x27;m fundamentally misunderstanding some concepts here.

                              <span>Hi community,
 as syntax is contentious a topic as ever, David (the main proposal author) and I would like to invite you to give your input on https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/585, where we propose to change the syntax of the accepted proposal #522 introducing Or patterns. In particular, we&#x27;d like to know
  
Whether you like the syntax ((one of 1,2,3), 4) in the original proposal better than the amended one mirroring case of: (one of {1;2;3},4)
 
Whether you like that it is subject to layout, similar to case of, e.g., 
 f (one of 1 2 3) &#x3D; 4
 Which looks kind of funny here, but perhaps has foreseen use cases.
 
Whether you think it&#x27;s good or bad to allow f (one of {}) (with layout just f (one of), even), and whether the semantics should be a strict match (mirroring case x of {}) or lazy (like case x of _ -&gt; ...)
 
If you have experience with writing tools for GHC Haskell, whether mirroring case of syntax poses new problems for you, especially caused by it being subject to layout rules
 
 (Note that we understand that you might not like either syntax. That is fine, but the linked proposal thread is not the place to have that discussion. In all honesty, the syntactic appearance is not why we like Or patterns, rather the opposite.)
 Thank you!

                              <span>I have been using chatgpt for emacs-lisp programming lately. It is helping me in learning APIs and writing simple functions.
 Today I wanted to write a set of functions to communicate with hammerspoon (the idea is to display in the menu bar the name of the task clocked in, and a continuous update of the time spend in it). I was able to complete my goal faster using chatGPT. When the task is clocked out, reset the menu bar.
 Here is example of what it shows &quot;[0:07] (doing som..&quot; truncated so it does not take too long

 Here are some interactions:

 It is also capable of writing some functions. Here is asking it do some coding:

 Overall, I highly recommend using chat-gpt to increase your emacs-lisp productivity.

                              <span>hello all! i’m new here but no stranger to emacs!
 ever since macOS decided to drop emacs, I’ve been wondering for quite awhile what terminal editor is intended to be used instead? I’ve been focusing on using nano (in both Ubuntu and macOS) for about a year or two and I’ve discovered I can’t unlearn emacs bindings after using it for over 25 years - it takes *more* effort to slow down and translate what I want to do into a nano binding which just doesn’t seem efficient to me (not to mention all the times I’ve had to undo my mistakes!)
 I‘m well aware I can just install emacs through homebrew and just wondering what alternatives exist out there compatible with emacs bindings? [and I’m not looking for anything fancy - 95% of the time I’m just doing basic editing of a config file or README.txt]
 I could have sworn there exists a lightweight terminal editor compatible with emacs bindings included with macOS now and I can’t find any reference to it so thought I’d wave the white flag and post here!

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to understand one little mystery in my init file, but can&#x27;t seem to figure it out.
 I have the following snippet in my init file to add some custom searches for rg:
 (with-eval-after-load &#x27;rg ;; Provide some custom searches for Lisp libraries (rg-define-search rg-emacs-lisp &quot;Search the Emacs lisp default libraries.&quot; :dir &quot;/usr/local/share/emacs/&quot; :flags &#x27;(&quot;--search-zip&quot;) :files &quot;*.{el,el.gz}&quot; :menu (&quot;Emacs Libraries&quot; &quot;b&quot; &quot;Built-in&quot;)) (rg-define-search rg-emacs-elpa &quot;Search Elpa packages.&quot; :dir package-user-dir :files &quot;all&quot; :flags &#x27;(&quot;--glob&#x3D;!*.elc&quot;) :menu (&quot;Emacs Libraries&quot; &quot;e&quot; &quot;Elpa&quot;))) 
 With that snippet, right after startup, if I call M-: (featurep &#x27;rg) the answer is t. But, if I comment it out, the answer is nil. So that bit is triggering the loading of rg. But, since it is set (with-eval-after-load &#x27;rg ...) I&#x27;d expect this to run only after rg is loaded for some other reason. How does trigger the loading of the package? Is there any way to make these settings while avoiding the loading of rg?

                              <span>I am a long time vim user, just started to use emacs a few weeks ago. And there is a feature I like so much in neovim that I wonder if it is possible to acomplish the same in emacs:
 The file tree displays a sign next to folders that have uncommited changes when in a git repository, and also shows a sign when the file or folder contain some error detected by the LSP. Like in the following image:
 nvim-tree
 Is there a way to do this in emacs? I use neotree, but I would be comfortable using any other file tree plugin if I could get this behavior.
 Thank you very much in advance!

As such it&#x27;s numbering doesn&#x27;t start at paragraph 1, it starts at 11-1. I&#x27;m curious if I can tell org export to start the first highest level headings at 11-1, then define how sub headings are handled. In my case here is what the document kind of looks like.
 11-1: Document Title (or more accurately this chapter&#x27;s title)
 INDENTED (1) Some stuff in paragraph form about the intent behind document, etc
 INDENTED (2) Some more stuff
 11-2: Next top level heading
 ​
 Reddit dumped the indentation, so I added &quot;INDENTED&quot;

Are there any downsides or limitations of using Emacs that users should be aware of?
 
Are there any major companies or organizations using Emacs in their development workflows?
 
I&#x27;m currently using productivity softwares (obsidian, anki etc.) Why should I use Emacs tools?
 
What are some popular Emacs packages or plugins that users might find useful?
 
 It will obviously take time and effort to learn, so help me to be sure.

                              <span>Hi!
 I&#x27;m very new to emacs, my journey has been vim followed by VSCode and now I want to dabble with emacs. I managed to set up evil, which was very straight forward but now I am struggling a lot with everything with typescript. 
 I&#x27;ve identified that I need lsp-mode, lsp-ui, tree-sitter, dap, tree-sitter-langs and tide to have a decent environment up and running. I have the following script setup:
  (require &#x27;package) (add-to-list &#x27;package-archives (cons &quot;nongnu&quot; (format &quot;http%s://elpa.nongnu.org/nongnu/&quot; (if (gnutls-available-p) &quot;s&quot; &quot;&quot;)))) (add-to-list &#x27;package-archives &#x27;(&quot;melpa&quot; . &quot;https://melpa.org/packages/&quot;) t) (package-initialize) (require &#x27;use-package) ;; EVIL (require &#x27;evil) (evil-mode 1) ;; DAP-MODE (use-package dap-mode) (setq package-list &#x27;(dap-mode tree-sitter tree-sitter-langs)) ;; TREE SITTER (require &#x27;tree-sitter-langs) (require &#x27;tree-sitter) ;; Activate tree-sitter globally (minor mode registered on every buffer) (global-tree-sitter-mode) (add-hook &#x27;tree-sitter-after-on-hook #&#x27;tree-sitter-hl-mode) (setq package-list &#x27;(dap-mode tree-sitter tree-sitter-langs lsp-mode lsp-ui)) (use-package tree-sitter-langs :ensure t :config (tree-sitter-require &#x27;typescript) ) ;; LSP (require &#x27;lsp-mode) (add-hook &#x27;prod-mode-hook #&#x27;lsp) (setq lsp-keymap-prefix &quot;C-c l&quot;) (dolist (package package-list) (unless (package-installed-p package) (package-install package))) 
 I&#x27;ve installed the packages but don&#x27;t really see anything. No syntax highlighting, nothing. Any clue where to even start?

                              <span>Using pdb from terminal makes it interactive &quot;forever&quot;: after program finished it restarts the script and starting again. Thats convenient. It is posible to use run and restart commands.
 But in emacs via elpy debuger it throws out into simple python prompt when the pdb reach the end of the program. The same when trying to use restart or run command - it goes to simple python prompt.
 How to make it stay in &quot;pdb-mode&quot; after program ends (like in terminal)?

                              <span>Say I have two buffers open, both in insert mode.
 In the first buffer, I push escape to go to normal mode, and then I switch to the second buffer.
 In the second buffer I will still be in insert mode.
 Not really consistent with vim, and annoying if I want to quickly switch back to another buffer but not realising I&#x27;m in insert mode and typing some shit. Now I got to back space and go to normal mode before switching.
 Any simple way to fix this? Both google and chatgpt have been less than helpful.

                              <span>Right now it appears there are only a couple of people working on this project. In the past there were some others, but at no time were there very many. Is it the ugly red-headed step-child nobody wants to see or hear?
 I watched some videos on Scala-Native and saw that the Java libraries which are used to some extent by Scala for the JVM are NOT usable for Scala-Native. Does this mean some parts of them have to be rewritten in Scala? how else might their use in the JVM world be replaced for the Native world?
 Is this a project new people can join? I&#x27;d love to see some good compiler writers join the project to get it moving along quicker.

                              <span>State machines are a common abstraction in computer science. They can be used to represent and implement stateful processes.
My interest in them stems from Domain-Driven Design and software architecture. With this blog post I’d like to explain why I think that state machines are a great tool to express and implement the domain logic of applications.
Moreover, I’d like to present crem, a new Haskell library to build state machines, and explain why Haskell plays an important role in making crem special.

The origin: Domain-Driven Design and state machines
If you are familiar with Domain Driven Design, and Event Storming in particular, you have probably already seen the following picture:

                              <span>hello, I am coming from vim and new to emacs I decided to use doomemacs since it looks easier to configure its working fine and was actually easier than configuring neovim !, but I am facing issue with fonts I am using this line of code
 (setq doom-theme &#x27;doom-gruvbox doom-font (font-spec :family &quot;Fire Code Medium&quot; :size 15.0))
 but it seems not to be set globally only on some texts like for example the version on bottom right and name of file opened at the bottom status bar but I want to make it the default font for every text.

                              <span>I have been using emacs for several months at this point. A few months into it, people started talking about using straight.el instead of package.el, so I moved my configuration over to using straight.el. However, now people are saying package.el is the best option and that people should not really use straight.el anymore. I have had good experience with straight.el since some packages I like are not on melpa. Additionally, I have tried downloading and using emacs-29, and it seems to run into issues when using straight which makes me lean more towards using package.el unless there is some way to fix this. Which package manager should I use, and why (I have also heard about elpaca which seems to have nice UI and fixes some issues that straight has, so what about that versus straight and use-package)?

                              <span>Hi,
 last year at the same period I wrote some articles about Emacs Lisp and org-mode on this subreddit that I just turned into a website:

 I hope this is useful.
 Have a nice day

                              <span>I was trying to make a backend to xref that depends on external programs and realized there seems to be no way to not block while waiting for a response. I was wondering if there is an alternative framework to xref that wouldn&#x27;t block. Ideally, I am looking for something that would take care of timeouts and would abort calls to async-xref if I make a new one. 
 Or maybe there is a better approach to the problem I have that I haven&#x27;t imagined?

 Does this need additional configuration? I can&#x27;t really find any docs on it either:(

                              <span>I find myself often re-arranging windows especially because I use projectile compilation or deadgrep etc, which pop up additional windows, or replace the one I&#x27;m currently working in.
 I used to use CEDET 15 years ago, and I liked the way it kept the layout fixed, with a lower buffer (similar as to VSCode does it) &quot;capturing&quot; all what could be considered process-output. And then up on top I&#x27;m free to do whatever.
 Is there something comparable? I&#x27;m wary getting CEDET itself into my life, as all its tools seem to be pretty dated.

 Any idea how to solve this?

                              <span>Hey Everyone, I created a curated Scala jobs aggregator FairJoin.com - right now it has 350 Scala jobs from 80 Companies. I created it because I&#x27;ve been a Scala Engineer for the past 10 years and it&#x27;s always been a pain finding jobs that actually use Scala. 
 An example of why it&#x27;s a pain: LinkedIn claims to have 30,000+ Scala jobs, but you click on most of them and they say &quot;Requires experience with languages like Python C#, C++, Java, Javascript, Rust, Go, Scala, or Kotlin&quot;. They just use Scala as a keyword, and you&#x27;ll never actually use Scala in that job.
 With FairJoin I review every job posting to ensure it has a high likelihood of actually using Scala. It&#x27;s early stages, but some of the next features I plan on adding are filters for things like location and Scala specific attributes (i.e. Functional, Akka, Cats, Data Engineering), as well as more company info.

 I hope it&#x27;s useful, and I&#x27;d love to hear your thoughts either here or email me at stephen@fairjoin.com

                              <span>On April 20th at 19.30 UTC, I&#x27;ll be speaking with Simon Peyton Jones, one of the team behind Haskell, on a YouTube livestream. 
 Simon is renowned for his work in lazy functional languages, and I&#x27;ll be exploring his career of building languages, especially Haskell, but also C-- and most recently Verse. We&#x27;ll dig into his work at both Microsoft Research and Epic Games, and exploring the lessons we can take from a monumental career. At the end we&#x27;ll put your questions to him in an AMA.
 Everyone is welcome to come and join in and ask questions. You can set a reminder on YouTube.
 The interview is part of Exercism&#x27;s #12in23 - a year long challenge to encourage people to try 12 new languages throughout the year. So far, I&#x27;ve interviewed José Valim (Elixir), Louis Pilfold (Gleam), Cameron Balahan (Go), Josh Tripplet (Rust), and  Bjarne Stroustrup (C++) - they&#x27;re all available to watch back on YouTube!

                              <span>As a short &quot;introduction,&quot; I am a 16 year old student from Canada. I&#x27;ve been programming since I was 12, although it wasn&#x27;t much until I was 14. I picked up python initially so I could &quot;show off&quot; to one of my friends, but I ended up getting hooked on writing C until about halfway through last year, in which I started learning Haskell. I&#x27;m firmly convinced that I won&#x27;t leave Haskell anytime soon, as everything just feels superior to how I was doing stuff before, even if it was harder initially (and still, to a certain extent.) I want to eventually work in I.T, but I&#x27;m unsure of the availability of Haskell developer entry positions for once I could actually fathom getting a job working as a developer. I know I&#x27;m young and not locked into using any 1 language / stack, but I&#x27;m still kind of just wondering what I should consider doing for the future? Thanks!

                              <span>I am practicing &quot;intermittent fasting&quot;, and record it as:
 | Date | Start | End | Format | Difference | |----------+-------+-------+--------+------------| | 20230412 | 20:05 | 12:30 | 24:00 | 16:25 | #+TBLFM: $5&#x3D;$4-$2+$3;U 
 My fasting started from 20:05 last night and expects to end on 12:30 today. I firstly tried to calculate the interval by formula &quot;$5&#x3D;24-$2+$3;U&quot;,but it compute a wrong result. So a new column Format 24 hours should be added.
 How could get it done without a cumbersome new column of 24 hours.

                              <span>We all like editing to be fast and transparent. But what are some things that make Emacs slow? Either long start-up, sluggish edits, GC freezes, etc. Things that may be cool, but are rendered impractical by execution time.
 Also if you found a way to speed the thing up, or a faster alternative, would love to hear it.
 (please be kind to the authors/maintainers of slow code as per Rule 2.)

(setq inhibit-startup-screen t) (setq hello-key (kbd &quot;C-c C-j&quot;)) (global-foo-mode 1) 
 I have split the code above into 2 parts. The first part contains the code for the minor mode. The bottom three lines show how the user may use the mode.
 The user wants to set the hello-key to (kbd &quot;C-c C-j&quot;) before enabling the mode. But the minor mode ignores this new value of hello-key because it has already used the old value (kbd &quot;C-c C-f&quot;) while defining the keymap for the minor mode.
 Is it possible to create a minor mode in a way that every time the user enables the minor mode, the minor mode re-evaluates its keymap?

                              <span>I want to use a variant of the EXWM function ((exwm-workspace-move-window (frame-or-index &amp;optional id)) to move an EXWM to another workspace/frame.
 Normally this is accomplished with the C-c RET key combination, but in this case the window in question is an EXWM window running under Xpra so it traps the key combination and handles it itself.
 The way around it is to get the window title of the Xpra window from Emacs/EXWM, derive the window-id from it or find it some other way then pass it to the ((exwm-workspace-move-window (frame-or-index &amp;optional0 id)).
 So begins my excursion into finding Emacs window ids, the X window values and those of frames as well.
 Where do I start?

                              <span>As the pretest version has been released, I cloned and built Emacs 29 on OpenSUSE TW. I used the following options:
 --with-native-compilation&#x3D;aot --with-x-toolkit&#x3D;gtk3 --without-xaw3d --with-xinput2 --with-tree-sitter --with-json --without-compress-install CFLAGS&#x3D;&#x27;-march&#x3D;native&#x27; 
 I faced an issue, so I searched and found the following comments on Arch AUR:
  
Native JSON support was removed from emacs sometime in the first semester of 2022. In my tests leaving JSON support out had some breaking bugs that made it a non-starter. I have to test it again before adding such switch to t build script.
  
I checked the official Arch package recipe and found that they do not use the --with-json option. The same is with OpenSUSE official package. However, Fedora package does use that option for their building. &#x27;
 Anyway, I found a tip that running make bootstrap could solve the issue, and it works. Emacs 29 got compiled successfully, and it now runs flawlessly on my machine since morning. Actually, I&#x27;m not sure what the issue was and if it was caused by --with-json option, but I wanted to raise a discussion about whether using this option is not recommended anymore by default.

                              <span>Does someone know how does the css-ls validate the css file? Emacs doesn&#x27;t show any errors for my css file, but when I ran it through the w3 css validator I got an error.
 There is a variable lsp-css-validate which is set to t in emacs. So I assume it does some validation https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/page/lsp-css/#lsp-css-validate
 But maybe the LSP validation is not as strict as the W3 css validator? https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator.html.en
 Scenario where I ran into this was that I had written &quot;scale (1)&quot; instead of the correct &quot;scale(1)&quot;. Spent quite a bit of time to hunt this down manually.
 In hindsight I would&#x27;ve spotted the error immediately if I had put the css file through the W3 CSS validator. Maybe next time I&#x27;ll remember this.

                              <span>Many fonts now support this readability enhancement: to display zero with slashes. This is not a different character (such as a slashed o character: „ Ø ”), but a variation of how zeros are displayed. 
 (This can also be enabled in web browsers with JavaScript script extensions such as Stylus, Stylebot etc.). 
 I understand that some people may be not welcoming change (including this one), but this is important for many things, including programming. I kept trying to make chat-gpt understand what code I&#x27;m asking for but it never provides any useful answer, as my current font in Emacs already supports this feature, it is just Emacs which does not make the font display this useful differentiation (variation). 
 Please don&#x27;t be harsh, for now I&#x27;d like to just improve some annoying things in the meanwhile of beginning to learn some more Emacs topics. Regards :).

which I believe is standard practice though?
 But in Emacs, using Magit, I&#x27;m not sure how to perform this operation? Simply opening a sell (M-x shell) and running that doesn&#x27;t do it.

 I&#x27;m getting below error when using consult-buffer. 
 Can anyone see what the problem could be?

 If that is possible, how could I do that?

                              <span>I have an application where, in my domain types, I have an Event which has many Tags and belongs to a single Venue:
  data Event &#x3D; Event { -- more than this but tags :: [EventTag], venue :: Venue, } newtype EventTag &#x3D; EventTag { tagName :: Text } newtype Venue &#x3D; Venue { venueName :: Text } 
 In the database schema, however, I have tables for tags and venues, and a foreign key relation to the events table.
 I had been using hasql for my database interactions, but found it extremely painful, so I switched to persistent, for which I defined the following schema:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; TagRow sql&#x3D;tags name Text UniqueTagName name
 VenueRow sql&#x3D;venues name Text UniqueVenueName name
 EventRow sql&#x3D;events title Text description (Maybe Text) url URL venueId VenueRowId startDate UTCTime endDate UTCTime origination OriginationURI UniqueOriginationURI origination approvedAt UTCTime rejectedAt UTCTime
 EventTag sql&#x3D;event_tags eventId EventRowId tagId TagRowId |] &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 What I&#x27;m not sure how to do, is how to insert non-existent tags and venues, and then insert the events, using persistent, in a relatively efficient way. I had done this previously using hasql as can be seen here, which is quite ugly but did the trick.
 I can think of three approaches with persistent, one is to do something analogous to what I&#x27;m doing above: write the tags, collecting the ids and names in a mapping, do the same with the venues, then stitch all this together when inserting the events. This one I do not know how to do with persistent. The other would be to process the events one at a time, inserting the tags, then fetching them again, doing the same with the venue, and then inserting the event. This one I think I know how to do with persistent. The final one would be to write it all as raw sql and process it that way, which I&#x27;m really not fond of as an idea (and haven&#x27;t looked into).
 Any pointers / help would be much appreciated.

 Have there been any known performance improvements between those GHC releases in unsafe C FFI calls and/or stream fusion?

 I&#x27;m working on a new project using effectful after having not touched effects in a while. I previously used polysemy and it was a pretty good experience.
 Pawel Szulc once again made a nice talk on using an effect system and it gave me a refresher and some other good information: Effectful | Paweł Szulc | Lambda Days 2022 .
 It&#x27;s perfectly possible to just implement only the IO interpreter and test that while developing with effectful, and for a while I did just that.
 However things became more interesting once I wanted to start testing. So here are rambly thoughts I&#x27;ve had bouncing around that others might want to…</span>

                              <span>My level is pretty poor, but I&#x27;ve been told--and seen elsewhere--innumerable times that it&#x27;s a good idea to start working on open source projects.
 I&#x27;m aware of one particularly friendly project called Bevy, which is a game engine written in Rust. They have &quot;good-beginner&quot; issues and are extremely nice in both the comments and in Discord, and are very active in helping newcomers. 
 I&#x27;d like to not jump into projects that aren&#x27;t able to allocate resources to helping beginner programmers on trivial problems. It would be a huge waste of their time and I assume disrupting their workflow. 
 I&#x27;m mostly just wanting to find projects that mostly meet this criteria. Bonus points if there&#x27;s an active discord/slack community. 
 Any sector is fine, since I&#x27;m trying to branch out and learn what I like. Pretty much any subject goes. I&#x27;m more interested in the coding experience/learning the ropes than anything. It&#x27;ll take time to find out what subject I really like. Right now, I have so much fun coding that the project itself rarely matters.
 My only limitation is that my math background is very poor, so a lot of research-based projects are probably too difficult for me.
 Any info would be really welcome. 
 Thanks :)

Is there a way to make the image appear in dark mode? Maybe I just can&#x27;t see it. Is there a setting in the theme json file? I can&#x27;t find one.</span>

Title should read org-bullets, not bullet-mode. Thank you /u/github-alphapapa.
  
Problem &amp; background
  
New install of default emacs GUI (27.1) on a new EOS 7 install.
 
H4 level bullets are rendering differently to previous 27.1 GUI, they are too big.
 
Examples: Tidy H4 stars on old GUI. New, large flowers on current GUI.
 
 Information
  
Emacs version 27.1 for both. GTK+ Versions - Old: 3.22.30 New: 3.24.30
 
Same config file
 
Same font: &quot;Roboto Mono:pixelsize&#x3D;13:foundry&#x3D;pyrs:weight&#x3D;normal:slant&#x3D;normal:width&#x3D;normal:scalable&#x3D;true&quot;
 
Stars render in the &#x27;old&#x27; way if emacs is launched in a terminal using &quot;emacs -nw&quot;. 
 
 Desired resolution
  
Get the H4 bullets to render in the same way as the old GUI.
  
If anybody has encountered the following issue, or has ideas for how to fix it, the help would be much appreciated.

Is the only solution to actually create one of those marker files in it&#x27;s directory? Or can I configure Projectile to allow me to run that function on these files?

                              <span>I&#x27;m struggling to figure out why something isn&#x27;t working on my end as it should be. And now I&#x27;m stuck trying to make sense of the definition of TeX-check-engine. 
 From what I can tell, this function will ask to check the engine only if (but not only if, since there&#x27;s a few other conditions I&#x27;m not listing here) the value of TeX-check-engine-list is set to something other than its default value, presumably to the list of engines required by the file being visited. 
 So here is my question: what is supposed to set the value of that variable? Looking at the docstring, I see that it should depend on what engine is required by the &quot;loaded TeX packages&quot;. But I don&#x27;t see what determines what the loaded TeX packages are, nor how that list is supposed to be updated. 
 (I&#x27;m running into difficulties using emacs -Q after reinstalling auctex etc., so I don&#x27;t see how this could be due to something in my config.)
 If anyone has any pointers, even if not a complete solution, I&#x27;d be curious to know what they are.

                              <span>I am using Emacs 28.2. Here is my code:
 ;;; foo.el (define-minor-mode foo-mode &quot;Foo mode&quot; :lighter &quot; Foo&quot; (message &quot;foo-mode %s in buffer %s&quot; foo-mode (buffer-name))) (defun foo-mode-on () (foo-mode 1)) (define-globalized-minor-mode global-foo-mode foo-mode foo-mode-on) 
 This works like I want.
 emacs -q -l foo.el 
 Then I run these things:
 C-x b *scratch* M-x global-foo-mode C-x b foo C-x b bar C-x b baz 
 I find that all buffers foo, bar and baz have Foo mode enabled. But https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Defining-Minor-Modes.html has got this to tell
  
Globally enabling the mode also affects buffers subsequently created by visiting files, and buffers that use a major mode other than Fundamental mode; but it does not detect the creation of a new buffer in Fundamental mode.
  
But in my case, it did work for fundamental mode buffers too. Why did it work when the documentation says it should not have worked? Or the documentation does not say that and I am misunderstanding something?

 Still a work-in-progress, this theme is the result of tweaks over time to the solarized light core. Readability and comfort are the primary goals here.
 Not quite ready for MELPA, but I thought I&#x27;d share here in case anyone is interested or would like to contribute.

 I am trying to correct a problem with a theme I am using. As you can see, the next character in the list of options is practically invisible.
 But I don&#x27;t have any idea where to start looking. I know the file from which the theme is being loaded, and I can modify it. But there are sooo many definitions that I have no idea which one is the one being used.
 What would be the best way to identify the theme class used by this text?
 (by the way, this problem started with my last update to prelude, which I use. I am also using the leuven theme, which I load after prelude).

                              <span>This has been an issue for a while, and I hope someone can tell me what&#x27;s really going on. I use transient-mark-mode and normally it works great. But once in a while it gets &quot;wedged&quot;, where the region doesn&#x27;t deactivate properly after something that should deactivate it. As a concrete example, if I mark a region and hit delete, the region is removed, but not deactivated. So if I move the point, it expands the region again, leaving the mark where it was. And if I just start typing, I only get the last letter, as each letter replaces the previous. The only way I&#x27;ve found to fix this is to exit emacs and restart it.
 Ideally, I&#x27;d like to figure out what setting gets &quot;bumped&quot; that makes this happen, and prevent it. Failing that, a way to correct it short of not using TMM would be nice. In the worst case, knowing what triggers it so I can maybe avoid it would be better than where I am now.

You are trying to run Emacs configured with the &quot;pure-GTK&quot; interface under the X Window System. That configuration is unsupported and will lead to sporadic crashes during transfer of large selection data. It will also lead to various problems with keyboard input.
  
I think this description is clear enough about what the problem is, but how can I fix it? (I still wish to use gtk.)

 It seems that melpa.org is blacklisted:
 https://mxtoolbox.com/SuperTool.aspx?action&#x3D;blacklist%3a178.128.185.1&amp;run&#x3D;toolpage
 As a consequence I cannot access melpa from my university.
 There is this old thread : https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/iyq75u/my_university_blocks_melpaorg/ three years ago.
 Anyone knows why is melpa still blacklisted ?
 Is there a mirror available ?

                              <span>Hi everyone, 
 I&#x27;ve recently updated my emacs to v29 --with-native-comp and I noticed that now when I do C-h f -&gt; consult-grep for example I&#x27;m getting the doc for that function as expected but the link to the source code where the function is defined leads to my packages.el file where I use use-package to install consult. 
 I just checked and I have similar issue with projectile functions too.
 the message says:
 projectile-grep is an autoloaded interactive native-compiled Lisp function in ‘../../packages.el’
 There is no such issue with variables defined by projectile or consult. The issue is there for some packages and for some not. For example orderless functions have no such issue and the doc points to orderless.el as expected. php-mode is fine. Magit has the issue. 
 Have you noticed anything like that in your setup? Is it native-comp related? Is there any way to guide Emacs so it knows where definitions are? It seems like Emacs knows that let&#x27;s say projectile-grep is there, it knows the docstring as well. But for some reason it just points to wrong file. 
 Just for some additional info: - I&#x27;m on MacOS - I use emacs-plus@29 compiled with brew - I use use-package with straight
 Any idea on how to solve it is highly appreciated. Thanks

                              <span>My idea is simple: I want to use emacs as a cross platform window manager: I want to have the same setup for managing windows, regardless of the operating system I am using. One simple idea is to send the windows to emacs and let emacs manage windows, that way I can use the same config everywhere.
 For example, I want emacs to be able to resize photoshop or final cut pro.
 I haven&#x27;t found anything on how to do that on Windows, Mac and ChromeOS.
 Does something already exist to do so?

                              <span>Running emacs v 30 in the GUI on Ubuntu in Windows 11 WSL, text that I kill is transferred to the Windows clipboard and I can paste into Windows apps. But the same isn&#x27;t true for text that I copy. So I have to kill then yank, which is a nuisance. I can rebind M-w but is there a workaround I&#x27;m not aware of? Fixes online seem to be about running X in windows but since killed text is transferred fine I don&#x27;t know why that would be necessary...

                              <span>I recently encountered this error on Ubuntu when trying to execute Jupyter source blocks:
  
start-process: Searching for program: No such file or directory, python
  
I tried adding (setq python-shell-interpreter &quot;/path/to/python3&quot;) to my init.el and setting my environment variables within Emacs and all of the other suggestions I found online, but still kept receiving the error. I even tried creating an alias for python in my .bashrc and calling emacs from the command line. 
 I finally solved the problem by creating a symlink to python: ln -s /usr/bin/python3 /usr/bin/python Hopefully if someone else encounters this issue and searches for a solution, they find this post and it works for them as well.

                              <span>I have a noticeable lag of at least 2 seconds when switching between Emacs frames.
 It only happens in combination of pdf-tools frames. I have the profiler report but I am not sure if it is orderless, vertico or some problem with completion. And the weird thing is that there is no pdf-tools reference at all. 
 Any ideas?
 Side question: Should I just drop pdf-tools from my packages? I have a love hate relationship with it, on one side it is very useful to have all of my pdf files in Emacs, but at the same time scrolling is not smooth and it has a lot of quirks like zoom reset when changing pages or getting stuck on a page. :/

 ivy/swiper, Org-mode, Json-mode, Vterm, Python-mode with lsp, Dired and wdired
 Sadly, I use vscode for most coding tasks however I don&#x27;t spend that much time coding these days.
 What packages do the cool kids use theses days?

                              <span>I have a global, dynamic list of common lisp structs, called &#x60;run_stack&#x60;. I would like a nice way of viewing it. To be specific:
 ​
 - I run a command (&#x60;display_run_stack&#x60; or something), and a new window opens with &#x60;run_stack&#x60; displayed in a special readonly buffer. Each entry of &#x60;run_stack&#x60; should be one line.
 - Each element of &#x60;run_stack&#x60; is a struct with a &#x60;uuid&#x60; field. When point is over a given entry, pressing Enter calls a function (&#x60;goto_uuid&#x60;) on that uuid.
 ​
 The thing I have in mind is something like Org Agenda. Any advice how to program this? Kind of a noob wrt emacs application programming. Not sure where to even start. Example code from some other project would be great.

                              <span>Hello all! Some time ago I published my very first couple of packages, both of them related to note-taking. Having essentially used them for a rather long time, they have proven to be very useful to me and I wanted to share them with you.
 I did not want to write here when I published them, to try and fix any bugs or problems that would arise by their new bundled form, but they seem to be working properly so... here they are:
  
KLP is a general package, focusing solely on making the consistent naming as easy as possible, with a note_category_title.org, template. This allows for arbitrary categories to be easily defined, built and search through. Some use cases for it would be cheatsheet files, easily accessible notes on cli tools ... generally static notes.
 Org-lectures. Now this one, even though it shares quite a lot of elements with KLP (it was developed almost simultaneously) allows for the easy creation and management of courses and lectures files. By assigning a couple of keybindings and complementing it with a package like CDLatex or Yasnippets, a really fun workflow was created that allows me to take (in real time) lecture notes for my university courses.
  
Feel free to try them!
 P.S. My experience in writing packages is limited, so any feedback would be more than welcome (this is the reason why I decided to post here after all, :P). Literate programming files also exist in their respective repos, allowing for easier understanding of these simple packages.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve had the idea for this post kicking around in my head for a while and decided to write it out. This is written as a sort of guide for someone who recently started learning about functors, and understand how they work in some basic cases like lists and Maybes, but wants to learn a bit more in depth about other kinds of functors. I&#x27;ve put in some more advanced stuff as well which I thought was interesting but that you can safely ignore for now if you&#x27;re actually just learning about functors.
 Most people on this subreddit are probably plenty familiar with functors already, but hopefully this can still help you think about functors or maybe help you help someone who is just learning about functors themself.

                              <span>I have searched online, but this is the best I could come up with, I&#x27;m not sure if it is correct, please correct these definitions.
  
seq :: a → b → b
 Evaluates first argument to weak head normal form (WHNF), when that is completed only then the second argument is returned (ensure arg1 is completed before proceeding with arg2).
 
pseq :: a → b → b
 
 Evaluates first argument to WHNF however does so in parallel using spark, when that is done the second argument is evaluated..
  
par :: a → b → b
  
Evaluates first and second arg in parallel, with hope that arg1 will be fully evaluated by the time its result is needed. It is useful in cases where the evaluation of first arg is expensive and is acceptable to delay its result until later.
 ​
 Now consider this quicksort algorithm:
 import Control.Parallel (par, pseq) 
 parSort (x:xs) &#x3D; greater ‘par‘ (lesser ‘pseq‘ (lesser ++ x:greater)) 
 where lesser &#x3D; parSort [y | y &#x3D; x] parSort _ &#x3D; []
 It will be almost as (in)efficient as the sequential version:
 sort :: (Ord a) &#x3D;&gt; [a] -&gt; [a] sort (x:xs) &#x3D; lesser ++ x:greater
 where lesser &#x3D; sort [y | y &#x3D; x] sort _ &#x3D; []
 Why is that?

                              <span>Here I defined Service1 with one method with default value:
 trait Service1 { def summarize(arg1: Int, arg2: List[Int] &#x3D; Nil): Int } 
 And this is how I try to test it:
 class Service2(service1: Service1) { def use: Int &#x3D; service1.summarize(0) } object Service2 { def layer: URLayer[Has[Service1], Has[Service2]] &#x3D; (new Service2(_)).toLayer } @mockable[Service1] object MockService1 object tests extends DefaultRunnableSpec { override def spec: ZSpec[TestEnvironment, Any] &#x3D; suite(&quot;example test&quot;)(testM(&quot;fails&quot;) { assertM( ZIO .service[Service2] .map(_.use) .provideLayer(MockService1.Summarize(equalTo(0, Nil), value(0)).toLayer &gt;&gt;&gt; Service2.layer) )(equalTo(0)) }) } 
 Execution failes with this error:
 - example test - fails - could not find a matching expectation - invalid call to MockService1.Summarize.default.2 expected MockService1.Summarize with arguments equalTo((0,List())) - unsatisfied expectations MockService1.Summarize with arguments equalTo((0,List())) 
 I suppose, that creating mock by hand (not using macro) will fix the issue, but is there any other way?

(I want to distribute the single html file.) I can generate base64 files and copy them into the org-file but this is a total hack. I am probably missing something basic. I would appreciate any advice.

 (I tried looking on google and asking chat-gpt, but there is only about changing the value to t to enable inserting one newline).

 I had to sprinkle in some more lazy until it didn&#x27;t produce stack overflows anymore.
  
Edit 1: When I write lazy val sum the forward reference error goes away and an infinite-loop warning appears. When I write that: &#x3D;&gt; Parser[T2] instead of that: Parser[T2], that warning goes away as well. I&#x27;m going to report back and see if it works with an implementation!
 The problem is that I don&#x27;t really know what I&#x27;m doing. I just understand that in Haskell, everything is lazy and in Java, everything is eager evaluation, besides stuff like &amp;&amp;, which I guess works &quot;lazily&quot; in Java as …</span>

                              <span>Hi all. Long time lurker here but first time poster.
 I thought this community might be interested in my dissertation. It’s an evaluation of effect systems / design patterns in pure functional languages, from first principles. It operates at the intersection of the academic literature and real world software development. Haskell was the most obvious language for this task, so I used a small program involving four key effects: environment, state, errors and I/O.
 A lot of my time was spent trying to understand the history of the domain and drawing out the most important criteria for working programmers. In the end I settled on: expressiveness, modularity, extensibility, ergonomics and performance. These are the basis for the comparison.
 I don’t expect anyone to have the time to read the whole thing, so this post summarises some of the key take aways: https://www.dantb.dev/posts/dissertation
 I also compiled a list of my favourite resources (there should be a few familiar names from this subreddit… 🙂): https://www.dantb.dev/posts/effects-bibliography
 This evaluation may be useful for people wanting to understand the trade offs involved in selecting tools and techniques in pure functional languages. This was one of my personal goals for the project, as someone who has used pure FP in Scala for several years but never went deep on the theory before. I saw a bit of a gap in the literature regarding the application of these design patterns from the perspective of a software developer, which is what I’m most interested in.
 The structure is broadly chronological and a lot of it is probably old news for experienced Haskellers. With that in mind, I&#x27;d highlight Chapter 7 which contrasts extensible effects with the earlier approaches.
 Comments are open 🙂

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been learning Haskell for almost a year now, and I feel like I can confidently write programs (not quite to the extent of my old imperative programming languages, but I used those for a lot longer) and I&#x27;m looking to contribute to some open source repositories so I can improve further and give back to this amazing community. I can work my way around a large codebase, but generally I would prefer to work on a more modest sized one if possible. Thanks!

                              <span>Hi I use emacs as my window manager and I&#x27;ve been able to define commands to launch applications like thunar or firefox 
 but when I try to use the code provided to launch xterm it crashes my emacs and freezes it up. It&#x27;s the same deal for a few other terminal emulators ive tried. Unsure why. when I use helm-run-external-command I&#x27;m able to launch without problem but its a litttle roundabout and creates it&#x27;s own buffer which is annoying

 Over time this has become a long file with 100s of entries. The issue i have is finding a specific note.
 I spend far too much time looking for a specific note. 
 How do you organise and search your journal with org mode?

 I am trying to write something that will send notification . I have the exact time when it starts 4/8/2023 at 18:47:10 ( lets call this A.1) and after 1hr40min51sec or 6051 seconds it moves to A.2 than A.3, A4.A5 and last one is A.6 after this ends it goes to B.1 and so on . Can I have emacs send me notifications every time it moves from A to B but also when it moves from A.1 to A2 etc .. I am looking at https://cl-cookbook.sourceforge.net/index.html and trying to understand what i need to use for this to work. Thank you

                              <span>I use emacs as a daemon. The following code should set Fira Code to be the font:
  (let ((default-font (pcase system-type (&#x27;gnu/linux &quot;Liberation Mono 16&quot;) (&#x27;darwin &quot;Avenir 16&quot;) ((or &#x27;windows-nt &#x27;cygwin) &quot;Corbel 16&quot;) (_ &quot;Verdana 16&quot;)))) (cond ((find-font (font-spec :name &quot;Fira Code&quot;)) (add-to-list &#x27;default-frame-alist &#x27;(font . &quot;Fira Code 16&quot;))) ((find-font (font-spec :name &quot;DejuVu Sans Mono&quot;)) (add-to-list &#x27;default-frame-alist &#x27;(font . &quot;DejuVu Sans Mono 16&quot;))) (t (add-to-list &#x27;default-frame-alist &#x60;(font . ,default-font))) ) ) 
 However, instead, Liberation Mono is set to be the font for some reason. I thought that find-font would return a list if a font is found, which is truthy, but that doesn&#x27;t appear to be the case. And yes, I&#x27;m sure that Fira Code is installed properly:
 (find-font (font-spec :name &quot;Fira Code&quot;)) -&gt; # 
 The output below the elisp snippet is what I get when I evaluate it.

                              <span>I use wsd-mode via websequencediagrams.com to create professional-looking sequence diagrams from a simple and easy to read markup language. Very happy with it! Way faster to create and edit than draw.io.
 Is there a similar Emacs package to convert from text to professional-looking directed diagrams like decision trees?
 I searched Google, Reddit and Emacs SE and the best I encountered was:
  
graph.el - converts a difficult to parse elisp lists to a similarly difficult to read text diagram.
 a bunch of packages for converting org docs to diagrams of various sorts, none of which were quite suitable for making arbitrary directed diagrams.
  
My hope is my google-fu has failed me and there is a great package I&#x27;ve missed. Also open to non-Emacs suggestions that could be integrated into Emacs with some work.

 What if before compiling emacs from source, we somehow integrate my init.el into the sources. The resulting binary will have my custom configuration (+ maybe decrease initial load time).
 Is this thought correct/rational? What are the pros and cons?

 I&#x27;m super excited to announce the release of Yampa 0.14.2! This release also comes with accompanying releases of many related projects: yampa-test (0.14.2), simple-affine-space (0.2.1), yampa-gloss (0.2.1), Space Invaders (0.14.2), and Haskanoid (0.1.6).
 Yampa is a fast, elegant Functional Reactive Programming implementation. Yampa prides itself in being a long-standing community project. It has now been around for 20 years!!! See https://github.com/ivanperez-keera/yampa#features for details on Yampa&#x27;s features.
 This release mainly addresses styling issues. All library code now conforms to the main rules of the style guide we follow (which is publicly documented). We&#x27;ve also addressed other minor maintenance issues, like compatibility with new versions of GHC and some de…</span>

                              <span>static-ls is a low memory language server for Haskell that serves as an alternative to hls with less functionality by using statically generated information. It is intended for (Highly recommend hls instead if you aren&#x27;t having these issues):
  
enterprise sized projects that are either too large or make extensive use of template Haskell leading to high memory usage for hls
 for machines with too little memory where hls can end up using too much memory
  
and provides a small subset of haskell language server&#x27;s functionality namely:
  
Type on hover
 Find references
 Go-to definition
  
Future features I&#x27;d like to implement include: - Haddock documentation on hover from interface files - Diagnostics from ghcid - Autocomplete in scope from hiedb
 It has been tested it on a codebase with over 180,000 LOC and works relatively stably. With a combination of ghcid, an hiedb filewatcher and the -fdefer-type-errors flag you can get pretty solid IDE behavior. Currently only ghc 9.4.4 is supported but happy to personally help people set this up if interested!
 Any feedback is appreciated!

 generic-persistence is a Haskell persistence layer for relational databases. The approach relies on GHC.Generics. The actual database access is provided by the HDBC library.
 New things in this release:
  
A query DSL
 Connection pooling
 A fail safe API that uses Either to safely return all database runtime errors
  
changes:
  
all retrieve* functions have been renamed to select*
 the function retrieveAll was removed. Selection of all entries os a table can now be done with select conn allEntries
  
All new features and changes are documented in the tutorial.
 I&#x27;ve also created a sample project that demonstrates how to build a Servant REST service using generic-persistence for database access.
 All Feedback, bug reports and pull requests are welcome!

                              <span>Hi. Pretty new to emacs and programming in general and I’m wondering if there’s an inbuilt package or something to help me relearning maths (pretty much forgotten all of it since we are taught to pass exams and not taught how to learn) 
 Thanks.

                              <span>I use doom emacs and am having an issue tracking down a key binding.
 While in insert mode, I like to use C-h as a binding for backspace since it is more ergonomic. However, while in org-mode, C-h seems to be bound to org-beginning-of-line.
 In order to find out why C-h was behaving this way, here&#x27;s what I did:
  
Open a .org file
 Enter insert mode
 Type M-SPC h k C-h
 This takes me to the documentation for org-beginning-of-line
  
Here&#x27;s where it gets weird:
 Under &quot;Key Bindings&quot;, it only has:
 org-mode-map C-a org-mode-map s- 
 ... no binding for C-h! But that&#x27;s the key I pressed to get to this help page!
 Why does C-h not show up here? Where did this binding even come from? How do I override it?
 I&#x27;ve tried doing:
 (map! :after org :map org-mode-map :i &quot;C-h&quot; #&#x27;backward-delete-char) 
 ... but this doesn&#x27;t seem to override the binding.

 I’ve been using emacs for a few years now about 3 years. I don’t really configure it much. I use vanilla Emacs.
 But I want to understand the power of emacs and how I can take advantage of it. I was wondering if some of you can explain to me the power of emacs? Thanks

 #+begin_src jupyter-python :results file :file ~/image.jpg import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt a &#x3D; np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) b &#x3D; np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) plt.plot(a, b) plt.show() #+end_src #+RESULTS: :RESULTS: #+attr_org: :width 547 [[file:~/image.jpg]] :END: 
 will not display an image.
 The problem occurs when using pandoc or org-export. Anyone have any idea how I can fix this?

                              <span>I use zero width spaces as an escape character for emphasis markers. I know it is recommended to use org-entities instead, but (1) I have tried using entities like \ast but they do not appear correctly on export (2) I&#x27;d like to use the actual characters rather than the entity. Does anyone have a function that strips zero width spaces from org documents on export to latex &amp; html?

 I&#x27;m newer to functional programming and use Scala3.2.0 version.
 now this code can&#x27;t be compiled and it prompts me: &quot;kinds not the same&quot;
 What&#x27;s the mistake in this code, and what is the correct code?

 trait Functor[F[_]]: extension[A] (fa: F[A]) def map[B](f: A &#x3D;&gt; B): F[B] opaque type Reader[-R, +A] &#x3D; R &#x3D;&gt; A given[R]: Functor[Reader[R, _]] with extension[A] (fa: Reader[R, A]) def map[B](f: A &#x3D;&gt; B): Reader[R, B] &#x3D; ???

                              <span>Hi Zettlers,
this is a new idea of mine that I don&#x27;t understand well yet:
The value of a position in chess consists of its probability of victory for the player. Moves are evaluated according to how they affect this probability of victory.
We can apply this to our thinking: knowledge-based value creation consists of enriching data, information, and pre-existing knowledge with value-giving properties. Value-giving properties include: Accuracy/Completeness, Reliability, and Usefulness.
An evaluation of thinking would look like this:1

                              <span>Hello,
 I&#x27;m kind of a newbie on configuring emacs, so here is the context:
 I decided to install cmake-ide. It seems that rtags came along with the former. Fine, but I also decided to use the vertico package. It also seems that rtags has a support for Helm, but from what I understand, Helm and and Vertico fall under the same category of packages and therefore I can only have one of them.
 I found this friendly tutorial on how to install cmake-ide and I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with the customization used in it. I thought that by omit the helm line in the config scope and by changing (setq rtags-display-result-backend &#x27;helm) to vertico would workout with my configuration, but it failed.
 So my question is: is it possible to combine vertico and rtags to work simultaneously?

                              <span>I want specific buffers (in my case Clojure REPL related) always appear on the right side which can be done by adding a set of values to display-buffer-alist:
 (add-to-list &#x27;display-buffer-alist &#x60;(,(rx bos (or &quot;*cider-repl&quot; &quot;*nrepl-server&quot; &quot;*cider-test-report*&quot; &quot;*cider-error&quot; &quot;*cider-result&quot;)) (display-buffer-reuse-window display-buffer-in-direction) (direction . right) (window . root) (dedicated . nil) ;; (window-preserve-size . (t . t)) ;; (window-width . 0.30) )) 
 Now, you can see that I have a couple of things commented because they don&#x27;t appear to work. it looks like I&#x27;m not using the right combination of display-buffer functions. Or maybe something else is wrong.
 What I want is:
  
I want buffers to appear initially on the right side with specific width (0.30 of the frame)
 If I change the position of the window, e.g., move it to the left side, I want Emacs to remember my choice, and when I bury the buffer and pop to it again, I want it to come from the left. Currently, it always pops on the right side
 The same for the width. If I change the width - I want Emacs to preserve it and the next time I pop the buffer, it should not resize the window.
  
Can someone help me tame display-buffer so it works as I want? Thank you!

                              <span>With as much of the following:
  
Statically-typed
 Generates self-contained binaries
 Not Go
 Has a garbage collector
 Not lazy nor extremely aggressive about immutability
 Packaged in most common distros, such as Debian or RHEL
 Good ecosystem for writing CLI tools (nice argument parsers, good support for running other programs)
  
But the on-topic requirement is that it has a great experience in Emacs. As a statically typed language, table stakes is good completion. Also it should not lag Emacs. Not requiring too much fiddling would be nice.
 I think nothing checks all boxes, so I&#x27;m just looking to tick most..

                              <span>I use the standalone ranger file manager on my system outside of Emacs and I&#x27;m used to the various commands and keybindings. I&#x27;ve been using ranger.el for a while to replicate this experience, but unfortunately I keep hitting a bug regarding bookmarks, which I think is related to the enhanced bookmark-plus/bmkp package I use to manage bookmarks. It also seems to get stuck after a while, with multiple copies of the same tab/pane opening if I keep hitting q to close ranger. Additionally ranger.el doesn&#x27;t look like it&#x27;s being actively maintained at the moment, 
  
 I&#x27;ve tried using dirvish, which has the added benefit of being recently updated. The previews seem to work nice, but (I realize this sounds crazy) there seems to be too much going on feature-wise. I keep trying to have the ranger like view with three panels, but dirvish seems to switch to a more standard dired like view despite my config. On top of this, there isn&#x27;t a nice C-h to hide dotfiles and I occasionally get a Selected deleted buffer error if I want to look at a directory I&#x27;ve killed.
  
 Does anyone have a smooth ranger.el or dirvish setup to share, or ways of overcoming the problems I mentioned above? Or a different way to browse files that&#x27;s more robust?

 I installed the first tutor I happened to find, called Monkeytype and do like it.
 The main plus is it has a nice minimalist UI where it shows my progress pretty clearly. The main minus is there&#x27;s no way to open a text file and automatically start tutorial using it. I think it would be pretty easy to script that kind of addition.

 I created a small package for showing overlays in Swift-code/Elisp code. (defun and cl-defun in emacs lisp has basic support too).This is regex-based so it&#x27;s not 100% accurate. But it looks cool.

 Feel free to improve it.
 Swift (SourceKit-LSP Doesn&#x27;t support Code-lenses, so if you have support for that for your language you&#x27;re better off keeping you current solution)
 Enjoy!

                              <span>Hi,
 I work frequently with a (proprietary) application that uses the .Net standard serialiser. I often manually edit these files, as they also contain a DSL embedded in some of the content, that I find easier to tweak this way rather than via the application itself.
 I was considering developing a small prog mode to assist me with some or all of the following features:
  
hide most of the XML boilerplate (but retain the structure)
 display the DSL code, ideally with syntax highlighting. This code is embedded within two XML elements.
 where multiple code elements exist in an XML file, provide some mechanism to display this in a natural way
  
I&#x27;d be amazed if something similar hadn&#x27;t been done previously, so I&#x27;m looking for an example or two that will provide me with a flavour of what is possible.
 Thanks

                              <span>Hi, I usually don&#x27;t post on Reddit, so I apologize in advance if I make some obvious mistakes. I&#x27;ve already asked similar question here on a different subreddit, but I was wondering if there are better solutions.
 ​
 I previously owned a Mac Book 2020 and used Emacs for editing texts. I really liked that the OS X had a global/system wide shortcut that allowed cursor move/act like in Emacs (e.g. C-f, C-b, C-n, C-p C-a, C-e, C-k). For example, I could use the Emacs move for browsers (Chrome/Firefox), File Manager, etc.
 However, I recently had to return my Mac, and purchased a Steam Deck which has a Arch Linux like OS called SteamOS, which does not have the Emacs movements enabled globally/system wide.
 I tried to configure cursor movements/actions similar to the Emacs moves via KDE Custom Shorcut (details of how I configured can be seen here), but this solution does conflict with several applications, and I have a feeling that there might be a better solution.
 By any chance, does anyone know how to configure non-Mac OS (in my case SteamOS/Arch Linux) to have shortcuts similar to the Emacs in a global/system wide manner?

                              <span>Hey.
 Why is agenda not editable?
 Around a third of my workflow is going through filtered notes in a table and adding various things. This is very dynamic - I might want to suddenly have another column in the table (or remove it, or resize it), to add more information, or to not have something clutter the view.
 So far, it seems the agenda is very &quot;set in stone&quot;, and I am going to be unable to do things on-the-fly. Only possible to spend time preparing a view, then use and re-use it.
 Is orgmode really this unflexible?

                              <span>Hello
 I am using org-mode and org-attach via doom emacs. Whenever I have made notes and tried to attach something using either org-download-screenshot or org-download-clipboard, by default the heading has an &quot;ATTACH&quot; tag signifying that there is an attachment in this heading. Example shown below.

 Now when I try to export this to GFM using pandoc, this is what it does
 ​
 https://preview.redd.it/2keyfcri9esa1.png?width&#x3D;1110&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;57aa82093888ea635644fcedc5be3eaf376f21f4
 Essentially it exports the ATTACH tag out. I have a couple of questions.
  
What&#x27;s the purpose behind the &quot;ATTACH&quot; tag? The reason I ask this is because I can easily set org-attach-auto-tag to nil and this tag is not attached and therefore not exported. But does it have other consequences that I might not be aware of. Reading the documentation, it doesn&#x27;t appear so, but I am then left to wonder why this would be the default behavior.
 Is there a way to keep the org-attach-auto-tag to the default value of &quot;ATTACH&quot; but not have it exported. I tried setting the EXPORT_EXCLUDE_TAGS to ATTACH but then of course the whole content doesn&#x27;t get exported.
  
Thanks for your help.

                              <span>I was looking for a workflow where I&#x27;d paste images from clipboard all the time. I figured I could do it with the org-download package like so (with use-package):
 (use-package org-download :ensure t ;; this makes sure the thing is loaded if not present :init (setq org-download-method &#x27;attach) :config (add-hook &#x27;dired-mode-hook &#x27;org-download-enable) :bind (&quot;C-y&quot; . org-download-clipboard)) 
 Which works, until I try to paste text. Emacs freezes completely, and is unusable.
 I realized this also happens if I just call org-download-clipboard directly without a shortcut, when there is no pic in the immediate clipboard.
 So my question is: am I doing something wrong? Is there a simple solution here without having to use different shortcuts?
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>The reason I say viable is that it&#x27;s always of course possible. Knowing people can always land you a job and so can incredible luck.
 Often times with niche languages, it&#x27;s easy to get a job despite the total amount of jobs being limited. If no one is applying, the competition is pretty weak or nonexistent. 
 I&#x27;ve seen that many jobs in Haskell are in the healthcare sector. It seems to be pretty standard enterprise stuff that likely was done with Java at some point in the past. 
 Are these jobs, or Haskell jobs (non-research) in general competitive?
 If you were rating the difficulty of getting a job in Haskell as a self-taught programmer on a scale of 1-10 (with 1 being a webdev at a no-name website and 10 being a FAANG job), where would you put Haskell jobs?

                              <span>I feel suddently an idiot that I used to code like this to map over a list
 map (+1) [1,2,3,4] 
 Then I felt it is more looking Python doing such
 [ (1 + x) | x  [1,2,3,4] 
 I used to read functor /applicative/monad ref a lot , coud you guys comment my understanding is right on &#x60;Functor&#x60;
 fmap :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; f a -&gt; f b 
 fmap is just a funciton that :
  
describe how to extract &#x60;a&#x60; from the container &#x60;f-1&#x60;
 then run function (a -&gt; b), to get &#x60;b&#x60;
 then describe how to plug back &#x60;b&#x60; to container &#x60;f-2&#x60; ( f-2 doesn&#x27;t have to be same with f-1)
  
The key is : on different types, the effect of fmap is describling how to extract parameter and how plug back the result to a container (maybe a new container with some state change as well ) ?

 I’m a new student to programming and I have exams in a little over a month’s time but since I’m more of a science student most of the concepts aren’t linking as easily to me as compared to the rest of the students. Is there any advice or anything I could do to improve within the next month so I can pass this course? I also do understand the answers when I’m doing questions but it’s just writing and coming up with the functions that is the hard part. 
 Thank you in advance!

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;d like to support a couple of Emacs maintainers but I&#x27;m not sure to whom and how much.
 For example I can choose the maintainers of my favourite packages and transfer some money on a regular basis. Is it okay to support many maintainers with less money or should I support few maintainers with more money? Or should I support FSF in general?
 I&#x27;m thinking of $50 per month. So, should I give 10 maintainers $5 per month or 5 maintainers $10?
 I will find an answer for myself but I&#x27;m interesting of how do you handle it.
 Thanks in advance

                              <span>I&#x27;m using Emacs 28 with tree-sitter.el. I&#x27;m trying to extract import-statements from C sources, and fail miserably.
 I can see the node tree using tree-sitter-debug-mode. But when playing around with queries - either interactively with tree-sitter-query-builder or with code (see below) - I don&#x27;t get any results.
 My code looks like this, and runs:
  (tsc-query-matches (tsc-make-query tree-sitter-require &#x27;c) [(preproc_include)]) (tsc-root-node tree-sitter-tree) #&#x27;ts--buffer-substring-no-properties) 
 The result is  [(0 . []) (0 . []) (0 . []) (0 . []) (0 . []) (0 . [])] 
 Which makes sense given the actual 6 include statements I have in the source file. But apparently no actual contents are extracted. Any suggestions?

                              <span>Hey.
 I&#x27;m just getting started with emacs, and I can&#x27;t even really start because of errors. Please help me stay here.
 I tried the debian package. It is bugged to say the least, and I found out quite quickly (see https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/cdei4p/failed_to_download_gnu_archive_bad_request/)I decided to install a newer version, as described by emacswiki (ganneff.de)https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsSnapshotAndDebian
 ​
 When apt was installing it, it would throw a much of eager-macro-expansion failure lines, something like
 Eager macro-expansion failure: (wrong-number-of-arguments (3 . 4) 5) 
 When running it, everything seemed fine, but, when I open a .org file, it throws
 (New file) File mode specification error: (error Eager macro-expansion failure: (wrong-number-of-arguments (3 . 4) 2)) 
 It does not do this if I run it with emacs -Q.
 Someone with a similar issue was https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/74421/eager-macro-expansion-failure-message-when-starting-emacs-28-2-from-the-mac-te , however, there is no fix there that worked for me
 HOME&#x3D;/tmp emacs 
 ^^ This still produces the error, even with an empty tmp.
 sudo apt remove --autoremove emacs emacs-common emacs-gtk 
 ^^ I did run this before installing the new one.
 Any advice will be appreciated. Thank you.
 ​
 EDIT: I tried deleting everything again, and installed the snap package. Same issue. There must be something leftover I&#x27;m guessing from those past emacs.

 I want to be able to insert links to all org-roam nodes that contain a certain tag. Is there a way to do this natively or do I need a custom Elisp function for it?
 Does anyone use this functionality who can share the code?

                              <span>I works on windows11&#x27;s native emacs 28.2 and run into an amusing but confused thing with org-babel.
 When I set &quot;sh&quot; as header, something wonderful happens:

 It&#x27;s a bash environment, when change &quot;sh&quot; to &quot;shell&quot;, it print a cmd.exe environment:
 https://preview.redd.it/n89e2r9gw6sa1.png?width&#x3D;673&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;af93c0f94bba7023ac95e67126d154f9a4d9602d
 I did not change the variable shell-file-name:
 https://preview.redd.it/ccmf77uqw6sa1.png?width&#x3D;938&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;9794eefc5cd6dc32158641d99ba7e2788587c345
 additionally not add &quot;sh&quot; to &quot;org-babel-load-languages&quot;.
 ​
 Any variables could determine which shell it invoke?
 The &quot;sh&quot; is what I desire, but I don&#x27;t know why it works？

 The rest is also control
 Is there anything I could do to fix this?

                              <span>prettychart provides an easy way to view and create charts from ghci. In conjunction with a new release of chart-svg, it provides a means to rapidly visualize and analyse numerical data. For those of you who enjoy live coding or have lots of quick and dirty data analytics to slog through, it&#x27;s worth trying out.

                              <span>Just out of curiosity, I started looking for a usable haskell system for dos (MS-DOS or Free DOS). It is mentioned in several places that there were dos versions of hugs or hbc, but all the links (many pointint to universities FTPs) are broken. Some are so obscure that even archive.org did not deign to make a copy. 
 I found the source code of hbc for linux. Attemps to compile it with djgpp failed.
 So is there somewhere one can get a dos version of haskell these days?

                              <span>How has your week been? What are your plans for the coming week? Tell us about the state of you zettelkasting journey.
My week has been busy with medical issues that prevented me from making many new notes. I feel good now. 
I got my first two essays back from the professor in my food writing class, and I feel good about them. I am of a different generation than everyone else in the class, including the instructor. There are a couple of writers in the class that seem to be able to write a first draft of a &#x27;writing prompt exercise&#x27; that is far more polished than my &#x27;shitty first drafts&#x27;. They are modeling a skill that I aspire to.
While journaling this morning, I found a gem in an entry from one year ago today. It&#x27;s very meta, and this is all very circular.

  
Zettelkasting and journaling are like workouts. You have a busy day ahead. Why journal? Journaling is not just another task. At first, you stumble with form.  Like when you are a beginner at weight training, you struggle with repeatedly getting to the gym. You think it will help your physical health, but at first, you feel sore, tight, and tired, not at all the pinnacle of health. Eventually, if you stick with it, you might find a coach that helps with form, you might set up your environment so going to the gym feels natural, you might start to feel strength building, and you&#x27;ve started progressing on the climb to physical health.
All these weight training actions can be applied to zettelkasting and journaling. They train your mental health in the same way exercise trains your physical health. It&#x27;s a slow process at first. You can&#x27;t see the improvements day to day or even week to week. Improvement only comes with consistency.


I think I&#x27;ll move this gem from my journal to my ZK. I have a couple of relevant notes on the mental health benefits of journaling.

                              <span>Getting into this ecosystem to see if it&#x27;s better than other note taking tools. I need the possibility to use something similar to column view.
 Why are the horizontals disconnected?
 I was following this tutorial https://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-column-view-tutorial.htmlthey end up with it looking like an actual table at one point:
 Connected table
 What gives? Am I doing something wrong? I tried googling to no avail.
 Thanks in advance.
 [EDIT] After using yantar92&#x27;s advice and folding before/after, I managed to get closer to the expected look:
 Space?
 But there is still space between them, although now it&#x27;s not really a breaking issue.

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying out github copilot with this package: https://github.com/zerolfx/copilot.el, configured like this:
 (use-package copilot :straight (:host github :repo &quot;zerolfx/copilot.el&quot; :files (&quot;dist&quot; &quot;*.el&quot;)) :ensure t :bind (:map copilot-mode-map (&quot;&quot; . my/copilot-tab) (&quot;s-n&quot; . copilot-next-completion) (&quot;s-p&quot; . copilot-previous-completion) (&quot;s-w&quot; . copilot-accept-completion-by-word) (&quot;s-l&quot; . copilot-accept-completion-by-line)) :config (defun my/copilot-tab () (interactive) (or (copilot-accept-completion) (indent-for-tab-command))) :hook (prog-mode . copilot-mode)) 
 I had been using corfu and cape for completions with Tabnine (another code analyzer thing.) After disabling these I get the expected suggestions from copilot, appearing as grayed out code that I can accept with .
 I&#x27;d like to get the sort of experience shown in the gif at the zerolfx/copilot.el github page. Short completions pop up in an overlay - I don&#x27;t know if they are multiple suggestions from copilot or coming from another backend - and copilot suggestions appear in gray for acceptance.
 But if I re-enable corfu/cape/Tabnine I only see the overlaid completions, and don&#x27;t get copilot suggestions.
 I don&#x27;t have a good understanding of how corfu does it&#x27;s thing or how I can integrate copilot&#x27;s suggestions.
 How should I progress?

 I want to add my own commands to projectile-commander and I have the following in my init.el. However if do require &#x27;projectile it will cause my projectile-switch-project-action to reset to default. However I need to do require &#x27;projectile else I will get the following error when evaling init.el Symbol&#x27;s function definition is void: def-projectile-commander-method
 Why am I getting this error and what is the correct way to setup commands using use-package and projectile?

                              <span>Sometimes, I see people use a combination of use-package and require for third-party packages. For example, I was browsing through aboabo&#x27;s Github repo, and he uses use-package for clj-refactor and require for flycheck-clj-kondo. Is there a general rule of thumb for when to use use-package vs require?

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I am currently using evil and corfu, but I want to configure such that pressing a single escape will invoke corfu-quit when its UI is active (because pressing &quot;C-g&quot; is harder).
 The problem: even after
 elisp (define-key corfu-map [escape] #&#x27;corfu-quit) ;; yes, I think that won&#x27;t be usable in terminal Emacs but (kbd &quot;ESC&quot;) will ;; complicate a bunch of other &quot;M-&quot; keys 
 In evil insert state, pressing ESC will always invoke evil-normal-state even when corfu&#x27;s UI is displaying. Thus the above snippet is fine without evil, otherwise the key will bring me back to normal state without discarding the popup completion list.
 Can someone tell me how to take over evil in some circumstances such as the above?

 The redundant info could be remove from WindowsTerminal by setting &quot;powershell.exe -nologo&quot;.
 but &quot;shell-file-name&quot; is a filename variable, suffix with “-nologo&quot; not work.

 How could remove the start info.

                              <span>For instance I made some notes of the usage of the Linux netcat command nc, but searching for it produces lots of files containing concat. Even being able to search for nc, it nc followed by a space would do the trick but I don&#x27;t know how to do that in the prompt.
 Using C u C c p s s give an option prompt in the minibuffer where you add the flags you want, -w in this case but that didn&#x27;t work.
 Is there also some way you can see the actual command executed by ag?

But if I have a non-Rust file open (my Cargo.toml, my README, whatever) then the keybind isn&#x27;t present. I can still M-x rustic-cargo-run, but having to remember to do that isn&#x27;t ideal. Is there a package that solves this problem?
 In the worst case I could add a hook on buffer creation that checks if the buffer belongs to a project that looks &#x27;Rust-ish&#x27; (contains a Cargo.toml at project root or whatever) and binds the relevant keys, but I don&#x27;t want to duplicate effort.

 type Image a &#x3D; Position -&gt; a
 type Position &#x3D; (Float, Float)
 type Region &#x3D; Image Boolean
 We would like to create a function that replaces the values of one image with another using paste.
 paste :: Region -&gt; Image a -&gt; Image a -&gt; Image a
 paste reg im1 im2 &#x3D; (\p -&gt; if (reg p) then (im1 p) else (im2 p))
 My question is where does p come from? paste takes 3 parameters reg, im1 and im2. So where does p come from? When using lambda in Javascript for example myList.map(x &#x3D;&gt; x+5), it&#x27;s clear that x is a value from myList. But here I get a little bit confused as to where p comes from.

                              <span>I&#x27;m going to list the Org mode apps available and summarize their flaws, harshly. I won&#x27;t have gripes about not supporting obscure Org syntax, or anything like that. Instead, can it read and write Org files? Trickier than you think.
  
Organice - It can&#x27;t access files from your phone&#x27;s filesystem, something that should be simple, but it&#x27;s difficult for a web app. You have to store your notes in 3rd party clouds like Dropbox or connect your own WebDAV server.
 Orgro : read only
 Orgzly - The most featureful. An unfortunate mechanism that can&#x27;t be turned off saves over your file with re-done spacing -- blank lines are added between headlines automatically, which isn&#x27;t Org specification nor everyone&#x27;s style. This clogs git, if you&#x27;re using version control, with changes that are just whitespace. One may notice a toggle to turn off adding blank lines between headlines, but that just means turning blank lines off entirely, forgetting ones that you may have added. Fundamentally, as of now, Orgzly&#x27;s parser doesn&#x27;t try to remember the blank lines in your notes that you may have added with purpose.
 Metanote A newcomer, but it has stayed proprietary.
  
I have more hopes about are full-fledged Emacs with termux or Emacs on F-Droid. None of the org mode apps today are very usable.

                              <span>I recently upgraded from Emacs 28.2 to Emacs 29 (changed Arch Linux packages from emacs to emacs29-git), and now Emacs closes very slowly with my configuration.
 To an extent, I know why this happens (auto-complete adds the function ac-comphist-save function to the kill-emacs-hook). But I fail to understand why ac-comphist-save is suddenly much slower on Emacs 29.
 If anybody has suggestions on why this is happening, or could explain what exactly I will lose by removing this function from the kill hook, I&#x27;d be very grateful.

                              <span>Emacs 29 has got new startup options: --init-directory. Here is how you can use it (for those daredevils who build their own Emacs, until 29 is finalized):
 In your shell, clone those repo(s) you would like to test:
 git clone https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs git clone https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude git clone https://github.com/jkitchin/scimax 
 You can now run your Emacs from command line in respective directory:
 emacs --init-directory&#x3D;~/spacemacs&amp; emacs --init-directory&#x3D;~/prelude&amp; emacs --init-directory&#x3D;~/scimax&amp; 
 Easy. 
 I actually never tried anyone&#x27;s setup before, but always had on my to-do to actually try those (+ Doom, but Doom seems to require slightly more fiddling). As a small review: Spacemacs and Prelude worked out of the box without any issues. Scimax is a bit older, and for some reason, it choked a bit during the installation. I had to press C-g once or twice to get it going. Also, every time Emacs starts, it is chewing on something until I press C-g. I haven&#x27;t investigated on what. But other than that, despite all the warnings during the package installation, it seems to work quite well. I am impressed with the amount of polish and integration all three has done. I can certainly recommend any, especially Scimax for those of you who are doing lots of org, org-babel and who write scientific articles and reports. Spacemacs seems to be the most polished of them the three, visually and technically, while Scimax seems to be actually most useful, especially if you are an academic.
 If you are new to Emacs and learning, it is not worth spending hours chasing packages and configuring stuff. Install Emacs, and you can be going solidly in less than five minutes with any of those three. Probably Doom to, but can&#x27;t be just cloned and auto-installed via provided init.el as those three guys.

                              <span>&#x60;I&#x27;m fairly new to emacs, so please be forgiving...
 I am trying GNU Emacs both on a Mac and a Windows PC. On the Mac, inserting a date with C-c ! shows [2023-04-04 Tue]. On Windows, it shows [2023-04-04 di]. Both machines have current-language-environment set to &quot;Dutch&quot;. The rest is mostly out of the box.
 It looks like Windows is properly detecting my locale, but the Mac isn&#x27;t.
 I want to use my local language (&quot;di&quot;) instead of English (&quot;Tue&quot;).
 What am I missing in setting this up?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been using embark for some months now, I like it, I like the concept, the way it works, and it&#x27;s already part of my workflow in a number of tasks. On the other hand I also find it somewhat overwhelming. The keymaps are very large, and comprise numerous tasks which could potentially be performed through Embark. As a result, unless the binding is already part of muscle memory, having to resort to the embark-verbose-indicator is a time consuming step, because the list is so long it feels like finding a binding in C-h m. True, C-h offers completion, but at this point I&#x27;m already wondering if it wouldn&#x27;t have been faster doing the task without using Embark.
 So, it works very well for bindings I know by heart. Which are a few. For others, I can&#x27;t help but feel I&#x27;d prefer to have less alternatives. Thus, I&#x27;m considering adopting a &quot;bottom-up&quot; approach to Embark. The idea would be drastically reducing the available Embark bindings, and then adding the ones for which I feel the need. The question is: is there a &quot;proper&quot; way to go about this? I don&#x27;t think nuking embark-keymap-alist to just a few maps is the way to go, since the keymaps put the bindings in the proper context. But, on the other hand, going around disabling each binding seems tedious. So, any advice on this?

                              <span>I keep track of certain reports in an org file and need to record the date the report was submitted. I use a property &quot;REPORT_DATE&quot; for this and then call org-time-stamp-inactive from the minibuffer in order to pass the value of the property in the desired format. 
 I am looking for a way to streamline this process, so that when I call org-set-property and select REPORT_DATE, I don&#x27;t have to manually call org-time-stamp-inactive, but instead I&#x27;m just prompted to select a date (i.e. a way for org-time-stamp-inactive to be called when I select the property REPORT_DATE via org-set-property). 
 I realize I could define a wrapper that would do much of what I need (prompt for a date and then call org-set-property with REPORT_DATE and the formatted output of org-time-stamp-inactive as arguments), but I&#x27;m wondering if this is necessary.
 I&#x27;ve looked into allowed values but, from what I can tell, I can only specify a list of values, which isn&#x27;t quite what I need.
  
EDIT: this does the trick. 
 (defun org-completing-read-date (prompt collection &amp;optional predicate require-match initial-input hist def inherit-input-method) &quot;Like &#x60;completing-read&#x27; but reads a date and outputs an inactive time-stamp. Only PROMPT and DEF are really used.&quot; (format &quot;[%s]&quot; (org-read-date nil nil nil prompt nil def))) (add-to-list &#x27;org-property-set-functions-alist &#x27;(&quot;REPORT_DATE&quot; . org-completing-read-date))

 But the fill column indicator is still displaying in vterm-mode. Can someone please explain to me what I am doing wrong? Thank you in advance.
 UPDATE
 Found a solution. Will only work with DOOM Emacs.
 ;; Show fill column indicator in text and programming modes. (add-hook! (&#x27;text-mode-hook &#x27;prog-mode-hook) &#x27;display-fill-column-indicator-mode )

                              <span>I was wondering is anything like &#x27;org agenda view in date tree format&#x27; exist?Right now I&#x27;m manually creating year, months, weeks, days in &#x27;date tree format&#x27;. And creating something like &#x27;column view&#x27; because ma days are based on checkboxes.
 So I imagine &#x27;org agenda view in date tree format&#x27; where I can org-cycle every element.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been a while since I last posted a post regarding Eask. So I would like to share some of the significant changes since v0.1.0.
 For those who don&#x27;t know Eask, you can treat Eask as a successor to Cask.
 Project repository: https://github.com/emacs-eask/cli
 🎉 Features
  
Unlike Cask-file, Eask-file is an elisp file. You can manage dependencies with elisp code like:
  
elisp (when (version&lt; emacs-version &quot;26.3&quot;) (depends-on &quot;package-name&quot;)) 
  
Node.JS is not required to use Eask; you can download the binary at our release page
 Out-of-the-box linters and test runners (checkdoc, package-lint, ert, buttercup, elsa, etc)
 Work across all OSs (Unless Node.js doesn&#x27;t support it :P)
 Automatically download packages when they are used
 Fast, won&#x27;t start Emacs unless it&#x27;s needed
  
✨ Changes
  
Eask now has all the commands from Cask and more (If Cask works, then Eask works)
 eask status to display the state of the workspace (eask info is also cool! :D)
 Convert Cask-file to Eask-file using eask init --from&#x3D;cask
 eask generate workflow [action] to generate workflow files (support GitHub Actions, GitLab Runner, CircleCI, etc)
 eask generate [type] to generate common files like-pkg.el, -autoloads.el, LICENSE, .gitignore, etc.
 eask cat to display file with highlighting (uses e2ansi)
 Differentiate workspace with flag --global and --config, so you can use Eask as either a general tool or package management tool for your personal configuration
 eask create [type] creates elisp project (package or ELPA)
 webinstall is now available, install it with curl!

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;m working on using MobileOrg with webdav, but it only works partialy: 1. &quot;captures&quot; works, the content can be sync&#x27;ed back and forth 2. but the outlines are not working, I set up the url to be something like &#x3D;http://host/org/index.org&#x3D; and it links to a foo.org, both .org files have a line in &#x3D;checksums.dat&#x3D; Every time I click &quot;sync&quot;, it seems ok but the foo.org is not fetched, the outlines panel is blank. And MobileOrg didn&#x27;t try to fetch it, as I observed with tcpdump.
 What could be wrong? How can I troubleshoot the problem? The MobileOrg version is 1.7.5
 Thanks in advance.
 P.S. I submitted an issue at https://github.com/MobileOrg/mobileorg/issues/290, but nobody responded yet, so I re-post it here to see if someone here knows how to fix it.

                              <span>For a software team to be successful, you need excellent communication. That is why we want to build
systems that foster cross-team communication. Using a monorepo is an excellent
way to do that. A monorepo provides:
Visibility: by seeing the pull requests (PRs) of colleagues, you are easily informed
of what other teams are doing.
Uniformity: by working in one central repository, it is easier to share
the configuration of linters, formatters, etc. This makes it easy
to use the same code style and documentation standards.
Uniformity smooths the onboarding of newcomers as well as the reassignment of engineers
to different internal projects.
Easier continuous integration: new code is picked
up automatically by CI, without any manual interaction, ensuring uniformity and best practices.

 I tried some stuff. Deleting the folder C:\sr does not help. Runnig the command as administratior gives another error and I&#x27;m uncertain if that is the right way to go.
 What should I try next to get hindent installed?

                              <span>Scala CLI v1.0.0-RC1 has just been released.
 v1.0.0-RC1 is the first release candidate version of Scala CLI. Either this or a future release candidate is meant to become the new official scala runner to accompany the Scala compiler (scalac) and other scripts, replacing the old scala command.
 To learn more about Scala CLI as the new scala runner, check out a recent blogpost: https://medium.com/virtuslab/exploring-scala-cli-the-new-scala-runner-4b958245c2e0
 Notable changes:
  
better performance
 using experimental features will now produce an appropriate warning, which can be disabled with the --suppress-experimental-warning option or the suppress-warning.experimental-features global configuration key
 experimental and restricted configuration keys are now only available in the --power mode
 deprecated using directive syntax has been dropped (multiline directives and others)
 and more, refer to the release notes for details

                              <span>whenever i turn on sly to edit a lisp file or to use the repl, i would like to have something like lispy mode turned on. This would autocomplete parentheses and allow me to work comfortably with s-exps. Just turning on lispy mode causes some annoying behavior in the repl. Specifically, if im typing 
 (defun f (x).) 
 and point is at . then pressing ENTER evaluates the form, rather than inserting a new line. Maybe I set this up wrong or the lispy package doesnt interact nicely with sly?

                              <span>I use evil-mode with a few modifications.
 In normal mode:
  
s
 s is remapped to org-cycle and S (uppercase s) to org-shifttab as I don&#x27;t use the substitute key in evil-mode, and for me org-cycle is the most used command in org-mode, Tab key is just a little bit too far away from the home row. Correspondingly cycle keys in magit diff view and pdf-tool&#x27;s outline view are also remapped to s.
 
x
 x is changed to evil-visual-line for a quick single key press. Remap X (uppercase x) to evil-delete-char to retain x&#x27;s original function.
 
Leader keys
 Main leader keys are Space, f, t.
 F (uppercase f) and T (uppercase t) are rebound to keep f and t&#x27;s original evil commands.
 
e
 e is set to avy-goto-char.
 
u and U
 u is for evil-undo, U (uppercase u) is changed to evil-redo.

                              <span>I have set sentence-end-double-space to nil, and I&#x27;m trying to use non-breaking spaces after things like &quot;Mr.&quot; in &quot;Mr. Johnson&quot; so as to distinguish abbreviation dots from end of sentence dots. However, even when I include a non-breaking space (C-x 8 SPC), commands like forward-sentence and backward-sentence will still stop on those.
 My sentence-end variable is nil, so according to the sentence-end function, the value will come from the variables ‘sentence-end-base’, ‘sentence-end-double-space’, ‘sentence-end-without-period’ and ‘sentence-end-without-space’. I&#x27;ve checked all of them, and the only one that seems to be pertaining is sentence-end-base, which says:
  
Its value is &quot;[.?!…‽][]\&quot;&#x27;”’)}»›]*&quot; 
 Regexp matching the basic end of a sentence, not including following space.
  
It doesn&#x27;t say anything about distinguishing spaces from non-breaking spaces. Any clues on how to change this behavior?
 Also, can you see any unintended consequences of the setup I&#x27;m planning to use (one space after sentences, one non-breaking space after things that should not be ending sentences)?

 I personally don&#x27;t do note taking, though I sure am guilty of abusing init.el as a procrastination tool.

                              <span>This is a bit of a nice-to-have, but as a programmer I sometimes wish for a way to augment code/data I&#x27;m looking at. My concrete example of yesterday was a compact hex-representation of some joystick input data. I discovered recently the highlight-functionality, and that has already been super helpful in making visibly distinct marks in long logfiles.
 I know that Emacs can do overlays (and I know that they are costly), so I wonder if anybody is aware of something like svg-annotate/git blame where for each line I get an annotation of the meaning of that line.

 Good. But how can I get a view of previous weeks, future weeks? And how is it even doing this? I don&#x27;t see any TODOs or such in the exported org-mode file. What is it, how is it populating org-agenda?

 The syntax here is that prod represents a DPT, [1..n] represents a set of integers from 1 to n. x.B is a type function with argument x. I am trying to calculate the number of elements of the resulting type. 
 Although I understand the concept of DPTs I don&#x27;t actually understand how they work in practise i.e. this example. My guess is that the cardinality of the resulting type is 6, (1,1) (2,1) (2,2) (3,1) (3,2) and (3,3). Can anyone give a better explanation of how this works?

                              <span>Was going to quickly write some complex computations and took a look at the source code for Data.Complex just to see what tools I get out of the box. Many of the formulas are what you would expect like:
 sin (x:+y) &#x3D; sin x * cosh y :+ cos x * sinh y 
 But the instances make no sense at all:
 instance Monad Complex where a :+ b &gt;&gt;&#x3D; f &#x3D; realPart (f a) :+ imagPart (f b) instance Applicative Complex where pure a &#x3D; a :+ a f :+ g  a :+ b &#x3D; f a :+ g b 
 I&#x27;m not seeing how the bind definition works at all. f is going to return a real and complex number when applied to both a and b so you are going to have to scramble. Moreover unless f is linear there is no reason to believe that f(a +ib) &#x3D; f(a) + i*f(b). It would seem to me a much more reasonable assumption would be to use numerical methods and compute a Taylor expansion for real a and then extend to b. That&#x27;s still highly questionable but at least don&#x27;t fail for functions as simple as f x &#x3D; x^2. Similarly the definition for pure makes no sense at all.
 Haskell normally doesn&#x27;t get obvious math wrong so I&#x27;m assuming the fault lies with me. What am I missing?

 -- in ModuleB import ModuleA
 fun :: arg -&gt; X a
 newtype Y a &#x3D; Y (ReaderT Bool X a) deriving (...Monad)
 funY :: arg1 -&gt; Y a &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 What I would like to achieve is to replace usage of concrete type X with a (constrained) abstract type without touching code in ModuleB - shadowing ModuleA import with a Cabal mixin.
 I tried: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; class ApiX m where ...
 type X a &#x3D; forall m. (ApiX m) &#x3D;&gt; m a &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 It almost works - except newtype Y a above. Compilation fails with the message that X is partially applied. Note that this already exists in ModuleB and the goal is not to touch source code in this module.
 Is there any way to achieve that (using type families or whatever)?
 EDIT: The end goal is to make all functions defined in ModuleB polymorphic without touching any code in this module. In other words transform all functions from
 f :: a -&gt; b -&gt; c -&gt; X d
 to
 f :: ApiX m &#x3D;&gt; a -&gt; b -&gt; c -&gt; m d

                              <span>I realized a while back that it should be pretty easy to write an unordered split function for the pqueue package.
 splitU :: Int -&gt; MinQueue a -&gt; (MinQueue a, MinQueue a) 
 splitU n q divides q into a priority queue of size min n (size q) and a priority queue of size max 0 (size q - n). I believe this can be achieved in amortized time O(log(min(n,|q|))) and worst case time O(log(max(n,|q|))) by operating in a manner analogous to binary subtraction. Which elements end up in which priority queue would be largely arbitrary. Would such an operation be useful for anything in practice? I haven&#x27;t been able to think of anything, but I really want to have a reason to write this ;-).
 Edit: those bounds are wrong, but the real ones are still logarithmic.

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking for a printed book to read after finishing with Manning Publication&#x27;s Get Programming with Haskell.
 Some things to consider are that, though I can&#x27;t say for sure why, I don&#x27;t like this book. I think the issue is that it&#x27;s light. Not just verbose, but lacking in substance. Since it isn&#x27;t entirely vapid and having paid money for it, I will finish the book. It&#x27;s just anemic. And the capstone projects are fun.
 Two books which worked well for me are Manning&#x27;s The Joy of Clojure 2nd Ed. and PragProg&#x27;s Programming Clojure 3rd Ed. This is of particular significance since at least 90% of the first seven chapters of The Joy of Clojure are redundant with Programming Clojure, which I read first. I feel like I&#x27;m getting less from reading Get Programming with Haskell than I did reading content I had already covered in another book. The content just isn&#x27;t there.
 (Also, it&#x27;s worth noting that the code examples are kind of crappy. I&#x27;m finding myself refactoring this &quot;expert&#x27;s&quot; code because it&#x27;s ugly and horribly redundant. One thing I like about Haskell is that it&#x27;s beautiful, with minimal boilerplate, and code I write in Haskell looks great to me. I don&#x27;t like looking at unsightly code, and his code is mostly that. But for the sake of learning, I can look beyond that.)
 So, with this in mind, what might /r/Haskell recommend as a second Haskell book?
 Edit: I should probably mention (admit?) that I am not a programmer, and if you exclude my Numerical Analysis textbook from grad school, those two Clojure books are the only programming books I&#x27;ve read. I have been programming at some level for decades, but I don&#x27;t have a typical CompSci background. (Which may or may not be a good thing since it does also mean I don&#x27;t need to unlearn OOP.)

 I checked with the compiler and it gave me this one foo :: Eq a &#x3D;&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; a
 First I thought about something like this foo :: (Eq a, Eq b) &#x3D;&gt; a -&gt; b -&gt; a -&gt; a
 So why does it forces x and y to be of the same type? Wouldnt the second option be more general as it gives the option of x and y being from the same or different type?
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I start a new job tomorrow, and I wanted to try retrieving calendar information using excorporate.
 However, the EWS url returns a 401 when an attempt is made to access it. Increasing the verbosity of the logging from request ((setq request-log-level &#x27;blather)) allows us to see that basic auth is being attempted against the https://outlook.office365.com/EWS/Services.wsdl url.
 This article would indicate that Basic Auth is no longer supported: https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/exchange-team-blog/basic-authentication-deprecation-in-exchange-online-september/ba-p/3609437
 I think this means that Excorporate can no longer authenticate with O365 as a result.

                              <span>Installed on a cheap Teclast 10-inch tablet, running Android12, from F-droid.
 It appears to run in isolation, in a container, so I cannot access the file system of the tablet. Can&#x27;t see a way to copy my config over...? Any ideas? 
 It initially starts up with a tiny, tiny font size, so I managed to set up a one line .emacs to increase the font size, so it is at least readable.
 Totally unsuited for an on-screen keyboard (tried swiftkey and the hacker keyboard).
 Hacker keyboard only shows the modifiers in landscape orientation
 And lastly, how the hell do you install fonts on Android??

                              <span>I&#x27;m having a problem with byte-compiling a package that uses defhydra.
 The package defines a hydra only if the hydra package is available, but since it&#x27;s a macro, it expands during byte-compilation and some users see &quot;void-variable&quot; error when trying to use the package.
 The relevant code looks like this:
 (when (require &#x27;hydra nil :noerror) (defhydra powerthesaurus-hydra ...)) 
 The idea is not to explicitly depend on hydra (or transient), but still define such interfaces if the corresponding package is available.
 I tried using eval-after-load and with-eval-after-load, but no luck there.
 I&#x27;d really appreciate any advice or approach to try. Thanks!

 I tried to (setq-default tab-width 2), but that doesn&#x27;t achieve anything

                              <span>Hello, I was planning to use org-agenda to empty my head of the (long-term) tasks that keep bothering me to focus better on the present. However, one requirement for whatever goal/task-planner system I wanted to use came up as having a system of &quot;prerequisites&quot;. 
 For example, say I want to do a book/course on Advanced Calculus, then a prerequisite for that would be Basic Calculus. Now, I&#x27;d love the planner system to not show the Advanced Calculus until I complete all its prerequisites. But when I do complete all its prerequisites, I want it to automatically show the Advanced Calculus goal.
 Is this pre-provided by org-agenda? If not, could someone please suggest what modifications I might need to do in order to enable this?
 org-enforce-todo-dependencies seems relevant, but this seems to assume that one task&#x27;s completion may only enable at most one other task (its parent), while I can imagine that there can be one-to-many such links.

                              <span>I was inspired by code metrics that was announced a few days back that shows the complexity of a function as a overlay above the function so I wrote a simple POC that uses RipGrep to shows number of references of that function signature. SourceKit-LSP that I uses for code completions doesn&#x27;t support code lenses so I thought it would be nice to have something similar. 
 Now to my problem. When my overlay-usage-mode is enabled the scroll/trackpad is starting to behave extremely bad, it hangs and sometimes it scrolls back to the area over and over. Its the exactly the same behavior I get when using pixel-precision-mode in Emacs 29.x
 So I would like to get some help to fix my code, or at least some pointers in the right direction.
 I am using Emacs 29.x on MacOS on a M1 Pro Max so I got a lot of CPU power.

 No matter how to scale the fonts, the table stay formatted badly.
 I tried it in Vterm, term, shell, eshell, ansi-term, they displayed the same as above.
 How could get it correctly displayed as in a decent terminal such as Konsole? (Emacs 28.2 on ubuntu)

                              <span>I&#x27;m using emacs 30, compiled from git. Pixel scroll precision mode is great, finally I can move around emacs without feeling lost with all those jumps. I&#x27;ve configured it like this:
 (setq-default scroll-conservatively 10000) (setq-default scroll-margin 5) (pixel-scroll-precision-mode t) (setq pixel-scroll-precision-use-momentum t) (setq pixel-scroll-precision-interpolate-mice t) (setq pixel-scroll-precision-large-scroll-height 10.0) (setq pixel-scroll-precision-interpolate-page t) (global-set-key (kbd &quot;C-v&quot;) &#x27;pixel-scroll-interpolate-down) (global-set-key (kbd &quot;M-v&quot;) &#x27;pixel-scroll-interpolate-up) 
 This lets me scroll smoothly with the mouse wheel as well. Only problem I&#x27;ve encountered is that I always scroll by the same amount, no matter the buffer size.
 There&#x27;s buffers that are quite tiny, like the documentation popup that corfu provides. I can place my mouse on top of it, and smooth scroll with the mouse wheel, but it scrolls too far, and it doesn&#x27;t let me see very much.
 Is there a simple way to make the scrolling dependent on the vertical height of the buffer?

                              <span>Edit: I thought just pressing C-c a and then choosing a different view would not work, because when I did that, the main window switched from the buffer I was editing to the agenda view, so I thought I was going to lose focus of the buffer I was editing.
 But once I selected a new agenda view, the buffer I was editing regained focus.
 So the answer is, just press C-c a and then choose the new view you want.

 Original post:
 Let&#x27;s say I&#x27;m in the week view of the Agenda (C-c a a) and I want to go to the view of my to-dos.
 I could press q to quit the week view, then press C-c a t.
 Is that the quickest way? I was wondering if there is a way to go &quot;back&quot; from an agenda view to the dispatcher, or to &quot;switch&quot; from one agenda view to another without quitting the agenda view entirely.
 I&#x27;m sorry if this is documented somewhere. I&#x27;ve looked in the manual and online and I&#x27;m coming up blank.

                              <span>Hi I am getting confused as to how to tackle a whole book or research paper and the production of notes.  I&#x27;m doing a literature review as part of a phd, so academic level critique needed.  The referencing I can easily cite at the end of the note so that isn&#x27;t a concern. Does one research paper produce many notes, how does one title these notes please?  Is it the concept or the book etc.  thank you

                              <span>Hi,  newbie here.  I&#x27;m not overly confident or comfortable with notion, have seen hypernotes that seems easier for me, however I&#x27;ve been using Notion for a while.  I like notion as I can directly link out to a google doc.  I&#x27;ve sort of constructed the page to use notion and files embedded as if it were scrivener.  I digress.  I am writing a phd.  I do a lot of literature reviews etc.
My question here is there really much value in having a tool that presents a map of notes as per obsidian.  If I build my zettelkasten in notion which is basically a relational database is this not sufficient.  I do really want to concentrate on writing.  As notion supports my writing very well the idea of having the zettel database in the same tool is appealing to me.
Any thoughts please?
thank you Zoe</span>

 Which configuration am I missing?
 I already tried (setq-local eldoc-documentation-strategy &#x27;eldoc-documentation-compose-eagerly) and (setq-local eldoc-documentation-strategy &#x27;eldoc-documentation-compose). But it did not help.
 EDIT: Sorry for the wrong wording. I meant, cursor-at-point, not mouse-hover. Also, here is a screenshot of the help Corfu shows, and a screenshot of the type signature Eglot/Eldoc shows: https://envs.sh/hZ-.png https://envs.sh/hLD.png

 I am slowly but surely developing some amount of knowledge I can attempt to share about &quot;how to set emacs to a good-enough-slate across automated end-to-end tests&quot;.
 If you&#x27;re curious, the package is https://github.com/trevoke/org-gtd.el - ... and the major major refactor is happening over at https://github.com/Trevoke/org-gtd.el/tree/more-flexible-organization .

                              <span>Hey there,
 So I&#x27;ve honestly been guilty of always writing notes via text on my phone but never pulling them into my Emacs &#x27;ideas.org&#x27; file on my local file server that I can access via SSH and via Tramp Mode with a related Hydra.
 That being noted, here&#x27;s the workflow of what I want to achieve:
 Desired Workflow:
  
I write an &#x27;idea&#x27; note on my Android phone&#x27;s Emacs Org Mode app
 I want the heading of the actual note to be like this (with the bulletpoints via Org Mode style to be intact):
  
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 * Week of (Monday&#x27;s date --&gt; ex: 3-27-2023)
 ** (Title of Idea)
 *** Notes:
 (Blah blah blah my notes)
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 ​
 With that in mind, can anyone point me in the right direction for a good Android phone app that does some of this heavy lifting? Also, can someone help me create the right syntax for the date insertion stuff above and format of the &#x27;Title of Idea&#x27;? for org mode note ingestion?
 I&#x27;ve only done something similar for a work based todo list for ticket work, but its been a long time.
 Also, a general explanation of how I can do this process via the same Android app would be great since I have never synced notes to an actual notes file over SSH, and only did this kind of thing locally to a todo list.
 Thanks so much!

 Blown trying to figure out why Emacs was giving message &quot;Cannot open load file: No such file or directory&quot;. The problem was trying to symlink my .emacs.d folder.
 Troubleshooting why my symlinks weren&#x27;t working. Tried Powershell and CMD commands. No help. Don&#x27;t use symlinks. That&#x27;s all I discovered. Washed my hands of the problem.

                              <span>I mainly made the switch because I wanted a tool that I can rely on for years to come (but also, Org-mode). Looking back, I have switched notebooks/editors 6 times in the past ~15 years for various reasons, either because I switched OS or the old tool could no longer satisfy my needs; it&#x27;s just not sustainable and migrating contents ended up being a headache every time.
 It&#x27;s only been a week, but so far, I like to think that I have found a forever home with Emacs.
 Here are some questions I have. I looked through some of the old threads but couldn&#x27;t find the answer I need. Any relevant info is appreciated.
  
What are some suggested options for syncing Org-mode files across different OS platforms, preferably E2E encrypted? One combination appears to be file sync client + Cryptomator, though unsure if that&#x27;d prove to be problematic in the long term.
 
How do people keep their configs consistent across platforms (also backing them up)? Let&#x27;s say that I carry around a Linux-powered laptop, but at home I switch between Windows and macOS for different purposes; each of them may have slightly different configs that correspond to the platform.
 
Is there a built-in cheatsheet of sort, or a toggle reference tool that can be customized, for a beginner to use as a reference while learning common keystrokes and commands? I have been killing by searching with apropos and then yanking to a separate org file; it works, just somewhat clunky. (Love the terminology, by the way.)
 
I plan to be using Emacs for academic purposes as well ­ drafting papers, processing data with scripts, so on and so forth. Any tools or advice that comes to mind?

 I have been using this package for book management, take a peek : https://github.com/lepisma/org-books
 ...and the damn thing stops working ..........and I am seeing some weird thing in the message buffer:
 Greedy org-protocol handler. Killing client.
 No server buffers remain to edit
 Deprecated date/weektree capture templates changed to ‘file+olp+datetree’.
 Invalid key: ‘^[’
 Invalid key: ‘[’
 Invalid key: ‘I’
 Invalid key: ‘^[’
 Invalid key: ‘[’
 Invalid key: ‘O’
 Invalid key: ‘^[’
 Invalid key: ‘[’
 Invalid key: ‘I’
 Extension ignored
 Clipboard pasted as level 1 subtree
 Item captured.
 ​
 I am trying to capture book information by org-capture template ..wondering ..
 P.S. Pasting captured url from the clipboard to org-capture-template ...also it sometimes throws errors like this too
 ​
 * %![Error: (void-function org-books-get-details)]
 ...and running out steam while chasing it.....so ....
 ​
 Little details which might help you people :
 1) I am running emacs on tty and this stuff worked flawlessly from here. Importantly, I haven&#x27;t done any changes specific to it anywhere.
 2) Emacs version 28.1

 Now, I want to install auctex as:
 sudo apt install auctex 
 However, it automatically to do extra jobs to install emacs emacs-bin-common emacs-common of version 27.
 How could I just install auctex and ignore its affiliated emacs.
