 I am sure that I declared this package in my configuration, reloaded my configuration/emacs, however I don&#x27;t find these ewal functions with a search through all available functions in my emacs( SPC(space)+:)
 by the way, I wrote this in my config.el:
 (require &#x27;ewal)
 (use-package ewal)
 (ewal-load-color &#x27;magenta +4)
 but it even doesn&#x27;t print any errors, or may be I don&#x27;t know how to check them, I use emacs29-pgtk on linux

                              <span>Unless I&#x27;m mistaken, org-mode headlines are like:
 * Foo
 ** Bar
 *** Baz
 The asterisks have to start in the first column.
 It strikes me (especially with org auto indent on) it might be handy to be able to write: (underscore &#x3D;&#x3D; space, cause reddit)
 * Foo
 ___** Bar
 ______*** Baz
 ie: Make the leading whitespace not relevent
 Now, I&#x27;m just being lazy, not wanting to wipe auto-indented spaces while int he typing flow and just entering headlines
 Another option might be a minor mode that detects &#x27;hey we&#x27;re in org-mode, and that looks like a headline with leading asterisks, lets blow away the whitespace for ya!&#x27;; wouldn&#x27;t be too hard a function to write.
 A function like tht could get goofy, if you&#x27;re doing say embedded a BEGIN_SRC block with C code in it, with multiline comments, but a function could check if its looking within such a block..
 Anyone considered this sort of thing?

                              <span>I want to pass nearly all printed output from (in this case, Python) code blocks through a function that (which usually is formatting, in other cases is some mathematical operation) I&#x27;ve defined previously.
 I think what I want is to use #+call or the :post header argument, but I&#x27;m not sure how.
 I think I need either a version of this:
 #+name: my_function #+begin_src python :var data&#x3D;0 my_function(data) #+end_src #+name: my_data #+begin_src python :post my_function(data) x&#x3D;2+2 print(x) #+end_src 
 or
 #+name: my_function #+begin_src python :var data&#x3D;0 my_function(data) #+end_src #+name: my_data #+begin_src python x&#x3D;2+2 print(x) #+end_src #+call: my_function(my_data) :results drawer 
 so that in both cases, I would have the my_function(my_output) evaluated and displayed in the buffer.
 I can&#x27;t quite get this to work -- does anyone see what I&#x27;m missing? I&#x27;m also using a Python :session my-session argument, which is located in the Org header for the file, so that I don&#x27;t have to keep adding the :session.

                              <span>Hello, i was wondering if you all (the community ) would like if emacs gets a new icon for a future release (e.g emacs-40.1 emacs-50.1 emacs-100.1), this is related to a thread that i started in emacs-devel
 The reason of this is for give to emacs a feel more modern for this decade in comparation to others editors and rivals such as vscode or neovim, about this also for give to that release as the begin of a new and great era for emacs and its community e.g the inclusion of tree-siter, eglot, the work in progress of the new GC, the new json parser, new and great packages, &amp;.c.
 I&#x27;ve done some conceptual icons in case there are interest in this.

                              <span>I just wanted to share my emacs-config that I&#x27;ve been using for a while and just recently pushed to GitHub. I&#x27;ve updated the config to use org-mode which then optionally tangles the code (I used to use auto-tangle but have turned that off).
 One of the great things about this config is that most of the packages are deferred. Startup time on my M2 Mac is around 1.5 seconds which I find pretty good.
 Something of note - a lot of inspiration of this came from two sources:
  
System Crafters (Emacs from Scratch)
 A guy name Portesilaos that has some great content.
  
My hope is that someone can find some use out of it.

This is yet another opportunity to share with your friends what you are working on. Add to this discussion by telling us about your zettelkasten journey. Share with us what you&#x27;re learning. Sharing helps me and, hopefully, you, too. It helps us clarify our goals and visualize our thinking. And sometimes, a conversation sparks a magical moment where we can dive into an idea worth exploring. I&#x27;d love to hear more from you.   🫵🏼
I&#x27;m still interested in connecting via Zoom for a chat if you want.
Ideas I&#x27;m exploring with my ZK and why I&#x27;m here:
I&#x27;m wrapping up the final project for this term. Once done, I&#x27;m going to hit the #proofing section of my zettelkasten. I&#x27;m shifting my focus from reading to writing in the fall term.
Food Reading - I&#x27;ve enjoyed a run of foodie books. They are starting to get under my skin in a good way.
Samu Practice is something I&#x27;ve done for 15 years without much reflection. I&#x27;m changing that.
Books I&#x27;m reading:
Sertillanges, A. G. and Ryan, Mary. The Intellectual Life: Its Spirit, Conditions, Methods. 1987. PDF [[202402140719]]

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to take a string which contains the name of one of my let values and set it i.e.
 (set (intern bar) (cons 3 (symbol-value (intern bar)))) ()(set (intern bar) (cons 3 (symbol-value (intern bar)))) (let ((foo &#x27;(1 2)) (bar &quot;foo&quot;)) (push 3 (intern bar))) ;; or (let ((foo &#x27;(1 2)) (bar &quot;foo&quot;)) (set (intern bar) (cons 3 (symbol-value (intern bar))))) 
 The first doesn&#x27;t work due to the macro and the second is operating in the global namespace and not on the lexically bound local variables.
 Edit version of the question: can I have lexical binding and go from string to corresponding symbol somehow or am I stuck.
 Thanks

 Does any know how to get this behavior in vanilla emacs?

                              <span>Maybe you dont like it but that&#x27;s fine, it is just an idea as of now as someone who is using emacs just for orgmode for years and recently started to use dired. I&#x27;m sorry not using it for more than those 2 things, please have mercy with me. 
 So back to my idea. That email &quot;client&quot;, well actually it is just a viewer, the receiving and sending part would have to be done with offlineimap, sendmail and friends:
  
there are different orgmode files, e.g. ~/org/mail/inbox.org, ~/org/mail/sent.org, ~/org/mail/drafts.org and all of them contain headlines which actually are emails, but they are just rendered as headlines.
 The headline includes the subject, but could also include some state such as READ or SENT
 The body is the text of the email
 Attachments? Use org attachment to add them
 Maybe we could also use properties for recipients or use the tags, I&#x27;m unsure about this one 
 a scheduler would iterate over those files every few minutes/hours and actually sends that email (headline) 
 you can archive an email, which would actually just refile it, or you could also move things around like refiling
 I don&#x27;t know if you can partially set some parts of the buffer to be read only, I don&#x27;t know if it would make sense to set all those files to be read only, hmm
 use org capture templates to write a new email, depending on the cursor position it would either be a reply or new mail

                              <span>hi, I am using elfeed to watch YT videos from various sources (jazz concerts). The most feeds I have are a mix of full concerts (&gt;45mn.) and smaller programs I would like to filter out.
 The question is how to retrieve the length of the videos and exclude the ones I don&#x27;t want to watch?

                              <span>Hi all,
 Last couple of days emacs is slow to start (close to two minutes) and &quot;tree-sitter-langs: Grammar bundle v0.12.187 was already installed; skipped:&quot; is the message during that wait.
 First of all, I have zero treesitter packages installed on my system, nor is it part of my config, grepping my system, I only find treesitter files associated with neovim. Nothing in /usr or ~/.config/emacs
 What is happening here ?
 I am open for any pointers, or tips, or insights.
 thx,
 S

 Would anyone be interested in a paper reading group? Where we commit to reading one paper a week. So there’s some accountability at least. And we could chat about the paper asynchronously.
 Edit: I created a Discord server. If anyone has a better idea, I’m open for that too:

                              <span>I use Org-Mode and the agenda quite heavily. My agenda is displayed in a horizontal pane.
 The default window size increases as I add more stuff to the agenda. I work on a laptop with limited display real estate and, at times, the agenda window consumes virtually the entire Org-Mode view, covering virtually all of the tasks I&#x27;m working on.
 I manually resize it when I need to. However, it would be better if the agenda consumed no more than 50% of the available Org-Mode real estate.
 I&#x27;ve been trying to find a setting to configure to limit the agenda&#x27;s vertical height to no more than 50% of the available window space. That is, the top half of the Org window would contain my tasks, and the bottom half would contain my agenda.
 Is this possible?

 does anyone allready have such a function in emacs?
 I&#x27;d love to be shown a direction if you know of such existing tools or attemps...

                              <span>I have been using lsp-mode with ccls in general. 
 Now I am looking at a large code base, and I need to go to definitions outside the file I am editting.
 It seems functions like xref-find-definitions only works for the function in the headers or the same file fiel I am editting. So too with the other lsp-mode functions I am tried.
 Is there some setting I have to set to make it search the whole project? Or some extra p[ackage to install?
 If not can someone suggest what the latest present day tags/package is. I am using etags and that seems kind of creaky.

                              <span>Hi,
 I just got back into dev mode for a few days for the job and I just noticed that narrowing with consult-imenu does not seem to work on my setup (see below). Tested with a Python code base and a C code base. In other consult cases, the narrowing feature works perfectly (consult-buffer, consult-org, consult-flymake). I don&#x27;t know since when it does not work for consult-imenu because I discovered the narrowing feature in consult only a few months ago, and only got the opportunity to try the feature on a code base/consult-imenu since yesterday. Anyone else is having this behavior ?
 I can open an issue on Github if needed. I didn&#x27;t do it yet because the code for consult-imenu has not changed for 4 months, and since I could not find any complaint about this, I suspect it might be related to my personal setup. So I wanted to probe the community first before bothering minad.
 My setup
  
Emacs 29.3, compiled by myself
 consult version 20240420.929, from Melpa
  
The steps to reproduce the issue
  
open a Python or C file in Emacs, with a lot of functions and variable
 hit M-x consult-imenu
 a nice, searchable, consult prompt shows up with all the functions/modules/variable tagged appropriately
 hit the narrow key (&lt; in my case)
  
Expected result
 There should be either a which-key frame showing the next key to type, or, if I&#x27;m quick enough, either I should be able to type f, and according to the consult-imenu code, it should filter on the functions only.
 Actual result
 &lt; or &lt;f are taken literally, like a conventional search pattern.

                              <span>Hi all. I would like to prevent backups within a certain directory for security reasons. I thought I could achieve this with a dir.locals.el file, e.g.,  ((nil . ((backup-inhibited . t)) ))  but when I open emacs it asks me if I want to apply that setting as it is not considered a safe local variable. Is there a safe way to achieve this. I guess I could make backup-inhibited a safe local variable, but I&#x27;m concerned whether this will lead to security issues. What&#x27;s the safest way to disable backups within a directory?

                              <span>Hi everyone! I&#x27;m a new-ish Emacs user (~1 year) and I&#x27;ve just started using the emacs-jupyter package for writing Python code. I used to write (too many) jupyter notebooks with VSCode but I find that I can organize my code &amp; notes better with org documents and just simple Python files. I started using emacs-jupyter after reading Martí Bosch&#x27;s blog on the topic. My current workflow is just opening up a python file (or write a new one), then running &#x60;jupyter-run-repl&#x60; and then &#x60;jupyter-repl-associate-buffer&#x60;. Then I do execute a region or execute line-by-line via &#x60;jupyter-eval-line-or-region&#x60; bound to &#x60;C-c C-c&#x60;. The thing with this workflow is that the jupyter REPL gets quite long as I&#x27;m tweaking little things about the graphs or visualization I&#x27;m working on. Is there a better workflow that people use for doing this kind of work? I also can&#x27;t find a way to clear the jupyter REPL that I&#x27;m working on.

                              <span>If I have a nested Object and I want to mock it to test the outer, I read I had to define a trait which the nested implemented, mock that trait, and the outer will “automatically” use this mock, but it does not, it’s calling the objects function instead of the thenReturn I defined for the mock. Any recommendations?

                              <span>org-ql is great. I use orq-ql-find all the time to quickly find something. One thing I&#x27;m missing is that org-ql-find doesn&#x27;t seem to support live preview of search results (like org-agenda and org-ql-search do). Is this really true? Or is there some problem in my configuration?

                              <span>This is the comment -&gt; &quot;Haskell was unironically the easiest programming language for me to learn, and remains the easiest programming language for me to read and write. I&#x27;ll explain why. Every other programming language forces the programmer to keep track of time in order to read and write the code. There is a notion of when things happen that needs to be considered, and this often makes it hard to re-use code and leads to unexpected interactions. Haskell code, on the other hand, requires no notion of time. Haskell code is tenseless, inert. Haskell code doesn&#x27;t do things. Haskell code merely means things. That made it easier to learn, read, and write than other languages like Java or even Python and Javascript.&quot;
 This is the link to the comment -&gt; https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/s/uhjWTq0rRb
 I was curious if there&#x27;s any resource that helps you learn haskell the same way the commentor learned. Or if there&#x27;s some blog posts which teaches you how to look at Haskell language similar to the commentators perspective

                              <span>Recently I found some users of our app where getting issues, and it seemed to be because libpq was throwing exceptions when database connections were dropping out. I did try to investigate the cause of these dropouts, and I changed some connection pool settings I thought were a bit funky, but then I realised no matter what I can do, database connections CAN drop out. Temporary network outages, whatever, the real world isn&#x27;t perfect.
 So instead of just letting this exception just bubble up, I should be catching and retrying. 
 So then I got reading about runtime exceptions in Haskell. And I found there are broadly two categories:
  
Asynchronous
 Synchronous
  
Asynchronous come from other threads, and you don&#x27;t want to catch and retry those. These are like another thread asking you to fin…</span>

                              <span>Hi there,
 I have this code (it is an adaptation of gnus-delay.el for working with notmuch) that sets up some timer (like &quot;every 5 minutes&quot;) that then chains an idle timer. The attempted result is &quot;every 5 minutes, then when idle for 30 seconds; rinse and repeat&quot;.
 (defvar notmuch-delay-timer-scheduled nil &quot;The current timer for the scheduled run.&quot;) (defvar notmuch-delay-timer-idle nil &quot;The current timer for the idle run.&quot;) (defun notmuch-delay-scheduled-runner () (unless (memq notmuch-delay-timer-idle timer-idle-list) (setq notmuch-delay-timer-idle (run-with-idle-timer 30 nil #&#x27;notmuch-delay-send-queue)))) ;;;###autoload (defun notmuch-delay-initialize () (unless (memq notmuch-delay-timer-scheduled timer-list) (setq notmuch-delay-timer-scheduled (run-at-time t 300 #&#x27;notmuch-delay-scheduled-runner)))) 
 The code works. But I can&#x27;t remove the feeling that there must be a much nicer way to do this properly or more Lispy.
 I would imagine I could use one single var with &#x60;car&#x60; and &#x60;cdr&#x60; thus having both timers there; but that&#x27;s still two timers and two functions.
 Any ideas?
 Chaining the idle timer after the scheduled one is to make sure that I am not working in Emacs when notmuch-delay-send-queue is called.

                              <span>I would like to participate more in Emacs-related mailing lists, occasionally without subscribing to them. I have recently sent an email to help-gnu-emacs, which I am not subscribed to, and received replies judging by the mailing list archive but those replies never landed in my inbox. Is the mailing list etiquette not to reply to the person specifically but only to the mailing list? This makes little sense to me since non-subscribing users would miss emails in this case, but I have also checked that I am able to receive emails at the address that I used. Now I would like to reply back, and I am thinking of replying using the mailing list archive. Is there something I should do to ensure that I receive the replies in my inbox? (I am still not subscribed to help-gnu-emacs.)

                              <span>The whole concept of &quot;emacs as an operating system&quot;, i.e. building applications like org-mode inside the editor, and using regular editor text buffers as the software interface is super interesting to me.
 I think this might be the direction I want to go in for a lot of custom personal software that I build for myself.
 So I&#x27;d like to learn a little more about the subject, but I&#x27;m struggling to find the right terminology to search the web for.
 I&#x27;m not an emacs user currently, I only ever tinkered with it for a few hours to try out org-mode many many years ago. So this probably doesn&#x27;t help.
  
Some questions:
  
1) Are there any commonly used concise terms around this whole &quot;editor as an application interface&quot; concept in general? 
 ...it could be either specific to emacs, or more broadly for other editors too.
 
e.g. We have some pretty common terms like &quot;CLI, TUI, GUI, desktop-app, web-based, mobile-app&quot; etc that are used to quite clearly denote the all the common interfaces...
 So I&#x27;m hoping there&#x27;s some easily-Google-searchable short term for this stuff too?
 
 2) If you know of any specific guides/learning resources on the topic, please share a link (or name I can search).
 3) I&#x27;m guessing that emacs is the #1 GOAT when it comes to how well it can do this stuff? But curious what other editors can also do this, and how they compare in abilities?
 4) Amongst the variants of emacs, which is best for this? For my use case it needs to work just as well on Windows as Linux.
 5) Also feel free to share any personal anecdotes on what discovering this paradigm meant to you personally. 
 Including where you&#x27;ve seen big improvements in usability/efficiency etc
 And maybe also were there any specific use cases where you over-estimated how useful it would be? And you went back to the mainstream types of interface for something?

                              <span>We decided to promote this minor release to stable. It comes with some updates:
  
Support for the -Xsource:3-cross compiler option 
 Improved support for Scala 3 export clauses and extension methods 
 Fixes to given and using clauses in some corner cases
  
... and a few more. Go to Settings | Plugins and update. Happy developing :)

                              <span>Hello, I am currently working as a software engineer using typelevel scala stack and I am wondering what is the most straightforward way to get hired as a Data Engineer consultant on Spark technologies. I have a solid understanding of distributed and streaming systems, is it enough to create side projects on my github utilizing the Spark streaming / kubernetes / Kafka or there is some kind of certification that is trustworthy for recruiters?

                              <span>Hello all, 
 Here&#x27;s an app I wrote for myself and have been using for some time .. and with some encouragement decided to clean up and release for anyone else who might find it useful. 
 It&#x27;s a windows task switcher with first class support for search, and much more responsive and feature-rich than the windows default.
 Its built with Rust and Tauri for backend, and uses direct ScalaJS for frontend w no other framework.
 Repo is https://github.com/yakrider/switche/
 The Readme there has all the necessary info to &#x27;git gud&#x27; with it, incl configuring hotkeys and features. 
 Screenshot of this first-ever-released version 2.2.7 is below. 
 Try it out and hopefully it might be useful for some of ya&#x27;ll. 
 I&#x27;m happy to field bug reports, questions, concerns, feedback of any kind.
 Cheers!

                              <span>For those who don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m talking about, I don&#x27;t blame you. It&#x27;s basically only referenced in this talk by Odersky from ScalaDays and random discussion threads scattered that only reference that talk. It mentions a new research project on algebraic effects called Caprese (Capabilities for Resources and Effects). 
 I was confused about the discourse around this project because some people have stated that it&#x27;s already making its way into scala 3, but I haven&#x27;t seen any kind of technical details, documentation, talks, or anything else I would expect from what appears to some to be a big change for the language. 
 Honestly I&#x27;m mostly just excited and want to know more. Especially since a lot of people I respect seem to see this as a possible avenue for resolving some of the bigger issues with scala like fragmentation/effort duplication and the poor ergonomics and high skill barrier of IO and tagless final. 
 Anyone have any good articles or resources that actually dive into the topic more and explore how it could affect library design in the future?

 I&#x27;m a teacher using org-agenda and org mode extensively for planning class and lessons and all. I have a list of tasks that come by daily during class days that clutters the weekly and monthly views. 
 These entries are all in the same CATEGORY. I&#x27;d like to find a way to keep these entries only in daily view, where they matter the most. Do you think it is possible ?

                              <span>I do now know Haskell (I somehow managed to avoid it at university, and my favorite language is C).
 But I want to use sv2v (A System Verilog to Verilog translator), which is written in Haskell. The Makefile uses Haskell Stack. I&#x27;ve tried on three Debian GNU/Linux testing systems:
  
amd64 - works fine.
 arm64 - ran into issues not obvious to a non-Haskell user https://github.com/zachjs/sv2v/issues/282
 ppc64 - ran into issues not obvious to a non-Haskell user https://github.com/zachjs/sv2v/issues/283
  
I don&#x27;t tend to see such problem with programs written in C - for a simple program, I just use the C compiler on whatever system I want to compile the C program on and that&#x27;s it; for more complex programs people tend to ship a configure script that works (or tells me what to install if a dependency is missing).
 Now I wonder if the issues I saw are sv2v-specific, or a wider protability problem with programs written in Haskell.

                              <span>Hi. I&#x27;m working on learning Haskell for personal enrichment. I already know OCaml rather well and use it for personal projects, so Haskell comes fairly easily. (except those compiler messages are brutal for newbs)
 However, there is kind of an uncanny valley for me between the Haskell one learns in tutorials and the Haskell (and GHC tricks) one is actually supposed to use to write software. Some examples:
  
Don&#x27;t actually use String, use ByteString
 In fact don&#x27;t use lists at all when performance counts.
 Except obviously for iteration, when fusion is applicable. 
 which, I don&#x27;t know when that is.
 
 sprinkle around strictness annotations and seq liberally. 
 also not really sure when to do that.
 
 Of course if you are doing X, you will definitely use pragma Y.
  
I&#x27;m also interested to find out about the 3rd-party libraries &quot;everyone&quot; uses. e.g. in Python, requests is more or less the &quot;standard&quot; http client, rather than the one in the standard library. In OCaml, you use the Re package for regex, never the Str module in the standard library because it&#x27;s not thread safe and is super stateful.
 I wish to know these kinds of things that &quot;real&quot; Haskell programmers know. Got any relevant links?

                              <span>Applicative captures lifting n-ary functions over n independent computations. These functions all have an Applicative constraint, except unary lifting which requires the weaker Functor.
 liftA0 :: (a) -&gt; (f a) liftF1 :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; (f a -&gt; f b) liftA2 :: (a -&gt; b -&gt; c) -&gt; (f a -&gt; f b -&gt; f c) liftA3 :: (a -&gt; b -&gt; c -&gt; d) -&gt; (f a -&gt; f b -&gt; f c -&gt; f d) liftA4 :: .. 
 This family of lifting functions can be captured using list-indexed datatypes. Pairs [a, b, c] is a fancy way to write tuples (a, b, c), and Products f [a, b, c] is isomorphic to (f a, f b, f c). Pairs is a special case of Products Identity.
 class Functor f &#x3D;&gt; Lifting f where {-# minimal lifting #-} lifting :: (Pairs as -&gt; res) -&gt; (Products f as -&gt; f res)

 It doesn&#x27;t work; can anyone get this working? C-h C-v shows the correct overridden value, it just isn&#x27;t used by org.

                              <span>After updating to Fedora 40 and KDE 6, F10 in emacs is triggering the file menu, ignoring my definition. This seems to be emacs doing it because disabling F10 as a shortcut at the OS level doesn&#x27;t help. The only way I&#x27;ve found to get F10 back is to disable menu-bar-mode. Is there a less drastic fix?

                              <span>I wondered if any of you have, or need, measures or features to adapt Emacs to a wide screen view?
 Packages like olivetti-mode, golden-ratio and the lakes tries to style buffers to make them more pleasantly readable. I have even tried out vertico-posframe, which is a good idea, but haven&#x27;t worked much in it yet, and I have feeling it will break some workflows, or maybe be obstructive.
 Have you tried &quot;center&quot; the minibuffer output, so your eyes don&#x27;t have to travel to the bottom corner every time you invoke an interactive command?
 I know this is very much about ergonomics and work positions too ... but still wondered enough to ask.

                              <span>Hi, I have a very weird vim workflow and would love to port it to emacs, org in particular. I had my emacs phase but am a strong vim user for plenty of years.
 For less distraction, I use a Windows 7 laptop at home, while I use a modern Linux one for work. I manage all my TODOs and Notes via vim on a server that I can access from both via ssh/mosh.
 I have plenty of vim tabs per instance, and several instances. All in a named tmux session that I can attach/unattach everytime I want to read it, so that I never have to actually reopen them. I thus have &quot;built a GUI&quot; by permanently using the same tmux splits.
 How would I do this in emacs (tui)? - I know that remote editing would usually be done via TRAMP, but I really want to keep the window open on the server. - Emacs within tmux is clunky because of overlapping bindings and nested terminal emulation. - I am confused on the differences of emacs server vs emacs daemon?

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently testing gnus over mu4e for my mail needs in emacs and am liking it a lot so far. One thing i&#x27;m trying to work out though, is how i can make the article summary a bit easier to parse. Two things i&#x27;m looking for:
  
There seem to be three &quot;Date&quot; options. &quot;%D&quot; as the date from the header, &quot;%d&quot; as an Article Date with only Month and day, and &quot;%o&quot; as the article Date in a long unseparated format. Is there any option to get a custom date format in there? %D is super verbose, including also timezone and such. &quot;%o&quot; is hard to parse as a non-separated string. &quot;%d&quot; is not enough granularity
 Can individual parts of the summary line be bolded or italizised? I&#x27;m looking to have the From Adress in Bold to better find it. If that&#x27;s not possible, i guess i have to work with fixed width &quot;blocks&quot; to make it somewhat into a table.
  
Any other great tips for a gnus &quot;newcomer&quot; that you found to be valuable?

                              <span>After getting some useful tips about using clock tables for my time reporting needs I&#x27;ve setup everything and basically it works pretty fine. My only problem is that the table shows the full hierarchy to a task.
 so if I have something like this:
 * Administration ** Meetings *** Weekly meetings :LOGBOOK: * Specification ** WIP *** Tasks **** Task 1 :LOGBOOK: **** Task 2 :LOGBOOK: 
 When I now create a clock table It would look like this (this is the compact view):
 | Headline | Time | |-------------------------------+--------| | *Total time* | *3:20* | |-------------------------------+--------| | Administration | 0:32 | | \_ Meetings | 0:32 | | \_ Weekly Meetings | 0:32 | | Specification | 2:48 | | \_ WIP | 2:48 | | \_ Tasks | 2:48 | | \_ Task 1 | 1:35 | | \_ Task 2 | 1:13 | 
 What I would prefer is something like this
 | Headline | Time | |-------------------------------+--------| | *Total time* | *3:20* | |-------------------------------+--------| | Weekly Meetings | 0:32 | | Task 1 | 1:35 | | Task 2 | 1:13 | 
 How could I do that?

                              <span>I am going through the Emacs Lisp Intro manual to consolidate my Elisp knowledge. In the &quot;More Complex&quot; section, the function &quot;copy-to-buffer&quot; is suggested as a case study. I will include it here for your reference:
 (defun copy-to-buffer (buffer start end) &quot;Copy to specified BUFFER the text of the region.&quot; (interactive &quot;BCopy to buffer: \nr&quot;) (let ((oldbuf (current-buffer))) (with-current-buffer (get-buffer-create buffer) (barf-if-buffer-read-only) (erase-buffer) (save-excursion (insert-buffer-substring oldbuf start end))))) 
 Perhaps I do not understand well how the save-excursion works. But, since we are setting temporarily the current buffer to the &quot;buffer&quot; argument by using the &quot;with-current-buffer&quot;, and we are erasing its contents with &quot;erase-buffer&quot;, why do we use &quot;save-excursion&quot;?
 After we use &quot;erase-buffer&quot; don&#x27;t we get point, point-min and point-max set to 1?
 It seems to me that it is just redundant to save the excursion inside the empty buffer when all the points have the value 1. Then why do we do that?
 Thank you very much.
 EDIT: I think that I understand the reason of save-excursion in this case. It is a user-friendly feature. It ensures that after pasting the text in the empty buffer, the point is set back to the value 1. I guess it is a just to avoid confusing the user by having the point set to point-max. When the user switches to the buffer where the selection was pasted, the users will see the beginning of the buffer instead of the end. Please feel free to correct me if you have a better explanation.

                              <span>I&#x27;m using evil-mode in vterm buffers so when I switch to normal state and go around in buffer and then do any command that alters the vterm window settings (scaling it vertically or horizontal, running vertico switching perspectives etc ) the point goes to the end of buffer. but when I use term it doesn&#x27;t do that, the point stays in the same place no matter what I do to the buffer window. I did the tests with no commands running.
 can I change that behaviour in vterm ?

                              <span>My emacs keeps segfaulting upon start-up. It happens about 50% of the time when I type emacs in the terminal. Looking here:
 https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Crashing.html
 a backtrace of some sort should be generated, but this is all I see:
 % emacs . Fatal error 11: Segmentation fault zsh: abort /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs . 
 I&#x27;m running a version off of the 29 stable branch.

                              <span>As an freelance agile coach and trainer I tend to collect lots of information and to develop numerus ideas to improve the WoW and my lectures. Besides that i have a broad interest in history, politics and Science. In my search to structure all this information and help me in a more structured way of thinking about what is usefull and how to use it I came along the Zettelkasten.
It looks like a (the?) solution which can help me out. To give it a kickstart i&#x27;m doing at the moment the introduction course with Sacha.

                              <span>Hi,
 Previously I had Java working with lsp-mode. Experimenting with tree-sitter recently has caused this to break.
 I&#x27;m using Emacs 29.2 on a Mac.
 My lsp-mode config is very basic:
 (use-package lsp-mode :ensure t :hook (lsp-mode . lsp-lens-mode) (lsp-mode . lsp-enable-which-key-integration) :config (setq lsp-prefer-flymake nil lsp-client-packages &#x27;(lsp-clients lsp-metals))) 
 And lsp-java:
 (use-package lsp-java :ensure t :init :config (add-hook &#x27;java-mode-hook &#x27;lsp) (add-hook &#x27;java-ts-mode-hook &#x27;lsp) (add-to-list &#x27;lsp-language-id-configuration &#x27;(java-ts-mode . &quot;java&quot;))) 
 However, when I open a Java file I get:
  
LSP :: There are no language servers supporting current mode java-ts-mode&#x27; registered withlsp-mode&#x27;.
  
Clearly the major mode is different with tree-sitter, it&#x27;s now &#x27;java-ts-mode&#x27;. Looking in lsp-java.el though, I do see this in the &#x27;lsp-register-client&#x27; function:
  :major-modes &#x27;(java-mode java-ts-mode jdee-mode) 
 There is obviously something else I&#x27;m missing. Any help is appreciated.

                              <span>I have this compile function to open the compile in a smaller size, and if i run again the C-c C-c it closes:
 (defun my-compile () (interactive) (let* ((current-window (selected-window)) (compile-buffer (get-buffer-create &quot;*compilation*&quot;)) (compile-buffer-window (get-buffer-window compile-buffer))) (if compile-buffer-window (progn (delete-window compile-buffer-window) (kill-buffer compile-buffer)) (let* ((compile-window-height (/ (window-total-height) 4)) (compile-command (read-from-minibuffer &quot;Compile command: &quot;))) (select-window (split-window-below (- compile-window-height))) (switch-to-buffer compile-buffer) (select-window current-window) (compile compile-command))))) (global-set-key (kbd &quot;C-c C-c&quot;) &#x27;my-compile) 
 However, when I&#x27;m in a python file, this bind doesn&#x27;t run correctly: python-shell-get-process-or-error: Start a Python process first with M-x run-python or ‘C-c C-p’
 But if I run the default emacs compile: M-x compile It works correctly, why? Is there a way to make this function of mine behave the same way as the native emacs compile? I like how it turned out because it doesn&#x27;t open a large buffer and it makes it much easier when I want to run a file.

                              <span>View PDF with intact image, but want dark mode(text and background inverted)
 This is possible in some pdf reader like acrobat
 aim : pdf tools night mode NOT inverting image
 trouble shoot : 3 options were availiable by tweaking variables
 1st : no night mode
 2nd : night mode, invert image(chromatic image)
 3rd : night mode, invert image(monotnous image)
 since 2nd 3rd option&#x27;s difference is only on images
 It may be possible to not invert image.
 thank for reply

                              <span>Hello,
 I am using a eshell as primary shell (for years…). But suddenly one thing starts to irritate me, that when pressing up or down, it lists the history of commands. I want to disable it (and use arrows for moving in the buffer), so I tried:
 (define-key eshell-mode-map (kbd &quot;&quot;) nil) 
 But somehow it&#x27;s not working. The original behavior remains....
 What is the trick then?

                              <span>So if I get the type of foldl
 λ&gt; :t foldl foldl :: Foldable t &#x3D;&gt; (b -&gt; a -&gt; b) -&gt; b -&gt; t a -&gt; b 
 I see it takes three arguments, the first is a function, the second the accumulator, and the third a list. Then the result is of type b. Could someone decipher, first, why the function uses two type variables a and b? If the function is binary commutative addition (+), why can&#x27;t the description just be (a -&gt; a -&gt; a)? And the accumulator is type b, again, why not just type a? And what is being indicated by t a? The Foldable t means t must be a type for which Foldable has an instance. Again, why this t a notation?

                              <span>I have been trying to get svg to work, but I noticed on my macos it was not rendering the icons properly. For example, I tried to change the background color of the PROJ heading, but it does not seem to change no matter what. I also tried running the svg-lib-demo.org, but it did not change the colors.
 ;; TODO / DONE (&quot;TODO&quot; . ((lambda (tag) (svg-tag-make &quot;TODO&quot; :face &#x27;org-todo :inverse t :margin 0)))) (&quot;NEXT&quot; . ((lambda (tag) (svg-tag-make &quot;NEXT&quot; :face &#x27;org-todo :inverse t :margin 0)))) (&quot;PROJ&quot; . ((lambda (tag) (svg-tag-make &quot;PROJ&quot; :inverse t :margin 0 :foreground &quot;#0FF000&quot; :background &quot;#FF5733&quot;)))) 
 I also noticed that the text in the icons is a little above and not centered. I was wondering if anyone had been able to figure out how to correct this in vanilla emacs.

                              <span>Hi. I want to know if there&#x27;s some way of remove or prevent the whitespaces before and after each column separator in a table in org-mode. For example, I wish this table:
 | name | age | country | |------+-----+---------| | john | 21 | usa | 
 would be like this:
 |name|age|country| |----+---+-------| |john|21 |usa | 
 Thanks, in advance.

                              <span>After I previously enabled treesitter imenu support and rewrote the simple imenu configuration variables, I decided I wanted to tinker a bit more and produce more hierarchical results.
 The two images are before on the left vs afterwards on the right.
 Note the constructors, methods, inner classes are placed as items under the class. I also discovered the builtin rules misclassified enums nodetype and fixed that as well. Finally, although I normally adjust the faces to all black/gray I&#x27;ve left it at the default to highlight something odd about the treesitter node creation code. Based on some unknown code path about half the time the node names come with the original properties including faces and the rest of the time they are plain text.
 Some sample in progress code.

                              <span>In my daily work I often work for clients that need me to track and report my time based on what exactly I did in a project. Like Meetings, coding feature x, writing documentation, ... On the other hand my employer has a project which is just assigned to the project I do for the customer. So it is basically a hierarchy with two levels:
 * TODO employer project ** TODO customer Meetings ** TODO customer Coding ** TODO customer Documenting 
 So at the end of the day I need to tell the customer the more granular times and the employer the overall times.
 What I want to have is a feature where I clock in on the customer todos but can also see a daily aggregation on the employer todo. How could I do that in org mode?
 It would be also awesome if I could have the customer todos in a different file and just &quot;backlink&quot; them to the employer todo which is in its own separate file

                              <span>Hi all, I&#x27;m hoping you might be able to help me out with this. My sister was diagnosed with a progressive auto-immune disease not to long ago. To simplify things, she has started to develop arthritis-like symptoms that will get progressively worse, and she will lose her vision over time. 
 She&#x27;s not very technical, but I know there are a lot of interesting ergonomics modes like xah-fly-keys, or even just spacemacs style bindings with a leader key. I&#x27;d love some recommendations for relatively easy to learn ergonomics systems that might be less intimidating to newer users. Right now I&#x27;m leaning towards spacemacs because that seems the easiest way for someone who would probably be pretty put off by editing an init.el right out of the gate. 
 I also thought that over time she could augment this with speech to text as well as text to speech. I know that there are a number of emacs tools like emacsspeak, but I remember seeing a video on youtube where someone had some hooks into a google text to speech library, and was using ai to send audio clips to chat gpt.If that rings a bell for anyone, please let me know what they were using. I haven&#x27;t been able to find it, but I&#x27;d love any other recommendations or thoughts there as well. 
 Anyway, thanks in advance!

                              <span>Simple example:
  
Given a list of integers, build a list that only contains numbers whose value n is less than 4
  
Ignoring &quot;high level&quot; declarative functions such as seq-filter, what&#x27;s the best way to build a list step by step? AFAIK, each call to append takes O(n) where n is the numbers of elements in the list. Also keeping a reference of the last cons of the list in order to nconc it might be frowned upon, as it is a destructive operation.

                              <span>Is there a way to somehow apply flycheck across various org-mode code blocks given that you are only using one language for all of them? I want flycheck to essentially treat the contents of the code blocks as one file.

                              <span>I was presented with Haskell in this semester (I&#x27;m in the second semester of college). It was functional paradigma time to learn. All my friends hate it. At first, I didn&#x27;t like it too. I found it weird, since the first language that I had contact with was C and it is much different from Haskell. Besides, my teacher wasn&#x27;t a good professor, so this made things worse. But instead of saying that this language is useless, I decided to give it a chance, since there might be a reason I&#x27;m supposed to learn it. After that, I end up enjoying Haskell and started viewing it as a new tool and a different approach to solve problems. I told my friends that I would continue to learn Haskell and read books about it during vacation time, and they laughed at me, told me that it is useless, that I&#x27;m just wasting my time, that Haskell has no real life application and that I should learn Java if I wanna get a job (we&#x27;ll learn Java next semester). I felt discouraged because I DO wanna get a job. My mom works very hard so I can only study, and I want as soon as I can be able to financially help her (or at least help her a bit). What I am asking is if learning Haskell will help me in the future somehow or am I just being naive?

                              <span>You can download binaries for this pre-release from: Release rc/v2.15.6.1 · commercialhaskell/stack · GitHub.
 Please test it and let us know at the Stack repository if you run into any trouble. If all goes well, we hope to release the final version soon, as the changes are made to allow a released version of Stack to build with the coming GHC 9.10.
 Release notes:
  
This release fixes potential bugs.
  
Changes since v2.15.5:
 Major changes: 
  
Stack 2.15.5 and earlier cannot build with Cabal (the library) version 3.12.0.0. Stack can now build with that Cabal version.
  
Behaviour changes: 
  
Stack’s StackSetupShim executable, when called with repl and stack-initial-build-steps, no longer uses Cabal’s replHook to apply initialBuildSteps but takes a more direct approach.
  
Bug fixes:
  
Fix a regression introduced in Stack 2.15.1 that caused a ‘no operation’ stack build to be slower than previously.

                              <span>But I’m a bit worried about investing time in it. I feel like there is a big need for Kafka/Data Engineering in general, and I’ll be using Scala for Spark in my new role. Do you use Scala to anything besides Kafka/Spark? Does Kafka really integrate well with Scala’s FP, or is it only an API for data extraction into tabular data schemas?
 Last question, 
 if you were to become a scala developer now, would you invest much time into quirks and features of scala, or would you spend more time to become a badass data engineer with more tools (pyspark, cloud, kubernetes, kafka [architecture wise])

                              <span>i used to use notepad++ for journaling then shifted to writing in vscode and then after a good while a month ago i came across doom emacs. i have set it up on my windows 10 and it works well but i that&#x27;s it. i don&#x27;t know how to navigte,what packages are... how do i install a new package. how to set it up. for instance i tried to install a package called &#x27;el easy draw&#x27; because somehow i don&#x27;t have &#x27;git clone&#x27; command in doom emacs and i dont know why hence i manually opened it up from file manager and fired up git bash in .emacs.d folder to cloned it manually and after that i added config lines into config file. used doom/reload coomand and nothing works. it&#x27;s been three days of me trying to set up doom emacs i was earlier trying to configure org-roam and left it in middle because that didn&#x27;t work too. either give me a guide on how to learn these things.

                              <span>So I&#x27;m trying eglot and I&#x27;ve just enabled it manually while I&#x27;m still trying and figuring things out with &#x60;M-x eglot&#x60; in my Main.java file. Things seem to work and it is really doing a good job so far! My only issue is, if I try to &quot;go to definition&quot; of one of the builtin classes or the ones that are provided from maven, it doesn&#x27;t go there as expected. For instance, &#x60;import picocli.CommandLine.Command&#x60; if the cursor is on Command and I try to go to definition, it just doesn&#x27;t go there and the minibuffer highlights the Command part for a second. The same thing for the java builtin methods. such as System.out.println. Is there a way to make them work?

                              <span>Hi all! 
 I&#x27;ve had this bug for some time now, this is what I&#x27;ve got:
 symptom: in the shell, when asked for password, prompt shows in minibuffer, then quits a second or two later (while I&#x27;m typing said password) leading to only the later half of my password being typed in clear text. 
 comint-watch-for-password-prompt runs comint-send-invisible in a (run-at-time 0 nil ...). If I replace run-at-time by the lambda content it is supposed to run, no more bug. If I replace 0 by 1 or 0.1, no more bug either. For values under 0.01 bug is back.
 If I add &quot;lol&quot; at the end of comint-watch-for-password-prompt, so that run-at-time&#x27;s cancelable timer is not returned to the caller, the bug still happens, so... it&#x27;s not quitting because somebody is canceling the timer. 
 So, what do I with this? 
 for reference, here is the function I&#x27;m talking about:
 (defun comint-watch-for-password-prompt (string) &quot;Prompt in the minibuffer for password and send without echoing. Looks for a match to &#x60;comint-password-prompt-regexp&#x27; in order to detect the need to (prompt and) send a password. Ignores any carriage returns (\\r) in STRING. This function could be in the list &#x60;comint-output-filter-functions&#x27;.&quot; (when (let ((case-fold-search t)) (string-match comint-password-prompt-regexp (string-replace &quot;\r&quot; &quot;&quot; string))) ;; Use &#x60;run-at-time&#x27; in order not to pause execution of the ;; process filter with a minibuffer (run-at-time 0.1 nil (lambda (current-buf) (with-current-buffer current-buf (let ((comint--prompt-recursion-depth (1+ comint--prompt-recursion-depth))) (if (&gt; comint--prompt-recursion-depth 10) (message &quot;Password prompt recursion too deep&quot;) (when (get-buffer-process (current-buffer)) (comint-send-invisible (string-trim string &quot;[ \n\r\t\v\f\b\a]+&quot; &quot;\n+&quot;))))))) (current-buffer))))

                              <span>tldr: Don&#x27;t upgrade your tree-sitter library, otherwise Emacs will crash when loading it. If you&#x27;ve already upgraded tree-sitter, either a) roll back to v0.22.2, or b) rebuild Emacs. If you use a package manager, uninstalling and reinstalling Emacs should rebuild Emacs.
 The latest version of tree-sitter library is binary-incompatible with the previous version, but the ABI version remains unchanged. That means package managers will simply replace the old libtree-sitter.so file with the new one. Then when Emacs runs, this binary-incompatible libtree-sitter.so is loaded and crashes Emacs.
 What should&#x27;ve happened is for tree-sitter to bump the ABI version; then package managers would install the new libtree-sitter.so file alongside the old libtree-sitter.so, rather than replacing it. And Emacs will still load the old libtree-sitter.so. 
 Rebuilding Emacs will resolve this issue since Emacs and tree-sitter remain compatible on the source level. Rebuild the Emacs binary and it&#x27;ll be compatible with the new tree-sitter binary.

 (I&#x27;ll note that please don&#x27;t reply in the GitHub issue unless you have constructive things to add.)

                              <span>Hi!
 I checked the widget library in emacs and I would like to know what is the concern about use this library ?
 Nobody who write a new mode/package use the widgets.
 I think to use this library for the setting it is reasonable but every package creator prefer the &quot;code&quot; based setting.
 I know I can use the customize-variable to set a variable but to create a custom page with widget to setup a module/mode/function should be a good point for the newbies.
 Is there a plan to use GTK based widget in the future ? :)

                              <span>Hello i am quite new to the Emacs and I&#x27;m wondering if there is any mode that helps me using Emacs keybindings more effectively, for example:
 when i try to move next on the buffer with arrow keys a mode that informs and corrects me with notifications like you can use C-n for that. 
 If there is any mode like this it will be very beneficial for me. 
 Thanks in advance

 It would be cool to have a ripgrep or FTS -like search for Emacs manuals, because I often don&#x27;t know where to find what I&#x27;m searching for in advance, or maybe want to look up a variable/function name described ...

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently trying to rely more on emacs for file browsing and stumbled upon the openwith package. It allows the user to specify which programs to use for opening which file types, and the choice is respected by find-file and dired-find-file. This is super useful as there are some file types which I never want to open in emacs. 
 The following config is more or less taken from github and tells emacs to open &quot;doc&quot;, &quot;xls&quot;, ... with &quot;libreoffice&quot;:
 (use-package openwith :config (setq openwith-associations (list (list (openwith-make-extension-regexp &#x27;(&quot;doc&quot; &quot;xls&quot; &quot;ppt&quot; &quot;odt&quot; &quot;ods&quot; &quot;odg&quot; &quot;odp&quot;)) &quot;libreoffice&quot; &#x27;(file)) )) :init (openwith-mode 1)) 
 Unfortunately, it requires me to explicitly specify which program to use for which file and does not seem to work when I replace &quot;libreoffice&quot; with &quot;xdg-open&quot;. Does anybody know why or whether there are any alternative packages that do something similar but work with xdg-open?

                              <span>I keep my org-directory separate from the location of my Org-roam notes files. I&#x27;d like to quickly search my Org-roam files for nodes with various TODO states. 
 How can I do this in an efficient way via org-ql (I can use rgrep to achieve something similar)? 
 Using org-ql-search interactively allows me to choose &quot;all&quot; files/directories, which is too broad. There doesn&#x27;t seem to be universal argument support, so I can&#x27;t pass the directory via &quot;C-u&quot;.
 I&#x27;ve also tried the org-roam-ql package, but for whatever reason, this doesn&#x27;t seem able to return the correct results -- maybe all the nodes have to be proper Org-roam nodes, with a corresponding org-id?

                              <span>Hello,
 I setup treesitter months ago and everything was working fine. However, earlier today I opened a file using the &#x60;js-ts-mode&#x60; and my entire emacs session was killed. I have been able to track this down to whenever I use a treesitter based major mode, not just &#x60;js-ts-mode&#x60;. I don&#x27;t know if this was caused by me updating my packages or something else (I am using Void Linux btw). Any idea how to resolve this issue?

                              <span>Let&#x27;s say I have a record type like
 data PosInt &#x3D; PosInt { getInt :: Int } 
 and I want to maintain some invariance about it. Here, that the wrapped Int is always positive (I know in this example I could also use a newtype but bear with me). So (I guess?) the standard approach would be to not expose the type constructor, so only the current module can construct instances of type PosInt. However, I still want to give read access to the wrapped Int, so I want to expose getInt. I might end up with something like:
 module Lib ( PosInt(getInt), setInt) where data PosInt &#x3D; PosInt { getInt :: Int } setInt :: Int -&gt; Maybe PosInt setInt x | x &gt; 0 &#x3D; Just (PosInt x) | otherwise &#x3D; Nothing 
 Now if I try to construct a PosInt outside this module, the type checker complains:
 import Lib ( PosInt(..) ) test1 :: PosInt test1 &#x3D; PosInt (-3) -- type error 
 So far so good. But given a PosInt I can actually violate my invariance using the getInt field:
 import Lib ( PosInt(..) ) test2 :: PosInt -&gt; PosInt test2 x &#x3D; x { getInt &#x3D; -3 } -- no type error 
 That caught me a bit off guard. It&#x27;s not a problem if I define getInt &quot;manually&quot;:
 data PosInt &#x3D; PosInt Int getInt :: PosInt -&gt; Int getInt (PosInt x) &#x3D; x 
 Maybe I misunderstood the role of record fields. This convention of calling them getSomething gave me the impression that they only give read access.

                              <span>Hi to all I have been following the forum and the blog for some time now, and as in multiple things in life growth is to be found inside of a community. Today I was reading about the Knowledge Cycle and taking notes and I thought to myself this forum and site is a real gold mine of people that are looking to improve the world, grow and share their knowledge.
I am a Engineering Manager, comming from a development background. And I am just addicted to learning, if anybody did a Gallup test I have Learner, Intellection and Input as the first three skills. I like to learn stuff, I like to think about stuff and I like to gorge on information, so as you may presume I am a big fan of the Collector Fallacy.
I remember when I got my first job as a web developer I learned more in 3 months than 3 yea…</span>

                              <span>Spark Connect decouples the client and the Spark driver, so the client doesn&#x27;t need the same software versions as the driver.
 If someone makes a Spark Connect Scala 3 project, then the community can start using Scala 3 with Spark.
 spark-connect-go, spark-connect-rs, and Spark Connect C# already exist.
 It&#x27;s a relatively small amount of work and would be a great way to enable devs to use Scala 3 with Spark! Reply in the comments, DM me, or email me if you&#x27;d like to work on this. Or just feel free to build it - that&#x27;s what folks have done for the other ones.

                              <span>TLDR: I&#x27;m trying to change the color of the cursor according to the enabled theme, but the color of the cursor don&#x27;t change when I start Emacs.
 Just to give a little of context I&#x27;m a web dev an currently working with a lot of css code. Emacs has a css-mode that change the background of the face of color codes meaning a { background-color: #fff } will have the #fff with a white background (just like the rainbow-mode package does). 
 The thins is that my cursor often get lost in certain color and I don&#x27;t like that so I decided to write a little of elisp to fix this (realice that a white or black cursor does the job). Also forgot to mention that I switch a lot between dark and light themes so I figure that I need to change the cursor color according to that. Doing my research came across to this https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/modus-themes/A-theme_002dagnostic-hook-for-theme-loading.html and this helped me to do the part of calling the function to change the color when I change of theme. 
 Everything work fine until I restart Emacs or open Emacs for the first time (like when I turn on my computer on my job) because the color of the cursor don&#x27;t change when Emacs start so I&#x27;m a little lost here and I&#x27;m not sure if I missing something. 
 Also I&#x27;m checking the *messages* buffers and appears that the function load correctly so.... 
 Here is the code I&#x27;m using:
 (defvar after-enable-theme-hook nil &quot;Hook to run after enabling a theme.&quot;) (defun run-after-enable-theme-hook (&amp;rest _args) &quot;Run &#x60;after-enable-theme-hook&#x27;.&quot; (message &quot;executin hook after-enable-theme-hook&quot;) (run-hooks &#x27;after-enable-theme-hook) (let* ((color-mode (frame-parameter nil &#x27;background-mode)) (cursor-color (if (eq color-mode &#x27;dark) &quot;red&quot; nil))) (set-face-attribute &#x27;cursor nil :background cursor-color))) (advice-add &#x27;enable-theme :after #&#x27;run-after-enable-theme-hook) 
 (load-theme &#x27;gruvbox-dark-hard)

                              <span>... more an annoyance really, and not elfeed&#x27;s fault at all but ...
 lemmy RSS feeds (such as &quot;https://lemmy.ml/feeds/c/emacs.xml&quot;) often (but not always) have mis-guided &quot;Link:&quot; elements which target an external link, an image file or other material instead of the lemmy post itself. Consequently, hitting &#x27;b&#x27; elfeed-search-browse-url may send one on a surprising if not always useful journey.
 eg
 Title: Keymacs, a program to generate Emacs keybindings | Plain DrOps Author: https://feddit.de/u/DrOps Date: Tue, 23 Apr 2024 23:35:25 AEST Feed: Lemmy - emacs Tags: emacs, lemmy Link: https://plaindrops.de/blog/2024/keymacs/ submitted by DrOps to emacs 8 points | 2 comments https://plaindrops.de/blog/2024/keymacs/ 
 In this case, the link to lemmy itself is in the &quot;2 comments&quot; &#x3D;&gt; https://lemmy.ml/post/14798221
 Has anyone a fix for this? It&#x27;s more likely needed at lemmy itself but given the infinite adaptability of emacs perhaps there&#x27;s a way.

 (defun find-binary (array value) (setq answer nil ) ( setq left 0) ( setq right (- (length array) 1)) (setq answer nil) (if (&#x3D; (length array) 1) (if (&#x3D; ( aref array 0) value) (setq answer 0) answer )) (if (&#x3D; (length array ) 0) (setq answer nil) answer) ; while the left element &gt; the right element (while ( (aref array middle) value) (setq right ( - middle 1))) (t (if (&#x3D; (aref array middle) value) (setq answer middle))))) answer ) 
 Could someone point out where the problems are in the code? Also, why does the &#x60;while&#x60; block never seem to stop? 
 (I noticed that emacs returns the last return value (as opposed to python where the first &#x60;return value&#x60; defines the value a function returns. I wonder if this is related, but haven&#x27;t gotten across.)
 Thank you very much.

                              <span>I just downloaded some old sources from the Internet Archive (see my other post), and found an interesting text about why you want to use Emacs (I see that question often asked here). Written back in 1991 (and still rocking):
  
We at the Applied Research Information Communications team have been working with the GNU Emacs environment for the last several years to produce an integrated productivity environment for information intensive tasks. (We now refer to this as InfoDock.) It is available today on Paging Products Sun and NeXT networks. The only technical support available for the environment right now is our own informal team answers to questions and documentation which you can find in the Boynton Beach library (ask for the InfoComm file cabinet).

                              <span>First of all - org-ql is a game changer for me. Absolutely amazing! The combination with super-agenda is perfect. At work I use orgmode and org-roam to manage teams, projects, meetings, and information.
 One thing I can&#x27;t seem to figure out is how to use custom sorting in org-ql-search. According to the documentation (https://github.com/alphapapa/org-ql) you can use a &quot;a user-defined comparator function that accepts two items as arguments and returns nil or non-nil&quot;.
 Assuming meetings are saved using the following structure:

He only typed the first letter of the directory name followed by a slash and it expanded to the full directory on pressing Tab (I think). I can&#x27;t find the video anymore. Does anyone know the package or setting that accomplishes this behaviour?

                              <span>I&#x27;m interested in how the workflow for many of you is. I&#x27;m realizing that i&#x27;m doing more and more things inside emacs and struggle to find a balance of what i want keybinds for. Some stuff is super obvious, like &#x60;project-find-file&#x60; or Window navigation. But with Org-Mode, Roam/Denote, Magit, Dired and Terminal things, i&#x27;m not sure how many functions i want to bind to keybinds.
 Thing is, keybinds are only quicker, if you remember them. If you need to search through which-key, just &#x60;M-x&#x60; and searching is faster. So, do you tend to create keybinds for most things in the packages you use? Or just for the one or two things you use multiple times a day and search for the rest?
 Additionally, maybe someone can give me a hint if this is possible: Can i come up with a sort of &quot;custom Command Palette&quot;? So, like &#x60;M-x&#x60; but it should only contain commands is specifiy? I find that with things like consult or other packages, searching &#x60;M-x&#x60; can be hard, when a package provides tens of interactive commands.

                              <span>Hello Scala people, I&#x27;m currently writing tests for some http4s routes for a &quot;pet&quot; project, I&#x27;m using the default dependencies that came in from the http4s library scala 3 starter so I&#x27;m using MUnit + Munit-cats-effect. I needed to &quot;mock&quot; PetAlgebra as petRoutes is using it.
 My questions are:
  
I&#x27;m using Mockito-core as ScalaMock doesn&#x27;t work with Munit and that is not a &quot;me problem&quot;. Does the regular mockito get used along with the typelevel stack or I&#x27;ve just hacked up something.
 Why would I use MUnit over ScalaTest, from what I gather it&#x27;s a matter of preferrence, some say code using cats-effect is easier to test via MUnit, but ScalaTest integrations with that too
 Would this method pass a PR? It does the job, but it feels like I pigeonholed java style into Scala and it looks clunky, how/do I have to change it to be idiomatic FP
  
​
 test(&quot;GET /pet/:id should return 200 and pet JSON when found&quot;) { val expectedPet &#x3D; Pet(/*not important*/) val mockPetAlgebra &#x3D; mock(classOf[PetAlgebra[IO]]) when(mockPetAlgebra.read(1)).thenReturn( IO.pure(Right(expectedPet)) ) val expectedJson &#x3D; petDeepEncoder(expectedPet) val petRoutes &#x3D; PetclinicRoutes.petRoutes[IO](mockPetAlgebra) val request &#x3D; Request[IO](Method.GET, uri&quot;/pet/1&quot;) for responseOpt &lt;- petRoutes.run(request).value response &lt;- IO.fromOption(responseOpt)( new NoSuchElementException(&quot;Expected a response&quot;) ) respJson &lt;- response.as[Json] yield assertEquals(respJson, petDeepEncoder(expectedPet)) assertEquals(response.status, Status.Ok) } 
 Thanks in advance

                              <span>The job market, as I&#x27;m sure we all know, is dire right now, so I was thinking of picking up another language (other than Scala) to help market myself further. That being said, I can&#x27;t seem to bring myself anymore to use a language that uses if-statements rather than if-expressions. However I&#x27;m not so far into the deep end of Scala that I feel the need to F[_] everything up.
 So while I hope the Scala market picks back up in the future, what alternative languages with jobs are there in the meantime, that I might feel comfortable with?

                              <span>I am attempting to display a logger info message related to the &#x60;mapPartitions&#x60; variable in PySpark. However, I&#x27;m encountering an issue: the info message doesn&#x27;t appear correctly when I run my code on clusters with primary and secondary nodes. Strangely, it works fine during unit testing, but a lot of info output without SparkContext.parallelize related function on the clusters.
 I&#x27;ve experimented with using &#x60;foreachPartition&#x60; or &#x60;foreach&#x60;, but these changes impact other subsequent logic. Can anyone provide some keywords or guidance for reference? Debugging code involving &#x60;SparkContext.parallelize&#x60; efficiently can be challenging. Thank you!
 Below is example by scala 2
 val RDDResult: RDD[Row] &#x3D; SparkContext.parallelize(ID,10).mapPartitions(
 ID &#x3D;&gt;{logger.info(&quot;show the message 1)
 //some logic...
 logger.info(&quot;show the message 2)
 }))

                              <span>We made a lot of progress on our journey since the last report. All new features bring us closer to Dependent Haskell, naturally, but most of them are useful in their own right.
 You can read our update here:

 As always, we made sure to include code examples for all user-facing changes to showcase the new syntax.

                              <span>May be a dumb question - but I take all my personal notes in orgmode, i have a file called groceries.org and its just what you think it is, a checkbox list of things to buy.
 I want the easiest way to use this list (add to it and check off items) when i&#x27;m on the go - what&#x27;s the best way to do this? Beorg on IOS is great for todo items, but the checkboxes are just plaintext. Organice is OK but I have some slight gripes with it. 
 if there&#x27;s no solutions I guess I&#x27;ll build a little something, just wanted to check first - thanks!

                              <span>The Nix daemon uses a custom binary protocol — the nix daemon protocol — to
communicate with just about everything. When you run nix build on your
machine, the Nix binary opens up a Unix socket to the Nix daemon and talks
to it using the Nix protocol1. When you administer a Nix server remotely using
nix build --store ssh-ng://example.com [...], the Nix binary opens up an SSH
connection to a remote machine and tunnels the Nix protocol over SSH. When you
use remote builders to speed up your Nix builds, the local and remote Nix daemons speak
the Nix protocol to one another.
Despite its importance in the Nix world, the Nix protocol has no specification
or reference documentation. Besides the original implementation in the Nix
project itself, the hnix-store project contains a re-implementation …</span>

                              <span>Can someone please help me tame expand-region?
 You know, the package that lets you mark, expand and contract the expansion?
 This is what I want, I want it to start expanding in this order:
  
First select the word
 Then select until the end of line
 Then if the cursor initially was not at the beginning of the line, I want it to mark the whole line,
 then paragraph, etc. etc.
  
The way how it&#x27;s usually achieved is by setting &quot;mode expansions&quot;, i.e.,:
  (defun er/add-mode-expansions () (setq-local er/try-expand-list &#x27;(er/mark-word er/mark-eol er/mark-bol er/mark-paragraph .... ))) (er/enable-mode-expansions &#x27;text-mode &#x27;er/add-mode-expansions) 
 What I see is happening is that it often skips the first step, immediately proceeding to the selection until the end of line.
 Ideally (I think), I&#x27;d like it to mark the word, then next adjacent word right after, then to the end of line, and so forth. But first, I need to figure out the simple one. 
 Why is it skipping the first step?
  
Additional notes:
 er/mark-word and er/mark-paragraph are defined in expand-region code. er/mark-eol and er/mark-bol are my custom functions, and they seem to be working just fine, at least when they are called directly, and not via er/expand-region. Interestingly, er/mark-word is also doing what you expect, when called independently. But when it&#x27;s called as a mode-expansion, expand-region often skips it (unless the cursor initially is at the exact beginning of the word).

                              <span>This is a real puzzler. I&#x27;m experimenting with emacs on my W10 machine, and it runs ok. But I can&#x27;t get into My Documents. Not sure if it&#x27;s because I have that folder &quot;paired with&quot; OneDrive, or if there is some other mysterious process at work. Any suggestions?

                              <span>Hi guys,
 So I stoped using emacs for about a month and for some reason now every time I start emacs I got the following error

After intializing emacs I did &#x60;package-refresh-contents&#x60; and got the following
  
Failed to verify signature archive-contents.sig:

This is my init.el about melpa, and thats it, everything else its not related to melpa
  
;; add melpa repo
 (require &#x27;package)

 ;; install use-package

 (package-refresh-contents)

Any idea how can I solve this? Thanks in advance

                              <span>Hi all,
 I am a new emacs user so please bear with me. I was setting up org-roam so I can have all my files from different categories linked if there is a relationship. For example, if I have a journal entry that talked about a philosophical topic in application to my life, I want it to link to one of my studies of that topic that is part of the philosophy category. Essentially, I want to map my brain. 
 In order to keep my files organized, I was planning on keeping my files for each topic in a completely separate directories from the Org-roam directory. I would have an org file in the Org-roam directory that links to that particular file and if there is a relationship, I would just link the org files in the Org-roam directory. In other words, the org files in the Org-roam directory simply contains links to the actual files in my file system and serves as the linker. 
 To organize my files in my file system, I plan on using the denote package for its file naming scheme.
 How does this setup sound? Are there any better setup designs that you can recommend? I was thinking about just using denote, but I like the org-roam-ui and I would like to keep everything in separate dirs. However, if this setup is not feasible then I might do that instead.
 Thanks!

 I find myself editing a lot of markdown lately and my fingers don&#x27;t want to learn the markdown commands.

                              <span>I&#x27;m learning Clojure, starting with the book Clojure for the Brave and True
 That book recommends Emacs for Clojure, and I decided to give it a spin. It also provides some config files for Emacs, here: https://nostarch.com/clojure
 It&#x27;s looking good so far - I vastly prefer keybindings and typing commands than clicking on GUIs (and I sort of already do that with my current &quot;IDE&quot; of choice, VSCode), but there are a few features that I&#x27;m missing
 Auto-complete, for example: how do I get that?
 Also symbol renaming is so very useful - by symbol renaming I mean how in VSCode you can press F2 on a function or variable name, type in a new name, then the variable/function will be renamed everywhere within the project, in a context-sensitive way - so, for example, if I have a poorly name function named, idk, getVars, I can F2 that function, type in getUserPreferences and everywhere that function is used in any other file within the project will be renamed
 Is that something that Emacs can do in a reasonable way? (e.g. without me having to write a lengthy program)
 EDIT: What an awesome community! Thanks for answers, folks!

                              <span>I just upgraded my Emacs to 29.3 and now, when I start Treemacs my Spacemacs leader key (A-m) stops working and it does not go back to working once I stop Treemacs.
 The change affects all the frames I have up at the time and both, GUI and terminal Emacs.
 I don&#x27;t remember this happening before - how do I go finding what is going on? I am sure it is possible but I do not know where to start.
 OK, it seems that the keys work but the menu that shows all the kebindings no longer works - in case this helps anybody.
 Thanks

                              <span>I found out the hard way (and thanks to this reddit thread) that Elisp uses Call by Sharing.
 ELISP&gt; (defvar ls &#x27;()) ls ELISP&gt; ls nil ELISP&gt; (push 10 ls) (10) ELISP&gt; ls (10) ELISP&gt; (defun my-push (list item) (push item list)) my-push ELISP&gt; (my-push ls 20) (20 10) ELISP&gt; ls (10) 
 What are the workarounds here? Using macros works, but I was curious if there is anything else that can be done?

 The radius is proportional to the weight of the stock in the index. The color is a range between green, white and red based on the price movement. This uses circle packing.

                              <span>An SVG element can be enclosed in  tag to mark it as an activated image map area. This facilitates click and tooltip behavior. However, the calculation gets a bit complicated with viewBox where we need to maintain the aspect ratio while simultaneously displaying the full image. Has anybody worked on it before? Or you may suggest improvement to the following code.
 (defun svg-image-map (image) (let* ((j 0) (x 0) (y 0) (factor 1) (view (dom-attr image &#x27;viewBox)) title bbox map w h w1 h1 l l1 diff) (when view (setq origin (svg-parse-viewBox image) w (dom-attr image &#x27;width) h (dom-attr image &#x27;height) w1 (nth 2 origin) h1 (nth 3 origin) l (if ( w1 h1) w1 h1) factor (min (/ w w1 1.0) (/ h h1 1.0)) diff (- l l1) x (car origin) y (cadr origin) ;; y axis is inverted x (+ (if (&gt; w h) (* .5 (- w w1)) 0) (* x factor)) y (+ (if (&lt; w h) (* .5 (- h h1)) 0) (* y factor)) )) (dolist (i (dom-by-tag image &#x27;a)) (setq bbox (svg-bbox (dom-children i)) j (1+ j) title (xml-substitute-special (or (dom-attr i &#x27;text) (dom-attr i &#x27;xlink:title)))) (when bbox (push &#x60;((rect . ,(read (format &quot;((%d . %d) .

                              <span>I use org-mode a lot to track notes, ideas, and TODO lists for the various projects I work on. I&#x27;d like to start using org-mode to create meeting agendas for various status and tagup meetings I attend with my boss and other team-mates working on projects. To date, my LaTEX/PDF exports tend to look more like term papers with bullet lists instead of paragraphs of text, so I end up cutting/pasting into MS Word to get simple lists of topics and action items to status. 
 Does anyone have a recommended template or workflow for preparing itemized lists of topics to discuss at meetings? I&#x27;ve found several templates for capturing meeting minutes, but my needs are slightly different than that. I&#x27;m looking for a titled document with a date and simple two-column bulleted lists - perhaps including a table, graphic, etc.?

                              <span>Metanote now supports various sync methods to seamlessly connect your documents between your computer and iPhone. You can configure sync in the settings, including local directories, Git, iCloud, Dropbox, OneDrive, WebDAV (Apache WebDAV Server, ownCloud, Yandex.disk, etc.). Local directories, Git, and iCloud are implemented by adding external folders, while other methods have built-in sync. Sync is fully automatic, and you hardly need to trigger it actively. In most cases, when you need it, your latest files are already there. You can use Metanote as a data center, syncing with different directories and different cloud services, or syncing with multiple cloud services on the same directory. Feel free to explore more ways to use it.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve mentioned my new effect system, Bluefin, a few times on Haskell Reddit. It&#x27;s now ready for me to announce it more formally.
 Bluefin&#x27;s API differs from all prior effect systems in that it implements a &quot;well typed Handle/Services pattern&quot;. That is, all effects are accessed through value-level handles, which makes it trivial to mix a wide variety of effects, including:
  
Bluefin.EarlyReturn, for early return
 Bluefin.Exception, for exceptions
 Bluefin.IO, for I/O
 Bluefin.State, for mutable state
 Bluefin.Stream, for streams
  
If you&#x27;re interested then read the Introduction to Bluefin. I&#x27;d love to know what you all think.

                              <span>In JavaScript there are console.log() for printing with newline and process.stdout.write() for printing without. PureScript has log for the former, but I can&#x27;t find any function for the latter. Is there something like process.stdout.write() in PureScript or any technique to achieve the same result?

                              <span>Hi everybody,
 I was going to post this in the org-roam forum, but its readership is very limited. So I thought it was better to do it here.
 I have been a devoted user of org-roam. It just works. There has been some discussion that development has stalled. Nonetheless, it works and it works well.
 What I want to do in this post is to document a bit better how templates work.
 First of all, a bit of context. Templates in org roam piggyback on org templates. Let us use the example from the org-roam manual:
  ((&quot;d&quot; &quot;default&quot; plain &quot;%?&quot; :target (file+head &quot;%-${slug}.org&quot; &quot;#+title: ${title}\n&quot;) :unnarrowed t)) 
 This template, when executed, does 3 steps:
  
Asks the user for a org-roam node title destination (potentially a new one). If the node title does not exist,

 This shell command will....
  
Copy all files in your specific original_dir to a new_dir to preserve your Obsidian .md files in case of an error.
 Add PROPERTIES, ID, END, title, and filetags at the very start of the file. 
 If you plan on using #+filetags, you&#x27;ll need to run this separately for each tag(s) you want to add.
 
 Rename an .md file &quot;Text1 Text2 Text3.md&quot; to &quot;text1_text2_text3-lastModifiedTimestamp.org.&quot; 
 Note that the title added to the file is separated from the renaming process after removing the .md extension, so it stays as e.g., &quot;Text1 Text2 Text3.&quot;

                              <span>Starting yesterday, when I try to build my personal site via GitHub actions, I get a &#x60;Failed to download ‘elpa’ archive.&#x60; message, with the net result that attempting to install the &#x60;webfeeder&#x60; package fails and, ultimately, the site build fails. I&#x27;m finding this one a bit of a head scratcher!
  
I have made no changes to the build script that might have impacted this (aside from various since-reverted attempts to fix it)
 The build environment doesn&#x27;t appear to have changed between the last successful build and the first failure (same emacs version, same ubuntu version, etc)
 It works fine locally
 I get the same warning when attempting to use elpa-mirror.
  
I would greatly appreciate any thoughts/suggestions! If nothing works I can just clone and manually install the necessary package but I would much prefer to solve this issue.

                              <span>Although I use Emacs for quite some time, I don&#x27;t usually go very deep into how everything works and connects together (lazy Doom Emacs user here).
 And I miss this feature: when I checkout a local branch in Magit by pressing b l, I am presented with a list of branches to choose from. And this list is sorted alphabetically (it seems). I wish it was sorted in the LRU manner instead.
 How would I approach this? Must this be done by Magit? Or is it the feature of either vertico or embark which I use? But I still would need to supply them a branch modification time somehow...
 Any pointers on where to go from here?

                              <span>In http://gem.librehacker.com/gemlog/starlog/20240418-0.gmi Christopher Howard talks about segregating Roam nodes into different areas, perhaps by project. He provides some code to select different Roam setups. I&#x27;m responding here as Christopher doesn&#x27;t provide a way to reply or comment.
 I have segregated my Roam data into two areas, work and personal. My Roam settings on my work laptop are for the work Roam data:
 (custom-set-variables ;; custom-set-variables was added by Custom. ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful. ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance. ;; If there is more than one, they won&#x27;t work right. . . . &#x27;(org-roam-directory &quot;/home/davemarq/org/roam/&quot; nil nil &quot;Customized with use-package org-roam&quot;) 
 My personal Roam data is in a directory pers I synch between work and home via Github. I use this personal Roam database at work too. To set my roam directory for this area, I use directory local settings in pers/.dir-locals.el:
 ((nil . ((org-roam-db-location . &quot;~/pers/org-roam/org-roam.db&quot;) (org-roam-directory . &quot;~/pers/org-roam&quot;)))) 
 I&#x27;m not a user of project or projectile, but I suspect one could also set these variables per project using mechanisms provided by project or projectile.

                              <span>I am loving Emacs without the Evil mode. I feel that the keybindings are more natural that way. No, I don&#x27;t have the Emacs pinky. Jokes aside, What prefix should I use for my user-defined keybindings.
 I have considered several options like C-SPC (it fucks with marking region), M-SPC (opens up the window menu), M-u (fucks with uppercase, which I use), SPC is not even an option, C-d (extremely important), M-d (again, I use it, it is very important to me)
 Almost all the keys seems to be occupied. So, what are the options left?

 I&#x27;ve been looking for roles since last 2 months here in the US, and I&#x27;ve found absolutely nothing so far. Im not even getting interview calls. Its really stressful when you are on a visa and clock is ticking. I have till august to find a position. Is it the same for everyone out there right now? I would really appreciate if someone could review my resume and tell me where I might be doing something wrong. 
 If you are someone who could get me an interview for Data Engineering roles using Scala, please do reach out. I would really appreciate any help.

                              <span>Hello, 
 I was checking out the new gears library (https://lampepfl.github.io/gears/) . I noticed that scala.js is not supported. I understand that Scala native is using the newly developed delimited continuations support, and the JVM version, the new virtual threads. 
 As JS is single threaded, I wonder if that makes it impossible to implement gears on it, or it requires some new feature that is not yet there, or there are just not enough resources to do it right now... so, do you know why ScalaJS is not supported by gears?

                              <span>I&#x27;m using PragamataPro Mono Liga font, using the ligature.el library by Mickey Petersen to display ligatures. The double pipe || ligature causes the current line height to increase and causes the next line to move down slightly as shown in this gif:
 https://cdn.zappy.app/87bee52262a7d88cc60b5a596339cca1.gif
 It does not happen with other ligatures, nor with other fonts I&#x27;ve tried. So it could be a problem with this font, although the ligature displays correctly in VS Code. The combination of Emacs, this font, and this ligature causes the problem.
 Although as mentioned I&#x27;m using ligature.el, I reproduced the above gif more simply using emacs -q and this elisp:
 (set-char-table-range composition-function-table t &#x27;([&quot;||&quot; 0 font-shape-gstring])) (set-face-attribute &#x27;default nil :family &quot;PragmataPro Mono Liga&quot;) 
 Increasing &#x60;line-spacing&#x60; does not help. 
 Any ideas as to a workaround? Visually it&#x27;s a little annoying. Thanks!

                              <span>Hey,
 With a compiled init.el file, I&#x27;m finding that use-package-always-defer isn&#x27;t working the way it ought to. At the beginning of my init, I have this:
 (setq use-package-always-defer (not (daemonp)) use-package-always-demand (daemonp))) 
 However, I find that packages still get eagerly loaded. The only way I have found to change this is to replace with the following:
 (eval-when-compile (setq use-package-always-defer t)) 
 Can anyone explain what&#x27;s going on here?

I didn&#x27;t use it for a while and now I&#x27;ve come back to this. I recently moved to emacs 30 from 29.3. Could this be a byproduct of using the development branch and something I&#x27;ll have to live with or is this error something else?

                              <span>I recently read Cal Newport latest book: &quot;Slow Productivity&quot;. In the third part of the book he talks about obsessing over quality, mentioning the famous speech by Ira Glass: &quot;The Gap&quot;. Cal Newport makes a point that in order to achieve brilliance, hard work is necessary but not sufficient and that we should spend time honing our taste.
I wonder if anybody relates to this concept, and if any of you has resources to suggest to improve ones taste in creating and writing notes.</span>

                              <span>Obviously, from my title, I&#x27;m using Ahrens&#x27; terminology. I&#x27;m aware that an alternate terminology exists, but I&#x27;m not sure I know how to use it correctly (&quot;Source Note&quot; &#x3D; Literature Note? &quot;Point Note&quot; &#x3D; Permanent Note&quot; I&#x27;m not confident that&#x27;s right).
In any case I want to make sure that I have the basic idea down correctly.
I searched for other posts on this but I didn&#x27;t feel like I found a really conclusive answer. People seem to have different ideas, some expressed more strongly than others.
As far as I currently understand it, a Literature Note is a summary of any concept or idea that comes from a source other than yourself. Books will be a regular source, but audio, video, personal conversations, etc. technically could as well. The Literature Note should have some kind of way to identi…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been having a weird issue w/ org-mode for a while now. I have a giant org file (~3 megs) with tons of nested headlines, and every so often when I&#x27;m zooming around one of them won&#x27;t expand. Other nearby headlines will still expand, but this one won&#x27;t.
 I can get around the issue by deleting the collapsed headline and whatever subtree is underneath it, then yanking it back, right where it was. Once I do that, I can expand it just fine, and I won&#x27;t have the problem again for days. I can&#x27;t figure out any commonalities as to why this happens. I think it&#x27;s happened across multiple versions of emacs (running 29.2 now) and org (9.6.25) but because I am a dumbass, I was not exhaustive in tracking the first appearance.
 I doubt anybody will be able to diagnose the issue from what I&#x27;ve written here, so diagnosis isn&#x27;t what I&#x27;m after. What I&#x27;m after is this: could someone tell me how to get whatever contextual info would be most relevant to debug it properly, next time it happens? Then I can come back and have a chance of figuring it out.

                              <span>Functional programming has come up with very interesting ways of managing &#x27;effects&#x27;. But curiously I haven&#x27;t found an explicit definition of what is meant by this word. Most of the time it seems interchangeable with &#x27;monad&#x27;. I also have the impression is that the word &#x27;effect&#x27; is used when talking about managing a program&#x27;s control flow.
 Is it the case that effects are about control flow? Are all effects representable with monads, and do all monads potentially model effects?

                              <span>I have read in the manual that SCHEDULED is supposed to be the start time when one will start working on a meeting. However, it&#x27;s pretty convenient to use a time range (using the commands that org-mode supports to manipulate the SCHEDULED timestamp is very convenient). Also, query languages like org-mode&#x27;s internal language and org-ql support querying the SCHEDULED time specifically. 
 Using ranges with SCHEDULED is widespread.
 Would it make sense to change SCHEDULED to mean the time when one will work on a task? (either start working on it, if it&#x27;s not a range, or spend working on it, if it&#x27;s a range).

What I want is to be able to type in my search string, hit &quot;RET&quot;, and then be able use abbreviated characters for different behavior, such as &quot;n&quot; for isearch-repeat-foreward, &quot;p&quot; for isearch-repeat-backwards, &quot;o&quot; for isearch-occur, etc. I want to also be able to switch back to normal isearch with something like &quot;i&quot; so I can modify my search string. What I tried was to create a custom minor mode that would change the keybindings to what I want. From my understanding, since this mode is more recently added to minor-mode-alist and minor-mode-map-alist, the bindings in my-isearch-mode-map should take higher precedence than isearch-mode-map. However, when I define it and activate it, isearch bindings still function like the default.
 Here is the link to my code. Be warned, it is not pretty as this is my first time writing a minor mode.
 What am I missing? Is there a better way to do this? I want to avoid hacky solutions to the best of my ability and I don&#x27;t want to have to go down to route of trying (and probably failing) to remake isearch just to get this one thing to work.
 I am open to suggestions on other packages as well. Currently I am using swiper primarily for search, however I want to start using isearch because of its integration with other emacs functionality like occur-mode. It is also built into emacs which is also a plus.
 Any help is appreciated, thank you in advance.

 \begin{enumerate} ... \end{enumerate} 
 Now, I would like to change this itemize such that that if I edit enumerate to itemize in \begin{} it should automatically change the environment variable to itemize in \end{}.
 Eglot-rename does not seem to work with this. I don&#x27;t know if there is a way in AucTeX, other than maybe writing a customized function. I am trying to avoid that since it is an in-built function in Vim or TexStudio.
 Any help would be useful. Thanks a lot.
 PS: I am using texlab as LSP server for LaTeX with eglot.

 I work in big data space (data engineering), I mainly used Java, Scala and Python.
 I have been learning functional programming in greater depth and I found this Python library which seems pretty cool.
 https://github.com/dry-python/returns
 I&#x27;ve used it at work for implementing an Either based error handling.
 It seems a great library.
 Any of you have used it?
 Any thoughts?
 For sure, I prefer doing FP in Scala but given the job market isn&#x27;t too kind too Scala and FP languages in general. What are your thoughts to bring FP (at least parts of it) to the Python world?
 Some people in the TypeScript world seem to take that direction:

                              <span>Hi everyone, first of all I would like to say a huge thank you to everyone who has contributed to this forum. I&#x27;ve been here for a while now reading all sorts of posts, but only now did I need to create an account for the sake of joining the discussion.
I&#x27;ll just briefly introduce myself, my name is Petr and I&#x27;m 20 years old, I love fitness, biohacking and anything that improves a person&#x27;s mental/physical performance and especially health in general. I guess that&#x27;s about me.
Now for the interesting stuff. This is probably going to be a very direct question, but how do I include in a permanent note the studies that the text or some statement in it discusses? I was thinking of putting a letter or number at the end of a sentence the normal way, but then I wonder if that would interfere with the note itself. Or should I leave the references to the literature note?
Example from today:
How do you guys approach this?
My goal is to create content on social media as well as developing my knowledge.
I apologize for the probably vague question, I still have a lot to learn.
Thank you!

 This is probably a basic question on this sub but I was wondering what kind of lisp magic I would need to do to run an emacs-command in certain major modes each time I save a file.
 For example, I would like to run delete-trailing-whitespace every time I save a file.
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>In OS X, I would like to run two instances of emacs. MacOS uses the name of application to display all info about it (e.g. when switching apps, the first string in the menu bar). I would like one instance to have a different name. Furthermore, hammerspoon uses the app name in several of its internal functions to keep track of the app windows.
 I have tried to rename the application in the Info.plist file.
 I have been successful changing the CFBundleIdentifier. But when I change the CFBundleName, this change does not take effect. Does anybody know how I can change the name of the running Emacs (even if it involves recompilation of the binary)? 
 Thank you,

                              <span>Been using Desktop Save Mode after coming across a post about it--it works great but it doesn&#x27;t seem to restore Org Agenda buffers (not org agenda files which restore as you would expect, but e.g. org-agenda-list. In place of what should have been a buffer for org-agenda-list is a seemingly random buffer.
 Apparently desktop-buffer-mode-handlers can add support for Org Agenda buffers but I don&#x27;t see an e.g. org-agenda-restore-buffer so I guess on would need to use a custom function? I don&#x27;t know much programming so hoping someone has found a solution for this.
 I also looked into activities.el but it looks like each &quot;activity&quot; is a frame/tab, but for my workflow with a tiling window manager I find it more suitable to liberally create and destroy frames from my window manager&#x27;s workspaces and for now at least am just looking for a way to restore all buffers/frames/window configuration without the need to create and switch projects. Actually activities.el might be suitable if an activity includes a set a frames. I prefer dealing with frames than Emac&#x27;s window management because I often work with at least a browser alongside in a window manager workspace and it&#x27;s just less cognitive overhead to treat each buffer as a frame when the rest of your applications are also managed by the window manager.

                              <span>I want to write a macro that defines a function which uses a backquote. For concreteness, let&#x27;s say that for any given symbol x I want to define a function:
 (defun bar (y) &#x60;(x ,y)) 
 My first try would be
 (defmacro foo (x) &#x60;(defun bar (y) &#x60;(,,x ,y))) 
 But this does not work. I can do it by writing instead:
 (defmacro foo (x) (let ((form &#x60;(backquote (,x ,&#x27;,y)))) &#x60;(defun bar (y) ,form))) 
 But this seems very hackish. What is the most idiomatic way to implement this functionality?

                              <span>For reasons beyond my control, I am forced to use Windows 11 at work. Luckily, I can still use Emacs.
 My emacs config shared with pure Linux machines works and Emacs on WSL is reasonable. But I have problems with Win key shortcuts. Over the years I have added more that 20 shortcuts where. So I need to migrate those shortcuts somewhere else.
 Have you been in a similar situation? What is the best solution?

But I want to use the native ChromeOS way.

                              <span>I&#x27;m going to keep this short and simple - I&#x27;ve been using Doom Emacs for quite sometime. Its bloody good package, but I don&#x27;t need 99% of what comes with it ( which now I realize I really miss :&#x27;( ). I am making my config from scratch and I really need some help with making org-mode work the way i want. 
  
This is my primary issue (Image) . Notice how the text in lists wraps right under the its number. I want it to align with the text block (marked in red).
 In Doom Emacs whenever my cursor was on a list item that entire item would be highlighted. How do I replicate this?
 Where can I find all the commands I can use to customize org-mode? I did not find this in the manual, or am I not looking hard enough?
  
I am using emacs 29 (the crafted emacs config) on Mac OS.
 PS - Indent mode and other relevant options are enabled
 Thank you.

It lists Applicatives that fail their laws, in different ways.
 So far, I have found Applicatives that fail the following sets of laws:
  
Id
 Id, Comp
 Id, Comp, Inter
 Id, Comp, Homo
 Id, Comp, Homo, Inter
 Id, Homo
 Id, Homo, Inter
 Id, Inter
 Comp, Inter
 Inter
  
But I had trouble triggering only failing the Composition law, or the Homomorphism law. Or only the Identity and Interchange laws, and so on.

                              <span>Hey folks, I have been learning Haskell for a long time but I never created a Haskell package before. That changed today. I created my first Cabal package, https://github.com/aaditmshah/hledger-check-postings, and pushed it to GitHub. Since I&#x27;m a complete noob, I&#x27;m looking for guidance on improving the package and publishing it to Hackage. I would appreciate it if you would look at my code and tooling, and suggest improvements by creating new GitHub issues or starting new GitHub discussions. For example, I want to add unit tests, Haddock documentation, and continuous integration via GitHub actions. I also want to publish my executable on Hackage so that it&#x27;s easier to discover and install. Furthermore, I would love to automate process of bumping the version number, updating the changelog, and publishing a new version to Hackage via continuous deployment. Finally, I would love to hear all the tips and counsel that you Haskell veterans have to offer, both here and on GitHub issues or GitHub discussions.

                              <span>I&#x27;m having some problems making HLS work properly on VS Code with the Haskell extension.
 It had been working quite well for the longest time, up until yesterday, when I came back after not being able to code with it for a couple months.
 I upgraded to the latest versions of everything (I now use GHCup 0.1.22.0, Stack 2.15.5, HLS 2.7.0.0, Cabal 3.10.3.0 and GHC 9.8.2), and now for some reason it seems like HLS does not load hlint specifically (and potentially other plugins, I didn&#x27;t check), and that&#x27;s bothering me. What could it be not making it work?
 I&#x27;m on Arch Linux with kernel 6.8.7-zen1-1-zen, visual-studio-code-bin 1.88.1-1, Haskell extension v2.4.3 (with Haskell Syntax Highlighting by Justus Adam v3.6.0).

                              <span>Been using Desktop Save Mode after coming across a post about it--it works great but it doesn&#x27;t seem to restore Org Agenda buffers (not org agenda files which restore as you would expect, but e.g. org-agenda-list. In place of what should have been a buffer for org-agenda-list is a seemingly random buffer.
 Apparently desktop-buffer-mode-handlers can add support for Org Agenda buffers but I don&#x27;t see an e.g. org-agenda-restore-buffer so I guess on would need to use a custom function? I don&#x27;t know much programming so hoping someone has found a solution for this.
 I also looked into activities.el but it looks like each &quot;activity&quot; is a frame/tab, but for my workflow with a tiling window manager I find it more suitable to liberally create and destroy frames from my window manager&#x27;s workspaces and for now at least am just looking for a way to restore all buffers/frames/window configuration without the need to create and switch projects. Actually activities.el might be suitable if an activity includes a set a frames. I prefer dealing with frames than Emac&#x27;s window management because I often work with at least a browser alongside in a window manager workspace and it&#x27;s just less cognitive overhead to treat each buffer as a frame when the rest of your applications are also managed by the window manager.

Thanks to this we can just write normal Scala function calls and get &#x27;free&#x27; editor support–types, documentation on hover, autocomplete.
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 Pretty new to the language (and functional programming more generally) so not sure on what I’m missing here but I can’t figure out the proper way of exception handling in Scala.
 So as I understand it an Option or an Either should be used most of the time to produce a None or an alternate value in the Left of the Either. Then exceptions should be thrown only in rare circumstances as they are a side effect?
 If that’s correct then:
  
How do you evaluate that the circumstance is right for an exception to be thrown?
 
What are the alternative values you provide instead of an exception that can keep the program running?

                              <span>As my first Halogen application has just surpassed 3K lines of Purescript code, and contains several components that communicate with and through each other, -I am starting to wish that I had some sort of visual &#x27;map&#x27; to navigate the relationship between my components.
 This is where I got the idea that what if we could simply invoke a function on the &#x27;root&#x27; component and then the function would output something like &#x27;plantUML&#x27; which then can be compiled to a diagram. In theory all the required information to generate the diagram is contained in the type information for all the Halogen components.
 Being relatively new to Purescript, I don&#x27;t have any clear idea how this could be achieved. But roughly I am thinking that since Purescript is quite weak on the metaprogramming side of things, one would probably have to exploit some FFI and JS to extract the information required to generate the diagram.
 For now I will probably just manually create my visual &#x27;map&#x27; with plantUML since I am busy on my own project, however I just wanted to throw the idea out there. Perhaps I will work on it in the future, or perhaps someone else will like the idea and work on it.
 In any case it would be cool to hear from more experienced Purescript programmers whether or not this is possible and how it could be accomplished. I personally think it would be quite awesome to be able to generate visual overviews like that.

                              <span>Hello everyone. I&#x27;m fairly new to emacs I&#x27;m using emacs 29.1, I do web development with typescript and react,so I configure emacs for that purpose, first I&#x27;ve only use the treesiter modes for typescript and tsx (typescript-ts-mode and tsx-ts-mode) until a friend introduce to lsp and tell me to use eglot since is builtin into emacs.
 So I did my research and find about autocompletion with company-mode and that is another mode called lsp-mode, so I decided to try both eglot and lsp-mode. first I use eglot and everything work well until I came across this tutorial -&gt; https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/tutorials/reactjs-tutorial/ then I decided to give a try to lsp-mode
 Later on working normaly with lsp y decided to switch back to do a comparision with eglot and realize that in lsp you can autocomplete snippets but then switching to eglot that same thing don&#x27;t happen. but accordingly to the eglot page you can autocomplete snippets using yasnippet (which I&#x27;m already using with lsp-mode) but for some reason this is not working and searching across internet I didn&#x27;t find any solution. So maybe I&#x27;m missing something?
 If I didn&#x27;t explain my self maybe these gif help.
 emacs with lsp-mode and company for typescript:

 note: I tried eglot and company with another languages (c-ts-mode, c++-ts-mode) and there works perfectly, only with typescript and javascript buffers don&#x27;t work.

                              <span>I have the C environment setup from the Wikemacs tutorial, which includes helm-gtags and gg tags. I first thought this was conflicting with c-eldoc, but turning those off did nothing to give me c-eldoc functionality. The closest I can get to actual functionality is to load an empty file with no extension (that doesn&#x27;t trigger a language mode), and then run c-turn-on-eldoc-mode. From here I get a null pstring error every time I hover over a symbol. At least that is something. 
 Weather the gtags packages are on or off, c-eldoc does absolutely nothing otherwise, besides turning on the &quot;Eldoc&quot; indicator. 
 I&#x27;m wondering if there is backend setup that I&#x27;m missing. 
 I tried downloading from github and compiling, I get warnings about missing cache functions, and emacs doesn&#x27;t seem to load it despite the folder being in &#x27;load-path&#x27;; I&#x27;m not experienced with installing packages this way; that&#x27;s another issue. 
 Mine is from Melpa.
 I&#x27;d like to see function signatures from the standard libraries.
 I have an F1 shortcut set for man pages, but sometimes that&#x27;s overkill, and sometimes the specifics of the function are embedded in a much larger man page of related functions.

                              <span>Hello, I&#x27;ve been trying to setup emacs for the first time and it&#x27;s been pretty easy and straightforward apart from a couple issues. I&#x27;m setting it up on a NixOS Virtual Machine using home-manager: I have two files a default.nix where I say which packages to install and a config.el where I write the configs. Here are the relevant parts from the files:
 default.nix:
 { pkgs , ... } { programs.emacs &#x3D; { enable &#x3D; true; package &#x3D; pkgs.emacs; extraConfig &#x3D; builtins.readFile ./config.el; extraPackages &#x3D; epkgs: with epkgs; [ evil evil-collection treesit-auto ]; }; } 
 config.el:
 (setq evil-want-keybinding nil) (require &#x27;evil) (require &#x27;evil-collection) (evil-collection-init) (evil-mode 1) (require &#x27;treesit-auto) (global-treesit-auto-mode) 
 The issues are:
 When I run home-manager switch I get two issues. The first one is assignment to free variable &#x27;evil-want-keybinding&#x27; followed by a reminder to set evil-want-keybinding to nil before loading evil and evil collection (even if I am doing it).
 The second one is that it gives the error cannot open load file: no such file or directory, treesit.
 I&#x27;ve tested and the issues are disconnected from one another. I&#x27;ve been googling around for a day now and I wasn&#x27;t able to find a fix to either. If any of you may know how to fix I&#x27;d be grateful.
 EDIT: Regarding the treesitter problem, I&#x27;m just a moron. The default pkgs.emacs is version 28. Changing it to pkgs.emacs29 it works. It does compile and works, but it does still give me issues about evil-want-keybinding.

 exwm-edit augments EXWM by letting you edit text in X windows in an Emacs buffer. For an example GIF of its usage, please see the project README.
 New changes in v0.0.3 include:
  
Autoload exwm-edit--compose and exwm-edit--compose-minibuffer, so it&#x27;s not necessary to require the package in your init.el.
 Just loading exwm-edit no longer binds any keys.
 Window display now uses standard display-buffer actions. Customize exwm-edit-display-buffer-action instead of exwm-edit-split.
 Require Emacs 27.1 or later

                              <span>It’s a minor thing, but is there a way I can evaluate an elisp function (timestamp, incrementing number, etc.) in the header of an org source block so that I can dynamically name the filename of the image that is created by the block?
 I do a lot of data exploration in org, similar to what one would do in a Jupyter notebook, and it’s a bit of a pain to come up with a unique filename for each one. I’d much prefer just to be able to kill/yank the header and reuse it for each code chunk.
 EDIT: Just realized I can create a yasnippet that inserts the timestamp right into the header. That should solve my problem.

                              <span>Hi all,
 I already tried asking this over on the citeproc-el github, but while I wait for an answer there I figured I would try my luck here.
 Basically, I&#x27;m having trouble rendering certain superscripted citations properly when exporting to ODT. Instead of showing a proper superscripted citation, the generated ODT document shows the underlying org shorthand (e.g., ^{1}). Using a (relatively) minimal example:
  
#+TITLE: Manuscript Title 
 #+OPTIONS: author:nil toc:nil num:nil 
 #+CITE_EXPORT: csl ~/path/to/CSL/styles/american-medical-association.csl 
 * Testing 
 This is a test sentence with a citation.[cite:@somecitekey] 
 This is standard superscript.^{1} 
 #+PRINT_BIBLIOGRAPHY:
  
The first sentence will render as (^{1}), and the second sentence will render with appropriate superscript (1). The bibliography will render appropriately according to the CSL style, as expected.
 Interestingly, when I export to other formats such as HTML, the superscripted citations render appropriately—it&#x27;s only ODT that has issues. Also, unsurprisingly, this isn&#x27;t an issue for CSL formats that do not require superscript for in-text citations.
 For reference, I&#x27;m using citeproc-el and the advanced org-mode-ox-odt fork to export org files to ODT, although I don&#x27;t know how much of a difference this makes.
 Any help or insight would be greatly appreciated!

The basic issue concerns where timestamps are &quot;best&quot; placed. In the original question, the focus was on whether an Entry&#x27;s PROPERTY drawer was an acceptable location, but I&#x27;ve been trying to understand it more generally. When I wrote my answer earlier today, I talked about how Org handled timestamps depending on which of FOUR locations was chosen. In the subsequent hours, I&#x27;ve discovered a FIFTH. It wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if there are even more. So, FWIW:
 Among the more common place timestamps tend to be found, I have found FIVE that are worth considering because o…</span>

 I need to run some commands over and over again, but they are basically the same. I&#x27;d like to write a script to run them under eshell, but I have no experience with that. The commands are rclone commands.
 Any thoughts?
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>I can&#x27;t make the font in a emacs window look like the one in the font picker dialog from the menu bar.
 In the font picker I can specify 9, 9.5 and 10 and they all look different, I want to use 9.5 but emacs windows display/round the font to 10. When using a size of 9.5 the font picker saves the font as the following:
 &#x27;(default ((t (:family &quot;Comic Code&quot; :foundry &quot;TAB &quot; :slant normal :weight regular :height 98 :width normal))))
 I tried messing with multiple values of :height but that didn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;m guessing the font picker dialog is some gtk widget and uses a different font rendering? In a terminal, the font is displayed correctly with 9.5, looks the same as in the file picker with 9.5.
 What should I look for to solve this issue?

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m new to MacOS. I&#x27;ve been experimenting with using the Command key on the Mac keyboard as the Emacs Ctrl key via
 (setq mac-command-modifier &#x27;ctrl). 
 This works in the GUI. However, when I&#x27;m running -nw in the MacOS Terminal, either the system or terminal app is hijacking the Command shortcuts. So, for example, Command-n creates a new terminal window and Command-p opens the print dialog. How do I disable all of the Command shortcuts of the terminal?

                              <span>The latest pre-release of Hyperbole, based on the git master tip, has now been available on melpa for a few weeks, for those who use melpa rather than the elpa-devel package archive.
 One new feature is the single hyrolo.py script which you can install for shell command-line record-level access to your Org, Markdown and Emacs Outline files. You give the search string and files to search on the command-line and it highlights the match in the lowest-level records that match. You can then pipe that into any other program. Not quite as powerful as the Emacs version of HyRolo but useful in other contexts. On an old machine, a single word search over 1300 files with four matches takes 0.75 seconds.
 Enjoy.

                              <span>Emacs is the best singular computer-interaction framework I’ve encountered so far, but we can all agree it has its flaws. Single-threaded performance characteristics, limited to text (rather than some more flexible core abstraction, perhaps one which would better allow making full use of the screen as a 2D canvas), Elisp (which while decent isn’t on par with the self-contained Lisp languages like CL), and other more minor problems.
 Are there any promising projects going on to make a replacement or successor for Emacs? The only ones I’m aware of are Lem and Project Mage; the former only solves 2 of the above major issues, and the latter is literally a one-person effort right now.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve used vanilla emacs for a long time for microcontroller work with stm32 and recently had to use vscode because of my work as a C++ developer. There I appreciated many of VsCode&#x27;s features, but being based off Microsoft once my job finished I began planning on dropping it. However seems to be neovim with many of its distros is nowadays the best experience for out of the box similarity with many of vscode&#x27;s features, however knowing emacs is emacs I know everything&#x27;s possible but is it worth the effort? Also with vanilla emacs I&#x27;ve seen some performance drawbacks whit heavy configurations and things were sometimes not as smooth even as vscode and I&#x27;ve heard neovim is very fast and light. Do you think emacs is a good idea for my goals? Maybe doom emacs already has what I want? So I don&#x27;t have to spend weeks configuring emacs.....
 Thnx in advance

                              <span>I wrote a Markdown to HTML compiler to pickup some Haskell -- it was a really fun project!! I really like the language (although the compiler infrastructure and package manager are lacking compared to Rust). 
 If you have any simple ideas like this for projects I can write to learn even more, please let me know!! I&#x27;d love to create something neat in Haskell again to keep learning!

                              <span>So I&#x27;ve been using Haskell for a while now, I&#x27;ve gotten the hang of monads, applicatives, lazy evaluation, dabbled in mtl, lenses, and free monads, and I&#x27;ve absolutely loved all of it. But there&#x27;s one single function that perpetually stumps me and I can&#x27;t seem to understand how it works, and that&#x27;s fix.
 The definition is
 fix f &#x3D; let x &#x3D; f x in x
 Trying to read through some stackoverflow answers explaining this function the closest I could get to understanding it is that the f passed into fix is infinitely composed with itself like so:
  x &#x3D; f . f $ x -- or x &#x3D; f (f x) x &#x3D; f . f . f $ x -- or x &#x3D; f (f (f x)) x &#x3D; f . f . f . f . f . f . f . f . f . f . f $ x -- etc. 
 Given this explanation my question is, if a function is infinitely composed with itself, even if we were to have lazy evaluation here, how could it ever possibly terminate? The documentation says something about how fix produces the least fixed point of a function, looking that up I see something about domain theory and don&#x27;t get any closer to understanding it. This is the one thing I feel like I simply can&#x27;t get about this language. Can anyone help me out here?

Haskell is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what’s going on in its community.

Choreographing a dance with the GHC specializer (Part 1) by Finley McIlwaine
Overloaded functions are common in Haskell, but they come with a cost. Thankfully, the GHC specialiser is extremely good at removing that cost. We can therefore write high-level, polymorphic programs and be confident that GHC will compile them into very efficient, monomorphised code. In this episode, we’ll demystify the seemingly magical things that GHC is doing to achieve this.
Core Inspection by Oleg Grenrus
Luckily, relatively recently, GHC got a feature to include all Core bindings in the interface files. Wh…</span>

If you’ve never heard of cloud native computing before, it has a number of definitions online, but the simplest one is that it’s mostly about Kubernetes.
Kubecon is a huge event with thousands of attendees. The conference spanned
several levels of the main convention center in Paris, with a myriad of
conference rooms and a whole floor for sponsor booths. FOSDEM already felt huge
compared to academic conferences, but Kubecon is even bigger.

                              <span>For a long time I have been having the issue where my emacs would occasionally glitch, in the following 2 ways:
  
it will randomly hang when I&#x27;m doing something. this happens with M-x and honestly everything so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s caching 
 when I type, it will randomly hang a bit and emit the text I type, but in the wrong sequence of keystrokes. I used to think that it might be completion-at-point taking too much time, but there&#x27;s honestly nothing there, and there are various of times they are very fast.
  
I used to assume that it was my keyboard as I basically only use emacs when I&#x27;m using my computer, but I just tested that other program don&#x27;t seem to have this problem
 So I suspect it is something with emacs.
 ​
 I tested the typing problem in firefox(I rolled &quot;123123123&quot; on my keyboard) and emacs. In firefox there&#x27;s occasional delay but very brief and no sequence error, and in emacs this happened
 &quot;123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123121323232311123123123123123123123123&quot;
 notice the &quot;121323232311&quot; part at the back, that&#x27;s when emacs hangs and emit the whole of them out altogether. My hand is quite consistent as you can see all other parts are consistent &quot;123123123&quot;.
 ​
 I have no idea why this happens, my machine is generally fast, nothing else (that is only firefox) glitch, and emacs only takes 7% of CPU. I wonder if anyone else have seen this before?
 my emacs version is 29.1 with doomemacs. my config is on z.gehninfel.xyz/20230914114145-doomemacs_configuration.html

 Demo of lasgun.el
 After writing some functionality for my personal configuration, I figured I may as well take a stab at writing my first package out of it.
 lasgun.el takes the Filter -&gt; Select -&gt; Act loop of avy and allows you to repeat the first two steps as needed, then act on the selections in bulk.
 It comes with two actions preloaded: one to place multiple-cursors.el cursors at each mark, and one to run embark-act-all on the positions. Users can define their own actions with the macro define-lasgun-action. Docstrings have usage information. 
 Besides avy, there are no dependencies (optionally mc and embark are needed for the aforementioned actions).

 In this specific case, modus-themes provides a function modus-themes-get-color-value that allows me to customize faces with the correct colors, depending on which modus theme loads at init. I load modus-vivendi and operandi based on the time of day. So, i don&#x27;t want to set fixed colors for stuff like the tab-line and such.
 My specific issues currently is, that the function seems to be available, but the face customization for tab-line is run before the modus theme is loaded, which results in the wrong colors being loaded.

 https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/eclipse.jdt.ls
 I&#x27;ve installed &quot;eclipse-jdt&quot; which is present in the openSUSE repository. But, I think LSP is not present in this and there&#x27;s no similar package in the repositories.
 I&#x27;m getting this error whenever I try to open a Java project -
 File mode specification error: (error Autoloading file /home/asd/.emacs.d/elpa/lsp-mode-20231227.620/lsp-mode.elc failed to define function lspdeferred)
 Am I doing something wrong?

                              <span>Solved: need to use save-buffers-kill-emacs instead.
 Hook to save desktop on daemon exit doesn&#x27;t seem to work, any ideas? Restoring the desktop works if I manually save the desktop:
 (setq desktop-dirname &quot;~/.cache/emacs&quot;) (add-hook &#x27;server-after-make-frame-hook #&#x27;(lambda () (unless desktop-save-mode (add-hook &#x27;server-done-hook #&#x27;(lambda () (desktop-save &quot;~/.cache/emacs&quot;))) (desktop-save-mode 1) (desktop-read)))) 
 The desktop file doesn&#x27;t get written to disk on C-x C-c or emacsclient -e &quot;(kill-emacs)&quot; so I need to manually evaluate (desktop-save &quot;~/.cache/emacs&quot;). I can also confirm the hook gets updated--it just doesn&#x27;t seem to apply on daemon exit.

 Edit: formatted code as suggested.

                              <span>im coming from neovim and ive been starting to learn emacs this whole day, i managed to get the basic stuff but now when i try to look at other peoples configs its just so different that i have no idea, so i think I&#x27;ll be rewriting my config from scratch.
 so my basic questions are:
 what is the best package manager, is it use package, straight, elget..? oh so many...
 how should i structure my emacs config? is it only a .emacs or is it separated in init.el package.el straight.el whatever.el? i have no idea
 also i wonder if there is a proper &quot;guide&quot; to all of this, and if so, please tell me
 i also didnt manage to setup lsp because use package was complaining
 but anyways ty very much everyone

                              <span>Hi, doeas anybody know how to disable tree-sitter mode for org files/org-mode
 Manually i can disable it by setting tree-sitter-mode to nil, but I cannot find a way to do it automaticaly.
 Profiling shows 
 356 100% - command-execute 349 98% - funcall-interactively 349 98% - org-self-insert-command 349 98% - apply 348 97% - # 347 97% - tree-sitter--after-change 345 96% - tree-sitter--do-parse 4 1% tsc-parse-chunks 1 0% + org-element--cache-after-change 7 1% + byte-code 0 0% + ... 
 My tree-sitter config
 (use-package tree-sitter :config (require &#x27;tree-sitter-langs) (global-tree-sitter-mode nil) ;;(add-hook &#x27;tree-sitter-after-on-hook #&#x27;tree-sitter-hl-mode) (setq tree-sitter-major-mode-language-alist (delete &#x27;(org-mode . org) tree-sitter-major-mode-language-alist)) ) (use-package tree-sitter-langs :config (setq tsc-dyn-dir (expand-file-name tree-sitter-subdir user-emacs-directory)) ;; Custom patterns to make it look like in old versions: ;; See: https://github.com/ubolonton/emacs-tree-sitter/issues/153 (tree-sitter-hl-add-patterns &#x27;python [(assignment left: (identifier) @variable)]) (tree-sitter-hl-add-patterns &#x27;python [(decorator (call (identifier) @function.special))]) (setq tree-sitter-major-mode-language-alist (delete &#x27;(org-mode . org) tree-sitter-major-mode-language-alist)) ) 
 I tried this hooks:
 (setq tree-sitter-major-mode-language-alist (delete &#x27;(org-mode . org) tree-sitter-major-mode-language-alist)) (dolist (mode &#x27;(org-mode-hook)) (add-hook mode (lambda () (progn (setq tree-sitter-mode nil) (setq tree-sitter-major-mode-language-alist (delete &#x27;(org-mode . tree-sitter-major-mode-language-alist)) ))) )

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been looking at trying out treesitter support again (specifically, c-ts-mode), and one thing that&#x27;s got me stuck is how to modify the rules that are used to highlight the text. c-ts-mode makes some baffling decisions where it deviates from cc-mode in how certain things get highlighted, and I&#x27;d like to change this.
 I haven&#x27;t been able to see anything about how to modify the highlighting so far. c-ts-mode doesn&#x27;t offer anything like c-ts-mode-indent-style for modifying indentation, and the general treesitter documentation for font lock stuff doesn&#x27;t really help. The closest I&#x27;ve figured so far is that maybe you can write a mode hook that adds entries to the treesit-font-lock-settings list, but there&#x27;s no indication if this would actually work, and if so how.
 I&#x27;m worried that the only &quot;solution&quot; right now is to copy-paste the font lock rules in c-ts-mode and manually maintain a separate copy just to change a couple things, which would obviously be unacceptable. And I can&#x27;t sidestep the issue by, say, modifying font faces to look better, because the issues I want to fix have to do with poorly-chosen generic font faces for some of these rules.
 If modifying syntax highlighting isn&#x27;t possible right now, then I&#x27;ll make a feature request and go back to waiting for treesitter support to be usable. I&#x27;m just not sure what part of emacs would be responsible for the new feature. I get the impression that the font lock rule system as it is now makes it really difficult for a major mode to let you extend its rules, so I&#x27;m leaning towards it being a treesitter feature request (as opposed to a c-ts-mode feature request).

                              <span>Hi. I&#x27;m making a package that sometimes asks for user input with completing read. I would like to add marginalia annotations for the candidates.
 Is there an example as to how I should do it? My candidates are already a list in the form of (&quot;candidate&quot; . &quot;content&quot;). I would like for &quot;content&quot; to be displayed as a marginalia annotation.
 I would also like to not have a hard dependency on marginalia, of course. I read the README in marginalia&#x27;s github, and there seems to be a way to do it, but it kinda went over me, didn&#x27;t quite get it. Thanks.

                              <span>I was introduced to Emacs at work and would like to migrate my physical todo list to org-agenda. This process is much easier thanks to the introduction materials by DistroTube, SystemCrafters, and Prod. While the aforementioned youtube videos are useful, I am having difficulty envisioning how best to organize my todos -- especially across multiple projects.
 It seems to me that there are three options (please correct me if I am wrong):
  
Single .org file -- top-level todo headers, :tags: used to organize per project
 Single .org file -- second-level todo headers organized under project-specific top-level headers
 Multiple .org files -- top-level todo headers organized in project-specific .org files
  
What is your approach for tracking/organizing todos across multiple projects?
 I find myself drawn to the idea of having a separate .org file per repository at work, organizing git-issue todos in the top-level header and task &quot;steps&quot; todos at the second-header level. However, I question whether this is the best approach because it would require me to update my configuration (setq org-agend-files ...) should I work on a new repository -- however unlikely.
 ​
 Any recommendations from seasoned &#x60;org-agenda&#x60; users is welcome!

                              <span>Specific question here for tracing in Scala
 In a CRUD webapp, let&#x27;s say a client receives an http request with a trace header, calls some logic, spins out some new fibers/futures/what-ever and does a bunch of work off the back of this instigating thing that all should be traced.
 If you want flamegraphs etc in the tracing visualisation tool of your choice to show where time gets spent for all subsequent calls (jaeger, datadog, graphana tempo, what-have-you). 
 In Java you&#x27;d have the option of instrumenting the JVM, and you&#x27;d get this without having to in code pass contexts nor record spans - basically, you instrument the JVM and you&#x27;re done (unless you want to explicitly gain access to it to do something more specific) and your only (some asterisks here, but, mostly) code interaction is to extract the trace-headers from the incoming http request.
 Am I correct in saying that this is not possible in Scala currently - Scala cannot be instrumented in this manner, and we need to use libraries akin to Natchez and/or otel4s where you manually call Span.trace(or whatever the library uses) each call that you want traced? 
 I guess a TL;DR - is it possible to instrument scala for tracing, or is it necessary to interact with libraries?

                              <span>Yes, I know I could use emacs or just any text editor, but I don&#x27;t want to do either. I want to have a nice checklist that I can sync with my phone with syncthing and use without thinking. I don&#x27;t use emacs for anything else so getting over the learning cliff that it is isn&#x27;t justified.
 Is there any org-mode desktop software on linux like orgzly? I found myself acually considering running an android emulator with just that purpose.

                              <span>Hello, it&#x27;s pushing six months since I posted this question originally. While I appreciate the tips from then, I&#x27;m still stuck and eager to overcome this problem so that I can move on with my learning. Since then, I have read LYAH and I have read a large chunk of Real World Haskell, yet I still can&#x27;t overcome this obstacle. I have pondered this problem on and off regularly during this six months. I feel like it is holding me back at this point. As before, this is *not homework*. This is for my own edification.
 This code won&#x27;t compile and I don&#x27;t know how I could bring it to a state where it could be compiled as I can&#x27;t figure out the logic behind it. Hopefully this will offer insight into what the program is supposed to do.

I&#x27;m using tree-sitter runtime ABI version 14. I&#x27;m using nixos so TSUpdate and TSInstall are not gonna work afaik.
 It happens if I paste the culprit text as well

                              <span>I think I&#x27;ve found the definitive * ** sentence that I could use to explain others what is Zettelkasten
I&#x27;ve put it at the top of my Zettelkasten note
Doing Zettelkasten is consider information like ears of wheat and tranforming them in bread and cakes
I&#x27;ve found in the bread making process the most complete and evocative process (harvest, grind, knead, bind floor with water, leaven) that maps to my zettelkasten until now.

 It&#x27;s sorta niggled at the edges of my brain for a while now - and it must confuse the heck out of newbies as well as those of us (ahem) who stuck stuff into init.el several decades ago and forgot about it. So I thought I&#x27;d ask the cool dudes who know ...
 Do packages generally have some kind of protection mechanism to avoid functional conflicts like this? Or at least a warning?
 Or perhaps there&#x27;s a document somewhere that goes into incompatibilities or maybe just &quot;it makes no sense installing X if you have A, B, C...&quot;

                              <span>I&#x27;m newish to emacs, been fiddling with it on/off for about a year but only really had it start to click in the last four months. Anyhow, I&#x27;m trying to setup yasnippets and something is jacking up the basic template you get on invoking yas-new-snippet:
 # -*- mode: snippet -*- # name: # key: # -- 
 For some reason everything past the mode declaration is quasi-randomly indented. I cannot figure out what is doing it and looking at the yasnippet docs this does not seem like the intent.
 My mode line tells me Snippet, ws, yas, company, and wrap are all activated when I invoke yas-new-snippet.
 This is my configuration for yasnippet: 
 (add-to-list &#x27;load-path
 &quot;~/.emacs.d/plugins/yasnippet&quot;)
 (require &#x27;yasnippet)
 (define-key yas-minor-mode-map (kbd &quot;&quot;) &#x27;yas-expand)
 (setq yas-snippet-dirs &#x27;(&quot;~/.emacs.d/snippets&quot; )) (yas-global-mode 1) 
 Is there something I am missing? Do I have to configure snippet-mode separately as well?

                              <span>I&#x27;m using Doom Emacs, with Emacs v. 28.1. I&#x27;m trying to run code to filter Org roam notes by tag-name. I&#x27;ve added it to Doom&#x27;s config.el, which I believe is analogous to Emacs init.el. My config.el file has ;;; $DOOMDIR/config.el -*- lexical-binding: t; -*- at the top, and describe-variable shows that the value for lexical-binding is indeed &#x27;t&#x27; in this buffer. When I evaluate the entire buffer, I catch a void-variable (tag-name), which (I believe?) shouldn&#x27;t be happening when lexical-binding is turned on. However, evaluating only the additional region within the same buffer works fine (temporarily, of course). How can I figure out what&#x27;s going on?
 Edit #1: selecting every line in the buffer and evaluating as a region works as well. Is my lexical-binding local variable being overlooked for some reason?
 Edit #2: Solved - It was because there was a single white character before ;;; $DOOMDIR.
  ;;; $DOOMDIR/config.el -*- lexical-binding: t; -*- . . . (use-package! org-roam :defer t (...)) (defun my/org-roam-filter-by-tag (tag-name) (lambda (node) (member tag-name (org-roam-node-tags node)))) (defun my/org-roam-list-notes-by-tag (tag-name) (mapcar #&#x27;org-roam-node-file (seq-filter (my/org-roam-filter-by-tag tag-name) (org-roam-node-list)))) (defun my/org-roam-find-project () (interactive) ;; Select a project file to open, creating it if necessary (org-roam-node-find nil nil (my/org-roam-filter-by-tag &quot;Project&quot;) nil :templates &#x27;((&quot;p&quot; &quot;project&quot; plain &quot;%?&quot; ;:if-new :target (file+head &quot;${slug}-%.org&quot; &quot;#+title: ${title}\n#+category: ${title}\n#+filetags: Project\n&quot;) :unnarrowed t)))) (global-set-key (kbd &quot;C-c n p&quot;) #&#x27;my/org-roam-find-project)

                              <span>I use Emacs mainly for typing English and Dutch. I would like to have completion candidates pop up from words typed in the current and other open buffers, and from an English and a separate Dutch dictionary file. I have got the English dictionary working, and I can use cape-abbrev by using the binding I defined, but not automatically. My corfu and cape settings follow. Any pointers are greatly appreciated:)

                              <span>I want to run a callback function when files change in a project. I see that it&#x27;s possible to watch individual files, but that&#x27;s not what I want. Yes, I could write some code to extend this to my entire project, but I&#x27;d rather leverage existing solutions if there are any. (Yes, I&#x27;m aware LSP file watchers exist, but I use Eglot).

 I&#x27;ve recently taken to start learning how to use emacs after a nice stint in nvim. I really like the IDE-like features of nvchad, and wonder if there exists such a project/fork of emacs that can replicate it.
 ​
 Thanks!

                              <span>as it say in the title. I tried tabbar mode but I noticed the tabs just take the &quot;next line&quot; in the tab bar instead of staying onn a single line like in Geany/Pycharm when there are too many tabs. Tabs also seem to shrink in size too.
 ​
 Any existing Emacs packages that does this or I&#x27;m I really the only one that would want that?

                              <span>After my last post with my tab-bar-mode visuals, I decided to extract it to a package for anyone who may want to use it. Note that this is for &#x60;tab-bar-mode&#x60;, not &#x60;tab-line-mode&#x60;, which means it is a tab per window layout (similar to perspective.el/persp-mode), and not a tab per buffer.

 Please let me know if it works for you and if there&#x27;s anything you&#x27;d like to customize that you can&#x27;t with this version of the package. No guarantees that I can or will add additional customization options, however.

                              <span>TL;DR
 In an org-capture template, is there any way to have a prompted %-escape that provides both:
  
access to %\N back-references, AND
 calendar support for date-picking (i.e. because it expects a date/time value)
  
Or, more generally: is there a way to get to reuse, further into my capture template, my response to a prompt of the form: %^{Birthday}u?
 Details
 I&#x27;d given up trying to beat org-capture templates into the precise shape I want. Instead I was looking more at yasnippets and the like. But I&#x27;ve been having another go with capture†, and although I&#x27;ve just been reminded of one of the reasons I gave up†, I thought I&#x27;d check with y&#x27;all in case I&#x27;ve missed something.
 When it comes to the various %-escapes available in capture template expansion, there are three types of prompted e…</span>

 I&#x27;ve posted a few times about my tab line config so my love for tabs is public. Recently I&#x27;ve seen several other folks posting as well on the topic and I noticed a trend in the comments with some repeated questions along these lines: 
 
  
But seriously they look nice but do you use them? 
 What&#x27;s the point / I don&#x27;t see what it adds beyond switch-buffer?
 I have a lot of files, hundreds really, open - this doesn&#x27;t look like it will scale.
  

 So I decided to make another tabs video with my answers and perspective on why I really find them useful and how they work in practice.

I&#x27;ve tried several different things and can&#x27;t get it to work. I can manually set flycheck to flake8 with C-c ! s so I know its finding the executable. Flake8 also works in terminal. I&#x27;m using lsp-mode and pyright. The two most recent things I&#x27;ve tried:
 ;; dir-locals.el ((nil . ((flycheck-checker . &#x27;python-flake8) (devdocs-current-docs . python~3.12)))) ;; init.el attempt (eval-after-load &#x27;flycheck (when (eq major-mode &#x27;python-ts-mode) &#x27;(add-hook &#x27;flycheck-mode-hook (flycheck-select-checker &#x27;python-flake8))))

                              <span>I&#x27;m exploring using silos in denote, which I think are potentially very helpful.
 Am I correct in saying that, at present, once I switch to a silo (e.g. with &#x60;denote-silo-extras-create-note&#x60;), I can&#x27;t switch back to the default &#x60;no-silo&#x60; (&#x60;denote-directory&#x60;) without switching to the &#x60;denote-directory&#x60; directory in dired? Or is the intention that everything should be in a silo, rather than in the default &#x60;denote-directory&#x60;?
 Either way, I think things could get complicated working in different silos (assuming the goal is to keep them separate). Perhaps what is needed is some indication prepended to buffer-name of the silo - e.g. if the silo is in ~/Orgs/Silo1 and the #+title is &quot;My plain title&quot;, the buffer name would be &quot;Silo1:My plain title&quot;. If we were in the default &#x60;denote-directory&#x60; , buffer-name would just be &quot;My plain title&quot;.
 Thanks

                              <span>On Arch Linux, there was a new Treesitter update today(0.22.4-1). After that update, Emacs crashes when opening any file with Treesitter enabled. Sadly I&#x27;ve also lost some java files after crashing.
 Anyone else having the issue?

                              <span>Hello I am totally new to emacs looking to try it out, and I have run into some problems setting up lsp-mode. Whenever I try to do M-x package install RET lsp-mode RET, it begins downloading as normal, but then it runs into 123 errors all going along the lines of:
 lsp-actionscript.el:27:2: Error: lsp-execute-command is already defined as something else than a generic function
 The other 122 errors are the exact same but for all the lanuages the lsp supports.
 If I go in the lsp-actionscript.el and go to line 27, then it&#x27;s this command which throws the error:
 (require &#x27;lsp-mode)
 The same goes for all the other errors. I can&#x27;t seem to find anything about this online. Hope u can help:)
 Btw, I use windows 11 if that makes any difference

                              <span>I feel like a complete idiot and have been banging my head against the wall all day with no progress at all. I cannot get this program to work with the packages I am trying to install per the recommendations of a tutorial I am following. It would be really helpful if someone who knows what they are doing could help me on screen share with discord because I feel like I am close to fixing this because I think everything that is supposed to be installed is there and I feel like probably just one of my directory paths is wrong but I don&#x27;t know where or how.
 I have posted on the tutorial and also asked on stack overflow and nothing has been helpful and I am just getting the same errors over and over. I just want to start coding but I can&#x27;t because I can&#x27;t even get this editor set up.
 ​
 Edit: I woke up with renewed vigor and I am going to try again when I get home from some obligatory human activities which unfortunately detract me from my goal of being a data spirit of some kind. Below is a copy of my relevant major file structure. &quot;pmacs&quot; is the HOME directory in my environment variables.

 To ensure normal operation, you should investigate and remove the
 cause of the error in your initialization file. Start Emacs with
 the ‘--debug-init’ option to view a complete error backtrace.

                              <span>Hi everyone! Hope my question is not too silly and repetitive!
 I’ve been a Golang developer most of my career but lately I’ve been feeling kinda stuck knowledge and career wise, so I’m looking for ways to improve my development skills and how to design maintainable clean code. Since I think I’m quite familiar with the common patterns in Go I thought learning a new language might help with broadening my views. I’m currently looking at Zig and Haskell and was going to decide on one of them.
 Im quite curious about your opinion on:
  
Has learning and writing Haskell has affected the way you think about code? not only in Haskell programs but in other languages too.
 
Do you think it has made you better developers? 
 
If so would you able to give some examples? What do you do now that you didn’t before learning Haskell?
 
Has it open some more opportunities for you career wise?
 
 Thank you for taking the time go through this post! Hope you have a great day!

 Hi everyone, I have developed a new library [typed-fsm](https://github.com/sdzx-1/typed-fsm). 
 It allows writing typed finite state machines.
 It has many advantages:
  
Focus on the right message
  
​
  
Top-to-bottom design for easy refactoring
  
​
  
Conducive to building complex state machine systems
  
​
 + Type guarantees will not produce incorrect function calls when written
 + With the help of the type system, we can define many state processing functions and then call each other recursively with confidence.
  
There is a sanity check. If you miss some items for pattern matching, the compiler will issue a warning, and there will also be a warning for invalid items.
  
​
 [Detailed explanation here](https://github.com/sdzx-1/typed-fsm/blob/main/more-en.md).
 Do you have any suggestions?

 [[org:filename.org::#custom-id]] 
 I want to follow this kind of links from function. I do not find the function-name to pass the link string (argument).
 Thank you.

                              <span>I&#x27;ll preface by stating that I use project.el, and not projectile. Any solutions involving the latter won&#x27;t do for me.
 In most other editors, you can create a file at the project root (or some other predefined path) that specifies settings and, among other things, launch commands.
 These commands are for anything related to the project, be it running, compiling, testing, debugging, whatever.
 I want something like this for emacs. So, I&#x27;ve been investigating possible ways to do it.
 I created a .dir-locals.el file on the project root. Emacs automatically loads this file. In it, I defined numerous variables with commands. I defined compile-command and created my own, like run-command and test-command.
 I would then need to create functions that read these variables and run their values, similar to how compile-command is handled. This would work just fine, but there&#x27;s an issue.
 Since the variables I&#x27;m creating are unknown to emacs, it marks them as risky. So, what ends up happening is that every time you open a file where these variables would apply, you get a prompt asking you if you want to apply the variables.
 I managed to fix this by setting these variables as safe when giving them strings like this:
 (put &#x27;compile-and-run-command &#x27;safe-local-variable #&#x27;stringp) (put &#x27;run-command &#x27;safe-local-variable #&#x27;stringp) (put &#x27;test-command &#x27;safe-local-variable #&#x27;stringp) 
 And while this works, it irks me the wrong way, since this file would obviously be bundled with the project. So, if anyone else downloads this project and opens it with emacs, they won&#x27;t have this extra config and they will be bugged by it, and for no good reason since they won&#x27;t have the functions that use these variables anyway so it&#x27;s of no use to them.
 So, I&#x27;m looking for a way to:
  
Define an arbitrary amount of commands to run on a project.
 Have this configuration loaded automatically.
 Not be a nuisance to third parties.
  
Any ideas?

Vice versa for if I hit the bottom.

                              <span>I&#x27;d like for my completions to first have the shortest prefix match.
 For example, if I do C-x C-f and start typing init.el, that should come before early-init.el.
 I seem to have gotten it working for the most part:
 (add-to-list &#x27;ivy-sort-matches-functions-alist &#x27;(counsel-find-file . ivy-sort-function-buffer)) (add-to-list &#x27;ivy-sort-matches-functions-alist &#x27;(ivy-switch-buffer . ivy-sort-function-buffer)) (add-to-list &#x27;ivy-sort-matches-functions-alist &#x27;(counsel-projectile-find-file . ivy-sort-function-buffer)) 
 However, I&#x27;m still faced with execute-extended-command (i.e, M-x) not honoring my wish. What relevant ivy function should I look into to get this to work?
 Would there instead be a way for me to get it to work for all of them instead of individually?
 Edit: I was able to do it by enabling counsel-mode and the relevant function was counsel-M-x; however, I&#x27;m still curious if there is either (1) a better way (2) to do. this for all completions.

                              <span>I&#x27;m happy to announce the release of Kele 0.5.0, the spritzy Kubernetes cluster management package for Emacs. Changelog is available here.
 This release integrates Kele with the menu bar. With this initial integration, you can switch Kubernetes contexts and default namespaces from within the menu bar. Kele presents your available contexts and namespaces as dynamic sub-menus, freeing you from the need to remember exact names and typing them in by hand (similar to kubectx and kubens on the terminal).

 With this release, Kele is now also integrated with doom-modeline. By adding the k8s segment to your doom-modeline configuration, you&#x27;ll see current context and namespace information directly on the modeline. By clicking the segment, you can also access the menu bar, for the (menu-bar-mode -1) crowd.

 For more details, see the Kele documentation. As always, please open an issue for any peculiar behavior you notice, or feel free to start a discussion if you&#x27;d like to give general feedback or throw ideas around.
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hi.
 As a follow up to this post I tried manually configuring the laravel-dev-tool server for blade templates.
 Here&#x27;s my config (I&#x27;m using Doom):
 (after! lsp-mode (...) (add-to-list &#x27;lsp-language-id-configuration &#x27;(web-mode . &quot;blade&quot;)) (lsp-register-client (make-lsp-client :new-connection (lsp-stdio-connection (executable-find &quot;laravel-dev-tools&quot;) &quot;lsp&quot;) :activation-fn (lsp-activate-on &quot;blade&quot;) :server-id &#x27;bladels :priority -1))) 
 When I use this configuration and open a .blade.php file nothing happens. No server starts. It doesn&#x27;t even try to start a server as I see no messages related to LSP.
 If I change the &quot;blade&quot; language to &quot;html&quot; (which is bound to html-ls) it starts the server successfully.
 So I&#x27;m guessing either I&#x27;m missing something or have something not configured correctly.
 Can someone please try and help me figure this out?
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>I have a simple issue, here&#x27;s my config:  (use-package lsp-mode :ensure t) (use-package lsp-java :ensure t)  and when I run lsp after entering a Java file I get  Command &quot;semgrep lsp&quot; is not present on the path.  I&#x27;ve tried some online solutions but nothing is working for me. I was using much more complex configs for lsp-mode and lsp-java and have settled down on this simplest.

                              <span>Hi there, 
 I&#x27;d like to have a &quot;do what I mean&quot; mouse navigation while coding and reviewing code (mainly typescript) featuring the following :
  
s- on an url in a comment open browser 
 s- on a type definition search for references
 s- on something opens definition
 s- on import opens the imports definition
 s- on a { folds it
 s- on a folded block unfolds it
  
Does someone have some lookalike setup or have pointers to quickly implement this?
 Thank you!

                              <span>I have a minor-mode which I use with org-mode buffers, the minor mode makes use of python expressions for example:
 * heading this is a test text &#x60;{True if 1 &#x3D;&#x3D; 1 else False}&#x60; this is another line 
 now I want the text inside &#x60;{ }&#x60; to be highlighted using python syntax, is this possible preferably using something related to font-lock-add-keywords ??
 I already tried poly-mode but it misses up all the org-mode syntax highlighting, and it makes emacs kinda laggy, but code completion when inside &#x60;{ }&#x60; is related to python. but no syntax highlighting.
 and here is the code I used to create the poly-mode :
 (define-hostmode poly-org-python-hostmode :mode &#x27;org-mode :protect-syntax nil :protect-font-lock nil ) (define-innermode poly-org-python-innermode nil :mode &#x27;python-mode :head-matcher &quot;&#x60;{&quot; :tail-matcher &quot;}&#x60;\n&quot; :head-mode &#x27;host :tail-mode &#x27;host) (define-polymode poly-org-python-mode :hostmode &#x27;poly-org-python-hostmode :innermodes &#x27;(poly-org-python-innermode ) )

                              <span>Hello -
 I&#x27;m trying to export a fairly complex org document---figures; links; footnotes; etc.
 It exports to LaTeX just fine, but not to ODT (which I need to get to a DOCX).
 It ends without creating a file, sending a humongous chunk of text to *Messages* without any error messages.
 The chunk of text seems mostly to be footnote related stuff. Here&#x27;s a typical line:
 &quot; 0 1 (:parent #18)))) (footnote-definition (:label &quot;65&quot; :begin 470440 :end 470472 :contents-begin 470448 :contents-end 470471 :pre-blank 0 :post-blank 1 :post-affiliated 470440 :mode nil :granularity nil :parent #16) (paragraph (:begin 470448 :end 470471 :contents-begin 470448 :contents-end 470471 :post-blank 0 :post-affiliated 470448 :mode nil :granularity nil :parent #17) #(&quot;Toll, &quot; 0 6 (:parent #18)) (italic (:begin 7 :end 34 :post-blank 0 :contents-begin 8 :contents-end 33 :parent #18) #(&quot;The Entertainment Machine&quot; 0 25 (:parent #19))) #(&quot;, 11.&quot; 0 5 (:parent #18)) #(&quot; 
 I&#x27;m guessing my file has got a bad something somewhere, but I don&#x27;t know where to look. 
 For what it&#x27;s worth, every line of the *Messages* dump ends with &quot;#(&quot;
 Has anybody faced anything similar before?
 Thanks for any help!

                              <span>The following sequence may cause the problem of keyboard keys producing no key input: 1. Copy some text from a web page (with Edge or Chrome) 2. Paste the copied to a buffer of emacs with command of evil p (paste) 3. Saw in the minibuffer &quot;M-p is undefined&quot; 4. Then enter a key in any application in Windows would produce no key input at all. After the error, selecting web page URL from bookmarks into address bar of Edge/Chrome browser also have no effect. 
 How to investigate the cause of the problem?
 The problem is random, only happens sometimes. The emacs runs in Ubuntu 22.04 in WSL 2.

 How can I make it to work in all modes? or scratch mode too?

                              <span>I have a global command &quot;M-l&quot; which prints &quot;hello&quot; in the minibuffer. I evaluate the following:
 (define-minor-mode test-mode :init-value nil :lighter &quot; test&quot; :keymap (make-sparse-keymap)) (define-key test-mode-map [t] &#x27;ignore) 
 and enable test-mode in a test buffer. As expected, nothing happens when I press any key. Even M-l does nothing and minibuffer remains clear. However, if I then evaluate
 (define-key test-mode-map (kbd &quot;M-j&quot;) (lambda () (interactive) (message &quot;hi fren&quot;))) 
 when I run M-j in the test buffer, I see &quot;hi fren&quot; in minibuffer, but if I also run M-l in test buffer, I also see &quot;hello&quot; in minibuffer. In fact, all M-modified global keys are now working. Why is this? 
 ​
 More to the point, what if I want to still have access to my global keybinds, while having special code for anything that is not defined in test-mode-map? 
 ​
 I could set the parent of test-mode-map to global-map, but then any keys that are not in test map and not in global-map are handled by global-map if I dont use the [t] option, and if I use it, any global keys not in test-map never reach global-map.

                              <span>Hi.
 I&#x27;ve come across haringsrob/laravel-dev-tools language server for editing Laravel Blade files. I was wondering if it&#x27;s possible to use it with Emacs&#x27; web-mode ? 
 I use intelephense language server but would like to be able to configure emacs to use this language server when editing .blade.php files.
 Is this possible? How can I configure this?
 Thanks in advance.

 Up until now I have been using lsp-treemacs-symbols to get an outline view of my java files. This mostly works but because it depends on the lsp server to provide the information there can be lots of odd hiccups when for whatever reason that server is down or slow. An alternative would be to use imenu and imenu-list to provide this capability. But by default it doesn&#x27;t show as much detail as lsp-treemacs and in particular there were no field …</span>

                              <span>This works perfectly fine and snappy in X11, but on Wayland with the PGTK build, some emacs links don&#x27;t display the highlight when hovering with the mouse immediately, it takes a few seconds. Then there are some other links that do work immediately, which makes it even more odd.
 You can see this in the dashboard.el recent files or project list. It can also be spotted on treemacs. Links in org mode buffers seem to be instant tho. It is quite inconsistent.
 In any case, I am more interested in knowing how can I see what function is reposnsible for the mouse highlighting on hover. I tried to use the profiler, but the function doesn&#x27;t show up. I guess it&#x27;s very deep in emacs, something from the C core most likely which would be a bummer. I want to investigate why this issue happens in the first place.
 Any ideas?

                              <span>I am upgrading a lot of Scala 2.13 services up to Scala 3, and have encountered some codebases where reflection was used in unit tests to examine all the subclasses of a trait.
 For example, in 2.x the way to make enumerations was with a sealed trait and case object subclasses. We would often make a collection listing all types, similar to Java enum .values. In our unit tests we would want to make sure no subtypes were accidentally omitted from that collection, and we would use reflection for that.
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;scala import scala.reflect.runtime.universe
 val classType &#x3D; universe.typeOf[Branding] val subclasses &#x3D; classType.typeSymbol.asClass.knownDirectSubclasses &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 This is gone in Scala 3 and I&#x27;m wondering if there is a simple alternative. I would love to spend a day or two learning the new Scala macro syntax but I don&#x27;t have the time right now to devote to that, just for this simple 2-line expression.
 One might also suggest just updating our 2-style enums to Scala 3 proper enums. That will solve some of our scenarios but we use this &quot;find subclass types&quot; in tests for other classes as well, not just enums. For example we might occasionally have a trait with many subclasses and we want to make sure we have written a certain kind of test for each of the concrete subclasses, and reflection can come in handy as a sanity check here.
 gzoller/scala-reflection seems popular but I don&#x27;t see any documentation.

I can&#x27;t figure out how to do this easily, without having to dig through directories with meaningless UUID names. Is there a quick and easy way to copy an attachment from one directory to another?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve started a Cabal project which consists of an executable and a single test-suite. In the test-suite I call the executable in a subprocess using System.Process.callProcess. 
 I&#x27;ve found that cabal test does not automatically rebuild the executable after its Main.hs has been modified. Hence tests were failing simply because the executable was out-of-date.
 It took me a while to figure out how to fix this so I&#x27;m recording the fix here. The Cabal file should look something like this:
 name: foo executable: bar main-is: Main.hs hs-source-dirs: app test-suite: tests type: exitcode-stdio-1.0 main-is: test.hs hs-source-dirs: tests build-tool-depends: foo:bar 
 The build-tool-depends line ensures that the executable bar in project foo gets built every time the test-suite is run.
 The comments on this Github issue suggest that this is the official way of ensuring that an executable is built before a test-suite is run. And this open issue is requesting the addition of a run-tool-depends field which would create a distinction between executables used when building a component and those used to running a component.
 Is there a better way of directly testing an executable with Cabal?

This is yet another opportunity to share with your friends what you are working on. Add to this discussion by telling us about your zettelkasten journey. Share with us what you&#x27;re learning. Sharing helps me and, hopefully, you, too. It helps us clarify our goals and visualize our thinking. And sometimes, a conversation sparks a magical moment where we can dive into an idea worth exploring. We&#x27;d love to hear more from you.   🫵🏼
Ideas I&#x27;m exploring with my ZK:
A deep dive into time-slicing vs time-sinks. I&#x27;m looking at this from the perspective of creating a flourishing life in the present moment and not as much from a formal &quot;time management&quot; perspective. I see that incrementally working on strategies for maintaining continuity and interest over time is what will make time-slicing sustainable, where my rigid thinking has led me to drop this practice in the past.
With the help of Matt Ellis at Grammarly Blog, I am studying the differences between summarizing and paraphrasing for academic research.

                              <span>I just switched to wayland and replaced my older emacs package with emacs-wayland, and the only bug so far is that, while using the daemon, if I have a frame opened and I start a new one with a keybinding or a command, the one I opened before switches to the scratch buffer of the new one
 It only works with one at a time from how I&#x27;ve tested it but it&#x27;s very weird, this never happens in X11, does anyone know what it could be?

                              <span>Hello emacs community, no matter how hard i try i cannot seem to wrap my head around the idea of using hooks in emacs. I have two examples to provide. The one working and the other one not, although i&#x27;ve seen both in the documentation.
 First example: Defining a function and then passing in to the hook.
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;emacs-lisp (defun my-c-mode-hook () (setq c-basic-offset 4 indent-tabs-mode nil electric-indent-mode nil) (message &quot;C-mode hook loaded successfully&quot;))
 (add-hook &#x27;c-mode-common-hook &#x27;my-c-mode-hook) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; Even though the message prints, the variables don&#x27;t seem to get the values.
 Second example:
 emacs-lisp (add-hook &#x27;c-mode-common-hook (lambda () (setq c-basic-offset 4 indent-tabs-mode nil electric-indent-mode nil) (message &quot;C-mode hook loaded successfully&quot; ))) 
 The second one, passing a lambda to the hook works. It also is the same for my latex-mode hooks.
 So my question is, what is the difference between the two methods and what am i missing here. If anyone wants to share a resource for working with emacs hooks it will also be really appreciated.
 On the note of hooks, i have a more general question. When using the setq-default it will set the variable globally if it can. tab-width for example if set with &#x60;setq-default does not apply to all buffers. But if it is passed with a hook it works. Correct me if i&#x27;m wrong but does that happen because the settings get overwritten by the major mode? That&#x27;s why you need the hook to overwrite the major mode defaults perhaps???
 Thank you in advance.

                              <span>Hello, folks! Learning to use the awesomeness that is org-babel, having trouble finding my footing:
 Withing dedicated buffer for, e.g. emacs-lisp, I get neat docs, and auto-completion, lsp (in the minibuffer).
 Now I know that lsp-within-org-babel has a whole package dedicated to it, so I know that:
  
there&#x27;s no LSP within code block by default
 there&#x27;s a hack that&#x27;s experimental but it might work
  
Haven&#x27;t tried it, so this is me regurgitating google, basically, and I welcome corrections gladly.
 Now when I try the above example within org code block - I don&#x27;t get the same features. 
 Is this a natural limitation of org babel and I just shouldn&#x27;t go for literate programming if I need the features of a proper IDE?
 emacs v.29.2 distro - spacemacs
 ADDED: huh, found this by one of spacemacs&#x27; devs.

                              <span>I am writing some code that allows me to work on trees and have those trees printed out onto the buffer. Depending on which kind of node I am currently editing, I have a different keymap for different commands that apply to that node. When I switch nodes however, I want to switch the active keymap, but changing the mode-map I have does nothing, the old keymap is still active and the new commands do not become available. I could look up the command in a hashtable, but Im worried that is not as efficient as just using the keymap structures furnished by emacs. How should I go about this?

                              <span>Hi everyone, this is the first time I&#x27;m posting something like this on this subreddit.
 After a lot of work (and crashes), I&#x27;m pleased to announce colorful-mode.el, a featured alternative to rainbow-mode.el
 Features
  
Preview any color from your current buffer in real time.
 Change them to any color type (only hex and emacs color names are available).
 Choose between highlight them or using a customizable string prefix.
  
Also you can add your custom regex function (check colorful-extra-color-keywords-hook).
 Since this is the first package for emacs that I&#x27;ve ever made I would like to hear your comments, feedback and tips (since i&#x27;m not expert in elisp)

                              <span>Hi, I work in org mode using ess-r. I&#x27;m not able to lets eglot automatically start while I open the src temp buffer. Emacs recognize the major mode (ess-r-mode) but eglot do not start. I try to open a .R file and eglot start as expected, so the issue is relative the src buffer. Do you have the same issue? How do you menage it?

Dyadic Decomposition using Functional lenses by Eduardo Lemos
Compressors are usually implemented imperatively. Pointers and mutation are in the spotlight and it is not hard to put yourself into some spaghetti code. How functional programming abstractions deal with it? In this presentation, I explain one instance in which some of them fit like a glove to the problem on hand, going all the way from intuition to actual code.

                              <span>I am looking for a gloss library that can help me make text boxes. The standard gloss library lets you add text, but does not support typing. Gloss does have a type for key events, so it’s easy enough to code the typing functionality. However, it gets tricky having to add a new line whenever the text reaches a certain length as gloss does not render ‘\n’. Help pleaseeeee

                              <span>I would like to share a simple demo on how to use Haskell to build a backend API on Google Cloud Run for free. It&#x27;s a simple API built with Haskell and Scotty, containerized with Docker for easy deployment.
 🔗 Repo: https://github.com/mihassan/cloud-run-hs-demo
 Why This Project? I&#x27;ve been coding in Haskell for some time now mostly for toy projects. I really love coding in Haskell, but one thing I was missing is to easily share my work in a straightforward, cost-effective way to friends/colleagues. This setup, combining Haskell with Docker and Cloud Run, might not be ideal for a production-grade service but is great for demos and learning experiences - all for free.
 Project Overview:
 The project, cloud-run-hs-demo, is a basic Haskell application that uses the Scotty web framework to set up a simple API. This demo showcases how you can containerize a Haskell application using Docker and deploy it to Google Cloud Run, a managed platform that automatically scales your stateless containers.
 I am aware that the setup lacks many essential features like rate limiting, authentication mechanisms, and DDoS protection. Also, there are many options for web frameworks, such as servant, yesod etc. and many database libraries. These are critical for production-grade services to ensure security and manageability. This project serves as a demonstration on how easy it is to get started.
 Features:
  
Simple Haskell API using Scotty.
 SQLite readonly database using sqlite-simple project.
 Docker integration for Cloud Run deployment.
 Static webpage as frontend for the API.
  
I&#x27;d love to hear your thoughts, feedback, or any experiences with similar technologies. Let&#x27;s learn and explore together!
 Happy coding! 🎉

                              <span>For a couple days, I have been faffing with Yololisp mainly since I think it looks pretty neat. I cannot seem to get it to work correctly and trying to google solutions has yielded few results.
 I am quite new to Emacs which is not helping either since I don&#x27;t know if it is an issue with how I am running it, if I am missing a package, or if the whole of Yololisp just doesn&#x27;t work anymore.
 When I run the .sh, I get a long error message with &quot;Eager macro-expansion failure: (error &quot;Misplaced t or &#x27;otherwise&#x27; clause&quot;)&quot; being the only thing I can see that leads me in any sort of direction. The error message only stays up for a quarte of a second, though I grabbed a screenshot of what I can view before it vanishes.

 tl;dr -- Every lsp mode for emacs works great, under most circumstances you can&#x27;t go wrong with any of them.
 Seriously, if all you want to know is if lsp modes for emacs are good and if you should use one, the answer is yes, assuming it supports your language.
 Summary
  
lspce is the lightest weight, least intrusive of all of them, even less than eglot if you ignore the setup costs. It gives you the least ability to inspect what&#x27;s going on (I haven&#x27;t checked the project for a couple of weeks, but when I first installed it it didn&#x27;t even have the stderr output of the lsp that was running) but also feels the most transparent. Similar to lsp-bridge, you&#x27;ll see a big benefit on large projects with the potential to block your UI.
 lsp-bridge took the most work to set …</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m having to write jsx/tsx, and I want the best possible experience dealing with this pesky syntax elements.
 What do you folks use these days? I&#x27;m basically hoping to improve the following aspects:
  
Typing jsx/tsx forms
 Folding
 Structural editing
  
 
For the first thing I probably can still use Emmet mode. Or maybe there&#x27;s something better now?
 
Since I&#x27;m already using treesitter, for folding I tried: emacs-tree-sitter/ts-fold, but because I&#x27;m using Emacs 30, I had to use this fork: abougouffa/treesit-fold, see emacs-tree-sitter/ts-fold#48 for details. That though still didn&#x27;t get me the desired outcome. If I have a component such as:
 export default function Home() { return (  
  ... 
 
 and I try folding around 
, it folds the entire function body. Not sure why. In general, I&#x27;m not sure what to use for folding to make it work with treesitter - ts-fold/treesit-fold, hideshow, evil-fold, origami, bicycle, yafolding, evil-vimish-fold, or something else?
  
For structural editing I&#x27;m not even sure what would be helpful here. I&#x27;m thinking of trying evil-matchit, to quickly jump to beginning/end of an element, because evil&#x27;s % keybinding doesn&#x27;t support html tags by default, but that&#x27;s just one aspect. There are probably a few other things to consider?
  
What are your thoughts? In general, do you know of any other Emacs packages you&#x27;d recommend for web-development? Also, I noticed that not all the features of emacs-tree-sitter/elisp-tree-sitter went into core (again, I&#x27;m using Emacs 30), do you think it&#x27;s worth loading the package instead of relying on what&#x27;s already in the core?

                              <span>I&#x27;m updating an old .emacs-file for a colleaque for Emacs 29.
 There are keybinding (for LaTeX) which stopped working.
 Example:
 (fset &#x27;gamma (lambda (&amp;optional arg) &quot;Keyboard macro.&quot; (interactive &quot;p&quot;) (kmacro-exec-ring-item (quote (&quot;\\gamma&quot; 0 &quot;%d&quot;)) arg))) (keymap-global-set &quot;s-g&quot; &#x27;gamma) 
 This returns now a &quot;Invalid function...&quot;
 Can anyone help updating them for v. 29., I&#x27;m not an experienced Emacs user and don&#x27;t know Lisp :)

                              <span>When I continue to hit backspace in eshell it removes the prompt elements. How can I stop this behaviour?
 A stack overflow post provides a solution for this issue for M-x shell namely setting comint-prompt-read-only to t but also a comment stated it should not happen for eshell yet it does for me. I could find no eshell equivalent variable.
 My eshell prompt is split across two lines. The first line shows my working directory followed by the git branch if relevant. (I also want to add venv info at some point.)The second line shows just # or $ depending on the user. 
 eshell-prompt-regexp is set at the default value &quot;[#$\n]* [#$] &quot; as it seems to match my constructed prompt but perhaps not? 
 Still on Emacs 27.1. Thanks for your time.
 Solution: here

In Rstudio, autocompletion work in console while debugging. Any suggestions or guidelines how to accomplish autocomplete in inferior ess while debugging? Thanks in advanced.

                              <span>Hello,
 I have a project utilizing CMake with nested subprojects, structured roughly like this:  -Root/ --compile_commands.json --CMakeLists.txt --Build/ --Library/ ---src/ ----A/ ----B/ ---CMakeLists.txt --Executable/ (Depends on Library) ---src/ ----A/ ----B/ ---CMakeLists.txt  The hope is to start Eglot once at the root, and have it work for each subproject, but it doesn&#x27;t enable when opening the source code for each subproject. Enabling Eglot repeatedly simply starts multiple instances, treating every single subdirectory as it&#x27;s own project. Is there any way to have it treat the whole Root/ folder as a single project?

                              <span>How would I best go about setting up a note where I could take weekly journal entries and TODOS throughout my day.
 I&#x27;m thinking something like having the date as a level one heading and then being able to input the current time as a level two heading below it and in that I can track my journal entries and todos?
 I&#x27;m a beginner in emacs so please keep that in mind when explaining things or recommending things for me to do

                              <span>I have some academic notes with citations in org-roam. They used to be like Train (2009). Recently, when I modify and complie them into pdf, the citations are now in footnotes like1.
 1 Train (2009)
 I think I did not change my init file. The releant lines are
 (setq org-cite-csl-styles-dir &quot;~/snap/zotero-snap/common/Zotero/styles/&quot;) (setq org-cite-global-bibliography &#x27;(&quot;~/Dropbox/org/org-roam/my_library.bib&quot;)) (setq org-cite-export-processors &#x27;( (t . (csl &quot;chicago-author-date.csl&quot;)))) ; Fallback(the default option)) 
 I tried other csl bib styles and citation styles, they are all in footnotes. For now, I use
 #+cite_export: basic author author-year 
 However, this produces Train, Kenneth (2009). Not something I want.
 I did some search and still do not know what happened. I followed the articles
  
https://amerygration.com/Blog/citation_handling_in_emacs.html
 https://blog.tecosaur.com/tmio/2021-07-31-citations.html
 https://kristofferbalintona.me/posts/202206141852
  
The author of citar posted something (https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/11rmakl/comment/jca9iqt/?utm\_source&#x3D;share&amp;utm\_medium&#x3D;web3x&amp;utm\_name&#x3D;web3xcss&amp;utm\_term&#x3D;1&amp;utm\_content&#x3D;share\_button) related to my problem. But is no longer on reddit.
 This is what I got when I compile the file now.
 This part relies on [cite/t:@trainDiscreteChoiceMethods2009].

 This is the file I complied in February.

 I&#x27;m thinking something like this
  
(today&#x27;s date) *(current time) **(notes, journal entries, basically anything) *(todos)
  
How would I do this in emacs?

Like with implicit parameters...why the hell not just include all the arguments? Why are you leaving shit out to be picked up implicitly? This is just making the code insanely hard to read quickly

                              <span>Hello, as a 3 YOE I want to interview for senior level jobs on the Typelevel stack, however I am wondering what are the expectations from the interviewer perspective? And what could be the best way to properly prepare such interviews? As a starting point I am doing the RockTheJVM &quot;Scala and FP interview&quot; course but I am wondering if there are other resources or better ways to crush the interview.

                              <span>Hi Scala community, as a software engineer with 10 years of experience I&#x27;d like to know your opinion. What would you choose now if you were in my situation: Scala or Rust?
 A bit of context: last 10 years I was involved mostly in web development (backend) and I feel kinda burned out now. Everything is the same: create a CRUD, connect a DB, integrate 3rd party API etc. It feels like it&#x27;s not fun anymore, everything is the same and boring.
 Currently I have a Scala job that has nothing to do with FP and to be honest I quite like the language. I also like FP and spend some time every day to learn cats and cats effect, I REALLY enjoy it, something new and refreshing.
 But anyway, at the end of the day i realize that all these fancy things like cats and monads, although it&#x27;s fun, is just anothe…</span>

                              <span>I do not feel that github stars correlates with the quality of a project. That said popularity and be an &quot;hot topic&quot; helps even in a competitive industry in which we work, where should be easier recognise real value from noise. If we want that scala gain popularity and adoption we need to act individually, we can do a lot of things: contributing, advocating, etc. The easier way, but nonetheless effective, it&#x27;s just to star a github repository. So guys let&#x27;s the scala3 repo fly to the moon :D

                              <span>1YOE in Scala, I&#x27;ve accomplished a good level of confidence with FP and Typelevel stack but i can&#x27;t say that i&#x27;m a good scala programmer. I know that it takes time, also coming from a dynamical language like python doesn&#x27;t help. But I would like to improve at a faster pace, could you suggest me something? In my opinion what helps more is: personal projects, spend a lot of time reading working on code and reading other people code. Anyone has some advice? Everything is accepted: books, courses, also personal advices or ideas about what worked for you..thx in advance

                              <span>I had a look for Scala podcasts -- and could not find any current podcasts dedicated to Scala. 
 Everything I found is two years old or older. Only related current podcast I dug out is: Happy Path Programming with Bruce Eckel &amp; James Ward (which actually is a good one).
 Is there anything else current?

                              <span>I want to fontify characters on each line of a buffer based off of the following:
  
For every character that is in a position greater than position 24 and less than position X, if (mod position 12) is zero, one, or two, then fontify.
  
I have the following that I plan to add this to when activating a custom mode.
 (defvar marc-font-lock-defaults &#x27;(;; MARC leader (&quot;^.\\{24\\}&quot; . font-lock-constant-face))) 
 I don&#x27;t think I can do this with a regex. What other options do I have, and can you point to some examples? Thanks.

 If the first: - How was/is the experience using it? - Does it work with languages other than Python?
 If the second: - Which one (if you can share a link it&#x27;ll be useful). - With which language have you used it? - How was the experience?

                              <span>Out of the blue Apple introduced a global shortcut for creating quick notes in Notes App: Control Q. It‘s supposed to be Fn+Q, but on my MacBook Pro it‘s Ctrl+Q. 
 Now this intereres with a lot of shortcuts in my Emacs setup. For instance with C-c C-q (toggle edit in dired mode). 
 Does anyone know how to disable Apple‘s global shortcut? I don’t want to delete Notes app, as I am using it.

                              <span>I know it&#x27;s fashionable to lazy load as much as possible in order to minimize startup time, but what&#x27;s the best way to do the opposite?
 I&#x27;m almost always going to want at least one org file open, so I&#x27;d like to eagerly load org-mode on startup and pay the cost then as opposed to being interrupted by an annoying hitch when I&#x27;m trying to open my first org file.
 My first two theories were:
 (use-package org :demand t) 
 and
 (require &#x27;org) 
 but neither worked.

                              <span>Hello all,
 I&#x27;ve finally got my own configuration built and a fairly decent working understanding of Emacs. I followed the System Crafter&#x27;s Emacs From Scratch YouTube playlist and then branched off into my own thing.
 I&#x27;m now wondering if there&#x27;s anything that I should exchange from that baseline configuration? 
 There&#x27;s a package that Neovim has that I&#x27;d love to have in Emacs called oil. It&#x27;s a buffer based directory and file tree modification system. 
 So those who are more familiar with the meta of Emacs packages right now, would you be able to recommend some packages that I should exchange with what I built from this config mentioned above?

                              <span>I don&#x27;t have stable access to the internet all the time and this causes me to stress when I learn something online, so I prefer to download resources, for example I downloaded the python documentation and it works as a site, I can click titles as if I&#x27;m browsing online, and also downloaded the freecodecamp chapter_ed video. 
 I notice that Haskell Also has great documentation, playground and the &quot;try Haskell!&quot; tutorial. but I don&#x27;t see ways to download these resources. Also I can&#x27;t seem to find an extensive video tutorial as it is the case with Perl, Python or C which I downloaded. 
 So tl;dr I already think online Haskell resources are great but, I need, for my special case offline resources that are as good.

                              <span>Like many before me, I love &quot;The Archive&quot; Mac app and am lusting for an iPad/iPhone version. I understand the limitations of small developers, but I was wondering if there would be additional incentives to create this if we were to get a &quot;crowdfund&quot; amount going on Kickstarter or something; if financial backing were high enough (you name the amount you need), we could collectively &quot;hire&quot; you guys to develop the iPad app.
I suspect the addition of AI-backed tools could start to reduce the hours required to achieve such a task, so perhaps an additional financial commitment from the community would make it worthwhile and eliminate any financial risks on your end, Sascha &amp; Christian.</span>

                              <span>I have a bit of a love-hate relationship with Org&#x27;s datetree structure, the most recent switch (from love back to hate on this occasion) being only two days ago. No doubt I&#x27;ll flip back again, but it&#x27;ll be short lived. If any given use of it lasted more than 10 weeks, I&#x27;d be surprised.
 So I was impressed to read u/github-alphapapa&#x27;s answer to a recent question, on org-ql:
  
You may also consider using datetrees in a smaller set of files, e.g. one file per year, or even for multiple years. My log.org file goes back over 10 years, ...
  
I&#x27;d be interested to hear (from the estimable u/github-alphapapa himself, but from anyone else too):
 In what way(s) do you find datetree to be useful and worth sticking with?
 TL;DR
 For context, and perhaps to head off at the pass answers like &quot;Coz it&#x27;s.…</span>

                              <span>Digging into org-ql and its pretty amazing to say the least.
 What i&#x27;m trying to do is query some org files I use for my personal review periods. I&#x27;d like to do a query that looks for additive tags not or based tags but I&quot;m not sure how to structure the query.
 An example:
 I&#x27;d like to be able to search my org files for items tagged say :FEB:2023:Accomplishment: if I use those tags via tags:Feb,2023,Accomplishment it gets things tagged with all the combinations not the 3 joined together to be more restrictive.
 If it&#x27;s helpful to understand I organize my reviews by month such that the 2023-02-Feb.org file has the FEB and 2023 in the filetags at the top of the file and then I have 4 headings within each file Week1,2,3,4 each with the same structure.
 If I can limit to just those tags then sorting by parent should then auto organize the month into week 1/2/3/4 sections in the org-ql view.
 Thanks in advance for any help!
 p.s. Additionally is there a way to have org-ql search a directory not just a set of individual space separated files?

                              <span>I have been killing myself trying to figure out what is going on here. I wrote a function to match for every reference in an org file to a word, then replace it with a link back to the org roam node. However I am having an issue.
 ​
 The function
 (defun link-name-to-org-roam-file (name filepath)
 (interactive &quot;sName: \nsOrg-roam File path (relative to Org-roam directory): &quot;)
 ;; Debugging: Print the filepath and name to *Messages* buffer
 (message &quot;Debug: name &#x3D; %s, filepath &#x3D; %s&quot; name filepath)
 (let* ((org-roam-dir (file-truename (expand-file-name org-roam-directory)))
 (full-path (expand-file-name filepath org-roam-dir))
 (link (format &quot;[[file:%s][%s]]&quot; full-path name)))
 ;; Debugging: Print the full-path again right before replacement
 (message &quot;Debug: link before replace-match &#x3D; %s&quot; link)
 (save-excursion
 (goto-char (point-min))
 (while (re-search-forward name nil t)
 ;; Debugging: Print what is actually being replaced
 (message &quot;Debug: replacing match with &#x3D; %s&quot; link)
 (replace-match link)))))
 ​
 The following are the debugs that get printed to the console:
 ​
 Debug: name &#x3D; Jane, filepath &#x3D; book1-characters-jane.org
 Debug: link before replace-match &#x3D; [[file:/home/john/org/RoamNotes/book1-characters-jane.org][Jane]]
 Debug: replacing match with &#x3D; [[file:/home/john/org/RoamNotes/book1-characters-jane.org][Jane]] [28 times]
 ​
 ​
 However when I cat the org file from the CLI, the links in the file actually look like this:
 [[File:/Home/John/Org/RoamNotes/Book1-Characters-Jane.Org][Jane]]
 Because of this the links do not work. I know the issue is not the function, could there be some addon or function to org mode that is capitalizing all the links?

                              <span>Maybe I compiled emacs without an option to speed up image viewing, but when compared to other pdf viewers, there is an annoying amount of lag when just scrolling a 4 page document. I have the same problem with docview, even when launching emacs with the -Q option. Turning off line number mode, as suggested by other answers, does nothing for me

                              <span>I switched to company + vertico + consult + marginalia + orderless a couple of years ago. I always run bleeding-edge emacs 30 compiled from source (I&#x27;m a glutton for punishment, been doing it that way for 30 years). 
 Now I see corfu has become a good simpler alternative to company, but I&#x27;m unsure what the difference is between corfu &amp; vertico, so I&#x27;m not sure if I can dump company or not. Minad says &quot;Vertico is the minibuffer completion counterpart of Corfu&quot; but what does that mean really?
 In my mind I think of company as a completion provider (on top of capf) and vertico as the UI for it. But corfu is a UI for capf, right? So do I still need vertico? And I assume I&#x27;ll still need consult, I couldn&#x27;t live without consult-buffer.
 I know I should just try it &amp; see what happens, but any pointers would be helpful.

                              <span>I try to run after restart transient that includes ffdata, I receive the error that FFData isn&#x27;t loaded; and when I try to load it by manually evaling its use-package statement, it says that emacsql isn&#x27;t loaded. So, I can get everything loaded by evaluating my emacsql use-package, and then my ff-data use-package. But why do I have to do this every load time? I thought I could get around it by using :after and :demand but for some reason this doesn&#x27;t seem to change anything. I like to pretend that order doesn&#x27;t matter in my init.el, so I would like to avoid repositioning them in some other order.
 Here are the important lines I am trying:
 (use-package emacsql :demand t) 
 and above:
  (use-package consult-ffdata :after emacsql :straight (consult-ffdata :type git :host github :repo &quot;chen-chao/consult-ffdata&quot;) :custom (counsel-ffdata-database-path &quot;/home/torysa/.mozilla/firefox/aabkj82t.default/places.sqlite&quot;) ) 
 Why aren&#x27;t the demand and after statements working, and why do I have to manually evaluate those lines to get things to work properly?

                              <span>A few months ago, I found a website that had a few different customized starter kit versions of emacs for download. I have been looking for that site again but can&#x27;t seem to find it. I am mainly looking for it because one of the configurations was customized for creative writing with all kinds of packages for creating novels, managing biographies, and world building. They also claimed snippets for org mode to insert LaTex that would get you most of the way to what is needed to publish an ebook. 
 I don&#x27;t remember everything they said it did, but I mainly use emacs for programming and org mode related things. I really wanted to take a look at the configuration and packages to see what was included. I want to add some creative writing tools to my emacs config, and I was hoping to save time scraping elpa and trying different things, by testing their starter-kit out and then stealing the best packages and workflows which I could modify and add to my own config for my own purposes.
 Anyways if anyone has seen anything like that Please point the way.

                              <span>My question is a bit more general this, but help me understand the best way to namespace some code:
 I work for the National Solar Observatory. We are NSF funded, and my team processes data from the DKIST solar telescope. I&#x27;m excited to build tools for this in Haskell.
 FITS is the digital format used for telescope images. I&#x27;ve been contributing to the fits-parse package, which uses Data.Fits as a namespace, but my needs are growing beyond the scope of that package. I need to add support for the ASDF file format (containing metadata for many FITS images) and for the World Coordinate System (WCS), among other things.
 So I&#x27;d like to make a new package containing all the tools one might need to work with astronomical images from modern telescopes/observatories. How should it be namespaced?
 There&#x27;s an existing package that uses the Data.Astro namespace: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/astro. The fits-parse package uses Data.Fits
 Let&#x27;s assume that I create a single package for this, and name it telescope. Should the code be namespaced under Data or not? If yes, should I use a different namespace than the Data.Astro that the astro package uses?
 Option 1: Pick my own Top-level Namespace
 import Telescope.Fits import Telescope.Asdf import Telescope.Wcs 
 Option 2: Add packages to existing namespaces like &#x60;Data.Astro&#x60;, which is used by the &#x60;astro&#x60; package
 Note that the &#x60;astro&#x60; package deals with calculating the position of celestial bodies, which is every bit as as valid a use of the word astronomy, but has a very different focus from my work to process astronomical observations.
 -- from this package! import Data.Astro.Fits import Data.Astro.Wcs -- from &#x60;astro&#x60; package import Data.Astro.Sun 
 Option 3: Pick a new namespace under &#x60;Data&#x60; to differentiate from the other packages
 import Data.Telescope.Fits import Data.Telescope.Wcs 
 What&#x27;s the right approach here?

                              <span>After 1 year of studying haskell, I decided to write small library which parses command line args.
 And since I haven&#x27;t had much experience in haskell, I would ask your help.
 I would ask you all to see the code and mention what I can improve, maybe there is somewhere memory leaks or performance issues, or maybe you have some your own best practices of how to orgranise the code and so on and so forth.
 I haven&#x27;t made tests and benchmarks, yet.
 I haven&#x27;t move String to Text yet.
 Also, I left the example in the example folder and also I left comments in the code so you might understand what is going on there
 So, I please you very hard, look on the code and make your suggestions/advices. And, please, look on example folder, I made question there about existential type
 And sorry for english here and in the comments in the repo, English is not my native
 thank you

                              <span>Now I&#x27;m writing a small application which manages some files in linux for my hobby.
 So I have tried to implement an abstraction of IO Monad to test as my file managing functions like below.
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;hs
 imporrt qualified System.Directory as D
 class (Monad m) &#x3D;&gt; FileManagerMonad m where
 moveFile :: FilePath -&gt; FilePath -&gt; m () doSomething :: FilePath -&gt; FilePath -&gt; m ()
 data FileObj &#x3D; File | Dict [FileObj]
 data AppPure &#x3D; AppPure
 { appDir :: FileObj
 }
 instance FileManagerMonad (Reader AppPure) where
 moveFile src dest &#x3D; do
 // do logical file moving onto appDir as same as &#x60;D.renameFile&#x60; of directory package. 
 doSomething src dest &#x3D; do moveFile src dest // do something.
 instance FileManagedMonad IO where
 moveFile &#x3D; D.renameFile doSomething src dest &#x3D; do moveFile src dest // do something as same as for AppPure. &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 After I wrote that, I have wondered that this implementation is meaningless at all because my FileManagerMoand implementation for AppPure is enable to be misimplemented and I don&#x27;t want to test removeFile directly. I&#x27;m satisfied to D.renameFile function in actual usage.
 But I am not good at Haskell programming, I want to know that I should create an IO monad abstraction for just imitation like a unnecessary mocking in testing context.
 Though I think that should write or not is depended on contexts absolutely, I have no idea how to decide it.
 Sorry for my stupid noobie (poor English) question. If I was gave some comments, so pleasure. Thanks.

                              <span>Hello everyone! Recently, i&#x27;ve started to program using the new C standard and i&#x27;ve been having some issues because my lsp server ( clangd 16.0.6 ) does not recognize some stuff from it ( nullptr for example ). Anyone had similar problems / knows any fix? 
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Hello I&#x27;m a really new user to emacs, literally just downloaded lol and don&#x27;t really have any experience with coding or programming. Is there a way to make setting up the app easier or any tips people could give me? 
 I was also wondering how the notes are organised, are they organised by different pages like something in obsidian or is it more of an atomic way like logseq? 
 Linked to the idea of organisation can I organise things via tags and links and stuff instead of folders because of ease of use and things like that because in obsidian my workflow was based around tags instead of looking through specific folders to find my information.
 I&#x27;m also just looking for a brief rundown of how you would organise the notes in emacs on a very basic level

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I am happy to announce a new release of these packages for FPGA/ASIC development. I believe there are great improvements and new features such as:
  
LSP autoconfiguration for &#x60;lsp-bridge&#x60; and &#x60;lspce&#x60; clients
 
Builtin xref backend for navigation of definitions/references 
 
Incremental tag collection and caching for autocompletion and navigation
 
Integration of tree-sitter on all existing features for improved performance
 
Better project management
 
All functionality tested on Emacs 29.1, 29.2 and 29.3
 
Updated GitHub Wiki pages for each feature
 
Fixed many bugs

                              <span>The immanent release of Ubuntu 24.04 is in a poor state at the moment, presumably because of the xz vulnerability, but emacs-gtk 29.3 became installable today for the first time.
 I&#x27;m so used to Debian &amp; Ubuntu shipping with an old emacs, this makes me very happy.

                              <span>New to emacs, not sure if this is a bug with the windows version or I&#x27;m missing something. Using version 29.3
 Very simple init.el:
 (add-to-list &#x27;load-path &quot;path/to/evil&quot;) (require &#x27;evil) (evil-mode 1) 
 But it still isn&#x27;t enabled on startup. I can enable it manually, but interestingly, I have to enter the command twice. If I remove (evil-mode 1), I just have to execute the command once. Other commands in my init.el get executed as expected.
 It works as expected when running emacs through WSL. I&#x27;ve also tried installing with package.el and elpaca but same thing. I was also able to install general.el without issue, and I&#x27;m a solid 4 hours in at this point, so I&#x27;m not sure where else to look. It just seems like (evil-mode 1) in my init.el doesn&#x27;t work for some reason
 Edit: Just added hooks to enable evil-mode to work around this

                              <span>Hello I&#x27;m a really new user to orgmode,literally just downloaded lol and don&#x27;t really have any experience with coding or programming. Is there a way to make setting up the app easier or any tips people could give me? 
 I was also wondering how the notes are organised, are they organised by different pages like something in obsidian or is it more of an atomic way like logseq? 
 Linked to the idea of organisation can I organise things via tags and links and stuff instead of folders because of ease of use and things like that because in obsidian my workflow was based around tags instead of looking through specific folders to find my information.
 I&#x27;m also just looking for a brief rundown of how you would organise the notes in orgmode on a very basic level.
 This is a copy paste from the emacs subreddit as I feel like it would better fit here.

                              <span>Bit of a specific issue: I&#x27;m using ox-hugo to export org-mode blogs to a hugo website. The website uses the Archie theme. The bibliography formatting turns out weird, specifically the numbering:
 Example of bibliography and badly formatted numbering
 What I would hope to get is something like:
 [1] Reference 1 [2] Reference 2 
 I have the following in the org file header:
 #+cite_export: basic numeric numeric #+bibliography: ~/OrgFiles/OrgRoam/biblio.bib 
 and use the following for a citation:
 [cite:@reference] 
 I export using &quot;Export to Hugo-compatible Markdown :: Subtree to Md file&quot;.
 A &quot;(1)&quot; appears in the text ok, although not hyperlinked to the actual reference in the bibliography section, but not as bothered about that.
 How do I fix the formatting of the bibliography numbering?

                              <span>I used to have a job where I had been hired as a Scala dev. Then I got roped into doing database stuff and haven&#x27;t touched any Scala code for real in years. Last time I did any production coding was before they announced that Akka was moving away from open source, and Zio was still pretty new. Consequently, I&#x27;ve also fallen off on staying up to date on the happenings in the Scala community.
 So what&#x27;s the new hotness I should be on top of if I&#x27;m going to advertise myself as a Scala dev again? Any big new developments I&#x27;ve missed? What should I study up on to ensure I speak the correct language at an interview?

                              <span>I mostly use Scala with WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux), currently at v2. Few years back, I wrote an utility for backing up and moving my WSL distro between computers. I recently cleaned it up - check out if this can be of any use! The code used Li&#x27;s excellent ammonite CLI and a Scala script, nothing too fancy!

 Anyone encountered this before/is this a known issue?

 Can anybody tell if one form of writting leads to less performant code than another (and/or other issues)?

                              <span>Hey! Could you please help me pick a topic for undergrad research related to Haskell?
 I have zero experience with research and little experience with Haskell, but I loved what I&#x27;ve seen of the language so far, and was told that undergrad research would be a great way to learn about it. Do you have any suggestions for topics that are reasonable to research in one year? (Don&#x27;t know how it works elsewhere, but where I study, that&#x27;s how long an undergrad research project typically lasts)
 I was thinking of doing research related to DataSci (I&#x27;m open to suggestions in other fields), maybe implementing some aspects of the Pandas library in Haskell. Is this a decent idea? Do you know of any features that would be interesting?
 Also, I have a (demanding) full time job as a software developer, so ideally the project shouldn&#x27;t be super difficult.
 Any help will be so very much appreciated. Thanks!

                              <span>Hello,
 On Win11 I use the light theme but I prefer to have my Emacs use a dark theme which results in an Emacs frame with a dark buffer and a light themed title and scroll bar.
 Is there a way to force Emacs to use the dark system theme for it&#x27;s title and scroll bar?

                              <span>There is a zsh plugin called &quot;powerlevel10k&quot; that has a feature called &quot;transient prompts&quot; that when enabled replaces the previous prompt with a simpler one to allow more screen real estate. 
 I currently use both eshell and zsh inside the eat Emacs terminal emulator and have my zsh configured so my prompt displays my current directory but only for the current prompt and not previous ones.
 is there a way to configure eshell or eat to make eshell behave like zsh does with transient prompts? 
 Thanks.

                              <span>After a lot of tweaking I am finally using as a emacs daemon on my mac. I have one outstanding issue. When I launch multiple frames, they are all represented under one dock and cmd-tab entry. So when I cmd-tab I’d like to have a separate entry for each frame (as though they were all distinct processes. 
 Anyone know if this is possible?

 Generate Commit Messages within magit-status Buffer
 Yep, you guessed it, another one calling the GPT API(gptel). The prompt modified from gptcommit, I&#x27;ve simplified it, trimming down API calls at the cost of accuracy. This package is more for fun than productive. There was a similar package before: Introducing GPT-Commit: An Emacs Package for AI-Generated Commit Messages, but the community feedback wasn&#x27;t very positive. Hence, I&#x27;ve been a bit hesitant to put it out there until recently when I finally uploaded it to MELPA. Anyway, I&#x27;ll still share it and any feedback are welcome.

 I like to slowly go back to the emacs keybinding and get reacquainted to it since i find devil-mode fascinating, 
 What strategy would you suggest to make devil-mode automatically enabled when using evil-mode?
 I already have :
 (setq evil-disable-insert-state-bindings t)
 what else would i need to start automatically devil-mode while in insert mode
 thanks for reading

                              <span>I recently migrated from VSCode to Doom Emacs, loving it so far. Though the learning curve seems steep, and I have lots of questions. Since I work with C/C++ most of the time, spent the Saturday goofind with Emacs GDB &amp; make. And I encountered the problem with M-x +evil:make (pic 1). It seems like the function&#x27;s supposed to create an interactive &quot;sh&quot; so that I can input the argument (pic 2), but it doesn&#x27;t (pic 4). Also attached an image showing edebug (pic 3) but I barely understand this tool.

 My questions:
 - Have anyone encountered my problem? Tried a couple other +evil: functions, they don&#x27;t create any interactive environment either
 - What is the &quot;proper&quot; way to close the comint terminal? C-x k seems tedious, if I can navigate and &quot;q&quot; it somehow would be nice. 
 Thanks.

                              <span>Hi,
 Do any of you have a working config for dape which attaches to a remote dlv-dap adapter. In my case, goland binary runs in a pod. I have a ssh tunnel to it. And I attach to localhost on the ssh tunnel port. I do see in the cmdline &quot;Handling connection for&quot; print by the ssh tunnel. But dape doest connect to dlv on the binary. Goland easily does this though.
 If you have a working config for remote attach to dlv-dap, please do share.

                              <span>I made a post yesterday about Scala.js.
 I spent two days to experiment with Scala.js and the three.js library for developing small 3D Games.
 I have used ScalablyTyped for generating the facades.
 I&#x27;m confident to say I&#x27;m a total beginner in three.js and scala.js. 
 I came to the conclusion that Scala.js can be awesome but I feel it is too much troubles since the facades generated by ScalablyTyped have some kind of issues and making the facades by myself for a 3D library isn&#x27;t a trivial task.
 At least it isn&#x27;t for me :)
 Not knowing well three.js sure isn&#x27;t helping.
 I probably gonna stick to TypeScript for this use case.
 If I really wanna use Scala, better use a framework like Libgdx (Java) anyway.
 I do feel like Scala.js is really good but it makes more sense when working with scala.js libraries like Laminar.
 Using it to use a heavy javascript library perhaps make less sense. Especially for a simple video game. 
 Anybody have used three.js with Scala.js?
 Any thoughts overall?

                              <span>I seem to recall a few years ago reading that there was a connection, and iirc the connection went something like:
  
Functors can represent up to Finite State Machines
 Applicatives can represent up to, I dunno, Push Down Automatas somehow?
 Monads can represent up to Turing Machines
 Selectives are somewhere in between Applicative and Monad. 
  
I mean, definitely in between Applicative and Monad in computation ability, but also nested on the Chomsky Hierarchy somewhere. Are they akin to Push Down Automatas?
 Am I just hallucinating the connection? (Also, if you have a favorite Selective resource, please send it my way! :) )

                              <span>How do production Haskell folks approach i18n and l10n in their projects? Mainstream tech stacks have generous support from services like Transifex and Lokalise, JS folks benefit from native support of Project Fluent, and what about Haskell? Do you simply use gettext? Are there gettext extractors for _() literal patterns from source files? What extra tooling are you excited to use for the problem of i18n and l10n?

                              <span>I am reading Thinking with Types: Type-Level Programming in Haskell book currently. In Chapter 2, Section 2.2 Data Kinds, I am finding the highlighted part, in the screenshot attached below, very confusing; it says &quot;we can change our User type...&quot; what does this mean?
 https://preview.redd.it/lemuzpikwtsc1.png?width&#x3D;774&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;f4cf318243853d7217c99f49856a86313b259ae9
 I tried this out in ghci (please refer to the screenshot attached below). But as expected, this causes an error. User is already defined as a data constructor for the UserType type, so creating another type by the same name gives an error. So, what does that line exactly mean? That
  
we can change our User type...
  
Kindly help me understand this. I am still new to this, so it is possible that I am unable to put together some related concepts that I have covered but might not have understood as well as I think I have. Thanks in advance.

                              <span>In order to get control of boxes around code in PDF exports, I&#x27;ve been placing code blocks in mdframed pairs, like this:
 #+begin_mdframed #+begin_src emacs-lisp ;; lisp goes in here #+end_src #+end_mdframed 
 However, I&#x27;ve noticed that it stops the code being treated as code from the point of view of formatting in emacs -- coloring, indentation, and so on.
 Is there a way around that?

 I am trying to set up functions to differentiate the visual styles of programming modes, text modes (specifically org mode, but also others), and the dashboard. The hooks, however, seem to only trigger when I manually set the mode of the buffer (e.g. when I run M-x emacs-lisp-mode in init.el), and not automatically when I open a file with a given major mode. Is there a better way to write these hooks? As well, the line numbers don&#x27;t always seem to disappear properly in text modes, am I incorrectly using (display-line-numbers-mode -1)?

                              <span>This function is called when you have pixel-scroll-precision-mode activated with the pixel-scroll-precision-interpolate-mice option enabled and scroll with the mouse wheel. The problem I&#x27;m having is that a single slight movement of the mouse wheel results in a substantial amount of scrolling.
 It is adequate if the windows takes the whole screen, but if you have some tinier ones, it&#x27;s too much, and you&#x27;re missing content. Is there a way to make it take into account the window size? (I&#x27;m talking about emacs&#x27;s windows here).
 For instance, I did something similar for the M-v and C-v keybinds, since I felt like scrolling the entire window was too much, so I just wanted half the window:
 (defun pixel-scroll-interpolate-half-down () (interactive) (pixel-scroll-precision-interpolate (/ (- (window-text-height nil t)) 2) nil 1)) (defun pixel-scroll-interpolate-half-up () (interactive) (pixel-scroll-precision-interpolate (/ (window-text-height nil t) 2) nil 1)) 
 Making the scroll wheel go past, I don&#x27;t know, maybe a fifth of the window would be cool.

                              <span>Hello, i&#x27;m new to Emacs and I set it up on my arch system as a systemd unit and I try to open a client with 
 emacsclient -c 
 (which I thought should open in a gui client window) but it does the exact same thing as
 emacsclient -t 
 (opens in current terminal in urxvt) 
 all things considered its fine and it works pretty well in a terminal but I don&#x27;t understand what is going on - it was working previously but I&#x27;m not finding any error messages or anything of the sort anywhere 
 Running I3 if that matters .. Thanks !

                              <span>Can I expect Emacs to be as good as e.g. VS code in providing completion suggestions for my python, scala, whatever code? I have spent quite a lot of time trying to figure out how to set up eglot, corfu, cape etc. on my python project but the results are &quot;meh&quot;. I get generic suggestions, it is not really able to pick up internals of classes (suggest methods etc. after I type object_name dot...) or even other imported modules and in general it is nowhere nearly as usable as VS code (which I am not a fan of). So, either my expectations are too high or I am doing something wrong!
 Can anyone post or point me to the simplest code completion initl.el setup in Emacs that I can use? I don&#x27;t have the time to spend weeks trying to debug this stuff, unfortunately. Sometimes and just sometimes, I would like things to work out of the box without having to become an expert in every package that is out there. Apologies if this sounds like I am lazy, I am not but deadlines, work, life... 
 Thanks!

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to set up emacs for editing astrojs.
 To prevent my config getting too complicated, I&#x27;m trying to set up seperate configs. I want to use chemacs2 to switch between profiles.
 https://github.com/plexus/chemacs2
 My .emacs-profiles.el looks like this:
 ((&quot;default&quot; . ((user-emacs-directory . &quot;~/.emacs.d-default&quot;)))
 (&quot;astro&quot; ((user-emacs-directory . &quot;~/.emacs.d-astro&quot;)))
 )
 If I just start emacs by typing in &#x27;emacs&#x27; at terminal, my default profile loads. As I believe it should.
 I think I should be able to load my astro profile by typing &#x27;emacs --with-profile astro&#x27;.
 However, this loads emacs with no init. The init in my astro profile does not load.
 How can I get the astro profile to load?

                              <span>I am experiencing a total slowdown in a fresh emacs instance, started with &#x60;-Q&#x60; (which as I understand starts without &#x60;.emacs&#x60; init so as to produce an unbiased measurement). The file is around 1800 lines of a list of non-enclosed braced sublist in a C header file, i.e. a syntactically incorrect file of:
 ​
 { one, two, three, four },
 { five, six, seven, eight },
 ...1800 more lines...
 As soon as I put the braces around the whole list, i.e. one opening &#x60;{&#x60; in line 1 and one closing &#x60;}&#x60; in line 1800, the slowdown is reduced (but still a bit noticeable). The performance monitor (mem) shows that it is indeed the handling of a braced list:
 877,399,714 70% - redisplay_internal (C function)
 877,226,114 70% - jit-lock-function
 877,226,114 70% - jit-lock-fontify-now
 877,221,930 70% - jit-lock--run-functions
 877,221,930 70% - #
 877,221,930 70% - font-lock-fontify-region
 877,221,930 70% - c-font-lock-fontify-region
 876,951,138 70% - font-lock-default-fontify-region
 876,876,741 70% - font-lock-fontify-keywords-region
 876,465,670 70% - c-font-lock-declarations
 875,641,854 70% - c-find-decl-spots
 873,729,173 70% - #
 861,984,604 69% - c-get-fontification-context
 859,903,452 69% - c-inside-bracelist-p
 858,589,113 69% + c-looking-at-or-maybe-in-bracelist
 1,165,232 0% + c-backward-over-enum-header
 365,361,651 29% + command-execute
 287,920 0% + timer-event-handler
 56 0% mouse--click-1-maybe-follows-link
 48 0% + tooltip-show-help
 0 0% ...
 Are we stuck with this kind of performance degradation in braced or somehow else bracketed lists? 1800 lines is not small but it also isn&#x27;t really big.
 I know that the syntax is illegal but honestly I don&#x27;t think that the editor should make this a problem for the user.

 Again, basic information for newbies like me.
 As with the previous post, I have tried getting my hands dirty with a bit of Lisp, in the attempt to feel the vertigo of dipping into the depths of Emacs&#x27; internals. I enjoyed studying these topics a lot and felt that sharing was due.

                              <span>I am working on some changes to the GHC. Currently my changes are enabled via a compiler flag. I want to test this against the entire compiler test suite; however, I an unfamiliar with how Hadrian really works.
 Is it possible for me to pass in a set of compiler flags when I execute hadrian/build test so that every test program is compiled using that flag? 
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>For example if I&#x27;m using typescript and I have the following data:
 const orbitRatios &#x3D; { mercury: 0.2408467, venus: 0.61519726, ... neptune: 164.79132, }; 
 I can easily create a type that contains all the keys of orbitRatios
 type Planet &#x3D; keyof typeof orbitRatios; 
 instead of manually doing something like
 type Planet &#x3D; &quot;mercury&quot; | &quot;earth&quot; | ... 
 and if orbitRatios get updated or extended I don&#x27;t have to manually update the type.
 I wonder What is the mentality to approach the same problem using haskell.
 What I did is
 orbitRatios :: [(String, Double)] orbitRatios &#x3D; [ (&quot;mercury&quot;, 0.2408467), (&quot;venus&quot;, 0.61519726), ... (&quot;neptune&quot;, 164.79132) ] test :: String -&gt; Double -&gt; Double test planetName elapsedTime &#x3D; case mRatio of Nothing -&gt; do something otherwise -&gt; do something where mRatio &#x3D; lookup planetName orbitRatios 
 the function accepts wherever string and I have to check against a list of tuples if the given key does exist.
 is this the appropriate way?

                              <span>Why can&#x27;t just make GHC implicitly replace data with newtype implementation (where applicable) and only use data keyword?
 The linter always keep suggesting me to use newtype for every convertible data in my code.

 Out of curiousity, do you use ScalablyTyped or similar plugins to get your facades or you write your own?
 I wanted to experiment with the three.js library with Scala.js.
 I was not sure if I should use ScalablyTyped.
 Any thoughts?
 Note: Given that I&#x27;m trying to develop a little game with three.js with ton of mutations, perhaps Scala.js doesn&#x27;t make sense lol

 What are your thoughts about Scala.js in 2024?
 Aside from our love for Scala, does it make sense over TypeScript? 
 I&#x27;d love to read any practical examples.
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hey, fairly new to programming and in my first semester.
 We use Scala and the university recommended using Linux Fedora as our OS. I always had some troubles with Scala but now we approach the exam and now my Scala doesn&#x27;t work anymore.
 First I had a problem with Java Home, which seems to be fixed, but now the next one is even more significant.
 I cant even run the scalac command in cmd and anytime a function is mentioned in code when I paste it, it spews out the same old Error 6.
 Yes, I have tried running code I know works and the error persists.
 ​
 At this point I&#x27;m just clueless and if I can&#x27;t fix this i will just return to Windows

                              <span>I have been annoyed with having three different sets of copy/paste shortcuts: ctrl-c/ctrl-v for most apps including browsers, shift-ctrl-c/shift-ctrl-v for the terminal, and y and p in emacs evil mode.
 But (at least on linux) shift-insert and ctrl-insert work as copy/paste everywhere, including the terminal and emacs!
 Of course, the insert key is not near the home row on most keyboards, but I set up my qmk firmware to move it close. Your operating system probably has some way to remap something handy like super-c/super-v to shift-insert/ctrl-insert.

                              <span>Friends, this has been haunting me for months...
 When navigating through GNU license, I notice that they share the license file in many format, yet not org-mode. src: https://www.gnu.org/licenses/licenses.html#GPL
 On Emacs source repo, all text files aren&#x27;t in &#x60;.org&#x60; (like README, CHANGELOG, NEWS, etc.)
 Also when looking at documentation site, there is always either a pdf or html version, but not org-mode. (this one, I can find some logic of why not at least)
 Is there any reason for this?

                              <span>My emacs initialization on my Debian 12 computer is kept in my home directory in .emacs.d/ Inside I have an init.el with this at the bottom
 (when (file-readable-p &quot;~/.emacs.d/config.org&quot;) (org-babel-load-file (expand-file-name &quot;~/.emacs.d/config.org&quot;))) (setq my-custom-file &quot;~/.emacs.d/my-custom.el&quot;) (load my-custom-file) 
 which calls and sets up everything in the config.org, then loads the my-custom.el file. The my-custom.el has my very large custom-set-variables list. This works -- sort of. My problem is whenever I use the interactive Emacs customize system it updates any committed customization of variables in a new custom-set-variables list which it tacks onto the end of my init.el file. IOW, it doesn&#x27;t know I want it stored in my-custom.el And so now I have a new version and an out-of-date version of custom-set-variables in my-custom.el. Also the custom-set-faces list gets tacked onto the end of init.el whenever I change that. Is there any way to have Emacs understand that I want at least custom-set-variables accessed, changed only from the my-custom.el?

                              <span>i have been working on this package https://github.com/mahmoodsheikh36/blk
 it started as a small collection of utilities and then i decided to package it, it helps the user create links between different blocks of text in (possibly) different files, similar to org-roam but not restricted to org headings/files, the patterns that can be linked to are defined using regex, and grep (or another tool, e.g. ripgrep or emacs itself) can be used behind the scenes to find the links when blk-open-at-point is invoked, this is the baseline functionality but much more is possible, including navigating to functions in source code by their names (e.g. your init.el) and inserting links from your elisp files to your org files and vice versa (inserting a link to an elisp function in an org file, without having to worry about the filenames, only about the function&#x27;s name as that is how its found when using blk-open-at-point).
 i would be happy to answer any questions, please note that this is still very much a work in progress but i feel it is perhaps time i received some feedback. so any criticism/suggestions are welcome. thank you!

                              <span>I use parcellite as a clipboard manager, and rofi as an application launcher. Is there a way to use Emacs to replace these applications?

                              <span>For R users creating shiny apps with Emacs, I am working on a new package to run shiny apps asynchronously. It runs completely independent of ESS in order to allow using the full power of ESS while running the app almost live during development.
 The package is in its infantry but it is doing its job well. I would really appreciate to receive feedback from some users to help it mature. Please, feel welcome to open issues with bugs, ideas, features requests or simply comments and opinions.

                              <span>Hi there, I was wondering if it is possible to make ediff not rely on any external frame and just use custom keys in buffer? I use evil so evil-collection sets up ediff with the expected keys but still that little frame gets in the way of things.

However, I cannot construct a feedback mechanism that will help me to correct things other than sending my zettels to another person.
Any thoughts on how to improve thinking skills or build a feedback loop by myself?</span>

                              <span>Hey folks,
 I wonder if anyone here uses beorg on iOS for their org agenda?
 I subscribe to the &quot;many tiny org files&quot; method, and it works totally fine on the desktop (especially with org-roam).
 With beorg, I have significant sync slow downs. To the tune of 10 seconds. That makes it practically unusable. 
 I experimented with only including org files that have * TODOs in the them and that made a huge difference -- from ~10 seconds to sub second. It makes sense since I have a few thousand org files, but only a handful of them have TODOs.
 In any case, does anyone have any advice on how to expose only a subset of org files to beorg while maintaining a master copy on my desktop?

Alias the current module with Imp by Taylor Fausak
Sometimes when writing a Haskell module you want to use an identifier that would be ambiguous. For example perhaps you’re writing a logger and want to call a function log. That’s a problem because the Prelude also defines a function called log. You can’t use either one without disambiguating. Usually you will disambiguate by qualifying the identifier like MyLogger.log. This is fine but it is a little annoying because it duplicates the name of the module. If you later refactor this module by changing its name, you’ll also have to update a…</span>
