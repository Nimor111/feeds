                              <span>I have been using emacs for several months at this point. A few months into it, people started talking about using straight.el instead of package.el, so I moved my configuration over to using straight.el. However, now people are saying package.el is the best option and that people should not really use straight.el anymore. I have had good experience with straight.el since some packages I like are not on melpa. Additionally, I have tried downloading and using emacs-29, and it seems to run into issues when using straight which makes me lean more towards using package.el unless there is some way to fix this. Which package manager should I use, and why (I have also heard about elpaca which seems to have nice UI and fixes some issues that straight has, so what about that versus straight and use-package)?

 last year at the same period I wrote some articles about Emacs Lisp and org-mode on this subreddit that I just turned into a website:

 I hope this is useful.
 Have a nice day

                              <span>I was trying to make a backend to xref that depends on external programs and realized there seems to be no way to not block while waiting for a response. I was wondering if there is an alternative framework to xref that wouldn&#x27;t block. Ideally, I am looking for something that would take care of timeouts and would abort calls to async-xref if I make a new one. 
 Or maybe there is a better approach to the problem I have that I haven&#x27;t imagined?

                              <span>I use eglot and gopls and things generally just work, except eldoc. It always gives me an empty eldoc window and it sure would nice to see the docs for the thing at point. 
 Does this need additional configuration? I can&#x27;t really find any docs on it either:(

                              <span>I find myself often re-arranging windows especially because I use projectile compilation or deadgrep etc, which pop up additional windows, or replace the one I&#x27;m currently working in.
 I used to use CEDET 15 years ago, and I liked the way it kept the layout fixed, with a lower buffer (similar as to VSCode does it) &quot;capturing&quot; all what could be considered process-output. And then up on top I&#x27;m free to do whatever.
 Is there something comparable? I&#x27;m wary getting CEDET itself into my life, as all its tools seem to be pretty dated.

 But since switching from Emacs27 to Emacs29 it doesn&#x27;t work anymore. The message is:

 Any idea how to solve this?

                              <span>On April 20th at 19.30 UTC, I&#x27;ll be speaking with Simon Peyton Jones, one of the team behind Haskell, on a YouTube livestream. 
 Simon is renowned for his work in lazy functional languages, and I&#x27;ll be exploring his career of building languages, especially Haskell, but also C-- and most recently Verse. We&#x27;ll dig into his work at both Microsoft Research and Epic Games, and exploring the lessons we can take from a monumental career. At the end we&#x27;ll put your questions to him in an AMA.
 Everyone is welcome to come and join in and ask questions. You can set a reminder on YouTube.
 The interview is part of Exercism&#x27;s #12in23 - a year long challenge to encourage people to try 12 new languages throughout the year. So far, I&#x27;ve interviewed José Valim (Elixir), Louis Pilfold (Gleam), Cameron Balahan (Go), Josh Tripplet (Rust), and  Bjarne Stroustrup (C++) - they&#x27;re all available to watch back on YouTube!

                              <span>As a short &quot;introduction,&quot; I am a 16 year old student from Canada. I&#x27;ve been programming since I was 12, although it wasn&#x27;t much until I was 14. I picked up python initially so I could &quot;show off&quot; to one of my friends, but I ended up getting hooked on writing C until about halfway through last year, in which I started learning Haskell. I&#x27;m firmly convinced that I won&#x27;t leave Haskell anytime soon, as everything just feels superior to how I was doing stuff before, even if it was harder initially (and still, to a certain extent.) I want to eventually work in I.T, but I&#x27;m unsure of the availability of Haskell developer entry positions for once I could actually fathom getting a job working as a developer. I know I&#x27;m young and not locked into using any 1 language / stack, but I&#x27;m still kind of just wondering what I should consider doing for the future? Thanks!

                              <span>I am practicing &quot;intermittent fasting&quot;, and record it as:
 | Date | Start | End | Format | Difference | |----------+-------+-------+--------+------------| | 20230412 | 20:05 | 12:30 | 24:00 | 16:25 | #+TBLFM: $5&#x3D;$4-$2+$3;U 
 My fasting started from 20:05 last night and expects to end on 12:30 today. I firstly tried to calculate the interval by formula &quot;$5&#x3D;24-$2+$3;U&quot;,but it compute a wrong result. So a new column Format 24 hours should be added.
 How could get it done without a cumbersome new column of 24 hours.

                              <span>We all like editing to be fast and transparent. But what are some things that make Emacs slow? Either long start-up, sluggish edits, GC freezes, etc. Things that may be cool, but are rendered impractical by execution time.
 Also if you found a way to speed the thing up, or a faster alternative, would love to hear it.
 (please be kind to the authors/maintainers of slow code as per Rule 2.)

 ;;; foo.el --- Example minor mode ;; Mode developer code.

(setq inhibit-startup-screen t) (setq hello-key (kbd &quot;C-c C-j&quot;)) (global-foo-mode 1) 
 I have split the code above into 2 parts. The first part contains the code for the minor mode. The bottom three lines show how the user may use the mode.
 The user wants to set the hello-key to (kbd &quot;C-c C-j&quot;) before enabling the mode. But the minor mode ignores this new value of hello-key because it has already used the old value (kbd &quot;C-c C-f&quot;) while defining the keymap for the minor mode.
 Is it possible to create a minor mode in a way that every time the user enables the minor mode, the minor mode re-evaluates its keymap?

                              <span>I want to use a variant of the EXWM function ((exwm-workspace-move-window (frame-or-index &amp;optional id)) to move an EXWM to another workspace/frame.
 Normally this is accomplished with the C-c RET key combination, but in this case the window in question is an EXWM window running under Xpra so it traps the key combination and handles it itself.
 The way around it is to get the window title of the Xpra window from Emacs/EXWM, derive the window-id from it or find it some other way then pass it to the ((exwm-workspace-move-window (frame-or-index &amp;optional0 id)).
 So begins my excursion into finding Emacs window ids, the X window values and those of frames as well.
 Where do I start?

                              <span>As the pretest version has been released, I cloned and built Emacs 29 on OpenSUSE TW. I used the following options:
 --with-native-compilation&#x3D;aot --with-x-toolkit&#x3D;gtk3 --without-xaw3d --with-xinput2 --with-tree-sitter --with-json --without-compress-install CFLAGS&#x3D;&#x27;-march&#x3D;native&#x27; 
 I faced an issue, so I searched and found the following comments on Arch AUR:
  
Native JSON support was removed from emacs sometime in the first semester of 2022. In my tests leaving JSON support out had some breaking bugs that made it a non-starter. I have to test it again before adding such switch to t build script.
  
I checked the official Arch package recipe and found that they do not use the --with-json option. The same is with OpenSUSE official package. However, Fedora package does use that option for their building. &#x27;
 Anyway, I found a tip that running make bootstrap could solve the issue, and it works. Emacs 29 got compiled successfully, and it now runs flawlessly on my machine since morning. Actually, I&#x27;m not sure what the issue was and if it was caused by --with-json option, but I wanted to raise a discussion about whether using this option is not recommended anymore by default.

                              <span>Does someone know how does the css-ls validate the css file? Emacs doesn&#x27;t show any errors for my css file, but when I ran it through the w3 css validator I got an error.
 There is a variable lsp-css-validate which is set to t in emacs. So I assume it does some validation https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/page/lsp-css/#lsp-css-validate
 But maybe the LSP validation is not as strict as the W3 css validator? https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator.html.en
 Scenario where I ran into this was that I had written &quot;scale (1)&quot; instead of the correct &quot;scale(1)&quot;. Spent quite a bit of time to hunt this down manually.
 In hindsight I would&#x27;ve spotted the error immediately if I had put the css file through the W3 CSS validator. Maybe next time I&#x27;ll remember this.

                              <span>Many fonts now support this readability enhancement: to display zero with slashes. This is not a different character (such as a slashed o character: „ Ø ”), but a variation of how zeros are displayed. 
 (This can also be enabled in web browsers with JavaScript script extensions such as Stylus, Stylebot etc.). 
 I understand that some people may be not welcoming change (including this one), but this is important for many things, including programming. I kept trying to make chat-gpt understand what code I&#x27;m asking for but it never provides any useful answer, as my current font in Emacs already supports this feature, it is just Emacs which does not make the font display this useful differentiation (variation). 
 Please don&#x27;t be harsh, for now I&#x27;d like to just improve some annoying things in the meanwhile of beginning to learn some more Emacs topics. Regards :).

 fatal: Could not read from remote repository. 
 Please make sure you have the correct access rights 
 and the repository exists.
  
which I believe is standard practice though?
 But in Emacs, using Magit, I&#x27;m not sure how to perform this operation? Simply opening a sell (M-x shell) and running that doesn&#x27;t do it.

                              <span>I have an application where, in my domain types, I have an Event which has many Tags and belongs to a single Venue:
  data Event &#x3D; Event { -- more than this but tags :: [EventTag], venue :: Venue, } newtype EventTag &#x3D; EventTag { tagName :: Text } newtype Venue &#x3D; Venue { venueName :: Text } 
 In the database schema, however, I have tables for tags and venues, and a foreign key relation to the events table.
 I had been using hasql for my database interactions, but found it extremely painful, so I switched to persistent, for which I defined the following schema:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; TagRow sql&#x3D;tags name Text UniqueTagName name
 VenueRow sql&#x3D;venues name Text UniqueVenueName name
 EventRow sql&#x3D;events title Text description (Maybe Text) url URL venueId VenueRowId startDate UTCTime endDate UTCTime origination OriginationURI UniqueOriginationURI origination approvedAt UTCTime rejectedAt UTCTime
 EventTag sql&#x3D;event_tags eventId EventRowId tagId TagRowId |] &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 What I&#x27;m not sure how to do, is how to insert non-existent tags and venues, and then insert the events, using persistent, in a relatively efficient way. I had done this previously using hasql as can be seen here, which is quite ugly but did the trick.
 I can think of three approaches with persistent, one is to do something analogous to what I&#x27;m doing above: write the tags, collecting the ids and names in a mapping, do the same with the venues, then stitch all this together when inserting the events. This one I do not know how to do with persistent. The other would be to process the events one at a time, inserting the tags, then fetching them again, doing the same with the venue, and then inserting the event. This one I think I know how to do with persistent. The final one would be to write it all as raw sql and process it that way, which I&#x27;m really not fond of as an idea (and haven&#x27;t looked into).
 Any pointers / help would be much appreciated.

 Pawel Szulc once again made a nice talk on using an effect system and it gave me a refresher and some other good information: Effectful | Paweł Szulc | Lambda Days 2022 .
 It&#x27;s perfectly possible to just implement only the IO interpreter and test that while developing with effectful, and for a while I did just that.

Title should read org-bullets, not bullet-mode. Thank you /u/github-alphapapa.
  
Problem &amp; background
  
New install of default emacs GUI (27.1) on a new EOS 7 install.
 
H4 level bullets are rendering differently to previous 27.1 GUI, they are too big.
 
Examples: Tidy H4 stars on old GUI. New, large flowers on current GUI.
 
 Information
  
Emacs version 27.1 for both. GTK+ Versions - Old: 3.22.30 New: 3.24.30
 
Same config file
 
Same font: &quot;Roboto Mono:pixelsize&#x3D;13:foundry&#x3D;pyrs:weight&#x3D;normal:slant&#x3D;normal:width&#x3D;normal:scalable&#x3D;true&quot;
 
Stars render in the &#x27;old&#x27; way if emacs is launched in a terminal using &quot;emacs -nw&quot;. 
 
 Desired resolution
  
Get the H4 bullets to render in the same way as the old GUI.
  
If anybody has encountered the following issue, or has ideas for how to fix it, the help would be much appreciated.

Is the only solution to actually create one of those marker files in it&#x27;s directory? Or can I configure Projectile to allow me to run that function on these files?

                              <span>I&#x27;m struggling to figure out why something isn&#x27;t working on my end as it should be. And now I&#x27;m stuck trying to make sense of the definition of TeX-check-engine. 
 From what I can tell, this function will ask to check the engine only if (but not only if, since there&#x27;s a few other conditions I&#x27;m not listing here) the value of TeX-check-engine-list is set to something other than its default value, presumably to the list of engines required by the file being visited. 
 So here is my question: what is supposed to set the value of that variable? Looking at the docstring, I see that it should depend on what engine is required by the &quot;loaded TeX packages&quot;. But I don&#x27;t see what determines what the loaded TeX packages are, nor how that list is supposed to be updated. 
 (I&#x27;m running into difficulties using emacs -Q after reinstalling auctex etc., so I don&#x27;t see how this could be due to something in my config.)
 If anyone has any pointers, even if not a complete solution, I&#x27;d be curious to know what they are.

                              <span>I am using Emacs 28.2. Here is my code:
 ;;; foo.el (define-minor-mode foo-mode &quot;Foo mode&quot; :lighter &quot; Foo&quot; (message &quot;foo-mode %s in buffer %s&quot; foo-mode (buffer-name))) (defun foo-mode-on () (foo-mode 1)) (define-globalized-minor-mode global-foo-mode foo-mode foo-mode-on) 
 This works like I want.
 emacs -q -l foo.el 
 Then I run these things:
 C-x b *scratch* M-x global-foo-mode C-x b foo C-x b bar C-x b baz 
 I find that all buffers foo, bar and baz have Foo mode enabled. But https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Defining-Minor-Modes.html has got this to tell
  
Globally enabling the mode also affects buffers subsequently created by visiting files, and buffers that use a major mode other than Fundamental mode; but it does not detect the creation of a new buffer in Fundamental mode.
  
But in my case, it did work for fundamental mode buffers too. Why did it work when the documentation says it should not have worked? Or the documentation does not say that and I am misunderstanding something?

 Still a work-in-progress, this theme is the result of tweaks over time to the solarized light core. Readability and comfort are the primary goals here.
 Not quite ready for MELPA, but I thought I&#x27;d share here in case anyone is interested or would like to contribute.

 I am trying to correct a problem with a theme I am using. As you can see, the next character in the list of options is practically invisible.
 But I don&#x27;t have any idea where to start looking. I know the file from which the theme is being loaded, and I can modify it. But there are sooo many definitions that I have no idea which one is the one being used.
 What would be the best way to identify the theme class used by this text?
 (by the way, this problem started with my last update to prelude, which I use. I am also using the leuven theme, which I load after prelude).

                              <span>This has been an issue for a while, and I hope someone can tell me what&#x27;s really going on. I use transient-mark-mode and normally it works great. But once in a while it gets &quot;wedged&quot;, where the region doesn&#x27;t deactivate properly after something that should deactivate it. As a concrete example, if I mark a region and hit delete, the region is removed, but not deactivated. So if I move the point, it expands the region again, leaving the mark where it was. And if I just start typing, I only get the last letter, as each letter replaces the previous. The only way I&#x27;ve found to fix this is to exit emacs and restart it.
 Ideally, I&#x27;d like to figure out what setting gets &quot;bumped&quot; that makes this happen, and prevent it. Failing that, a way to correct it short of not using TMM would be nice. In the worst case, knowing what triggers it so I can maybe avoid it would be better than where I am now.

You are trying to run Emacs configured with the &quot;pure-GTK&quot; interface under the X Window System. That configuration is unsupported and will lead to sporadic crashes during transfer of large selection data. It will also lead to various problems with keyboard input.
  
I think this description is clear enough about what the problem is, but how can I fix it? (I still wish to use gtk.)

 It seems that melpa.org is blacklisted:
 https://mxtoolbox.com/SuperTool.aspx?action&#x3D;blacklist%3a178.128.185.1&amp;run&#x3D;toolpage
 As a consequence I cannot access melpa from my university.
 There is this old thread : https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/iyq75u/my_university_blocks_melpaorg/ three years ago.
 Anyone knows why is melpa still blacklisted ?
 Is there a mirror available ?

                              <span>Hi everyone, 
 I&#x27;ve recently updated my emacs to v29 --with-native-comp and I noticed that now when I do C-h f -&gt; consult-grep for example I&#x27;m getting the doc for that function as expected but the link to the source code where the function is defined leads to my packages.el file where I use use-package to install consult. 
 I just checked and I have similar issue with projectile functions too.
 the message says:
 projectile-grep is an autoloaded interactive native-compiled Lisp function in ‘../../packages.el’
 There is no such issue with variables defined by projectile or consult. The issue is there for some packages and for some not. For example orderless functions have no such issue and the doc points to orderless.el as expected. php-mode is fine. Magit has the issue. 
 Have you noticed anything like that in your setup? Is it native-comp related? Is there any way to guide Emacs so it knows where definitions are? It seems like Emacs knows that let&#x27;s say projectile-grep is there, it knows the docstring as well. But for some reason it just points to wrong file. 
 Just for some additional info: - I&#x27;m on MacOS - I use emacs-plus@29 compiled with brew - I use use-package with straight
 Any idea on how to solve it is highly appreciated. Thanks

                              <span>My idea is simple: I want to use emacs as a cross platform window manager: I want to have the same setup for managing windows, regardless of the operating system I am using. One simple idea is to send the windows to emacs and let emacs manage windows, that way I can use the same config everywhere.
 For example, I want emacs to be able to resize photoshop or final cut pro.
 I haven&#x27;t found anything on how to do that on Windows, Mac and ChromeOS.
 Does something already exist to do so?

                              <span>Running emacs v 30 in the GUI on Ubuntu in Windows 11 WSL, text that I kill is transferred to the Windows clipboard and I can paste into Windows apps. But the same isn&#x27;t true for text that I copy. So I have to kill then yank, which is a nuisance. I can rebind M-w but is there a workaround I&#x27;m not aware of? Fixes online seem to be about running X in windows but since killed text is transferred fine I don&#x27;t know why that would be necessary...

                              <span>I recently encountered this error on Ubuntu when trying to execute Jupyter source blocks:
  
start-process: Searching for program: No such file or directory, python
  
I tried adding (setq python-shell-interpreter &quot;/path/to/python3&quot;) to my init.el and setting my environment variables within Emacs and all of the other suggestions I found online, but still kept receiving the error. I even tried creating an alias for python in my .bashrc and calling emacs from the command line. 
 I finally solved the problem by creating a symlink to python: ln -s /usr/bin/python3 /usr/bin/python Hopefully if someone else encounters this issue and searches for a solution, they find this post and it works for them as well.

                              <span>I have a noticeable lag of at least 2 seconds when switching between Emacs frames.
 It only happens in combination of pdf-tools frames. I have the profiler report but I am not sure if it is orderless, vertico or some problem with completion. And the weird thing is that there is no pdf-tools reference at all. 
 Any ideas?
 Side question: Should I just drop pdf-tools from my packages? I have a love hate relationship with it, on one side it is very useful to have all of my pdf files in Emacs, but at the same time scrolling is not smooth and it has a lot of quirks like zoom reset when changing pages or getting stuck on a page. :/

 What packages do the cool kids use theses days?

                              <span>I have a global, dynamic list of common lisp structs, called &#x60;run_stack&#x60;. I would like a nice way of viewing it. To be specific:
 ​
 - I run a command (&#x60;display_run_stack&#x60; or something), and a new window opens with &#x60;run_stack&#x60; displayed in a special readonly buffer. Each entry of &#x60;run_stack&#x60; should be one line.
 - Each element of &#x60;run_stack&#x60; is a struct with a &#x60;uuid&#x60; field. When point is over a given entry, pressing Enter calls a function (&#x60;goto_uuid&#x60;) on that uuid.

 The thing I have in mind is something like Org Agenda. Any advice how to program this? Kind of a noob wrt emacs application programming. Not sure where to even start. Example code from some other project would be great.

                              <span>Hello all! Some time ago I published my very first couple of packages, both of them related to note-taking. Having essentially used them for a rather long time, they have proven to be very useful to me and I wanted to share them with you.
 I did not want to write here when I published them, to try and fix any bugs or problems that would arise by their new bundled form, but they seem to be working properly so... here they are:
  
KLP is a general package, focusing solely on making the consistent naming as easy as possible, with a note_category_title.org, template. This allows for arbitrary categories to be easily defined, built and search through. Some use cases for it would be cheatsheet files, easily accessible notes on cli tools ... generally static notes.
 Org-lectures. Now this one, even though it shares quite a lot of elements with KLP (it was developed almost simultaneously) allows for the easy creation and management of courses and lectures files. By assigning a couple of keybindings and complementing it with a package like CDLatex or Yasnippets, a really fun workflow was created that allows me to take (in real time) lecture notes for my university courses.
  
Feel free to try them!
 P.S. My experience in writing packages is limited, so any feedback would be more than welcome (this is the reason why I decided to post here after all, :P). Literate programming files also exist in their respective repos, allowing for easier understanding of these simple packages.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve had the idea for this post kicking around in my head for a while and decided to write it out. This is written as a sort of guide for someone who recently started learning about functors, and understand how they work in some basic cases like lists and Maybes, but wants to learn a bit more in depth about other kinds of functors. I&#x27;ve put in some more advanced stuff as well which I thought was interesting but that you can safely ignore for now if you&#x27;re actually just learning about functors.
 Most people on this subreddit are probably plenty familiar with functors already, but hopefully this can still help you think about functors or maybe help you help someone who is just learning about functors themself.

                              <span>I have searched online, but this is the best I could come up with, I&#x27;m not sure if it is correct, please correct these definitions.
  
seq :: a → b → b
 Evaluates first argument to weak head normal form (WHNF), when that is completed only then the second argument is returned (ensure arg1 is completed before proceeding with arg2).
 
pseq :: a → b → b
 
 Evaluates first argument to WHNF however does so in parallel using spark, when that is done the second argument is evaluated..
  
par :: a → b → b
  
Evaluates first and second arg in parallel, with hope that arg1 will be fully evaluated by the time its result is needed. It is useful in cases where the evaluation of first arg is expensive and is acceptable to delay its result until later.
 ​
 Now consider this quicksort algorithm:
 import Control.Parallel (par, pseq) 
 parSort (x:xs) &#x3D; greater ‘par‘ (lesser ‘pseq‘ (lesser ++ x:greater)) 
 where lesser &#x3D; parSort [y | y &#x3D; x] parSort _ &#x3D; []
 It will be almost as (in)efficient as the sequential version:
 sort :: (Ord a) &#x3D;&gt; [a] -&gt; [a] sort (x:xs) &#x3D; lesser ++ x:greater
 where lesser &#x3D; sort [y | y &#x3D; x] sort _ &#x3D; []
 Why is that?

                              <span>Here I defined Service1 with one method with default value:
 trait Service1 { def summarize(arg1: Int, arg2: List[Int] &#x3D; Nil): Int } 
 And this is how I try to test it:
 class Service2(service1: Service1) { def use: Int &#x3D; service1.summarize(0) } object Service2 { def layer: URLayer[Has[Service1], Has[Service2]] &#x3D; (new Service2(_)).toLayer } @mockable[Service1] object MockService1 object tests extends DefaultRunnableSpec { override def spec: ZSpec[TestEnvironment, Any] &#x3D; suite(&quot;example test&quot;)(testM(&quot;fails&quot;) { assertM( ZIO .service[Service2] .map(_.use) .provideLayer(MockService1.Summarize(equalTo(0, Nil), value(0)).toLayer &gt;&gt;&gt; Service2.layer) )(equalTo(0)) }) } 
 Execution failes with this error:
 - example test - fails - could not find a matching expectation - invalid call to MockService1.Summarize.default.2 expected MockService1.Summarize with arguments equalTo((0,List())) - unsatisfied expectations MockService1.Summarize with arguments equalTo((0,List())) 
 I suppose, that creating mock by hand (not using macro) will fix the issue, but is there any other way?

                              <span>I have several image files linked within my org-file. I would like to generate a stand-alone html-file from the org-file which embeds the image files within it. (I want to distribute the single html file.) I can generate base64 files and copy them into the org-file but this is a total hack. I am probably missing something basic. I would appreciate any advice.

 (I tried looking on google and asking chat-gpt, but there is only about changing the value to t to enable inserting one newline).

 I had to sprinkle in some more lazy until it didn&#x27;t produce stack overflows anymore.
  
Edit 1: When I write lazy val sum the forward reference error goes away and an infinite-loop warning appears. When I write that: &#x3D;&gt; Parser[T2] instead of that: Parser[T2], that warning goes away as well. I&#x27;m going to report back and see if it works with an implementation!
 The problem is that I don&#x27;t really know what I&#x27;m doing. I just understand that in Haskell, everything is lazy and in Java, everything is eager evaluation, besides stuff like &amp;&amp;, which I guess works &quot;lazily&quot; in Java as …</span>

                              <span>Hi all. Long time lurker here but first time poster.
 I thought this community might be interested in my dissertation. It’s an evaluation of effect systems / design patterns in pure functional languages, from first principles. It operates at the intersection of the academic literature and real world software development. Haskell was the most obvious language for this task, so I used a small program involving four key effects: environment, state, errors and I/O.
 A lot of my time was spent trying to understand the history of the domain and drawing out the most important criteria for working programmers. In the end I settled on: expressiveness, modularity, extensibility, ergonomics and performance. These are the basis for the comparison.
 I don’t expect anyone to have the time to read the whole thing, so this post summarises some of the key take aways: https://www.dantb.dev/posts/dissertation
 I also compiled a list of my favourite resources (there should be a few familiar names from this subreddit… 🙂): https://www.dantb.dev/posts/effects-bibliography
 This evaluation may be useful for people wanting to understand the trade offs involved in selecting tools and techniques in pure functional languages. This was one of my personal goals for the project, as someone who has used pure FP in Scala for several years but never went deep on the theory before. I saw a bit of a gap in the literature regarding the application of these design patterns from the perspective of a software developer, which is what I’m most interested in.
 The structure is broadly chronological and a lot of it is probably old news for experienced Haskellers. With that in mind, I&#x27;d highlight Chapter 7 which contrasts extensible effects with the earlier approaches.
 Comments are open 🙂

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been learning Haskell for almost a year now, and I feel like I can confidently write programs (not quite to the extent of my old imperative programming languages, but I used those for a lot longer) and I&#x27;m looking to contribute to some open source repositories so I can improve further and give back to this amazing community. I can work my way around a large codebase, but generally I would prefer to work on a more modest sized one if possible. Thanks!

 but when I try to use the code provided to launch xterm it crashes my emacs and freezes it up. It&#x27;s the same deal for a few other terminal emulators ive tried. Unsure why. when I use helm-run-external-command I&#x27;m able to launch without problem but its a litttle roundabout and creates it&#x27;s own buffer which is annoying

 Over time this has become a long file with 100s of entries. The issue i have is finding a specific note.
 I spend far too much time looking for a specific note. 
 How do you organise and search your journal with org mode?

 I am trying to write something that will send notification . I have the exact time when it starts 4/8/2023 at 18:47:10 ( lets call this A.1) and after 1hr40min51sec or 6051 seconds it moves to A.2 than A.3, A4.A5 and last one is A.6 after this ends it goes to B.1 and so on . Can I have emacs send me notifications every time it moves from A to B but also when it moves from A.1 to A2 etc .. I am looking at https://cl-cookbook.sourceforge.net/index.html and trying to understand what i need to use for this to work. Thank you

                              <span>I use emacs as a daemon. The following code should set Fira Code to be the font:
  (let ((default-font (pcase system-type (&#x27;gnu/linux &quot;Liberation Mono 16&quot;) (&#x27;darwin &quot;Avenir 16&quot;) ((or &#x27;windows-nt &#x27;cygwin) &quot;Corbel 16&quot;) (_ &quot;Verdana 16&quot;)))) (cond ((find-font (font-spec :name &quot;Fira Code&quot;)) (add-to-list &#x27;default-frame-alist &#x27;(font . &quot;Fira Code 16&quot;))) ((find-font (font-spec :name &quot;DejuVu Sans Mono&quot;)) (add-to-list &#x27;default-frame-alist &#x27;(font . &quot;DejuVu Sans Mono 16&quot;))) (t (add-to-list &#x27;default-frame-alist &#x60;(font . ,default-font))) ) ) 
 However, instead, Liberation Mono is set to be the font for some reason. I thought that find-font would return a list if a font is found, which is truthy, but that doesn&#x27;t appear to be the case. And yes, I&#x27;m sure that Fira Code is installed properly:
 (find-font (font-spec :name &quot;Fira Code&quot;)) -&gt; # 
 The output below the elisp snippet is what I get when I evaluate it.

                              <span>I use wsd-mode via websequencediagrams.com to create professional-looking sequence diagrams from a simple and easy to read markup language. Very happy with it! Way faster to create and edit than draw.io.
 Is there a similar Emacs package to convert from text to professional-looking directed diagrams like decision trees?
 I searched Google, Reddit and Emacs SE and the best I encountered was:
  
graph.el - converts a difficult to parse elisp lists to a similarly difficult to read text diagram.
 a bunch of packages for converting org docs to diagrams of various sorts, none of which were quite suitable for making arbitrary directed diagrams.
  
My hope is my google-fu has failed me and there is a great package I&#x27;ve missed. Also open to non-Emacs suggestions that could be integrated into Emacs with some work.

                              <span>Just a random thought. 
 What if before compiling emacs from source, we somehow integrate my init.el into the sources. The resulting binary will have my custom configuration (+ maybe decrease initial load time).
 Is this thought correct/rational? What are the pros and cons?

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I&#x27;m super excited to announce the release of Yampa 0.14.2! This release also comes with accompanying releases of many related projects: yampa-test (0.14.2), simple-affine-space (0.2.1), yampa-gloss (0.2.1), Space Invaders (0.14.2), and Haskanoid (0.1.6).
 Yampa is a fast, elegant Functional Reactive Programming implementation. Yampa prides itself in being a long-standing community project. It has now been around for 20 years!!! See https://github.com/ivanperez-keera/yampa#features for details on Yampa&#x27;s features.
 This release mainly addresses styling issues. All library code now conforms to the main rules of the style guide we follow (which is publicly documented). We&#x27;ve also addressed other minor maintenance issues, like compatibility with new versions of GHC and some de…</span>

                              <span>static-ls is a low memory language server for Haskell that serves as an alternative to hls with less functionality by using statically generated information. It is intended for (Highly recommend hls instead if you aren&#x27;t having these issues):
  
enterprise sized projects that are either too large or make extensive use of template Haskell leading to high memory usage for hls
 for machines with too little memory where hls can end up using too much memory
  
and provides a small subset of haskell language server&#x27;s functionality namely:
  
Type on hover
 Find references
 Go-to definition
  
Future features I&#x27;d like to implement include: - Haddock documentation on hover from interface files - Diagnostics from ghcid - Autocomplete in scope from hiedb
 It has been tested it on a codebase with over 180,000 LOC and works relatively stably. With a combination of ghcid, an hiedb filewatcher and the -fdefer-type-errors flag you can get pretty solid IDE behavior. Currently only ghc 9.4.4 is supported but happy to personally help people set this up if interested!
 Any feedback is appreciated!

                              <span>I&#x27;m happy to announce the 0.4.0.0 release of generic-persistence! Here is the Hackage Link.
 generic-persistence is a Haskell persistence layer for relational databases. The approach relies on GHC.Generics. The actual database access is provided by the HDBC library.
 New things in this release:
  
A query DSL
 Connection pooling
 A fail safe API that uses Either to safely return all database runtime errors
  
changes:
  
all retrieve* functions have been renamed to select*
 the function retrieveAll was removed. Selection of all entries os a table can now be done with select conn allEntries
  
All new features and changes are documented in the tutorial.
 I&#x27;ve also created a sample project that demonstrates how to build a Servant REST service using generic-persistence for database access.
 All Feedback, bug reports and pull requests are welcome!

 What would be the closest thing nowadays? (Short summary of what I took away from them: Indeed quite low cost for highly competent Haskell consultancy + the questions and answers would, baring for exceptions, be open for others to read.)

                              <span>Hi. Pretty new to emacs and programming in general and I’m wondering if there’s an inbuilt package or something to help me relearning maths (pretty much forgotten all of it since we are taught to pass exams and not taught how to learn) 
 Thanks.

                              <span>I use doom emacs and am having an issue tracking down a key binding.
 While in insert mode, I like to use C-h as a binding for backspace since it is more ergonomic. However, while in org-mode, C-h seems to be bound to org-beginning-of-line.
 In order to find out why C-h was behaving this way, here&#x27;s what I did:
  
Open a .org file
 Enter insert mode
 Type M-SPC h k C-h
 This takes me to the documentation for org-beginning-of-line
  
Here&#x27;s where it gets weird:
 Under &quot;Key Bindings&quot;, it only has:
 org-mode-map C-a org-mode-map s- 
 ... no binding for C-h! But that&#x27;s the key I pressed to get to this help page!
 Why does C-h not show up here? Where did this binding even come from? How do I override it?
 I&#x27;ve tried doing:
 (map! :after org :map org-mode-map :i &quot;C-h&quot; #&#x27;backward-delete-char) 
 ... but this doesn&#x27;t seem to override the binding.

 I’ve been using emacs for a few years now about 3 years. I don’t really configure it much. I use vanilla Emacs.
 But I want to understand the power of emacs and how I can take advantage of it. I was wondering if some of you can explain to me the power of emacs? Thanks

 #+begin_src jupyter-python :results file :file ~/image.jpg import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt a &#x3D; np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) b &#x3D; np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) plt.plot(a, b) plt.show() #+end_src #+RESULTS: :RESULTS: #+attr_org: :width 547 [[file:~/image.jpg]] :END: 
 will not display an image.
 The problem occurs when using pandoc or org-export. Anyone have any idea how I can fix this?

I know it is recommended to use org-entities instead, but (1) I have tried using entities like \ast but they do not appear correctly on export (2) I&#x27;d like to use the actual characters rather than the entity. Does anyone have a function that strips zero width spaces from org documents on export to latex &amp; html?

 I&#x27;m newer to functional programming and use Scala3.2.0 version.
 now this code can&#x27;t be compiled and it prompts me: &quot;kinds not the same&quot;
 What&#x27;s the mistake in this code, and what is the correct code?
 (I think F[_]&#x27;s kind and Reader[R, _]&#x27;s kind are both * -&gt; *, what&#x27;s wrong with it?)

                              <span>Hi Zettlers,
this is a new idea of mine that I don&#x27;t understand well yet:
The value of a position in chess consists of its probability of victory for the player. Moves are evaluated according to how they affect this probability of victory.
We can apply this to our thinking: knowledge-based value creation consists of enriching data, information, and pre-existing knowledge with value-giving properties. Value-giving properties include: Accuracy/Completeness, Reliability, and Usefulness.
An evaluation of thinking would look like this:1

                              <span>Hello,
 I&#x27;m kind of a newbie on configuring emacs, so here is the context:
 I decided to install cmake-ide. It seems that rtags came along with the former. Fine, but I also decided to use the vertico package. It also seems that rtags has a support for Helm, but from what I understand, Helm and and Vertico fall under the same category of packages and therefore I can only have one of them.
 I found this friendly tutorial on how to install cmake-ide and I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with the customization used in it. I thought that by omit the helm line in the config scope and by changing (setq rtags-display-result-backend &#x27;helm) to vertico would workout with my configuration, but it failed.
 So my question is: is it possible to combine vertico and rtags to work simultaneously?

                              <span>I want specific buffers (in my case Clojure REPL related) always appear on the right side which can be done by adding a set of values to display-buffer-alist:
 (add-to-list &#x27;display-buffer-alist &#x60;(,(rx bos (or &quot;*cider-repl&quot; &quot;*nrepl-server&quot; &quot;*cider-test-report*&quot; &quot;*cider-error&quot; &quot;*cider-result&quot;)) (display-buffer-reuse-window display-buffer-in-direction) (direction . right) (window . root) (dedicated . nil) ;; (window-preserve-size . (t . t)) ;; (window-width . 0.30) )) 
 Now, you can see that I have a couple of things commented because they don&#x27;t appear to work. it looks like I&#x27;m not using the right combination of display-buffer functions. Or maybe something else is wrong.
 What I want is:
  
I want buffers to appear initially on the right side with specific width (0.30 of the frame)
 If I change the position of the window, e.g., move it to the left side, I want Emacs to remember my choice, and when I bury the buffer and pop to it again, I want it to come from the left. Currently, it always pops on the right side
 The same for the width. If I change the width - I want Emacs to preserve it and the next time I pop the buffer, it should not resize the window.
  
Can someone help me tame display-buffer so it works as I want? Thank you!

                              <span>With as much of the following:
  
Statically-typed
 Generates self-contained binaries
 Not Go
 Has a garbage collector
 Not lazy nor extremely aggressive about immutability
 Packaged in most common distros, such as Debian or RHEL
 Good ecosystem for writing CLI tools (nice argument parsers, good support for running other programs)
  
But the on-topic requirement is that it has a great experience in Emacs. As a statically typed language, table stakes is good completion. Also it should not lag Emacs. Not requiring too much fiddling would be nice.
 I think nothing checks all boxes, so I&#x27;m just looking to tick most..

                              <span>I use the standalone ranger file manager on my system outside of Emacs and I&#x27;m used to the various commands and keybindings. I&#x27;ve been using ranger.el for a while to replicate this experience, but unfortunately I keep hitting a bug regarding bookmarks, which I think is related to the enhanced bookmark-plus/bmkp package I use to manage bookmarks. It also seems to get stuck after a while, with multiple copies of the same tab/pane opening if I keep hitting q to close ranger. Additionally ranger.el doesn&#x27;t look like it&#x27;s being actively maintained at the moment, 
  
 I&#x27;ve tried using dirvish, which has the added benefit of being recently updated. The previews seem to work nice, but (I realize this sounds crazy) there seems to be too much going on feature-wise. I keep trying to have the ranger like view with three panels, but dirvish seems to switch to a more standard dired like view despite my config. On top of this, there isn&#x27;t a nice C-h to hide dotfiles and I occasionally get a Selected deleted buffer error if I want to look at a directory I&#x27;ve killed.
  
 Does anyone have a smooth ranger.el or dirvish setup to share, or ways of overcoming the problems I mentioned above? Or a different way to browse files that&#x27;s more robust?

 I installed the first tutor I happened to find, called Monkeytype and do like it.
 The main plus is it has a nice minimalist UI where it shows my progress pretty clearly. The main minus is there&#x27;s no way to open a text file and automatically start tutorial using it. I think it would be pretty easy to script that kind of addition.

                              <span>Hi Emacsers.
 I created a small package for showing overlays in Swift-code/Elisp code. (defun and cl-defun in emacs lisp has basic support too).This is regex-based so it&#x27;s not 100% accurate. But it looks cool.
 https://github.com/konrad1977/emacs/blob/main/localpackages/overlay-usage.el
 Feel free to improve it.
 Swift (SourceKit-LSP Doesn&#x27;t support Code-lenses, so if you have support for that for your language you&#x27;re better off keeping you current solution)
 Enjoy!

                              <span>Hi,
 I work frequently with a (proprietary) application that uses the .Net standard serialiser. I often manually edit these files, as they also contain a DSL embedded in some of the content, that I find easier to tweak this way rather than via the application itself.
 I was considering developing a small prog mode to assist me with some or all of the following features:
  
hide most of the XML boilerplate (but retain the structure)
 display the DSL code, ideally with syntax highlighting. This code is embedded within two XML elements.
 where multiple code elements exist in an XML file, provide some mechanism to display this in a natural way
  
I&#x27;d be amazed if something similar hadn&#x27;t been done previously, so I&#x27;m looking for an example or two that will provide me with a flavour of what is possible.
 Thanks

                              <span>Hi, I usually don&#x27;t post on Reddit, so I apologize in advance if I make some obvious mistakes. I&#x27;ve already asked similar question here on a different subreddit, but I was wondering if there are better solutions.
 ​
 I previously owned a Mac Book 2020 and used Emacs for editing texts. I really liked that the OS X had a global/system wide shortcut that allowed cursor move/act like in Emacs (e.g. C-f, C-b, C-n, C-p C-a, C-e, C-k). For example, I could use the Emacs move for browsers (Chrome/Firefox), File Manager, etc.
 However, I recently had to return my Mac, and purchased a Steam Deck which has a Arch Linux like OS called SteamOS, which does not have the Emacs movements enabled globally/system wide.
 I tried to configure cursor movements/actions similar to the Emacs moves via KDE Custom Shorcut (details of how I configured can be seen here), but this solution does conflict with several applications, and I have a feeling that there might be a better solution.
 By any chance, does anyone know how to configure non-Mac OS (in my case SteamOS/Arch Linux) to have shortcuts similar to the Emacs in a global/system wide manner?

                              <span>Hey.
 Why is agenda not editable?
 Around a third of my workflow is going through filtered notes in a table and adding various things. This is very dynamic - I might want to suddenly have another column in the table (or remove it, or resize it), to add more information, or to not have something clutter the view.
 So far, it seems the agenda is very &quot;set in stone&quot;, and I am going to be unable to do things on-the-fly. Only possible to spend time preparing a view, then use and re-use it.
 Is orgmode really this unflexible?

                              <span>Hello
 I am using org-mode and org-attach via doom emacs. Whenever I have made notes and tried to attach something using either org-download-screenshot or org-download-clipboard, by default the heading has an &quot;ATTACH&quot; tag signifying that there is an attachment in this heading. Example shown below.
 ​

 Now when I try to export this to GFM using pandoc, this is what it does
 ​
 https://preview.redd.it/2keyfcri9esa1.png?width&#x3D;1110&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;57aa82093888ea635644fcedc5be3eaf376f21f4
 Essentially it exports the ATTACH tag out. I have a couple of questions.
  
What&#x27;s the purpose behind the &quot;ATTACH&quot; tag? The reason I ask this is because I can easily set org-attach-auto-tag to nil and this tag is not attached and therefore not exported. But does it have other consequences that I might not be aware of. Reading the documentation, it doesn&#x27;t appear so, but I am then left to wonder why this would be the default behavior.
 Is there a way to keep the org-attach-auto-tag to the default value of &quot;ATTACH&quot; but not have it exported. I tried setting the EXPORT_EXCLUDE_TAGS to ATTACH but then of course the whole content doesn&#x27;t get exported.
  
Thanks for your help.

                              <span>I was looking for a workflow where I&#x27;d paste images from clipboard all the time. I figured I could do it with the org-download package like so (with use-package):
 (use-package org-download :ensure t ;; this makes sure the thing is loaded if not present :init (setq org-download-method &#x27;attach) :config (add-hook &#x27;dired-mode-hook &#x27;org-download-enable) :bind (&quot;C-y&quot; . org-download-clipboard)) 
 Which works, until I try to paste text. Emacs freezes completely, and is unusable.
 I realized this also happens if I just call org-download-clipboard directly without a shortcut, when there is no pic in the immediate clipboard.
 So my question is: am I doing something wrong? Is there a simple solution here without having to use different shortcuts?
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>The reason I say viable is that it&#x27;s always of course possible. Knowing people can always land you a job and so can incredible luck.
 Often times with niche languages, it&#x27;s easy to get a job despite the total amount of jobs being limited. If no one is applying, the competition is pretty weak or nonexistent. 
 I&#x27;ve seen that many jobs in Haskell are in the healthcare sector. It seems to be pretty standard enterprise stuff that likely was done with Java at some point in the past. 
 Are these jobs, or Haskell jobs (non-research) in general competitive?
 If you were rating the difficulty of getting a job in Haskell as a self-taught programmer on a scale of 1-10 (with 1 being a webdev at a no-name website and 10 being a FAANG job), where would you put Haskell jobs?

                              <span>I feel suddently an idiot that I used to code like this to map over a list
 map (+1) [1,2,3,4] 
 Then I felt it is more looking Python doing such
 [ (1 + x) | x  [1,2,3,4] 
 I used to read functor /applicative/monad ref a lot , coud you guys comment my understanding is right on &#x60;Functor&#x60;
 fmap :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; f a -&gt; f b 
 fmap is just a funciton that :
  
describe how to extract &#x60;a&#x60; from the container &#x60;f-1&#x60;
 then run function (a -&gt; b), to get &#x60;b&#x60;
 then describe how to plug back &#x60;b&#x60; to container &#x60;f-2&#x60; ( f-2 doesn&#x27;t have to be same with f-1)
  
The key is : on different types, the effect of fmap is describling how to extract parameter and how plug back the result to a container (maybe a new container with some state change as well ) ?

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I’m a new student to programming and I have exams in a little over a month’s time but since I’m more of a science student most of the concepts aren’t linking as easily to me as compared to the rest of the students. Is there any advice or anything I could do to improve within the next month so I can pass this course? I also do understand the answers when I’m doing questions but it’s just writing and coming up with the functions that is the hard part. 
 Thank you in advance!

                              <span>I&#x27;d like to configure Emacs so I can toggle entering C- commands with single keystrokes, like god-mode, but the mode quits (goes back to insert mode) as soon as the command completes. Is there a way to make god-mode do this? Or is there another package that can provide this behavior? Thanks in advance.

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;d like to support a couple of Emacs maintainers but I&#x27;m not sure to whom and how much.
 For example I can choose the maintainers of my favourite packages and transfer some money on a regular basis. Is it okay to support many maintainers with less money or should I support few maintainers with more money? Or should I support FSF in general?
 I&#x27;m thinking of $50 per month. So, should I give 10 maintainers $5 per month or 5 maintainers $10?
 I will find an answer for myself but I&#x27;m interesting of how do you handle it.
 Thanks in advance

                              <span>I&#x27;m using Emacs 28 with tree-sitter.el. I&#x27;m trying to extract import-statements from C sources, and fail miserably.
 I can see the node tree using tree-sitter-debug-mode. But when playing around with queries - either interactively with tree-sitter-query-builder or with code (see below) - I don&#x27;t get any results.
 My code looks like this, and runs:
  (tsc-query-matches (tsc-make-query tree-sitter-require &#x27;c) [(preproc_include)]) (tsc-root-node tree-sitter-tree) #&#x27;ts--buffer-substring-no-properties) 
 The result is  [(0 . []) (0 . []) (0 . []) (0 . []) (0 . []) (0 . [])] 
 Which makes sense given the actual 6 include statements I have in the source file. But apparently no actual contents are extracted. Any suggestions?

                              <span>Hey.
 I&#x27;m just getting started with emacs, and I can&#x27;t even really start because of errors. Please help me stay here.
 I tried the debian package. It is bugged to say the least, and I found out quite quickly (see https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/cdei4p/failed_to_download_gnu_archive_bad_request/)I decided to install a newer version, as described by emacswiki (ganneff.de)https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsSnapshotAndDebian
 ​
 When apt was installing it, it would throw a much of eager-macro-expansion failure lines, something like
 Eager macro-expansion failure: (wrong-number-of-arguments (3 . 4) 5) 
 When running it, everything seemed fine, but, when I open a .org file, it throws
 (New file) File mode specification error: (error Eager macro-expansion failure: (wrong-number-of-arguments (3 . 4) 2)) 
 It does not do this if I run it with emacs -Q.
 Someone with a similar issue was https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/74421/eager-macro-expansion-failure-message-when-starting-emacs-28-2-from-the-mac-te , however, there is no fix there that worked for me
 HOME&#x3D;/tmp emacs 
 ^^ This still produces the error, even with an empty tmp.
 sudo apt remove --autoremove emacs emacs-common emacs-gtk 
 ^^ I did run this before installing the new one.
 Any advice will be appreciated. Thank you.
 ​
 EDIT: I tried deleting everything again, and installed the snap package. Same issue. There must be something leftover I&#x27;m guessing from those past emacs.

 I want to be able to insert links to all org-roam nodes that contain a certain tag. Is there a way to do this natively or do I need a custom Elisp function for it?
 Does anyone use this functionality who can share the code?

                              <span>I works on windows11&#x27;s native emacs 28.2 and run into an amusing but confused thing with org-babel.
 When I set &quot;sh&quot; as header, something wonderful happens:

 It&#x27;s a bash environment, when change &quot;sh&quot; to &quot;shell&quot;, it print a cmd.exe environment:
 https://preview.redd.it/n89e2r9gw6sa1.png?width&#x3D;673&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;af93c0f94bba7023ac95e67126d154f9a4d9602d
 I did not change the variable shell-file-name:
 https://preview.redd.it/ccmf77uqw6sa1.png?width&#x3D;938&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;9794eefc5cd6dc32158641d99ba7e2788587c345
 additionally not add &quot;sh&quot; to &quot;org-babel-load-languages&quot;.
 ​
 Any variables could determine which shell it invoke?
 The &quot;sh&quot; is what I desire, but I don&#x27;t know why it works？

                              <span>prettychart provides an easy way to view and create charts from ghci. In conjunction with a new release of chart-svg, it provides a means to rapidly visualize and analyse numerical data. For those of you who enjoy live coding or have lots of quick and dirty data analytics to slog through, it&#x27;s worth trying out.

                              <span>Just out of curiosity, I started looking for a usable haskell system for dos (MS-DOS or Free DOS). It is mentioned in several places that there were dos versions of hugs or hbc, but all the links (many pointint to universities FTPs) are broken. Some are so obscure that even archive.org did not deign to make a copy. 
 I found the source code of hbc for linux. Attemps to compile it with djgpp failed.
 So is there somewhere one can get a dos version of haskell these days?

                              <span>How has your week been? What are your plans for the coming week? Tell us about the state of you zettelkasting journey.
My week has been busy with medical issues that prevented me from making many new notes. I feel good now. 
I got my first two essays back from the professor in my food writing class, and I feel good about them. I am of a different generation than everyone else in the class, including the instructor. There are a couple of writers in the class that seem to be able to write a first draft of a &#x27;writing prompt exercise&#x27; that is far more polished than my &#x27;shitty first drafts&#x27;. They are modeling a skill that I aspire to.
While journaling this morning, I found a gem in an entry from one year ago today. It&#x27;s very meta, and this is all very circular.

  
Zettelkasting and journaling are like workouts. You have a busy day ahead. Why journal? Journaling is not just another task. At first, you stumble with form.  Like when you are a beginner at weight training, you struggle with repeatedly getting to the gym. You think it will help your physical health, but at first, you feel sore, tight, and tired, not at all the pinnacle of health. Eventually, if you stick with it, you might find a coach that helps with form, you might set up your environment so going to the gym feels natural, you might start to feel strength building, and you&#x27;ve started progressing on the climb to physical health.
All these weight training actions can be applied to zettelkasting and journaling. They train your mental health in the same way exercise trains your physical health. It&#x27;s a slow process at first. You can&#x27;t see the improvements day to day or even week to week. Improvement only comes with consistency.


I think I&#x27;ll move this gem from my journal to my ZK. I have a couple of relevant notes on the mental health benefits of journaling.

                              <span>Getting into this ecosystem to see if it&#x27;s better than other note taking tools. I need the possibility to use something similar to column view.
 Why are the horizontals disconnected?
 I was following this tutorial https://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-column-view-tutorial.htmlthey end up with it looking like an actual table at one point:
 Connected table
 What gives? Am I doing something wrong? I tried googling to no avail.
 Thanks in advance.
 [EDIT] After using yantar92&#x27;s advice and folding before/after, I managed to get closer to the expected look:
 Space?
 But there is still space between them, although now it&#x27;s not really a breaking issue.

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying out github copilot with this package: https://github.com/zerolfx/copilot.el, configured like this:
 (use-package copilot :straight (:host github :repo &quot;zerolfx/copilot.el&quot; :files (&quot;dist&quot; &quot;*.el&quot;)) :ensure t :bind (:map copilot-mode-map (&quot;&quot; . my/copilot-tab) (&quot;s-n&quot; . copilot-next-completion) (&quot;s-p&quot; . copilot-previous-completion) (&quot;s-w&quot; . copilot-accept-completion-by-word) (&quot;s-l&quot; . copilot-accept-completion-by-line)) :config (defun my/copilot-tab () (interactive) (or (copilot-accept-completion) (indent-for-tab-command))) :hook (prog-mode . copilot-mode)) 
 I had been using corfu and cape for completions with Tabnine (another code analyzer thing.) After disabling these I get the expected suggestions from copilot, appearing as grayed out code that I can accept with .
 I&#x27;d like to get the sort of experience shown in the gif at the zerolfx/copilot.el github page. Short completions pop up in an overlay - I don&#x27;t know if they are multiple suggestions from copilot or coming from another backend - and copilot suggestions appear in gray for acceptance.
 But if I re-enable corfu/cape/Tabnine I only see the overlaid completions, and don&#x27;t get copilot suggestions.
 I don&#x27;t have a good understanding of how corfu does it&#x27;s thing or how I can integrate copilot&#x27;s suggestions.
 How should I progress?

 I want to add my own commands to projectile-commander and I have the following in my init.el. However if do require &#x27;projectile it will cause my projectile-switch-project-action to reset to default. However I need to do require &#x27;projectile else I will get the following error when evaling init.el Symbol&#x27;s function definition is void: def-projectile-commander-method
 Why am I getting this error and what is the correct way to setup commands using use-package and projectile?

                              <span>Sometimes, I see people use a combination of use-package and require for third-party packages. For example, I was browsing through aboabo&#x27;s Github repo, and he uses use-package for clj-refactor and require for flycheck-clj-kondo. Is there a general rule of thumb for when to use use-package vs require?

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I am currently using evil and corfu, but I want to configure such that pressing a single escape will invoke corfu-quit when its UI is active (because pressing &quot;C-g&quot; is harder).
 The problem: even after
 elisp (define-key corfu-map [escape] #&#x27;corfu-quit) ;; yes, I think that won&#x27;t be usable in terminal Emacs but (kbd &quot;ESC&quot;) will ;; complicate a bunch of other &quot;M-&quot; keys 
 In evil insert state, pressing ESC will always invoke evil-normal-state even when corfu&#x27;s UI is displaying. Thus the above snippet is fine without evil, otherwise the key will bring me back to normal state without discarding the popup completion list.
 Can someone tell me how to take over evil in some circumstances such as the above?

 The redundant info could be remove from WindowsTerminal by setting &quot;powershell.exe -nologo&quot;.
 but &quot;shell-file-name&quot; is a filename variable, suffix with “-nologo&quot; not work.

 How could remove the start info.

Even being able to search for nc, it nc followed by a space would do the trick but I don&#x27;t know how to do that in the prompt.
 Using C u C c p s s give an option prompt in the minibuffer where you add the flags you want, -w in this case but that didn&#x27;t work.
 Is there also some way you can see the actual command executed by ag?

                              <span>When I have a Rust file open, I have all the rustic-mode keybinds for things like rustic-cargo-run. But if I have a non-Rust file open (my Cargo.toml, my README, whatever) then the keybind isn&#x27;t present. I can still M-x rustic-cargo-run, but having to remember to do that isn&#x27;t ideal. Is there a package that solves this problem?
 In the worst case I could add a hook on buffer creation that checks if the buffer belongs to a project that looks &#x27;Rust-ish&#x27; (contains a Cargo.toml at project root or whatever) and binds the relevant keys, but I don&#x27;t want to duplicate effort.

                              <span>Given: 
 type Image a &#x3D; Position -&gt; a
 type Position &#x3D; (Float, Float)
 type Region &#x3D; Image Boolean
 We would like to create a function that replaces the values of one image with another using paste.
 paste :: Region -&gt; Image a -&gt; Image a -&gt; Image a
 paste reg im1 im2 &#x3D; (\p -&gt; if (reg p) then (im1 p) else (im2 p))
 My question is where does p come from? paste takes 3 parameters reg, im1 and im2. So where does p come from? When using lambda in Javascript for example myList.map(x &#x3D;&gt; x+5), it&#x27;s clear that x is a value from myList. But here I get a little bit confused as to where p comes from.

                              <span>I&#x27;m going to list the Org mode apps available and summarize their flaws, harshly. I won&#x27;t have gripes about not supporting obscure Org syntax, or anything like that. Instead, can it read and write Org files? Trickier than you think.
  
Organice - It can&#x27;t access files from your phone&#x27;s filesystem, something that should be simple, but it&#x27;s difficult for a web app. You have to store your notes in 3rd party clouds like Dropbox or connect your own WebDAV server.
 Orgro : read only
 Orgzly - The most featureful. An unfortunate mechanism that can&#x27;t be turned off saves over your file with re-done spacing -- blank lines are added between headlines automatically, which isn&#x27;t Org specification nor everyone&#x27;s style. This clogs git, if you&#x27;re using version control, with changes that are just whitespace. One may notice a toggle to turn off adding blank lines between headlines, but that just means turning blank lines off entirely, forgetting ones that you may have added. Fundamentally, as of now, Orgzly&#x27;s parser doesn&#x27;t try to remember the blank lines in your notes that you may have added with purpose.
 Metanote A newcomer, but it has stayed proprietary.
  
I have more hopes about are full-fledged Emacs with termux or Emacs on F-Droid. None of the org mode apps today are very usable.

                              <span>I recently upgraded from Emacs 28.2 to Emacs 29 (changed Arch Linux packages from emacs to emacs29-git), and now Emacs closes very slowly with my configuration.
 To an extent, I know why this happens (auto-complete adds the function ac-comphist-save function to the kill-emacs-hook). But I fail to understand why ac-comphist-save is suddenly much slower on Emacs 29.
 If anybody has suggestions on why this is happening, or could explain what exactly I will lose by removing this function from the kill hook, I&#x27;d be very grateful.

                              <span>Emacs 29 has got new startup options: --init-directory. Here is how you can use it (for those daredevils who build their own Emacs, until 29 is finalized):
 In your shell, clone those repo(s) you would like to test:
 git clone https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs git clone https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude git clone https://github.com/jkitchin/scimax 
 You can now run your Emacs from command line in respective directory:
 emacs --init-directory&#x3D;~/spacemacs&amp; emacs --init-directory&#x3D;~/prelude&amp; emacs --init-directory&#x3D;~/scimax&amp; 
 Easy. 
 I actually never tried anyone&#x27;s setup before, but always had on my to-do to actually try those (+ Doom, but Doom seems to require slightly more fiddling). As a small review: Spacemacs and Prelude worked out of the box without any issues. Scimax is a bit older, and for some reason, it choked a bit during the installation. I had to press C-g once or twice to get it going. Also, every time Emacs starts, it is chewing on something until I press C-g. I haven&#x27;t investigated on what. But other than that, despite all the warnings during the package installation, it seems to work quite well. I am impressed with the amount of polish and integration all three has done. I can certainly recommend any, especially Scimax for those of you who are doing lots of org, org-babel and who write scientific articles and reports. Spacemacs seems to be the most polished of them the three, visually and technically, while Scimax seems to be actually most useful, especially if you are an academic.
 If you are new to Emacs and learning, it is not worth spending hours chasing packages and configuring stuff. Install Emacs, and you can be going solidly in less than five minutes with any of those three. Probably Doom to, but can&#x27;t be just cloned and auto-installed via provided init.el as those three guys.

                              <span>&#x60;I&#x27;m fairly new to emacs, so please be forgiving...
 I am trying GNU Emacs both on a Mac and a Windows PC. On the Mac, inserting a date with C-c ! shows [2023-04-04 Tue]. On Windows, it shows [2023-04-04 di]. Both machines have current-language-environment set to &quot;Dutch&quot;. The rest is mostly out of the box.
 It looks like Windows is properly detecting my locale, but the Mac isn&#x27;t.
 I want to use my local language (&quot;di&quot;) instead of English (&quot;Tue&quot;).
 What am I missing in setting this up?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been using embark for some months now, I like it, I like the concept, the way it works, and it&#x27;s already part of my workflow in a number of tasks. On the other hand I also find it somewhat overwhelming. The keymaps are very large, and comprise numerous tasks which could potentially be performed through Embark. As a result, unless the binding is already part of muscle memory, having to resort to the embark-verbose-indicator is a time consuming step, because the list is so long it feels like finding a binding in C-h m. True, C-h offers completion, but at this point I&#x27;m already wondering if it wouldn&#x27;t have been faster doing the task without using Embark.
 So, it works very well for bindings I know by heart. Which are a few. For others, I can&#x27;t help but feel I&#x27;d prefer to have less alternatives. Thus, I&#x27;m considering adopting a &quot;bottom-up&quot; approach to Embark. The idea would be drastically reducing the available Embark bindings, and then adding the ones for which I feel the need. The question is: is there a &quot;proper&quot; way to go about this? I don&#x27;t think nuking embark-keymap-alist to just a few maps is the way to go, since the keymaps put the bindings in the proper context. But, on the other hand, going around disabling each binding seems tedious. So, any advice on this?

                              <span>I keep track of certain reports in an org file and need to record the date the report was submitted. I use a property &quot;REPORT_DATE&quot; for this and then call org-time-stamp-inactive from the minibuffer in order to pass the value of the property in the desired format. 
 I am looking for a way to streamline this process, so that when I call org-set-property and select REPORT_DATE, I don&#x27;t have to manually call org-time-stamp-inactive, but instead I&#x27;m just prompted to select a date (i.e. a way for org-time-stamp-inactive to be called when I select the property REPORT_DATE via org-set-property). 
 I realize I could define a wrapper that would do much of what I need (prompt for a date and then call org-set-property with REPORT_DATE and the formatted output of org-time-stamp-inactive as arguments), but I&#x27;m wondering if this is necessary.
 I&#x27;ve looked into allowed values but, from what I can tell, I can only specify a list of values, which isn&#x27;t quite what I need.
  
EDIT: this does the trick. 
 (defun org-completing-read-date (prompt collection &amp;optional predicate require-match initial-input hist def inherit-input-method) &quot;Like &#x60;completing-read&#x27; but reads a date and outputs an inactive time-stamp. Only PROMPT and DEF are really used.&quot; (format &quot;[%s]&quot; (org-read-date nil nil nil prompt nil def))) (add-to-list &#x27;org-property-set-functions-alist &#x27;(&quot;REPORT_DATE&quot; . org-completing-read-date))

                              <span>I am using DOOM Emacs v3.0.0-pre for reference.
 I have the following lines in my config.el:
 (setq global-display-fill-column-indicator-modes &#x27;( ;; The following modes do not use the indicator. (not special-mode vterm-mode ) ;; All other modes are enabled. t ) ) ;; Draw a line at the fill column (by default 80 chars). (global-display-fill-column-indicator-mode) 
 But the fill column indicator is still displaying in vterm-mode. Can someone please explain to me what I am doing wrong? Thank you in advance.
 UPDATE
 Found a solution. Will only work with DOOM Emacs.
 ;; Show fill column indicator in text and programming modes. (add-hook! (&#x27;text-mode-hook &#x27;prog-mode-hook) &#x27;display-fill-column-indicator-mode )

 So I imagine &#x27;org agenda view in date tree format&#x27; where I can org-cycle every element.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been a while since I last posted a post regarding Eask. So I would like to share some of the significant changes since v0.1.0.
 For those who don&#x27;t know Eask, you can treat Eask as a successor to Cask.
 Project repository: https://github.com/emacs-eask/cli
 🎉 Features
  
Unlike Cask-file, Eask-file is an elisp file. You can manage dependencies with elisp code like:
  
elisp (when (version&lt; emacs-version &quot;26.3&quot;) (depends-on &quot;package-name&quot;)) 
  
Node.JS is not required to use Eask; you can download the binary at our release page
 Out-of-the-box linters and test runners (checkdoc, package-lint, ert, buttercup, elsa, etc)
 Work across all OSs (Unless Node.js doesn&#x27;t support it :P)
 Automatically download packages when they are used
 Fast, won&#x27;t start Emacs unless it&#x27;s needed
  
✨ Changes
  
Eask now has all the commands from Cask and more (If Cask works, then Eask works)
 eask status to display the state of the workspace (eask info is also cool! :D)
 Convert Cask-file to Eask-file using eask init --from&#x3D;cask
 eask generate workflow [action] to generate workflow files (support GitHub Actions, GitLab Runner, CircleCI, etc)
 eask generate [type] to generate common files like-pkg.el, -autoloads.el, LICENSE, .gitignore, etc.
 eask cat to display file with highlighting (uses e2ansi)
 Differentiate workspace with flag --global and --config, so you can use Eask as either a general tool or package management tool for your personal configuration
 eask create [type] creates elisp project (package or ELPA)
 webinstall is now available, install it with curl!

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;m working on using MobileOrg with webdav, but it only works partialy: 1. &quot;captures&quot; works, the content can be sync&#x27;ed back and forth 2. but the outlines are not working, I set up the url to be something like &#x3D;http://host/org/index.org&#x3D; and it links to a foo.org, both .org files have a line in &#x3D;checksums.dat&#x3D; Every time I click &quot;sync&quot;, it seems ok but the foo.org is not fetched, the outlines panel is blank. And MobileOrg didn&#x27;t try to fetch it, as I observed with tcpdump.
 What could be wrong? How can I troubleshoot the problem? The MobileOrg version is 1.7.5
 Thanks in advance.
 P.S. I submitted an issue at https://github.com/MobileOrg/mobileorg/issues/290, but nobody responded yet, so I re-post it here to see if someone here knows how to fix it.

                              <span>For a software team to be successful, you need excellent communication. That is why we want to build
systems that foster cross-team communication. Using a monorepo is an excellent
way to do that. A monorepo provides:
Visibility: by seeing the pull requests (PRs) of colleagues, you are easily informed
of what other teams are doing.
Uniformity: by working in one central repository, it is easier to share
the configuration of linters, formatters, etc. This makes it easy
to use the same code style and documentation standards.
Uniformity smooths the onboarding of newcomers as well as the reassignment of engineers
to different internal projects.
Easier continuous integration: new code is picked
up automatically by CI, without any manual interaction, ensuring uniformity and best practices.

 But when I try to do this I get the following persmission denied error.
 I tried some stuff. Deleting the folder C:\sr does not help. Runnig the command as administratior gives another error and I&#x27;m uncertain if that is the right way to go.
 What should I try next to get hindent installed?

                              <span>Scala CLI v1.0.0-RC1 has just been released.
 v1.0.0-RC1 is the first release candidate version of Scala CLI. Either this or a future release candidate is meant to become the new official scala runner to accompany the Scala compiler (scalac) and other scripts, replacing the old scala command.
 To learn more about Scala CLI as the new scala runner, check out a recent blogpost: https://medium.com/virtuslab/exploring-scala-cli-the-new-scala-runner-4b958245c2e0
 Notable changes:
  
better performance
 using experimental features will now produce an appropriate warning, which can be disabled with the --suppress-experimental-warning option or the suppress-warning.experimental-features global configuration key
 experimental and restricted configuration keys are now only available in the --power mode
 deprecated using directive syntax has been dropped (multiline directives and others)
 and more, refer to the release notes for details

                              <span>whenever i turn on sly to edit a lisp file or to use the repl, i would like to have something like lispy mode turned on. This would autocomplete parentheses and allow me to work comfortably with s-exps. Just turning on lispy mode causes some annoying behavior in the repl. Specifically, if im typing 
 (defun f (x).) 
 and point is at . then pressing ENTER evaluates the form, rather than inserting a new line. Maybe I set this up wrong or the lispy package doesnt interact nicely with sly?

                              <span>I use evil-mode with a few modifications.
 In normal mode:
  
s
 s is remapped to org-cycle and S (uppercase s) to org-shifttab as I don&#x27;t use the substitute key in evil-mode, and for me org-cycle is the most used command in org-mode, Tab key is just a little bit too far away from the home row. Correspondingly cycle keys in magit diff view and pdf-tool&#x27;s outline view are also remapped to s.
 
x
 x is changed to evil-visual-line for a quick single key press. Remap X (uppercase x) to evil-delete-char to retain x&#x27;s original function.
 
Leader keys
 Main leader keys are Space, f, t.
 F (uppercase f) and T (uppercase t) are rebound to keep f and t&#x27;s original evil commands.
 
e
 e is set to avy-goto-char.
 
u and U
 u is for evil-undo, U (uppercase u) is changed to evil-redo.

                              <span>I have set sentence-end-double-space to nil, and I&#x27;m trying to use non-breaking spaces after things like &quot;Mr.&quot; in &quot;Mr. Johnson&quot; so as to distinguish abbreviation dots from end of sentence dots. However, even when I include a non-breaking space (C-x 8 SPC), commands like forward-sentence and backward-sentence will still stop on those.
 My sentence-end variable is nil, so according to the sentence-end function, the value will come from the variables ‘sentence-end-base’, ‘sentence-end-double-space’, ‘sentence-end-without-period’ and ‘sentence-end-without-space’. I&#x27;ve checked all of them, and the only one that seems to be pertaining is sentence-end-base, which says:
  
Its value is &quot;[.?!…‽][]\&quot;&#x27;”’)}»›]*&quot; 
 Regexp matching the basic end of a sentence, not including following space.
  
It doesn&#x27;t say anything about distinguishing spaces from non-breaking spaces. Any clues on how to change this behavior?
 Also, can you see any unintended consequences of the setup I&#x27;m planning to use (one space after sentences, one non-breaking space after things that should not be ending sentences)?

                              <span>This is a bit of a nice-to-have, but as a programmer I sometimes wish for a way to augment code/data I&#x27;m looking at. My concrete example of yesterday was a compact hex-representation of some joystick input data. I discovered recently the highlight-functionality, and that has already been super helpful in making visibly distinct marks in long logfiles.
 I know that Emacs can do overlays (and I know that they are costly), so I wonder if anybody is aware of something like svg-annotate/git blame where for each line I get an annotation of the meaning of that line.

 Good. But how can I get a view of previous weeks, future weeks? And how is it even doing this? I don&#x27;t see any TODOs or such in the exported org-mode file. What is it, how is it populating org-agenda?

                              <span>This DPT is from a problem sheet I am working through:
 https://preview.redd.it/juqanyg7wqra1.png?width&#x3D;283&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;947b2dbcfd219209dec6f798e4f3c3143d511d21
 The syntax here is that prod represents a DPT, [1..n] represents a set of integers from 1 to n. x.B is a type function with argument x. I am trying to calculate the number of elements of the resulting type. 
 Although I understand the concept of DPTs I don&#x27;t actually understand how they work in practise i.e. this example. My guess is that the cardinality of the resulting type is 6, (1,1) (2,1) (2,2) (3,1) (3,2) and (3,3). Can anyone give a better explanation of how this works?

                              <span>Was going to quickly write some complex computations and took a look at the source code for Data.Complex just to see what tools I get out of the box. Many of the formulas are what you would expect like:
 sin (x:+y) &#x3D; sin x * cosh y :+ cos x * sinh y 
 But the instances make no sense at all:
 instance Monad Complex where a :+ b &gt;&gt;&#x3D; f &#x3D; realPart (f a) :+ imagPart (f b) instance Applicative Complex where pure a &#x3D; a :+ a f :+ g  a :+ b &#x3D; f a :+ g b 
 I&#x27;m not seeing how the bind definition works at all. f is going to return a real and complex number when applied to both a and b so you are going to have to scramble. Moreover unless f is linear there is no reason to believe that f(a +ib) &#x3D; f(a) + i*f(b). It would seem to me a much more reasonable assumption would be to use numerical methods and compute a Taylor expansion for real a and then extend to b. That&#x27;s still highly questionable but at least don&#x27;t fail for functions as simple as f x &#x3D; x^2. Similarly the definition for pure makes no sense at all.
 Haskell normally doesn&#x27;t get obvious math wrong so I&#x27;m assuming the fault lies with me. What am I missing?

                              <span>Existing code: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; -- in ModuleA data X a &#x3D; ... deriving (...)
 -- in ModuleB import ModuleA
 fun :: arg -&gt; X a
 newtype Y a &#x3D; Y (ReaderT Bool X a) deriving (...Monad)
 funY :: arg1 -&gt; Y a &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 What I would like to achieve is to replace usage of concrete type X with a (constrained) abstract type without touching code in ModuleB - shadowing ModuleA import with a Cabal mixin.
 I tried: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; class ApiX m where ...
 type X a &#x3D; forall m. (ApiX m) &#x3D;&gt; m a &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 It almost works - except newtype Y a above. Compilation fails with the message that X is partially applied. Note that this already exists in ModuleB and the goal is not to touch source code in this module.
 Is there any way to achieve that (using type families or whatever)?
 EDIT: The end goal is to make all functions defined in ModuleB polymorphic without touching any code in this module. In other words transform all functions from
 f :: a -&gt; b -&gt; c -&gt; X d
 to
 f :: ApiX m &#x3D;&gt; a -&gt; b -&gt; c -&gt; m d

                              <span>I realized a while back that it should be pretty easy to write an unordered split function for the pqueue package.
 splitU :: Int -&gt; MinQueue a -&gt; (MinQueue a, MinQueue a) 
 splitU n q divides q into a priority queue of size min n (size q) and a priority queue of size max 0 (size q - n). I believe this can be achieved in amortized time O(log(min(n,|q|))) and worst case time O(log(max(n,|q|))) by operating in a manner analogous to binary subtraction. Which elements end up in which priority queue would be largely arbitrary. Would such an operation be useful for anything in practice? I haven&#x27;t been able to think of anything, but I really want to have a reason to write this ;-).
 Edit: those bounds are wrong, but the real ones are still logarithmic.

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking for a printed book to read after finishing with Manning Publication&#x27;s Get Programming with Haskell.
 Some things to consider are that, though I can&#x27;t say for sure why, I don&#x27;t like this book. I think the issue is that it&#x27;s light. Not just verbose, but lacking in substance. Since it isn&#x27;t entirely vapid and having paid money for it, I will finish the book. It&#x27;s just anemic. And the capstone projects are fun.
 Two books which worked well for me are Manning&#x27;s The Joy of Clojure 2nd Ed. and PragProg&#x27;s Programming Clojure 3rd Ed. This is of particular significance since at least 90% of the first seven chapters of The Joy of Clojure are redundant with Programming Clojure, which I read first. I feel like I&#x27;m getting less from reading Get Programming with Haskell than I did reading content I had already covered in another book. The content just isn&#x27;t there.
 (Also, it&#x27;s worth noting that the code examples are kind of crappy. I&#x27;m finding myself refactoring this &quot;expert&#x27;s&quot; code because it&#x27;s ugly and horribly redundant. One thing I like about Haskell is that it&#x27;s beautiful, with minimal boilerplate, and code I write in Haskell looks great to me. I don&#x27;t like looking at unsightly code, and his code is mostly that. But for the sake of learning, I can look beyond that.)
 So, with this in mind, what might /r/Haskell recommend as a second Haskell book?
 Edit: I should probably mention (admit?) that I am not a programmer, and if you exclude my Numerical Analysis textbook from grad school, those two Clojure books are the only programming books I&#x27;ve read. I have been programming at some level for decades, but I don&#x27;t have a typical CompSci background. (Which may or may not be a good thing since it does also mean I don&#x27;t need to unlearn OOP.)

 I checked with the compiler and it gave me this one foo :: Eq a &#x3D;&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; a
 First I thought about something like this foo :: (Eq a, Eq b) &#x3D;&gt; a -&gt; b -&gt; a -&gt; a
 So why does it forces x and y to be of the same type? Wouldnt the second option be more general as it gives the option of x and y being from the same or different type?
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I start a new job tomorrow, and I wanted to try retrieving calendar information using excorporate.
 However, the EWS url returns a 401 when an attempt is made to access it. Increasing the verbosity of the logging from request ((setq request-log-level &#x27;blather)) allows us to see that basic auth is being attempted against the https://outlook.office365.com/EWS/Services.wsdl url.
 This article would indicate that Basic Auth is no longer supported: https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/exchange-team-blog/basic-authentication-deprecation-in-exchange-online-september/ba-p/3609437
 I think this means that Excorporate can no longer authenticate with O365 as a result.

                              <span>Installed on a cheap Teclast 10-inch tablet, running Android12, from F-droid.
 It appears to run in isolation, in a container, so I cannot access the file system of the tablet. Can&#x27;t see a way to copy my config over...? Any ideas? 
 It initially starts up with a tiny, tiny font size, so I managed to set up a one line .emacs to increase the font size, so it is at least readable.
 Totally unsuited for an on-screen keyboard (tried swiftkey and the hacker keyboard).
 Hacker keyboard only shows the modifiers in landscape orientation
 And lastly, how the hell do you install fonts on Android??

                              <span>I&#x27;m having a problem with byte-compiling a package that uses defhydra.
 The package defines a hydra only if the hydra package is available, but since it&#x27;s a macro, it expands during byte-compilation and some users see &quot;void-variable&quot; error when trying to use the package.
 The relevant code looks like this:
 (when (require &#x27;hydra nil :noerror) (defhydra powerthesaurus-hydra ...)) 
 The idea is not to explicitly depend on hydra (or transient), but still define such interfaces if the corresponding package is available.
 I tried using eval-after-load and with-eval-after-load, but no luck there.
 I&#x27;d really appreciate any advice or approach to try. Thanks!

                              <span>Hello, I was planning to use org-agenda to empty my head of the (long-term) tasks that keep bothering me to focus better on the present. However, one requirement for whatever goal/task-planner system I wanted to use came up as having a system of &quot;prerequisites&quot;. 
 For example, say I want to do a book/course on Advanced Calculus, then a prerequisite for that would be Basic Calculus. Now, I&#x27;d love the planner system to not show the Advanced Calculus until I complete all its prerequisites. But when I do complete all its prerequisites, I want it to automatically show the Advanced Calculus goal.
 Is this pre-provided by org-agenda? If not, could someone please suggest what modifications I might need to do in order to enable this?
 org-enforce-todo-dependencies seems relevant, but this seems to assume that one task&#x27;s completion may only enable at most one other task (its parent), while I can imagine that there can be one-to-many such links.

                              <span>I was inspired by code metrics that was announced a few days back that shows the complexity of a function as a overlay above the function so I wrote a simple POC that uses RipGrep to shows number of references of that function signature. SourceKit-LSP that I uses for code completions doesn&#x27;t support code lenses so I thought it would be nice to have something similar. 
 Now to my problem. When my overlay-usage-mode is enabled the scroll/trackpad is starting to behave extremely bad, it hangs and sometimes it scrolls back to the area over and over. Its the exactly the same behavior I get when using pixel-precision-mode in Emacs 29.x
 So I would like to get some help to fix my code, or at least some pointers in the right direction.
 I am using Emacs 29.x on MacOS on a M1 Pro Max so I got a lot of CPU power.

 No matter how to scale the fonts, the table stay formatted badly.
 I tried it in Vterm, term, shell, eshell, ansi-term, they displayed the same as above.
 How could get it correctly displayed as in a decent terminal such as Konsole? (Emacs 28.2 on ubuntu)

                              <span>I&#x27;m using emacs 30, compiled from git. Pixel scroll precision mode is great, finally I can move around emacs without feeling lost with all those jumps. I&#x27;ve configured it like this:
 (setq-default scroll-conservatively 10000) (setq-default scroll-margin 5) (pixel-scroll-precision-mode t) (setq pixel-scroll-precision-use-momentum t) (setq pixel-scroll-precision-interpolate-mice t) (setq pixel-scroll-precision-large-scroll-height 10.0) (setq pixel-scroll-precision-interpolate-page t) (global-set-key (kbd &quot;C-v&quot;) &#x27;pixel-scroll-interpolate-down) (global-set-key (kbd &quot;M-v&quot;) &#x27;pixel-scroll-interpolate-up) 
 This lets me scroll smoothly with the mouse wheel as well. Only problem I&#x27;ve encountered is that I always scroll by the same amount, no matter the buffer size.
 There&#x27;s buffers that are quite tiny, like the documentation popup that corfu provides. I can place my mouse on top of it, and smooth scroll with the mouse wheel, but it scrolls too far, and it doesn&#x27;t let me see very much.
 Is there a simple way to make the scrolling dependent on the vertical height of the buffer?

 Then I want to emphasize &quot;code&quot; with ~, but should twice strike ~.
 Try to select the word &quot;code&quot; firstly with M-S-f, then strike ~, but it didn&#x27;t embrace &quot;code&quot; with &quot;~&quot;.
 How could add ~ as elements of smartparents.

                              <span>Edit: I thought just pressing C-c a and then choosing a different view would not work, because when I did that, the main window switched from the buffer I was editing to the agenda view, so I thought I was going to lose focus of the buffer I was editing.
 But once I selected a new agenda view, the buffer I was editing regained focus.
 So the answer is, just press C-c a and then choose the new view you want.

 Original post:
 Let&#x27;s say I&#x27;m in the week view of the Agenda (C-c a a) and I want to go to the view of my to-dos.
 I could press q to quit the week view, then press C-c a t.
 Is that the quickest way? I was wondering if there is a way to go &quot;back&quot; from an agenda view to the dispatcher, or to &quot;switch&quot; from one agenda view to another without quitting the agenda view entirely.
 I&#x27;m sorry if this is documented somewhere. I&#x27;ve looked in the manual and online and I&#x27;m coming up blank.

 I have been working on a library to batch requests transparently, eg: transforming multiple concurrent dynamodb GetItem requests in one BatchGetItem requests or multiple concurrent elasticesearch index request to one batched request.

                              <span>Hi I am getting confused as to how to tackle a whole book or research paper and the production of notes.  I&#x27;m doing a literature review as part of a phd, so academic level critique needed.  The referencing I can easily cite at the end of the note so that isn&#x27;t a concern. Does one research paper produce many notes, how does one title these notes please?  Is it the concept or the book etc.  thank you

                              <span>Hi,  newbie here.  I&#x27;m not overly confident or comfortable with notion, have seen hypernotes that seems easier for me, however I&#x27;ve been using Notion for a while.  I like notion as I can directly link out to a google doc.  I&#x27;ve sort of constructed the page to use notion and files embedded as if it were scrivener.  I digress.  I am writing a phd.  I do a lot of literature reviews etc.
My question here is there really much value in having a tool that presents a map of notes as per obsidian.  If I build my zettelkasten in notion which is basically a relational database is this not sufficient.  I do really want to concentrate on writing.  As notion supports my writing very well the idea of having the zettel database in the same tool is appealing to me.
Any thoughts please?
thank you Zoe</span>

 Which configuration am I missing?
 I already tried (setq-local eldoc-documentation-strategy &#x27;eldoc-documentation-compose-eagerly) and (setq-local eldoc-documentation-strategy &#x27;eldoc-documentation-compose). But it did not help.
 EDIT: Sorry for the wrong wording. I meant, cursor-at-point, not mouse-hover. Also, here is a screenshot of the help Corfu shows, and a screenshot of the type signature Eglot/Eldoc shows: https://envs.sh/hZ-.png https://envs.sh/hLD.png

                              <span>I have just spent approximately 12 hours trying to figure out why tests were breaking in my package after a significant refactor (yes, yes, I should have taken smaller steps), and it turns out the problem is that because of how emacs works and what my tests do, I had last-command set to kill-region across tests and I was generating the wrong kill-ring.
 I am slowly but surely developing some amount of knowledge I can attempt to share about &quot;how to set emacs to a good-enough-slate across automated end-to-end tests&quot;.
 If you&#x27;re curious, the package is https://github.com/trevoke/org-gtd.el - ... and the major major refactor is happening over at https://github.com/Trevoke/org-gtd.el/tree/more-flexible-organization .

                              <span>Hey there,
 So I&#x27;ve honestly been guilty of always writing notes via text on my phone but never pulling them into my Emacs &#x27;ideas.org&#x27; file on my local file server that I can access via SSH and via Tramp Mode with a related Hydra.
 That being noted, here&#x27;s the workflow of what I want to achieve:
 Desired Workflow:
  
I write an &#x27;idea&#x27; note on my Android phone&#x27;s Emacs Org Mode app
 I want the heading of the actual note to be like this (with the bulletpoints via Org Mode style to be intact):
  
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 * Week of (Monday&#x27;s date --&gt; ex: 3-27-2023)
 ** (Title of Idea)
 *** Notes:
 (Blah blah blah my notes)
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 ​
 With that in mind, can anyone point me in the right direction for a good Android phone app that does some of this heavy lifting? Also, can someone help me create the right syntax for the date insertion stuff above and format of the &#x27;Title of Idea&#x27;? for org mode note ingestion?
 I&#x27;ve only done something similar for a work based todo list for ticket work, but its been a long time.
 Also, a general explanation of how I can do this process via the same Android app would be great since I have never synced notes to an actual notes file over SSH, and only did this kind of thing locally to a todo list.
 Thanks so much!

 Hour Two
 Blown trying to figure out why Emacs was giving message &quot;Cannot open load file: No such file or directory&quot;. The problem was trying to symlink my .emacs.d folder.
 Troubleshooting why my symlinks weren&#x27;t working. Tried Powershell and CMD commands. No help. Don&#x27;t use symlinks. That&#x27;s all I discovered. Washed my hands of the problem.

                              <span>I mainly made the switch because I wanted a tool that I can rely on for years to come (but also, Org-mode). Looking back, I have switched notebooks/editors 6 times in the past ~15 years for various reasons, either because I switched OS or the old tool could no longer satisfy my needs; it&#x27;s just not sustainable and migrating contents ended up being a headache every time.
 It&#x27;s only been a week, but so far, I like to think that I have found a forever home with Emacs.
 Here are some questions I have. I looked through some of the old threads but couldn&#x27;t find the answer I need. Any relevant info is appreciated.
  
What are some suggested options for syncing Org-mode files across different OS platforms, preferably E2E encrypted? One combination appears to be file sync client + Cryptomator, though unsure if that&#x27;d prove to be problematic in the long term.
 
How do people keep their configs consistent across platforms (also backing them up)? Let&#x27;s say that I carry around a Linux-powered laptop, but at home I switch between Windows and macOS for different purposes; each of them may have slightly different configs that correspond to the platform.
 
Is there a built-in cheatsheet of sort, or a toggle reference tool that can be customized, for a beginner to use as a reference while learning common keystrokes and commands? I have been killing by searching with apropos and then yanking to a separate org file; it works, just somewhat clunky. (Love the terminology, by the way.)
 
I plan to be using Emacs for academic purposes as well ­ drafting papers, processing data with scripts, so on and so forth. Any tools or advice that comes to mind?

 I have been using this package for book management, take a peek : https://github.com/lepisma/org-books
 ...and the damn thing stops working ..........and I am seeing some weird thing in the message buffer:
 Greedy org-protocol handler. Killing client.
 No server buffers remain to edit
 Deprecated date/weektree capture templates changed to ‘file+olp+datetree’.
 Invalid key: ‘^[’
 Invalid key: ‘[’

 Item captured.
 ​
 I am trying to capture book information by org-capture template ..wondering ..
 P.S. Pasting captured url from the clipboard to org-capture-template ...also it sometimes throws errors like this too
 ​
 * %![Error: (void-function org-books-get-details)]
 ...and running out steam while chasing it.....so ....

 Little details which might help you people :
 1) I am running emacs on tty and this stuff worked flawlessly from here. Importantly, I haven&#x27;t done any changes specific to it anywhere.
 2) Emacs version 28.1

 However, it automatically to do extra jobs to install emacs emacs-bin-common emacs-common of version 27.
 How could I just install auctex and ignore its affiliated emacs.

                              <span>I guess what I mean by &quot;main&quot; is that there are a decent amount of jobs in a company that specifically hire Haskell programmers for various work. I&#x27;m aware of some niche use cases of it, like Facebook&#x27;s spam filter, but I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily count that as a &quot;sector.&quot;
 Are Haskell jobs reasonable to search for if you&#x27;re self-taught and no degree?
 Certain Haskell jobs are obviously eliminated since it tends to be used in very math-focused areas and academic sectors.
 I&#x27;m reasonably good at Haskell, and enjoy the language more than most, so I was curious what&#x27;s out there.

                              <span>Hi all,
 https://github.com/makingthematrix/signals3
 Signals3 is a lightweight event streaming library I made, based on code from the Android client of Wire, an end-to-end encrypted messenger. Its Android app was probably the biggest Scala project on Android in the world. I worked on it for five years, and extracting a small part of it to a separate library was one of the nicest and most productive tasks I remember from those days :)
 I released Signals3 1.0.0 two months ago. It was a direct rewrite of the old version from Scala 2.11 to Scala 3 (hence the name). The whole thing is an implementation of the observer pattern and in Wire, it helped a lot to connect different parts of the app, made it react quickly to events, and made the code pretty and readable.

                              <span>Every cmake project seems to get built in a new folder, and it can be anywhere. In the past, I would symlink the compile_commands.json to a path that clangd would automatically find, but this is a bit cumbersome. I&#x27;m looking for something that does not require a cmake mode in emacs to find the projects.
 It seems like there are a few different ways this could be done, but I figure someone has worked through this before. There are some open tickets in lsp-mode that discuss this.

 I&#x27;ve been at this Emacs stuff for a while, but only set up the Sponsors page now.
 At the moment I&#x27;m between employments, so on the odd chance the donations thing takes off (unlikely as it is), I could hold off a little longer before looking for the next job, giving that time to extra Emacs-related development.
 Please check it out, and maybe throw several bucks my way if you&#x27;re so inclined. It&#x27;s the thought that counts anyway.

download and install emacs-28.2-installer.exe from http://ftp.wayne.edu/gnu/emacs/windows/. Update path.

 Right now the basic configuration I copied from the readme works this way:
 I can find python-completion-at-point by typing py, then M-/, space, com, space, poi. 
  
 But I&#x27;d like corfu to let me find this by typing com, M-/, space, poi. I mean, without the prefix, just like on the image above.

                              <span>I usually don&#x27;t donate to open source projects, and I only supported Magit and Wikipedia in the recent past. I&#x27;ve only been using Emacs for roughly one year, but it has been a life changing choice. I am starting to feel that it&#x27;s my editor, If I miss something I write a package for it or customize it to my will. 
 What&#x27;s your approach to support open source software, and Emacs. Is it possible to donate to the core team, the ones that works with Emacs it self?
 Have a nice weekend Emacsers.

                              <span>Hi, 
 I created a small package that some might found useful. As disclaimer: I would first point out that I&#x27;m quite new to emacs-lisp so there might be ways of doing some of this much better and much more efficient. 
 But it serves the purpose (for me at least) , I use it to create libs header and flags to my org-source blocks, using conan in the background.

 Anyway, if anyone finds it useful or have any ideas of improvement don&#x27;t hesitate to tell me.

 I&#x27;ve tried running with emacs -q and it also hangs.
 Does anyone know how to fix this?
 My package-archive variable, when running with -q, is:

                              <span>Lsp-bridge have a powerful remote code completion feature that does not rely on tramp. It comes with the following advantages: high-performance file synchronization, ssh tunnel for bidirectional communication, and server-side no need to install Emacs. More technical details are in here .
 ​
 https://preview.redd.it/ap2fhnlme1ra1.png?width&#x3D;2500&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;ff898954cd787a11e436f7ffe62771b59cb3d2b5
 Other highlight features of lsp-bridge compared to other Emacs lsp clients:
  
Fully asynchronous and high-performance: computationally intensive parts are all implemented in Python using asynchronous methods.
 
Out-of-the-box support for multiple LSP servers: lsp-bridge supports various LSP servers for code completion, diagnostics and fixes.
 
Seamless integration of multiple completion backends: lsp-bridge has a completion framework called ACM, which integrates lsp, TabNine, template, file path, English, Tailwind, Citre, and other completion backends. All these backends are seamless integrated.
 
 ​
 After 11 months of continuous improvement and refinement with over 84 contributors, lsp-bridge is more stable and functional than previous version.
 Welcome to try lsp-bridge.

                              <span>Is there a way with built-in project management to include multiple repositories in a single project?
 I have a project with two components each in its own git repo but I&#x27;d like to be able to jump back and forth between files with e.g. project-find-file like they were a single project.

 I have this problem where I working and by some mistake, I failed to identify when this happened, I get new frame with help. It is very annoying and actually I can&#x27;t close it because it crash mi whole emacs for some reason. Since I&#x27;m not using emacs frames at all (at least not to show multiple buffers at once, maybe some completion tolling does use it, maybe company?), is there way to prevent any opening of new frame in emacs globally? Are there any probable consequences to this?
 Thank you.

 I can&#x27;t find a way to do it without edit the data twice, first for the table, and then a csv file, any pointer to an example or a manual for this.

                              <span>I am trying to make a environment for developing JS, and I am having a lot of trouble installing eslint inside emacs. I can run it from the command line, but when I do M-x lsp-install-server eslint, i get the following error: LSP :: Server eslint install process failed with the following error message: (wrong-type-argument stringp nil). I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s something related to my lsp config itself, because I was able to install the ts-ls server perfectly, but my lsp config is the following:
  (use-package lsp-mode :straight t :init :commands lsp :hook ( ((typescript-mode js-mode) . lsp) (lsp-mode . lsp-enable-which-key-integration)) :bind (:map lsp-mode-map (&quot;TAB&quot; . completion-at-point))) (use-package lsp-ui :straight t :commands lsp-ui-mode) (use-package lsp-ivy :straight t :commands lsp-ivy-workspace-symbol) (use-package company-lsp :straight t :commands company-lsp) 
 Thanks in advance!
 ​
 Edit: I justo found out what was happening. Eslint comes inside a .zip file and it seems emacs was trying to use the program &quot;unzip&quot; to ... well, unzip it. I didn&#x27;t have unzip installed. So there it goes, if anyone has a similar problem, try installing unzip.

However, I seem to have some difficulty trying to get it to work. Here&#x27;s my emacs config layout:
 .emacs.d |-- auto.el |-- loaddefs.el |-- hooks.el |-- init.el |-- modes |-- java.el 
 And in auto.el, I have the following:
 (defun update-all-autoloads () &quot;IMPORTANT. Updates autoloads.&quot; (interactive) (cd user-emacs-directory) (let ((generated-autoload-file (expand-file-name &quot;loaddefs.el&quot;))) (when (not (file-exists-p generated-autoload-file)) (with-current-buffer (find-file-noselect generated-autoload-file) (insert &quot;;;&quot;) (save-buffer))) (loaddefs-generate &#x27;(&quot;modes&quot; &quot;lisp&quot;))) )

 I want to write code that looks like

 (for [sub-expr (rest s-expr)]
 (set-font-face (first sub-expr) &#x27;my-fun-font)))
 ​
 and that highlights arg1, arg2, .... argn
 ​
 so far all of the syntax highlighters I&#x27;ve seen rely on regexp rather than the underlying structure of the code. I want to roll my own syntax highlighter for clojure, but hopefully avoid playing regexp golf :D

 Using org-html-export-as-html seems to me that the filename is ignored. It is not rendered somewhere.
 From the users perspective where would you like to have that filename in the resulting HTML output? Here some ideas:
  
Display it in a tooltip (
).
 Render it in the upper right corner of the resulting codebox.
 Render it as a top/bottom caption.
  
Something else?

                              <span>I&#x27;m part of a team working on multiple interconnected haskell command line tools. As our tools are growing we&#x27;re slowly running into two issues: 1. Compile times are getting longer and 2. projects are getting out of sync. I hope you can give me some advice on how we should arrange things conceptually and technically to mitigate both issues. The question is not unrelated to this one here, but involves a second library.
 Here are some core infos on our setup:
  
In one repo we have a library A with two main executables Ex1 and Ex2.
 Another repo provides a library B with an executable Ex3.
 Everything is build with stack.
 Library A defines core data types and logic and is needed for Library B and all executables.
 Ex1 makes use of almost all features of A. The subcommands of Ex1 fully live …</span>

                              <span>It&#x27;s Thursday, and here we go again. I&#x27;m telling you what I&#x27;m working on to inspire you to share what you are working on. The best way to grow and learn is to step outside your comfort zone and participate. Your unique perspective and contributions are valuable and can help spark new ideas.
Although I&#x27;ve spent less time zettelkasting this week, I&#x27;ve still captured a few notes and started to build an economics structure hub.  My morning practice has shifted, and it is more free writing focused than it has been. This currently feels like progress, but time will tell. Tonight my creative energy is low, and rather than resist, I will be okay with it and rest.

                              <span>SimpleX Chat is probably the first ever Haskell app that works on Android ARMv7a 32 bit CPUs. Huge thanks to u/angerman who made it possible. Now that Haskell GHC compiler support ARMv7a, I hope there will be other apps, not only on Android, that benefit from it!
 New in v4.6:
  
support for Android 8+ and ARMv7a devices!
 hidden profiles – you can hide your private chat profiles with a password.
 group / community moderation.
 improved audio/video calls - fully re-implemented in iOS to use native iOS interface for calls and improved on Android.
 reduced battery usage, particularly when sending the messages to large groups.
  
Also, since v4.5 release we added Dutch, Czech, Chinese and Spanish interface languages, thanks to the users&#x27; community and Weblate!
 See more details in this post and download the apps via the links here.
 v4.6.1-beta.0 is also already available on GitHub and in our F-Droid repo - it includes experimental support for sending files up to 1gb via XFTP (it can be enabled via Developer tools) and many fixes.
 Please ask any questions about SimpleX Chat in the comments! Some common questions:
 Why user IDs are bad for privacy?
 How SimpleX delivers messages without user profile IDs?
 How SimpleX is different from Session, Matrix, Signal, etc.?
 SimpleX Chat security was assessed by Trail of Bits in November 2022.

                              <span>Recently I&#x27;ve asked myself how much of linear logic can be done in linear Haskell. I&#x27;m pretty sure that pure Linear Haskell isn&#x27;t enough. Let&#x27;s define:
 type Not a &#x3D; a %1 -&gt; () 
 This is the type of &quot;obligations for an a&quot; or &quot;slots for an a&quot;. I don&#x27;t think that there&#x27;s a way to implement Not (Not a) %1 -&gt; a, which is a requirement for linear logic. But looking through the linear-base library I found the following function:
 alloc :: Int -&gt; (DArray a %1 -&gt; ()) %1 -&gt; Vector a 
 In other words: &quot;Give me a way to fill an array with n elements and I&#x27;ll give you an array with n elements&quot;. This means that alloc 1 is already what we want!!! linear-base (maybe accidentally?) implies all of linear logic. Of course it&#x27;s a bit cheaty, alloc uses unsafeDupablePerformIO internally, but if the linear-base authors have decided that it&#x27;s fine I&#x27;m okay with it.
 I wrote up some basics of linear logic in Haskell (over here). Using double negation you can implement both of the missing monoidal operations (&amp; and ⅋/Par, the other two already exist: ⊗&#x3D;(,) ⊕&#x3D;Either) and interpreting Ur as ! also gives you ?. I&#x27;ve also done some laws including (iso-)mix and both exponential isomorphisms.
 I think it&#x27;s a bit surprising that it&#x27;s actually doable. I would have expected that it&#x27;s either already done or deliberately impossible. But I haven&#x27;t found anyone talking about doing it, the closest is this library by Edward Kmett which uses some magic to embed linear logic inside of linear Haskell. Unlike this approach I don&#x27;t think it gives you linear logic for all of LinHask, but only for some types.

                              <span>I would like to set the default evil state of term-mode to normal (for reasons outside the scope but related to evil leader keys), and I use ansi-term.
 When I have the line
 (evil-set-initial-state &#x27;term-mode &#x27;normal) 
 in my init.el, emacs freaks out on startup (but no errors) and what I get is emacs inside of emacs, which is entirely unusable. I suspect this is because term-mode is actually invoked during setup or something, but I could equally just be making a mistake.
 If this won&#x27;t work, what is the best way to achieve this behavior (ansi-term starting in the normal state for evil)? Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I’ve been using Vim for 20 years. Tried Emacs once, but it was so long ago I can’t even remember my impression.
 I’d like to try DOOM for 6-8 weeks to get a taste, but I couldn’t care less about org mode or magit or integrated browsers. I just want to go about my usual Python workflow: Copilot, pyright, testing, pre-config, grepping, linting, file switching, … the usual suspects. 
 I tried VSCode and walked away because the polish didn’t seem to be there for a lot of the plug-ins. On the Vim side, we’ve got all the tpope stuff that has been around for years and is mature and nuanced.
 I judge an editor by how it performs on things I do 100s of times a day. What should I look for in Emacs?

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to use vertico-multiform do create key bindings on the minibuffer-local-map specific to certain commands. Some hints by minad suggest it should be possible (e.g. https://github.com/minad/vertico/issues/321#issuecomment-1399902077 and https://github.com/minad/vertico/issues/320#issuecomment-1399261079), but I can&#x27;t seem to make them work. I tried those, and also with local-set-key, but no bliss.
 For the sake of concreteness, here is one actual case I&#x27;m trying to have one such binding: I&#x27;d like to bind &#x27; in the minibuffer for find-file and related commands which takes me to consult-find at the current location. So I have: 
 (defun gb/consult-find-for-minibuffer () &quot;Search file with find, enter the result in the minibuffer.&quot; (interactive) (let ((dir (file-name-directory (minibuffer-contents))) (file (file-name-nondirectory (minibuffer-contents)))) (gb/minibuffer-quit-and-run (funcall-interactively &#x27;consult-find dir file)))) ;; http://oremacs.com/2015/07/16/callback-quit/ ;; But this version comes from Ivy. (defmacro gb/minibuffer-quit-and-run (&amp;rest body) &quot;Quit the minibuffer and run BODY afterwards.&quot; (declare (indent 0)) &#x60;(progn (put &#x27;quit &#x27;error-message &quot;&quot;) (run-at-time nil nil (lambda () (put &#x27;quit &#x27;error-message &quot;Quit&quot;) (with-demoted-errors &quot;Error: %S&quot; ,@body))) (abort-recursive-edit))) 
 I currently bind this with:
 (define-key minibuffer-local-map (kbd &quot;&#x27;&quot;) &#x60;(menu-item &quot;&quot; gb/consult-find-for-minibuffer :filter ,(lambda (cmd) (when (memq current-minibuffer-command &#x27;(find-file find-file-other-window find-file-other-frame project-find-file)) cmd)))) 
 But I find this procedure somewhat clumsy, and would prefer to use vertico-multiform for that.
 So, is there a general procedure to use vertico-multiform to make a keybinding on the minibuffer-local-map for specific commands?

                              <span>Hey there,
 I&#x27;ve been trying to use &#x27;tmux&#x27; in &#x27;vterm&#x27; to manage some terminals, but the tricky part I have found is to grab buffer text from split terminals that are split horizontally (aka one top terminal and one bottom terminal) for log trackback stuff.
 That being said, does anyone know any good Emacs packages could open up a buffer to quickly switch between available &#x27;vterm&#x27; instances on the fly? This alone would be super helpful to me since I usually have to run at least two separate &#x27;vterm&#x27; terminals for web dev stuff for Ruby On Rails and React (aka on terminal for &#x27;npm start&#x27;, and one terminal for &#x27;rails s&#x27; for local development).
 Thanks so much!

                              <span>I am still in the process of befriending calc. One of the things I have a hard time liking is that when I enter a multiplication like &quot;a * b&quot; what calc shows on the stack becomes &quot;a b&quot;. I could care less how it looks on the stack but I do care that this is also how it looks when I yank it into an org mode buffer. I tried it with and without no-simplification and also with latex Mode but it doesn&#x27;t do anything different. Ideally I would like it to display &quot;*&quot; when in normal mode and \cdot when in latex mode.
 I am on Emacs 28.2 and also tried this with emacs -q.
 Is this intended behavior? Is there an option or a way for me to get my wishes granted?

                              <span>Issue: https://codeberg.org/akib/emacs-eat/issues/35
 Some users asked for Windows support in Eat, so I&#x27;m considering it. I don&#x27;t use Windows, so I need help from someone who is familiar with Windows.
 After searching the internet, I found that Alacritty supports Windows. I discovered that the TERM in the Alacritty terminal on Windows is xterm-256color, instead of alacritty or alacritty-direct. I also discovered that there&#x27;s also a dumb TERM environment variable in Windows, but no TERMINFO environment.
 Now, my questions are:
  
Does Windows have any mechanism to inform the program about the terminal&#x27;s capabilities (like terminfo in Unix-like systems), or is it fixed to the XTerm escape sequences?
 
Why M-x eat and M-x term says Spawning child process: Invalid argument on Windows?
 
Does set-process-window-size work in Windows?
 
Is it possible to support Windows only using Emacs Lisp (without any C code)?

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I am excited to announce my new Emacs package, ancilla.el, which is my first attempt at writing a bigger Elisp project than just customizing my own stuff. The motivation behind this package was the recent discontinuation of OpenAI&#x27;s Codex API, which caused another Emacs package, codex-completion, to stop working. I wanted to improve the AI-coding interaction and came up with some new ideas that I implemented in ancilla.el.
 I must admit that parts of the code were actually written with the help of ChatGPT and GPT-4, which was a really weird and fun experience.
 Thank you for your attention and I hope you give ancilla.el a try!

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been working with emacs-jupyter for a few days now. when i output a pandas dataframe with a lot of columns (around 24), the resulting org table is horizontally too long. how do you suggest i handle/navigate these kind of tables?
 i normally use visal-line-mode and olivetti-mode, but had to turn them off to get a better view of the table.
  
I&#x27;ve thought of binding some keys to jump to the next/prev column.
 I&#x27;ve looked at https://github.com/misohena/phscroll, but was wondering if there are other approaches
 as i was writing this post, i noticed org-end-of-line provides nice horizontal navigation (it kind of goes to the end of the visible line, not the literal end). however, org-beginning-of-line goes straight to the beginning of the line

                              <span>Had a curious psychological reaction to using Emacs for pretty much everything on a minimal linux desktop over about six months. I think it was to to with the plain text and almost complete lack of graphical interest. I just started feeling really flat emotionally. Like the screen I was looking at was utterly uninteresting.
 So I went back to windows for a while, using VS Code, a graphical git client and so on and strangely there I felt the opposite, like the graphical density with so much on the screen was almost overwhelming after months without all that graphical clutter. That faded over a week or two and I found myself adding a few non-Emacs apps with more graphical elements alongside Emacs to mix things up.
 This was quite strange, I learned to program using VT terminals and actually worked in places where my daily computer was a vax system with a VT terminal and never felt anything like this.
 I&#x27;m not intending this as a slight against Emacs, but I found it was interesting that my brain just started to shut down a little due to the lack of stimulating stuff on the screen. I was wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience? I know some of you guys pretty much live in Emacs 24/7, do you find it overwhelming to use a very graphical application after that? Or people who do the opposite and work in a graphically intensive environment a lot, do you find it relaxing, or boring, or have any other reaction to switching to Emacs (or any other plain text environment) afterwards?

                              <span>I&#x27;m using emacs as my java ide for class at the moment, and while it&#x27;s mostly fine, using javafx is a bit of a bother because emacs doesn&#x27;t recognize any of the javafx libraries. I can write working code just fine, it&#x27;s just the syntax checking will highlight everything that isn&#x27;t from the standard library and clutters my screen with fake errors. Is there a fix for this?

                              <span>Ahoy, Emacs aficionados! 🎩
 I come to you with a tale of woe, for I have been both blessed and cursed by the Emacs wizardry. As my fingers dance across the keyboard, conjuring powerful Emacs incantations with ease, I find myself unable to enjoy the mundane GUIs and simple apps that litter the software landscape. 🧹🖱️
 You see, dear friends, Emacs has spoiled me with its boundless customization, incredible extensibility, and mind-bending keybindings. Now, I dread the moments when I must use the pedestrian applications my company forces upon me. Oh, how I long for the sweet embrace of Emacs in those dark hours! 💔🕰️
 In my despair, I turn to you, my fellow Emacs magicians, for camaraderie and counsel:
  
How do you cope when the world demands you to use lesser tools? 🛠️😢
 Are there secret spells to imbue these uninspired apps with even a fraction of Emacs&#x27; power? 🔮✨
 Can we petition the powers that be to make Emacs the one true editor, unifying the world in a harmonious symphony of keystrokes? 🌍🎼
  
I eagerly await your wisdom and insights. In the meantime, I&#x27;ll be huddled in the corner, clutching my Emacs manual like a treasured tome, dreaming of the day when all software is as magically magnificent as our beloved editor. 📖💭
 Yours in Emacs enchantment, 🧙‍♂️

                              <span>I&#x27;m experiencing an issue with org-publish creating  tags instead of the markup I&#x27;ve specified and wondered if someone had an idea as to what could be the issue?
 First up I use a basic bash script to launch a new emacs session, without my config getting in the way:
 ./build.sh:
 #!/bin/bash start_web_server() { emacs -Q --script org2web.el &amp; EMACS_PID&#x3D;$! echo &quot;Web server started with PID: $EMACS_PID&quot; } stop_web_server() { echo &quot;Stopping web server with PID: $EMACS_PID&quot; kill $EMACS_PID } trap stop_web_server INT start_web_server wait 
 which, in turn, calls:
 ./org2web.el:

                              <span>Hey folks, I&#x27;ve been trying to create a function that can be called to load a CSV into a string array, but I&#x27;m having trouble returning it outside the array once it&#x27;s captured. Here&#x27;s the code I have so far:
 object CSVImport extends App: println(&quot;Running CSVImport&quot;) def run(path: String) /* : Array[String] */ &#x3D; val bufferedSource &#x3D; io.Source.fromResource(path) //val outputArr &#x3D; new Array[String](5) for line &lt;- bufferedSource.getLines.drop(1) do val outputArr &#x3D; line.split(&quot;,&quot;).map(_.trim) bufferedSource.close //outputArr 
 I&#x27;m attempting to call it in Main:
 @main def Main() &#x3D; val arrayOutput &#x3D; CSVImport.run(csvPath) 
 I&#x27;ve tried to make the Object Def output to an Array[String], however I&#x27;ve been struggling with making the output work. When I execute the code as-is with the extra bits commented out, I get a nice Scala array which I can call individual columns using println(s&quot;${flightData(1)}&quot;), but when I uncomment the extra code the output becomes a mess, I think due to the Array format being from java. I get the output [Ljava.lang.String;@35f983a6.
 My question is, is it possible to export the outputArr without converting it to a java format, so I can keep the legibility and pass it through to other functions? and if not, how can I format the gibberish output into something usable?

Algebraic Path Finding by Iago Leal de Freitas
There’s something magical about polymorphic algorithms. Really, isn’t it awesome to write a piece of code once and then just tweak the meaning of some inputs to solve another seemly unrelated problem?

I have a very quick (and embarrassing) question about keyboard shortcut function in The Archive. I work in split screen mode all the time (PDF left and The Archive right) and need to fold the Sidebar constantly to have more space so the writing doesn&#x27;t look crammed. However, using the mouse to fold the Sidebar away is slow and cumbersome, and the keyboard shortcut is written as ^+command+S.  What key does ^ imply me to press? I cannot get the shortcut to work, which is very annoying and embarrassing at the same time.
Please help!</span>

 (global-set-key &quot;\C-w&quot; &#x27;backward-kill-word)
 For some reason sometimes when I type this combination my Emacs freezes. If I hit C-g something quits and the backward-kill-word command finishes. I can&#x27;t figure out exactly when it happens because sometimes it just works fine. 
 What is a good approach to debug this? How can I find out what the something is that is freezing my Emacs?

                              <span>I recently picked up a new MacBook, and trying to get emacs setup. There’s one issue I’m running into. I can’t get ledger mode. The only information I can find says to install the package, but it’s not showing up in my package list. Is there something I’m missing? Or some way to install manually? I had it running fine on my old intel air, but can’t remember how I did it.

                              <span>For some environments you have no choice to use emacs in a terminal ... 
 1) Can you see breakpoints in terminal mode with realgud:gdb and gdb ? 
 2) Can you evaluate variables in terminal mode ? 
 For me breakpoints are not visibles
 To evaluate with gdb it is answered file is &quot;read only&quot;
 To evaluate with realgud-gdb is there another way that ask in gdb prompt ? 
 How do you do for 1) and 2) ? or you always prefer another tool that emacs ?

 I am using mac os and I have looked online to fixing this dvipng problem but none of those solutions were not able to fix the above issue on my macbook. I am also wondering if this is because my org-roam directory is on onedrive. It seems when I double click the file from the directory in my mac it opens up that file in emacs without error. But when I do C-c n f it gives me the error.

                              <span>I have seen there are quite a few options, hoping someone can suggest one which works well as a coding assistant.
 Think along the lines of asking questions about the selected region, like what does this error mean can you convert this to a different format for me, can you generate some code todo this.
 Been using it to convert sql to honeysql and it can do a pretty good job saving me converting it currently doing it in browser but would like some closer integration.

 THE GOAL:
 launch an emacs web server, in a new session, to serve the files contained within the &quot;public&quot; directory, which is located in same directory my script is called.
 THE APPROACH:
 use a basic shell script (./launch.sh) to run an emacs-lisp build script (./build.el) that uses org-publish to publish my org files to HTML files in the (.public/) directory, mentioned earlier, then serve them in a web server written in emacs-lisp.. amazing.
 THE CODE:
 ./launch.sh
  #!/bin/bash emacs -Q --script build.el &amp; 
 ./build.…</span>

 I tried something like what is below...
 #+name: cor:1 #+begin_corollary This is my corollary. #+end_corollary [[cor:1]] 
 But in the pdf, it shows up as ??. I am not really sure what is going on. TOCs for my documents are no longer appearing as well, so it could be that they are related. Any help is appreciated.

 The recentf command gives me listings like this, hiding the useful bit (the actual filename) behind the too-long path listing:
 ~/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/highweirdness/essays/ecstas... -rw------ 17k (etc)
 Ugh! What I want is to see:
 Dropbox/highweirdness/essays/fullfilename.mdown (etc)
 In God&#x27;s name, how do I customize recentf output to collapse e.g. ~/Library/CloudStorage/ ?
 Thanks in advance.

I also heard about leaf, which is a (package configurator/loader) alternative to use-package? According to the elpaca documentation, one is supposed to use use-package like this:
 ;; Install use-package support (elpaca elpaca-use-package ;; Enable :elpaca use-package keyword. (elpaca-use-package-mode) ;; Assume :elpaca t unless otherwise specified. (setq elpaca-use-package-by-default t)) ;; Block until current queue processed. (elpaca-wait) ;; Expands to: (elpaca evil (use-package evil :demand t)) (use-package evil :demand t)

 Any input is appreciated.

 For example consider the Haskell package: GlossI would like to import a function called to display in the Gloss package.

 Hello everyone! 
 I have a challenge for you :) I&#x27;m new to Haskell and I&#x27;m looking for a solution to this problem...
 I have this given datatype for a QuadTree (trees whose internal nodes have 4 children)
 data QT a &#x3D; C a | Q (QT a) (QT a) (QT a) (QT a) 
 Which is used to represent 2^n x 2^n matrices. 
 For example the matrix:

                              <span>Hi all,
 I was wondering a while ago how Haskell &quot;decides&quot; if a given recursive type definition should be given by the least or greatest fixed point. In particular, for a given type equation there are two canonical solutions given by the least and greatest fixed point respectively. But certain types &quot;feel&quot; more like one than the other. For example, lists or Peano numerals &quot;feel&quot; like least fixed points, whereas streams &quot;feel&quot; like greatest fixed points (and in fact the LFP solution is just the empty type, ignoring bottom). So then how does Haskell decide which form to take if the user never specifies?
 So this got me thinking: are Haskell recursive datatypes always given by greatest fixed points? This does seem to make sense mathematically, as for example gfp X. (1 + X) would give the naturals plus a point at infinity, and this translates in Haskell to
 data Nat &#x3D; Z | S Nat zero &#x3D; Z one &#x3D; S Z two &#x3D; S (S Z) ... inf &#x3D; S inf 
 (i.e. we can implement a term representing an infinite stack of successors)
 So is this actually the case? Does Haskell justify recursive datatypes by greatest fixed points? Or maybe does it not really care about any mathematical justification (i.e. you just get what you get by making a tagged union and putting pointers to the right types)?

 I wrote very basic introductory series on Cats Effect 3 especially for newbies to effect system. Here is the link https://yadukrishnan.live/series/cats-effect
 Please do let me know if this is helpful for anyone.
 This was not intended for people already familiar with the CE, Monix, ZIO etc, but for people who are trying to get started with CE-3.

                              <span>I have a capture of &quot;file+datetree&quot; that I update daily but the file is getting too large and it is slow to open and parse. I was thinking about breaking this existing file up into many pieces by date into it&#x27;s own subdirectory and naming the files by date. Maybe having a file by day, though I could possibly get away with the files still being small enough by having a file per-month versus per-day.
 As such I need new captures to go to a new file (automatically naming file like YYYY-MM-DD__suffix.org) if it is a new day and then continue to put additional captures to that new file throughout that day. Then it would begin the cycle again for the next day.
 I believe this is beyond the existing functionality of org-capture from my research so maybe there is package out there that works like this or maybe I just have to figure out how to code an e-lisp solution if not?

                              <span>Is there any way to create a new TODO item in elisp?
 Scenario:
 I change the state of a todo item from TODO to WAITING FOR EXPORT. When that happens I want to automatically create a new todo item in my todos.org file, that has the title RUN EXPORT with a scheduled date for tomorrow. 
 This fits my workflow perfectly and is a function that I&#x27;ve always wanted from other todo list apps :)

 But running the code block by having the cursor inside the block and pressing C-c C-c I get the error/message from the *Org-Babel Error Output* buffer saying:
  
/bin/bash: python: command not found
  
With no output being produced not matter the code I use. I assume my config is still poorly setup since the error is referencing /bin/bash for some reason?

 Installing emacs-nox (using yum) on Centos-7 (on an old AMD PC), It is also installing trousers package (tss). Question is why?
 Thanks!

 This moring &quot;Po says&quot;:
  
Would people please test the latest prebuilts at: 
 https://sourceforge.net/projects/android-ports-for-gnu-emacs/ 
 and verify that they indeed work correctly on all of these newer
 systems? 
  
There is also now an emacs-30 folder on GNU alpha. Only one build (&quot;master&quot; at revision 28a9438169f) is posted, so far, plus initial dependencies and dependency source archives.

 So, how should a package author advertise their Emacs package while not overdoing it? Extra points if possible without using proprietary software and unethical platforms.
 [I have asked the same question on Fediverse, and someone sent me here to this subreddit.)

                              <span>What I am about to say is best reproduced with an empty configuration. So if you want to reproduce this issue just back up your ~/.emacs.d and any other init files to a different folder and try this.
  
First I run M-x customize.
 In the search box I search font-lock-comment-face. The default color is shown as Firebrick and the default state is STANDARD.
 Change the color to green.
 Then Apply and Save. The state becomes SAVED and set.
 Check ~/.emacs. It has this code inserted: &#x27;(font-lock-comment-face ((t (:foreground &quot;green&quot;))))
 Now Revert &gt; Erase Customizations. The face is now -- Empty face --. The state becomes EDITED, shown value does not take effect until you set or save it. (This is where I have trouble. Why is the state not STANDARD again? Why is the face not Firebrick again?)
 Then Apply and Save. 
 Check ~/.emacs. It has &#x27;(font-lock-comment-face ((t nil))).
 The comments are now black in my code.
  
Why does &quot;Erase customizations&quot; remove the default value? Why does it not revert the customization to standard state as mentioned in Emacs documentation?

 I&#x27;m a bit able to read and write Japanese and know how inputsystems like IMEI work. I never used Japanese as input or output in Emacs. So I&#x27;m not sure why it is relevant for Emacs.

                              <span>So I was just going through my older journal entries and found the following entry: 
  
I do not think that AI is the right choice for a lot of our things if the underlying problem of freeing humans always remains. It makes more sense to me to be a part of a group where the focus is on freeing our time through removal of shackling of our time than to build AIs that feed the capitalist to extract more wealth from underpaying humans and from keeping them subjugated to 8 hour work days no matter how advanced the AI is. Eventually, the AI is going to be a prime worker for the capitalist than for the betterment of humanity. 
 I refuse to be a part of this process and that is why I am choosing not to get into those domains in any which way. 
 Emacs therefore remains my stronghold that I would like to curate and build my freedom from. If one cannot free themselves from 8 hour senselessness, then they can build stuff to free up time and work from home and do other more productive and happiness, mental peace bringing things. Productive here means that doing what I really want to do and doing it rather than producing as much value for the capitalist who would rather discard me if there was a more productive person or an AI.
  
This reminded me about one of the prime reasons why I wanted to use Emacs - it&#x27;s extensibility that enabled me to build shortcuts and workflows that help me with shaving off sufficient amount of time which I spent on repetitive tasks. The trick however is to not to be vocal about your efficiency to your bosses because the time saved will be used against you to staff you with more work whether you want it or not. 
 Go use the time saved to spend with your loved ones, yourself, exercise, learn something, do nothing or even just calm and rest. It&#x27;s your reclaimed time. 
 Who else does this?

 What is the purpose of these lines? I notice it always matches the name of the file, but everything seems to work just fine without it.

                              <span>I&#x27;m not sure if chatgpt these days is powered by GPT-4 or not, but it&#x27;s showing improvements in some areas compared to where it was a few months ago. Nowadays, if I ask it &quot;Why do sharks eat elephant eggs&quot; it doesn&#x27;t tell me that sharks rarely get a chance to do so cause elephant eggs are so large and on land, but rather that elephants do not lay eggs.
 Today I decided to test it by asking how one would use Scala 3 macros to get the types of the inputs and outputs of a method. It had some decent suggestions to do that for someone that is new to macros, but a lot of its answer was false, suggesting people use something called QuotesContext, not recognizing properly what extension methods are available for the Symbol type, and worst of all, trying to splice Type values into an Expr.
 If they can manage to get chatgpt to actually tell the truth consistently (like saying &quot;I don&#x27;t know how to do that&quot; rather than just lying) I think it will be a nice resource for discovering how to do stuff you don&#x27;t currently know how to do. Sadly, it&#x27;s still got a nasty habit of making stuff up.

                              <span>Is it possible to treat headings with TODO keywords fundamentally different in the LaTeX export? I&#x27;d like to not treat them as headings, in a normal document structure, but rather render them as insertion, interupting the document structure, but i still want to render normal headings as normal headings, which are part of the document structure.
 I&#x27;d prefer to do this using pandoc, but if there is an easy alternative, I&#x27;d happily take it.

                              <span>I often find myself realizing I want to convert a heading tree structure to a plain list, with checkboxes. And I find I have to do that by hand. The closest I have found in the docs to doing what I want is org-toggle-item, but at least the standard behavior doesn&#x27;t preserve the depth of the heading that you convert, and it also doesn&#x27;t work on a whole subtree, but instead just over a single item. 
 Why isn&#x27;t this a common enough use-case to be built-in functionality? How is this not something that everyone else wants all the time too?

                              <span>Hi all,
 I use Haskell as a hobbyist (Go at work) and have been learning it for some time now. After going through books like Get Programming with Haskell and Haskell in Depth and making some projects I want to delve deeper into the more advanced stuff available with the language an become proficient with it (usage of DataKinds, GADTs, HKTs and so on, even linear types).
 However, I&#x27;m finding it difficult to come with use cases for these features and examples where these features can be the most appropriate answer. I struggle to wrap my head around the concepts as they are exposed in Haskell in Depth for example. Of course I don&#x27;t blame the book, but I feel there wasn&#x27;t enough room in it for me to get the clear picture (as obviously there were many more things to cover in around 600 pages)…</span>

                              <span>I was introduced to Haskell by a friend a few years ago (he has a PhD in Automatic Theorem Proving). I tried learning, but got bogged down by the mathematical intricacies.
 Fast forward a few years and I went to a couple sessions about category theory by Bartosz Milewski (in person), but it still seemed way over my head.
 I&#x27;ve been a software engineer for ~6 years now, and have always been interested in the concept of formal verification, &quot;proof-based&quot; correctness, etc, and Haskell always seems to come up. How do I learn Haskell properly this time? The &quot;Learn you a Haskell for Great Good!&quot; didn&#x27;t quite resonate with me, so open to suggestions!

 Progress so far: * CentOS 7 yum install ghc provides 7.6, but ghc 9.0.2 requires ghc 8.8 to build (which requires 8.4, which requires 8.0, which requires 7.8, which can be built with 7.6) * Wasn&#x27;t able to figure out how to cross compile for this platform using this doc: https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/wikis/building/cross-compiling * Ubuntu bionic does provide ghc 8.0 with the same glibc version, which does work when copied into CentOS 7 * Building ghc 8.4 on CentOS 7 is now giving me &quot;C99-compatible compiler needed&quot;

                              <span>This question may be asked may times. Please give an other chance. I started playing around with Haskell for few weeks now. Slowly I am getting more interested towards it. I am programming for more than a decade. Much of my programming is around C#, Java &amp; JavaScript(Currently). I am exploring functional programming for few months now, just out of curiosity. Now am thinking to move my career towards new paradigm and projects.
 1. How big is job market for Haskell and which are the major industries? ( of course location is important, am currently based out of India), But generally.
  
Where Haskell stands against other functional programming languages like Scala, F# &amp; Clojure, in terms of usage in industry and which are those? 
 
Optimal learning path and projects to start with!
 
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Is there any source for haskell best practices? Or haskell tips/useful design patterns ? Although i have grasped the basics like monad transformers, existential types, type families, etc i feel as if i still need more experience and knowledge.
 for instance when should i use state? and when doing so what are the considerations when choosing between IOrefs, MVars , STM or the state monad?
 Besides the libraries in the CLC which are the &quot;default&quot; libraries for a certain topic? For instance for xml there are 3 libraries, i have many questions in this style/topic and feel that many others may as well have them.

                              <span>I&#x27;m working through Bruce Tate&#x27;s &quot;7 Languages in 7 Weeks&quot; and need to establish a GHC 6.12.1 environment, or something pretty similar. I understand this is not the latest Haskell compiler - I intentionally want to match versions and work through specific examples, that are over a decade old. My goal is to work through the exercises as Bruce, the author, intended. 
 Are there any pre-built VMs, or community resources for easy-installations for older versions? I tried asdf and the version of Haskell was just too old to get the right pieces together for compilation.

                              <span>Information
  
Overview: Khoj now exposes a chat interface to your second brain. Uses GPT models by OpenAI.
 Background: I&#x27;d posted about Khoj a few months ago. Since then khoj.el has become available on MELPA, gotten a Chat interface and can automatically set up the backend python package. Thought I&#x27;d provide an update for folks to try it out.
 Chat Features 
 Faster answers: Find answers faster, with less effort than search. No need to manually scan through your notes to find answer
 Iterative discovery: Iteratively explore and (re-)discover your notes using multi-turn conversations
 Creative assistance: Smoothly weave answers retrieval with content generation
 
  
Quickstart:
  
M-x package-install khoj
 M-x eval-expression RET (setq khoj-openai-api-key &quot;YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY&quot;)
 M-x khoj RET c via transient
  
See readme for proper setup instructions
 Warning: Your query and notes in search results are sent to OpenAI for ChatGPT to respond.

I then end up with a file that should be in the package com.exmaple.bar with the statement package com.example.foo. Is there an lsp-java command to fix the package statement, assuming that the directory is correct? 
 I can write something that searches for the package statement and checks it against the directory, but if the code already exists, I&#x27;d rather just use it. And it&#x27;s probably been checked against some corner cases that I&#x27;m initially going to miss (like if there is no package statement at all).

As far as I understand, Tree Sitter is now built-into Emacs 29 and above as treesit (https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/master/admin/notes/tree-sitter/starter-guide), which makes tree-sitter.el obsolete. There is also this package https://github.com/renzmann/treesit-auto which seems to handle the installation, mapping and activation of the language modes.
 But what I don&#x27;t understand is, how do I activate syntax hightlighing with treesit, without having tree-sitter-hl-mode? Is this done automatically once the major mode for a given language supports Tree Sitter? With the help of treesit-auto?

                              <span>Hi I have created the below script with the intention of allowing me to have certain tasks recur on set days. I am sick of having multiple Task &#x27;A&#x27;s because they need to be executed on Monday, Wednesday, Saturday. However I am having an issue with the final step. When I select the task and hit Enter, it automatically marks it as done but then provides me with a prompt to select the next day to re-occur. 
 Is there a better way to do this?

 (require &#x27;org) (defun org-select-recur-task () (let ((days-of-week &#x27;((&quot;Monday&quot; . &quot;1&quot;) (&quot;Tuesday&quot; . &quot;2&quot;) (&quot;Wednesday&quot; . &quot;3&quot;) (&quot;Thursday&quot; . &quot;4&quot;) (&quot;Friday&quot; . &quot;5&quot;) (&quot;Saturday&quot; . &quot;6&quot;) (&quot;Sunday&quot; . &quot;7&quot;))) (org-recur-days) (selected-day)) (while (not (string&#x3D; selected-day &quot;finish&quot;)) (setq selected-day (completing-read &quot;Select days to recur the task (type &#x27;finish&#x27; to complete): &quot; (append days-of-week &#x27;((&quot;finish&quot;)) ) nil t)) (when (and (not (string&#x3D; selected-day &quot;finish&quot;)) (not (string&#x3D; selected-day &quot;&quot;))) (let ((day-code (cdr (assoc selected-day days-of-week)))) (unless (member day-code org-recur-days) (setq org-recur-days (append org-recur-days (list day-code))))))) org-recur-days)) (defun org-recur-setup () (interactive) (let* ((org-recur-days (org-select-recur-task)) (recurring-days (concat &quot;+&quot; (string-join org-recur-days &quot;,&quot;) &quot;d&quot;)) (current-time (format-time-string &quot;%Y-%m-%d %a&quot;))) (end-of-line) (newline) (insert (format &quot;DEADLINE: &quot; current-time recurring-days)) (org-deadline-warning-days 0))) (define-key org-mode-map (kbd &quot;C-c r&quot;) &#x27;org-recur-setup) (defun org-renew-recurring-task () (when (string&#x3D; org-state &quot;DONE&quot;) (org-deadline nil) (org-schedule &#x27;(4)))) (add-hook &#x27;org-after-todo-state-change-hook &#x27;org-renew-recurring-task)

 What is this for? It is off by default. Do I need it?
 I like to run emacs as a daemon. But why is systemd useful for that?

                              <span>I have a couple of large hydras, e.g., for smartparens, and I occasionally forget a key, but I vaguely remember the name, and skimming through a list is slower than completions.
 Sacha Chua has solved this: https://sachachua.com/blog/2021/04/emacs-hydra-allow-completion-when-i-can-t-remember-the-command-name/
 Except, the binding to tab in the hydra-base-map doesn&#x27;t work, I can&#x27;t figure out why. The my/hydra-execute-extended function works great though, if you invoke it after quitting hydra.
 Any ideas how to fix the binding?
 P.S. Huge thanks to Sacha, I learned a lot about emacs through her blog.

 But how can I investigate such crashes?
 I&#x27;m using Emacs29 as daemon in (SSH) terminal. There is not error or debug output. It just disappears.
 What can I do to improve the output?

 It is working but slow in some situations.
 Are there improvements between 27 and 29 that could possible improve the performance of Emacs use?

 Reading up, it seemed ispell using Hunspell is what is mostly used, but also seems on windows you have to use a very old Hunspell version (1.3.x?) or have issues with it not finding dictionaries.
 Just trying to find a way to do spellchecking in English and my native language in Emacs without spending days setting up workarounds to make things work.

                              <span>My use case is that I don&#x27;t want to switch to terminal just for some simple commands (commands that I just need to execute then and leave) like docker-compose -f /very/long/path/to/my/docker-compose.yml up -d, I think I can just make use of the  compile function like:
  compile  docker-compose -f /very/long/path/to/my/docker-compose.yml up -d 
 and it actually works. However I still have many other simple commands, for now I can navigate up/down one-by-one to find the exactly command, but it would be more productive to have the list of history suggestions (just like fzf command history) when I press &quot; compile &quot;
 How can I do that in emacs?
 p/s: I use vertico.

                              <span>The problem with missing &quot;org-assert-version&quot; is known and described a lot. Also the workaround. But I don&#x27;t get it.
 I&#x27;m using Emacs 27 from Debian 11 repo. I removed the whole ~/.emacs.d/elpa folder just to be sure that org is &quot;deinstalled&quot;.
 The I created this el file
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; (require &#x27;package) (add-to-list &#x27;package-archives &#x27;(&quot;elpa&quot; . &quot;https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/&quot;))
 (package-refresh-contents) (package-install &#x27;org) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 And loaded it via emacs -Q -l x.el. But I got the message that org is already installed.
 I don&#x27;t know how to go along.
 Some background info: That Emacs 27 was working very well the last year. But I tried Emacs29, build it myself. But then I removed it (via sudo make uninstall and make distclean). Something must happens since then.

                              <span>I released the first version of the Jinx spell checker on GNU ELPA. Jinx aims to be efficient and unobtrusive, such that you can enable it always. Jinx provides the jinx-correct command to correct the nearest misspelling via completion or all misspellings in the whole buffer if invoked with a prefix argument.
 For performance reasons Jinx directly binds to the libenchant native library and lazily checks only the visible portion of the current buffer. Libenchant provides backends like Hunspell and Nuspell which also power the spell checking in word processors or browsers.
 I am interested in your feedback. The package is still young, so expect some rough edges. See the following links for more details.

                              <span>I know this must be in docs somewhere, but I haven&#x27;t been able to make it cooperate and it&#x27;s been driving me to cocoa puffs. 
 What causes org-roam to jump to the capture even when &#x60;:jump-to-capture nil&#x60; is set on the template it uses? https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam/issues/1292 (seems to be an issue others have run into)
 ​
 Looking through the code it appears a &#x60;:finalize&#x60; template keyword is used to potentially run either &#x60;org-roam-capture--finalize-find-file&#x60; or &#x60;org-roam-capture--finalize-insert-link&#x60; (it seems to be running the former now) 
 Everything I change in the template seems to be irrelevant. 
 At this point I&#x27;m thinking of just removing the entire org-roam-capture--finalize hook from org-capture-after-finalize-hook. And just resyncing the db separately?

                              <span>Hello, I recently started learning how to use Nix Os and I am running it on a LXC container in a Proxmox host. I was wondering whether anyone has a recommened way to set up a remote graphical emacsclient through x2go. I am willing to share my configuration details and other information necessary to get it working. I read through the post here:https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/8t461y/how_to_run_a_graphical_emacsclient_on_a_remote/ which covers the main steps, however, once I run the x2go client, It runs into a blank white screen. If I change the session type to XFCE I am able to see a desktop but I can&#x27;t interact with anything on the screen.

 Grab it here: https://github.com/djcb/mu/releases/tag/v1.10.0; For all details, see https://github.com/djcb/mu/blob/release/1.10/NEWS.org (and I&#x27;d recommend reading that before installing), but some highlights are:
 For mu4e:
  
mu4e now keeps track of _updates_ in your mail, compared to some baseline; in the bookmarks list you see e.g. 1(+1)/2 for a bookmark, which means that there was one new message since &#x27;baseline&#x27;. See the manual for details https://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/mu4e/Bookmarks-and-Maildirs.html

 I’d played with emacs before then, but I stuck with vim because I liked it’s keybindings more.
 I’m not trying to cause a war here, but do you think that users trying to replicate vim are missing out on anything?

                              <span>I&#x27;m coming from Obsidian to Emacs/org-mode and have a bunch of .md-files I have converted to .org with Pandoc. But all the links connecting my notes seem to be broken in org (which makes sense I guess, anyway whenever I click a link I get a messaage with &quot;No match - create this as a new heading? y or n&quot;). Is there a way to convert the md-files to org and at the same time keep the links and connections in my vault intact (I have a lot of notes so editing the links would take a looong time)?

                              <span>I am trying to switch to eshell from vterm+zsh and I find some of the user experience frustrating. For example, while pcomplete opens a new window for completion it does not switch to it automatically and it does not escape the spaces. This means that every time I have to add quotes myself or escape the spaces manually. I would also like pcomplete to be like orderless and vertico and allow me to select entries the same way.
 I am now using corfu with eshell and it is a bit less frustrating but it is still not smooth as much as zsh completion system is. For example, I have to press escape otherwise I cannot stop the corfu autocompletions once it is activated.
 So my questions are:
 ​
  
Is there a way to make pcomplete escape spaces and special characters when completing in eshell? Ideally I should not have to switch to the pcomplete window but it should be done automatically.
 Is there a way to use vertico and orderless, rather than pcomplete, or even in tandem with pcomplete? I would like my eshell experience to be as close to the rest of the Emacs.
 Is there any other suggestion or improvement that makes you life in eshell easier?
  
​
 Thank you very much.

                              <span>Hi,
 Just updated to the newest Emacs 29, with straight.el:  (use-package expand-region :straight (expand-region.el :type git :host github :repo &quot;magnars/expand-region.el&quot;) :bind ((&quot;M-e&quot; . er/expand-region)) ) 
 While this package used to work correctly on an early December 2022 snapshot of Emacs 29, currently it no longer seems to work correctly. As soon as I invoke the command er/expand-region, the entire document is selected instead of (sub)sections of an org document, or paragraphs in a text document.
 Did anyone encounter this issue?
 Bad
 PS: I encountered some other issues with this Emacs 29 version that could be fixed by just re-loading the top elisp file of a package (e.g., yasnippet), but this would not work here.

                              <span>Today I had to painfully go through each commit in a series of 10 that I was interested in re-wording. I marked a region on the Git history I was looking at and tried unsuccessfully to re-word all of them (each at the time), it is the commit under the pointer or nothing.
 The same happens when I want to remove commits. And I also don&#x27;t understand how to cherry-pick commits from one branch to another (I did learned about &quot;donate&quot; commits using Magit, which does what I want with a region of commits)
 How am I supposed to use these features from Magit? What am I doing wrong?

                              <span>A &quot;morgue file&quot; is a collection of notes, articles, and files kept by investigators or journalists for possible future use. Today, I have developed a morgue file that in my zettelkasten that collects items that I think might provide fodder for my fiction writing.
I write speculative fiction and so I track newspaper articles or reports that I think might serve as the germ of a story. Then, as part of my writing process, I&#x27;ll make a new (structure) note and include links to articles or pieces that might inspire pieces of my story (whether character, setting, or plot).
For example, I recently learned about Point Nemo, a &quot;spacecraft cemetery&quot; in the Pacific Ocean that is a &quot;pole of inaccessibility,&quot; the location farthest from any land. This was intriguing enough, so I did some more cursory reading and learned (among other things) that it is also a remarkably lifeless part of the ocean because it is so far from land. Also, in spite of not being officially identified as the &quot;pole of inaccessibility&quot; until 1992, Point Nemo is near where H.P. Lovecraft placed R&#x27;lyeh, the lost city where Cthulhu is imprisoned!
At any rate, I now have a cluster of notes about Point Nemo that is forming the gensis of a story about scavengers trying to salvage material in this remote location. The real-life details are helping me flesh out the skeleton of a plot and raising more questions for me to explore. (For example, I know next to nothing about what might be involved in this salvage operation, so I now have some more reading to do!)
I thought I&#x27;d share in case others are interested in using their zettelkasten to generate ideas for fiction, and to learn from others who might implement a similar practice. Do you have any other tips or advice? Pitfalls to avoid?</span>

But all the links connecting my notes seem to be broken in org (which makes sense I guess, anyway whenever I click a link I get a messaage with &quot;No match - create this as a new heading? y or n&quot;). Is there a way to convert the md-files to org and at the same time keep the links and connections in my vault intact (I have a lot of notes so editing the links would take a looong time)?

 Is there a way to set the debug buffer&#x27;s max height?

                              <span>Hi there,
 today I updated to the latest HEAD of the Emacs 29 branch. It looks like it broke several packages.
 First: yasnippet. When enabled via yas-global-mode it regularly causes errors like this:
 Debugger entered--Lisp error: (wrong-number-of-arguments # 2) vertico-exit(undo 0.5) yas--post-command-handler() 
 The second one is highlight-indent-guides. When enabled it throws errors like this:
 Error during redisplay: (jit-lock-function 1) signaled (wrong-number-of-arguments # 0) Error during redisplay: (jit-lock-function 1501) signaled (wrong-number-of-arguments # 0) Error during redisplay: (jit-lock-function 3001) signaled (wrong-number-of-arguments # 0) Error during redisplay: (jit-lock-function 2488) signaled (wrong-number-of-arguments # 0) Error during redisplay: (jit-lock-function 3988) signaled (void-function nil) 
 I can&#x27;t get a backtrace via toggle-debug-on-error, sorry :(
 It also looks like I can avoid these errors by disabling nativecomp: when setting this in early-init.el:
 (setq native-comp-jit-compilation-deny-list &#x27;(&quot;.*&quot;) native-comp-speed -1) 
 all errors are gone.
 Is this my fault?
 Best regards, CK

                              <span>I made a small package to add some actions to evil-mode using the new built-in tree sitter library. The package only works with Emacs 29 or greater. To activate, just run M-x evil-ts-mode. This was so easy to do, that it hardly merits a package. But perhaps it will be useful to someone. I use it mostly with python, but I&#x27;m guessing it should work OK with other languages.

                              <span>Windows &quot;snapshot&quot; binaries for emacs-29@64a2b0d36fe are uploading now and should be available from your fav GNU alpha FTP mirror shortly. 
 https://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/pretest/windows/emacs-29/?C&#x3D;M;O&#x3D;D 
 Notes:
 - I changed the file-naming convention with this version. Binary sets are now named to include the git revision short code instead of the date of build.
 - My build script seems to work gooder than ever b4 so I&#x27;ll probably start making these snapshots pretty aggressively, as I see commits to the Emacs 29 branch, during the final push to release of Emacs 29.1

                              <span>I&#x27;m having an issue with getting dired to show a folder on a remote server that is running zsh and MacOS. I have the fix in for my .zshrc file that has this line so that at least the login works:
 [[ $TERM &#x3D;&#x3D; &quot;dumb&quot; ]] &amp;&amp; unsetopt zle &amp;&amp; PS1&#x3D;&#x27;$ &#x27; &amp;&amp; return
 ​
 When remoting in, it will list files at the home directory, but when I try to switch into any folder remotely, I don&#x27;t see a directory listing.
 When looking at the Messages buffer, I do see this message: 
 Invalid face reference: dired-directory-face [72 times]. 
 Is it possible this is related, and is there a workaround?

                              <span>I am trying all of this in GUI Emacs (not terminal). I have defined the following key-binding:
 (global-set-key (kbd &quot;C-S-1&quot;) (lambda () (interactive) (message &quot;Hello&quot;))) 
 But if I press C-S-1 I get this error:
 C-! is undefined 
 I know that this works:
 (global-set-key (kbd &quot;C-!&quot;) (lambda () (interactive) (message &quot;Hey&quot;))) 
 Now on pressing C-! I do get the message &quot;Hey&quot;.
 But I want to know why my first key binding C-S-1 does not work?
 Note: I am not trying to solve any specific problem. So I am not looking for suggestions on how to &quot;solve&quot; the problem. There is nothing to solve. I am only trying to understand why C-S-1 does not work. Hopefully understanding this will teach me a thing or two about how Emacs key bindings.

                              <span>I setup revert mode like this in my init.el
  (setq global-auto-revert-mode 1) (setq auto-revert-use-notify nil) ;; e.g. for dired buffers (setq global-auto-revert-non-file-buffers t) 
 After starting emacs I checked the value of that variables and they are as expected.
 But auto-revert doesn&#x27;t work even in a simple txt file. I open a txt file. Then I also open it with another editor (geany), edit and save it. Nothing happens in emacs. When I try to edit that file in emacs I&#x27;m informed about that this file was modified. But this is to late. I want to make the revert automatic without asking me first.
 Then I disable(!) the global revert mode and enabled it again. Then it works. Modifications I do with Geany are loaded in the emacs buffer automatically.
 First I thought something interfered with my python/eglot/xyz setup. But as I say it also happens with a txt file.

                              <span>So, I&#x27;ve been using org-roam to make notes and what not. And it has been going great. Now, I have an exam, which is an open-book exam, so I think printing out my notes would be very useful, since it can get into details of things. So, I wonder if there is a way to export all the linked notes to HTML/PDF, so I can easily print them? Now, i don&#x27;t want notes to be in some order, it is just that I want if A -&gt; B (A links to B), and if A is getting exported, so should B. (I know there can be cycles, so I will traverse only few depths before I return).
 Does this sound like something which has been accomplished before, or I should try to do it before exams? :)

                              <span>So let&#x27;s say I have a main where I try to process input arguments, perhaps open a chosen file with specific extension only, read something from the file in an expected format, etc. And I have proc_args, check_extension, proc_file_data, functions. Each of those functions can fail, eg if necessary argument is missing, file with wrong extension has been provided, the file doesn&#x27;t follow the expected format. Based on what I know about haskell, using Maybe type as the return value of the functions seems reasonable to me, Nothing if it fails, Just result if it succeeds. What I&#x27;m having trouble with is how to actually utilize this in main. I do something like this
 let proc_args_result &#x3D; proc_args args if proc_args_result &#x3D;&#x3D; Nothing then die &quot;Invalid arguments&quot; else return() ... -- continue working with processed arguments 
 the problem is that if I want to continue working with the processed arguments, I still have the Maybe value instead of the actual value of the result. Alternative is using
 case proc_args args of { Nothing -&gt; die ... Just value -&gt; ... -- continue here } 
 but that will lead to uncontrollable indentation

 The error is
 Diagnostics: 1. • Couldn&#x27;t match expected type ‘p’ with actual type ‘r -&gt; Int’ ‘p’ is a rigid type variable bound by the inferred type of getter :: Example -&gt; p • In the expression: field In an equation for ‘getter’: getter (Example {field}) &#x3D; field In an equation for ‘fieldL’: fieldL &#x3D; lens getter setter where getter (Example {field}) &#x3D; field setter _ f &#x3D; Example {field &#x3D; f} • Relevant bindings include field :: r -&gt; Int getter :: Example -&gt; p 
 Why can I not create a lens for an existential data type? How can I make lenses for existential data types?
 Update: The real code is
 data RowHdr n e &#x3D; forall r. RowHdr { draw :: ListFocused -&gt; WidthDeficit -&gt; RowHdrCtxt -&gt; r -&gt; Widget n , width :: AvailWidth -&gt; [r] -&gt; RowHdrWidth , toRH :: e -&gt; Index -&gt; r } 
 I just want a lens into this data type.

                              <span>I know this functionality exists, but for the life of me cannot remember how to do so. 
 If I write a quick lisp function to calculate subtraction for example:
 (- 56000 55952)
 How can I evaluate just that line?
 Thank you so much!

                              <span>About 2 months ago, I moved from my 3 year old home baked config to Doom Emacs. Just recently I have noticed a problem with Treemacs. 
 If I use the Evil shortcut &#x60;SPC w h&#x60; on the right buffer, trying to goto the Treemacs window, I get an error saying &#x60;No window left from selected&#x60; . 
 This is certainly not the case as Treemacs is open on the left. If I&#x27;m in Treemacs buffer, I&#x27;m able to go out with &#x60;SPC w l&#x60; but not back in. 
 I feel like I have done something dumb with my config. Do you know how to fix this behaviour ??
 Thanks
 Not able to navigate to Treemacs buffer with &#x60;SPC w h&#x60;

 Is there some way to make an emacs buffer throw out face overrides and go back to the default?

                              <span>Hey there folks,
 pretty much got my emacs-based IDE working like a charm, save for one issue. But I&#x27;m REALLY banging my head against the wall with this one. Maybe someone can try to reproduce? I&#x27;m using lsp-mode with ts-ls. Works great for the most part, can&#x27;t get yasnippet to work with autocompletion no matter what I try, but I just bound inserting a snippet and it&#x27;s enough, so don&#x27;t mind that.
 I&#x27;m getting an error message from lsp-mode if I chuck in the following piece of code and move my cursor over the function name (triggering suggested code actions):
 function somefunc(arg_without_type) { } 
 The error message reads: https://hastebin.com/share/onatikugar.php
 Blurts it into the message and mini-buffer, too, so I can&#x27;t just ignore it, sadly. Looks like an error with the language server and not my config, but you never know. I&#x27;m pasting the mode configs that might have something to do with it below. If it isn&#x27;t my config, can someone recommend me a good alternative? I&#x27;m thinking tide.
 (use-package lsp-mode :after company :commands (lsp lsp-deferred) :init (setq lsp-keymap-prefix &quot;C-c l&quot;) :config (lsp-enable-which-key-integration t)) (use-package lsp-ui :bind ((&quot;C-,&quot; . lsp-ui-peek-find-references) (&quot;C-.&quot; . lsp-ui-peek-find-definitions)) :config (progn (define-key lsp-ui-mode-map [remap xref-find-definitions] #&#x27;lsp-ui-peek-find-definitions) (define-key lsp-ui-mode-map [remap xref-find-references] #&#x27;lsp-ui-peek-find-references))) (use-package flycheck :diminish :init (global-flycheck-mode)) (use-package company :diminish :hook (prog-mode . company-mode) :bind (:map company-active-map (&quot;&quot; . company-complete-selection)) (:map lsp-mode-map (&quot;&quot; . company-indent-or-complete-common)) :custom (company-minimum-prefix-length 1) (company-idle-delay 0.1)) 
 Thanks in advance!

 I tried this:
 :config (set1 company-format-margin-function #&#x27;company-vscode-light-icons-margin) 
 And this:
 :config (setq company-format-margin-function #&#x27;company-vscode-dark-icons-margin) 
 I saw both examples in other init files on github. But I do not get icons:
 https://preview.redd.it/gf7vep8i1npa1.png?width&#x3D;694&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;46d8af253b1c8564dd12ae5e24c04893c93c10e7
 I have all-the-icons installed and i have nerd fonts installed.
 Note - id rather use the built in company feature rather than another package.

                              <span>Hello,
 I am kinda posing a question in the form of a package here: basically, what’s the most efficient way to bind keys? It’s one of those questions I had neglected to ask for so long that I’m a little afraid to ask now, cuz keyboard macros are kind of a core feature to Emacs. Anyway, here&#x27;s what I wrote:
 https://github.com/Overdr0ne/skey
 I felt like there was a missing define-keys function, so I tried to provide it in this package. Rather than writing:
  (define-key some-map (kbd &quot;x&quot;) #&#x27;my-func) (define-key some-other-map (kbd &quot;x&quot;) #&#x27;my-func) (define-key some-map (kbd &quot;y&quot;) #&#x27;my-other-func) (define-key some-other-map (kbd &quot;y&quot;) #&#x27;my-other-func) etc...  skey lets you write:  (skey-define-keys &#x27;(some-map some-other-map) &#x27;((&quot;x&quot; my-func) (&quot;y&quot; my-other-func) etc...)) 
 As of this writing, skey is 9 lines of code in one function. Is there already a standard way to do this? Is everyone just using raw define-key, maybe in a loop? general? use-package’s :bind? Reinventing your own key definers? I explain more in the readme some of the ways I bind keys, but I was just curious how other people are doing things.
 Suggestions for additional features to this package are welcome, but I would be just as happy to learn that there’s a simple, standard way to do what this package does. Maybe add lazy loading by default or something? I dunno, this is kind of a weird post lol...

                              <span>I&#x27;m on Ubuntu 18.04. My current emacs version is Emacs 25.2.2.
 I&#x27;m told that the right way to upgrade Emacs is through the same method it was installed. But that&#x27;s hit a bit of a stumbling block.
 I&#x27;ve installed Emacs through Synaptic. According to Synaptic, I&#x27;m on the latest version (Version 47??? What does that number refer to?). So I can&#x27;t update through that.
 I&#x27;d love to be more up-to-date, but I don&#x27;t want to create any problems through installing from another method. What&#x27;s the right way to do this? 
 Do I have to un-install from Synaptic and re-install from the command line? And if I do, what happens to all the packages I&#x27;ve installed, do I have to re-install every single package again?
 While we&#x27;re at it, is Emacs 28.2 the recommended version to update to? Or should I try something a little less bleeding edge, if that&#x27;s still showing any problems?

                              <span>I made a little view for extracting an Elisp public API from a buffer via tree-sitter:
 https://ag91.github.io/blog/2023/03/24/moldable-emacs-what-is-the-public-api-of-this-elisp-buffer/
 I was thinking to extend it with another view that evaluates the API: any chance anybody has a good reference for evaluating APIs? I am thinking things like how many functions should an interface have to remain usable and understandable for instance.
 Anyway hopefully this gives more ideas on how to use tree-sitter apart for major modes ;)

                              <span>Currently, if I want to produce a plot in org mode I do something like the following...
 #+begin_src R :session *plot_examples* :file plot.png :results graphics file :exports both 
 #+end_src 
 I am finding it tedious to type out the this header every time I want to produce a graphic. Additionally, whatever working directory I am in gets cluttered with images. Has anyone found a way a way to automatically name these images and store them in a /images directory under the current working directory? Better would be like what I can get with jupyter-python in emacs, where I don&#x27;t have to call the graphics argument at all. Thanks.

                              <span>Hi everyone, I&#x27;m interested to know about the options for doing 3D graphics programming are, if any. Sorry if this post is all over the place --- in short, I&#x27;m just looking for any kind of information, experience and advice related to 3D graphics in Haskell.
 With one exception (see below), all the info/libraries that I have found are a little dated, and I would like to know how to interpret that fact: have the existing 3D libraries/tools just come to a stable stage where they no longer need updating? Or is Haskell not (/no longer) a serious option for 3D graphics? In particular, is the OpenGL library a viable option today, or is it no longer worth looking into?
 Here&#x27;s some of what I have found so far:
  
The wiki page about Graphics. Unless I am mistaken, the last 3D-related edits on that page are more than 10 years old.
 The OpenGL page on the wiki. Here again the information seems to be a little dated.
  
The exception (to the things I&#x27;ve found being old) is h-raylib, Haskell bindings to the Raylib library. It&#x27;s very nice, but I&#x27;d be interested in knowing about the other options, notably lower-level ones.
 By the way, h-raylib doesn&#x27;t appear on the Haskell wiki page. Should I add it?

                              <span>This is a topic that deserves its own thread. I&#x27;ll launch the first salvo.

  
@Massimo_Curatella said over at Ideas We&#x27;re Grappling With March 23, 2023::
I am thinking about designing a tutorial on how to create your user profile to get the best out of participating to online communities.


Not sure that even a sparkling user profile like mine  is good enough to bolt us into participating or be a tornado hurling others to interact with us. But I could be wrong.

  
I need to set specific boundaries to my exploration and that was the smallest unit of value I could think of.


Concentrating on the user profile is a small gesture but who knows where it could lead? I&#x27;m willing to follow along and help where I can.

  
I started to talk about that idea to friends and, surprisingly, they found it useful.


I have a mildly snarky question, are you talking to us &quot;about the idea as friends&quot; or are we the &quot;real people&quot; you want to experiment on?
This is a superb idea, and I&#x27;ll participate. I think this forum would benefit from anything that would enhance engagement.
To start this off, here is a screenshot of my profile.</span>

 With tree-sitter, I believe this should be relatively trivial to implement but I can&#x27;t find any implementation. If this don&#x27;t exist, I&#x27;ll be happy to hack something out!

 ​
 The alt key looks really hard to reach; the ctrl key also is not too easy to reach. Maybe toggle instead of holding the key may be better? How do you set up your modifier keys?

                              <span>when i enable flycheck-mode on my emacs packages, it almost always (always?) baulks at my &quot;;; Package-Requires:&quot; statement, saying that &quot;Package X is not installable&quot;, even if the package is installed and on the load-path.
 my config looks like this: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; (use-package flycheck-package)
 (use-package flycheck :config (setq flycheck-emacs-lisp-load-path &#x27;inherit) (flycheck-package-setup)) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 setting &#x60;flycheck-emacs-lisp-load-path to inherit is the only solution i have found online for this issue.
 does anyone have any further ideas?
 if it&#x27;s relevant i use straight.el for package managing, and i&#x27;m not tip-top with it. but afaik, straight updates the load-path for packages installed with it.

 a set of rules to avoid incorrect sentence ends, for example &quot;e.g.&quot;, &quot;i.e.&quot;, &quot;Mr.&quot;, &quot;Dr.&quot;, etc., and functions that follow those rules.
 previously discussed as segment.el on here while i was working on it and struggling a little. some on here helped me out (thanks!), after we finally understood each other. (https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/uwqmy8/segmentel_porting_complex_sentence_break_rules/)
 seems to work ok, though there are improvements to be made.
 might be added to melpa or similar soon.
 feedback welcome.

 ​
 The code above is correct, but i could also bind C-c to a keymap which contains &quot;z&quot; and &quot;o&quot; bound to another keymap which respectively binds &quot;p&quot; and &quot;s&quot; to to &#x27;backward-char.
 ​
 The question is: when is it needed to define a new keymap?

 Also, anyone know how to change the width of the treemacs buffer?

 Every time I try to use info in eshell, the emacs built-in info-mode opens, and so, the command I am searching for doesn&#x27;t shows up, how can I solve this?
 Example: &quot;info gh&quot; return the documentation for the ghub package of emacs, not the gh command from the github-cli software
 Thanks in advance and sorry the poor English!

                              <span>Hello,
 You can find Leafy-mode on GitHub here: leafy-mode
 I&#x27;ve developed a new Emacs minor-mode called Leafy-mode, designed to seamlessly integrate ChatGPT within org-mode documents. This allows you to have long-running, tree-structured AI conversations similar to the web UI.
 Here&#x27;s a quick rundown of the features:
  
Intelligent token prioritization: Leafy-mode prioritizes sending sibling branches and ancestor nodes to the OpenAI API when the token context fills up, dropping less relevant content.
 Easy model switching: Switch between GPT models with a simple click on the status bar, upgrading to GPT-4 temporarily if GPT-3.5 gets stuck.
 Document cost tracking: Leafy-mode tracks total costs and tokens per model as properties in your org-mode document.
  
Interestingly, ChatGPT not only played a major role in writing the code for Leafy-mode (using both the web UI and Emacs) but also came up with the name!
 Here&#x27;s how I&#x27;ve been using Leafy-mode:
  
I have a &quot;project documentation&quot; org file open in one window and my code in a separate split window.
 I keep a high-level description of my project and a list of important functions for quick reference.
 I break down tasks into small, manageable pieces, working on each in its own org headline.
 Once a task is complete, I delete unnecessary details or archive them using an :ignore tag to maintain a clean workspace.

                              <span>Hello, folks. I&#x27;m not much of an expert in emacs, so I need some help in debugging freezes when I edit python scripts with elpy-enabled (from MELPA). Here&#x27;s elpy-config:
  Emacs.............: 28.2 Elpy..............: 1.35.0 Virtualenv........: None Interactive Python: python3 3.11.2 (/opt/homebrew/bin/python3) RPC virtualenv....: rpc-venv (/Users/user/.emacs.d/elpy/rpc-venv) Python...........: python3 3.11.2 (/opt/homebrew/bin/python3) Jedi.............: 0.18.2 Autopep8.........: 2.0.2 Yapf.............: 0.32.0 Black............: 23.1.0 Syntax checker....: flake8 (/opt/homebrew/bin/flake8) 
 As for elpy mode everything works fine. I see syntax highlighting, minibuffer help, autocompletion, etc.
 However sometimes when I remove quotation mark like this:
  print(&#x27;Some text&#x27;) -&gt; print(&#x27;Some text)  to edit a line or type backslash like:
  some_var &#x3D; &#x27;&#x27; -&gt; some_var &#x3D; &#x27;\&#x27; 
 emacs hangs. Ctrl-g doesn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;ve managed to get debugger log:
  Debugger entered--entering a function: * #f(compiled-function () #)() syntax-ppss() python-nav-end-of-statement() python-nav-end-of-defun() python-info-current-defun() #f(compiled-function (info) #)(nil) elpy-promise-resolve([*elpy-promise* #f(compiled-function (info) #) elpy-rpc--default-error-callback # nil] nil) elpy-rpc--handle-json(((result) (id . 314))) elpy-rpc--filter(#
 &quot;{\&quot;result\&quot;: null, \&quot;id\&quot;: 314}\n&quot;)  I have no clue what happens and why. My suggestions is it somehow related to highlighting, because removing or escaping quotation mark leads to changing syntax colors of the rest of the file and emacs can&#x27;t handle it.
 I&#x27;ll report the error to corresponding package developers or to gnu/emacs team directly, but first I need to found out what package/command is a problem.
 Any ideas?

 So, update. After a while, I managed to make it work with pyls. I just had to sudo pip install &#x27;python-language-server[all]&#x27;. I don&#x27;t know if this is the right way but.. It works on my machine lol. Thanks everyone for their time!

 The Post installation needs me to invoke 
 export PATH&#x3D;$PATH:$HOME/.emacs.d/doom/bin 
 ******* I have a .doom.d and .emacs.d directories but which file do I need to add this path change to?
 The github mentions that It&#x27;s a good idea to add 
 ~/.config/emacs/bin 
 to your PATH!
 First, set up the PATH variable to detect the “/home/$USER/.emacs.d/doom/bin/” directory. Do this by adding the following line to the “/home/$USER/.profile” file:
 Ive been reviewing different source outside of github but Im not clear on where to add the path to I see conflicting info on a few sites.
 I do not see a profile directory. Im assuming my actual user name needs to go in the path to read as follows 
 “/home/$darren/.emacs.d/doom/bin/”

                              <span>It&#x27;s Thursday, and here we go again. I&#x27;m telling you what I&#x27;m working on to inspire you to tell me what you worked on. Consider the bar set low for participation. Pop in and say hi.
This week I&#x27;ve been distracted by schoolwork. The second paper in my ENGL501 class was due. I feel good about it, but we&#x27;ll see. I spent too much time programming, according to my sweetie. She is probably right, but getting lost in programming problems felt so good.
Thoughts about construal level theory have surfaced again in my ZK, leading me to Robin Hanson, Associate Professor at George Mason University, and his paper on the sacred. We See The Sacred From Afar, To See It The Same. I quickly looked at the paper, and while I don&#x27;t agree with everything, Robin&#x27;s look at the construal-level theory and how it relates to our concept of sacred is fascinating and well-referenced.
A week filled with productive distractions. Next week I&#x27;m afraid other people&#x27;s expectations of me will creep up the priority list.
What&#x27;s happening in your ZK?

                              <span>Hi all,
 two questions.
  
Is Implicit conversion considered evil because of non-total conversions and the fact that it&#x27;s hard to trace where this conversion is happening?
 I&#x27;ve used implicit defs for something like this in the past. Is this also considered a bad practice? Would the same reasoning from point #1 apply ?

                              <span>Complete newbie here.
 Is there any kind of (runtime) instrumentation possible in Haskell similar to Java? I need to add some OpenTelemetry monitoring to existing Haskell software and don&#x27;t know how to approach it. Is the only way forking the source and have custom build of a library (talking about PostgREST / hasql in particular).
 EDIT: I am aware of two OpenTelemetry Haskell libraries. What I am really asking about is if it is possible to inject monitoring logic into existing software without modifying/rebuild it?
 In Java there is instrumentation framework that can be used to do that.

                              <span>A bit about us
 We are a successful multi-strategy hedge fund managing assets in excess of $10bn for our clients. Over the last 12 years we have grown from a single office in London to a current headcount of over 200 people working across London, Glasgow, New York, Hong Kong, Zürich and Dubai. We believe our colleagues are key to the fund’s success and have developed a firm-wide culture we are proud of.
 Role description
 We are seeking to hire a software development intern for a minimum of 3-6 months, to help building a new Haskell codebase and deploy it in a Linux environment.
 You will work with guidance from a portfolio manager who recently joined the team earlier in 2023.
 The role will expose you to many of the technical aspects of running an investment strategy. Experience in financial markets and financial instruments will be helpful but is not a requirement to perform well in this role.
 You will join a collaborative &amp; friendly environment spread across all global offices.
 What we work with
 We are working with Haskell, Nix (package management), Python and Relational databases (Sqlite and SQL Server)
 Essential skills
  
Demonstrable proficiency in Haskell (no professional experience required)
 University degree in a quantitative field
 Experience with Linux
 Experience with relational database systems
  
Preferential skills
  
Experience with Python
 Experience working with Nix
  
Office
 The Zurich office is located at the heart of Zurich located 2 minutes from Lake Zurich – but you can also work in one of our other offices globally or remotely.
 How to apply
 Please send your CV, motivational letter, as well as information regarding your visa situation and when you would want to start to [internships@lmrpartners.com](mailto:internships@lmrpartners.com).

                              <span>Hey there!
 I am thinking of creating a small pet project - a UI for some existing REST-api.
 And the api I am going to connect to already exposes it&#x27;s description as an openapi 3.0 json file. 
 So I am wondering what would be the best way of generating a purescript client. 
 PS as a plan B I&#x27;ve got servant-purescript (since the api&#x27;s running on servant)

 I’ve seen people here following either a single page journal likely yearly one or a multi file journal like daily or weekly. Apart from personal preference and the impact on orgmode agenda, what are the pros and cons of one method over the other in medium to long term.

The problem with scopes
In the example API for pure mutable arrays, the original Linear
Haskell paper (Arxiv
version) featured the function:
newMArray :: Int -&gt; (MArray a %1 -&gt; Ur b) %1 -&gt; Ur b

This function is essential to make the API work: mutable arrays can
only be pure when they are not aliased. By taking a linear function as
an argument, newMArray can make sure that the MArray is, in fact,
not aliased. This is because linear ty…</span>

                              <span>What are the best practices for structuring a public custom mode project? Say I&#x27;m creating a minor mode called slug,
  
Should all the code go in a subdir with the readme in the root?
 If so, should the dir be called slug or something more generic like src?
 Is a README.md expected or does the mode commentary in the source make that redundant? 
 If I&#x27;m going to write additional helper libraries that aren&#x27;t directly connected should they go in a separate dir?
  
What are some projects you consider well structured/organized?

                              <span>Hey there,
 I&#x27;ve been debating workflows recently, and what I would really want is some way to make a rectangle frame within a current code buffer to quickly access dired to switch a file instead of having to split the window, and access Dired that way.
 Is there any way for a rectangle frame to appear ontop of the current one?
 And no, I don&#x27;t want it to popup as a separate Emacs window itself, just need a rectangle centered in the center of the current buffer to show a dired buffer real quick.
 If that above is possible, is it possible to also use a fuzzy finder utility in Emacs the same way as well? Would love to quickly find a file and edit it real quick too.
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hey there,
 I&#x27;ve tried Tab Bar mode and Eyebrowse Mode, and I honestly don&#x27;t like either one of them. The default tab styling and workflow for Tab Bar mode is not ideal for me, and I couldn&#x27;t really get Eyebrowse mode to not freak out keybinding wise no matter what I did.
 With this in mind, going forward and ignoring the two above, I&#x27;m wondering, is there something similar to like &#x27;i3&#x27; window manager, but within Emacs itself?
 Looking for something similar where it has like 5 window options where you can just swap between them on the fly, etc. Plus something that could save those buffers for later use would be great.
 ​
 Not sure if I qualify as someone who should just learn Projectile or something though since I have a few web dev projects I swap out to sometimes. I usually have Treemacs on the left pane with code being edited in Emacs on the right. I also need a separate screen for two split vterm terminals, and a separate screen for an org mode buffer notes pane. If I could manage this all within some kind of in-built window manager within Emacs in a sane way, I would be very very happy.
 ​
 Thanks.

                              <span>Most of us probably heard of Copilot, and how it&#x27;s great, useful and better than rule-based autocomplete (see https://youtu.be/cdiD-9MMpb0?t&#x3D;8690 where Andrej Karpathy praises it for example). 
 Now the GitHub ecosystem is getting better with the inclusion of GPT-4 (which is better than ChatGPT for simple code generation, which is in turn comparable with or better than Codex which is essentially behind Copilot) and some projects built around it: 
 - Copilot X: https://github.com/github-copilot/chat_waitlist_signup/ (basically a chat buffer) 
 - Copilot Voice: https://githubnext.com/projects/copilot-voice/ (voice input) 
 - Copilot Docs: https://githubnext.com/projects/copilot-for-docs/ (ask anything about the docs) 
 - Copilot for PRs: https://githubnext.com/projects/copilot-for-pull-requests/ (helps in writing PRs) 
 - Copilot CLI: https://githubnext.com/projects/copilot-cli/ (helps you with the ffmpeg and ghostscipt cli interfaces 🥴) 
 ​
 With all this AI hype and products shipping at an insane pace, I can&#x27;t stop thinking of how the Emacs ecosystem could answer with an open and better alternative. I think Emacs is very well suited for this new text-based smart-ish assistant tech interface-wise (much more so than VS Code). 
 There are some &quot;open-source&quot; alternatives for the open-AI generative LLMs there, like LLAMA https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp trained and leaked by Meta, and made available in c++ and actually runnable even on a MacBook Air. Sure it&#x27;s not as great as Codex, GPT-4 and such, but it&#x27;s a start (there are also open datasets with lots of code https://huggingface.co/datasets/bigcode/the-stack, so maybe in the future the gap will close). 
 Maybe we should work on something like this? 
 ​
 Very interested in what the community thinks about this in general.

 Here&#x27;s the tree-sitter package installed from MELPA:

 Is this simply colorschemes not implementing the current faces or is this not as through for some reason?

                              <span>I recently started a YouTube channel where I live stream my first look through an unfamiliar code base. The idea is that it&#x27;s supposed to feel a bit like when you&#x27;re working at a big tech company and you&#x27;re trying to figure out what some code that you&#x27;ve never seen before is doing.
 I thought folks here might be interested in a video I made last week about one of my favorite programs of all time: Emacs!
 Let&#x27;s read the Emacs source code video
 I spend some time looking at the history of Emacs, but you can also jump directly to the code.

                              <span>I am unsure why this is the case, but pdfs rendered in-app emacs 29 on osx (Ventura 13.2.1) have quite poor legibility font-wise (all the pdfs were embedded within Zotero). The pdfs look fine in other OSX apps such as the system default Preview.app, Zotero itself or even FIrefox.
 Does anyone know how to correct this within emacs? (Ideally, I want to be reading the pdf in one pane and making notes in org-roam in the other.

                              <span>I always wondered why Emacs takes 20+ seconds to launch on Windows compared to Linux where it starts in an instant, googling revealed that a lot of people suffer from this issue but many deal with it with emacs-client, but then, by accident, I started emacs from a folder that I excluded from Windows Defender and all of a sudden it started in 90ms... down from literal 20 sometimes even more seconds.
 ​
 tl;dr If your Emacs on Windows takes long to start, exclude its folder from Windows Defender.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been using Emacs Org mode to create fiction for over a decade, and I&#x27;ve slowly built up a pleasant system for laying out and linking files while I&#x27;m writing. I like linking quickly to relevant notes whenever names or keywords are mentioned in the main text of a story, and being able to manage those notes with the minimum of effort. It&#x27;s always worked really well for me, so I coded up a package to have Emacs make it even easier. And, thus, Org Novelist was born. 
 I also wrote some code to export the stories to a standard manuscript format for submission to publishers. 
 The package takes care of most of the boring stuff for me, and lets me get on with actually writing.
 I realize that the set of people using Emacs for novel writing is likely to be quite small (and I coded this for my personal use rather than for public release), but if you think it could be useful, you can find Org Novelist on GitHub.
 Thanks for reading, and keep on writing!

                              <span>Hello all,
 I have problem with Emacs and Slime. As of writing this post,
 Debian 11 apt keeps Emacs 27.1 and
 Fedora 37 dnf keeps Emacs 28.1
 On Debians Emacs you can instal Slime package
 M-x package-install RET slime RET 
 and it will run with e.g. sbcl without no problems. However on Fedoras 28-Emacs it will not. On start up, Emacs will give warning:
 Package cl is deprecated 
 Such a warning is described in this post for Emacs 27. But for what I understand it does not speak about Slime issue... But I continue, it is &quot;only&quot; a warning. Fedora version of Slime is 2.26.1 and after running
 M-x slime 
 I get
 Wrong number of arguments: (3 . 4), 2 
 and Slime won&#x27;t start.
 What I tried:
  
installed dnf package emacs-slime
 edited and recompiled hyperspec.el in slime library as written here (also tried adding &quot;unknown&quot; as mentioned in comment of the post)
 tried to downgrade to Emacs 27.1 but Fedoras dnf does not maintain older versions than 28
 tried to install Emacs 27.1 from Gnu&#x27;s archive but I get errors in make which might be for other post all together.
  
​
 If anyone encountered and solved these problems with Slime on Emacs 28, please let me know what you did. Also if anyone wants that make error output I can give you that.
 Thank you.

I moved the (setq lsp-keymap-...) line outside (and before) use-package. I also used :config (define-key lsp-load-map...) in my use-package block. But none of them worked.

                              <span>Hi, silly question:
 I&#x27;m hoping to use Doom emacs with agda-mode, but when I do there are some features that just don&#x27;t work. For instance, in vanilla agda-mode, if I wanted to to type unicode symbols such as $$\Sigma$$, I would be able to via by beginning the slash. However this does not work in Doom. However, here i have to type C-x 8 RET GREEK CAPITAL LETTER SIGMA, which is pretty inconvenient. This issue does not go away when turning evil mode off
 Additionally when in evil mode there are some agda-mode keybinds beginning with C-u that I really wish could work. I&#x27;m not sure what they get remapped to, if anything. 
 Thank you for any help in understanding this. I&#x27;m very new to emacs (need to use it because the vscode agda extension is buggy), and I&#x27;m partial to doom. So I really hope I can find a way to make this all work

                              <span>Hello all,
 ​
 I followed the manual (https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Specifying-File-Variables.html#Specifying-File-Variables) and added with M-x add-file-local-variable-prop-line the line:
 ;;; -*- eval: (set-input-method &#x27;latin-1-prefix); -*-
 to the beginning of the file, but when i open it the input method is not latin-1-prefix.
 If i explicitly evaluate the expression, then the input method is changed.
 Does any one know a way to specify the input method for just one file?
 I am using Emacs 30.0.50 with pgtk.

                              <span>So, emacs has officially included eglot, which is a minimalistic LSP client. Great. lsp-mode has always felt way too bloated in my experience. It wants to do a lot, and if you don&#x27;t do things its way, it gets messy.
 Anyway, dap-mode only works with lsp-mode, so I was wondering if there was any plans to implement something similar to eglot, but for DAP.

                              <span>I started eglot a couple of hours ago and emacs is now occupying 10 GB of RAM. I have 32 GB total.
 I have removed every other leaky package, and I know from profiling that 95% of the memory is being consumed by jsonrpc-process-filter.
 I can&#x27;t believe this is something every emacs user just bears. There must be a correct solution for that.
 EDIT: Just found this emacs fork, looks promising.

 https://np.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/j8df0/moderator_guidelines_thems_the_rules/
  
Following some feedback on rule 1, it has been changed to the following:
  
 Top-level posts should be primarily about Haskell. For example a post about OCaml would only be allowed if there was a connection to Haskell. Posts about topics that are adjacent to Haskell, like for example functional programming, are typically allowed.
  
 Hopefully this expresses the intent of the rule more clearly. Obviously this is a Haskell sub-Reddit, so we&#x27;re all here mostly for Haskell content. Here&#x27;s some further clarification: 
  
The rule applies to top-level posts, not comments. 
 Posts should be about Haskell, but they may be about other related topics. 
 You should be able to complete the sentence: &quot;This post is about Haskell because _.&quot;
 Moderators are only likely to take action for egregious violations. In general if a post is well received by the community, the moderators will let it stand. 
  
Thanks to u/adamgundry and u/bss03, among others, for bringing this to my attention. 
 I&#x27;m happy to answer any questions people have about the rules.

                              <span>Are you also bothered by unhelpful error messages by the compiler, and would like to see the quality of error messages in your favourite programming language improve? You can help us by participating in a user study which investigates the quality of type error messages.
 The study will take about 15 to 20 minutes, and your task will be to evaluate the helpfulness of error messages for defective OCaml programs. There will be a short introduction to OCaml if you are not familiar with it.
 While the study uses OCaml Syntax, our results will be equally applicable to Haskell and other functional programming languages :)

                              <span>Software failures can lead to significant costs and even human hardship and
danger. We believe that with an appropriate set of tools and techniques it is
possible to improve the reliability of both existing and new software without a
huge upfront investment.
Formal methods do not have to be “too expensive” or “too time consuming”; simple
things can drastically improve the assurance of software, even without complete
verification. Furthermore, academia is constantly generating new ideas. Which of
those translate into suitable tools for a given context? There is a spectrum of
assurance and we believe in combining different techniques to gradually bring
software from zero assurance to fully verified. We aim to identify, use and
improve upon the most suitable tools for the job.
We offer high-assurance services and team augmentation for clients who either
have high-assurance needs or are themselves solution providers in this space. In
particular, we are happy to assist in the following areas:
Specification: help craft and lay specifications, and asses their aptness
to an original goal by proving relevant properties about them
Testing: help create better test suites, and build tools for executing
them over complex domains
Auditing: comprehensively test a system, report and showcase behaviours
that are potentially harmful to system security or safety, assess code quality
Tooling: improve existing tools to suit the testing/verification needs of
a particular project, or write domain-specific tools from scratch
Refactoring: help improve existing code bases through the use of
modularisation, strongly typed code, purity, and other compile-time guarantees
Full-fledged verification: assist in projects aiming to develop a
completely verified piece of software</span>

 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;wyABTfR9UTU time: 00:18:54
 In it he talks about the early efforts at programming and how OOP and FP came to be. He refers a bit to assembler and asynchronous stuff. I think there are two parts to why certain ideas gain traction and Farley leans toward performance while I look a lot at ergonomics. He says he agrees to some extent with Robert Martin&#x27;s idea that language features (like type checking) are intended to constrain us, so we can&#x27;t shoot ourselves in the foot. There are various reasons for adoption of language features.
 He also explains some of the early reasons for OO message-passing, modularity, and consideration of mathematics as a basis for a soun…</span>

                              <span>Here&#x27;s a tiny helper library, which generates html tables from case classes (or Product, generally).
 https://github.com/Quafadas/scautable
 I guess it&#x27;s kind of hard to get excited about html tables, but I felt it might be interesting enough to post, for two reasons; 
 - It seems a practical use of &#x60;Mirror&#x60; - there&#x27;s no &quot;macros&quot; or seriously gnarly meta-programming, and yet it&#x27;s fairly generic! I found it an interesting exercise ... and got some help from this forum earlier - thanks to those people.
 - It&#x27;s entirely scala CLI. 
 The scala-cli part was remarkably quick to get all the of the project boilerplate in place, publish out of CI etc. Even better - it cross compiled (super easily), and it cross platform tests really easily! And has different tests and capabilities for the JVM etc. I think these parts of scala-cli might still be subject to change... but it was amazingly easy / fast to get all of the &quot;project grind&quot; in place. 
 Ultimately, there wasn&#x27;t really a barrier, or a reason _not_ to (cross-)publish it - even something this small - and I think that&#x27;s kind of fun :-).

                              <span>Hi, I am planning to work on a toy project on purescript. With purs frontend, what language and library would you recommend for the backend? I know Haskell but purescript with node express looks cool too. 
 Thanks.

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to achieve Scrivener like functionality, where I have my org headings in the left frame, and the text in the right frame, using org-tree-to-indirect-buffers. Unfortunately, when I type text in the last or second last space before the end of the narrowed buffer, the text appears in the left frame below or next to the org heading. How do I continually hide text in the left, cycled to only headings, pane?

                              <span>When I click a link in some file I have open in my emacs, it used to open my systems web browser. However now, it opens a dialogue (im on opensuse KDE) asking which application to use, what&#x27;s strange is that the list doesnt even contain any of my web browers. This used to work, but something has changed. Clicking links in other text editors works properly, that&#x27;s why I figure its Emacs related rather than linux related.
 What could be the problem?

                              <span>I already use org-roam for taking (copious) PKM notes. Zotero seems nice for biblio management and pdf acquisition and storage (though not married to it yet)
 I was hoping someone had a flow where they then use org-roam to link up their notes with those Zotero stored pdfs with org-noter, make notes in org-roam (linked to the pdf), and then have the bibtex exported for when it&#x27;s actually time to write those citations into a paper (which looks like zotero will do already_ to a file i could then use from emacs.
 Has anyone got a workflow llike this (with configs)? 
 I&#x27;ve googled most of the day trying to come down on any one person&#x27;s setup for both the bilbio management (and citations) as well as the annotating of those source materials but did not find one that was focused more on the knowle…</span>

 when I tried $1&#x3D;max(@1$1..@5$1) in the last row I got this:

 instead of getting 5 in the last cell. 
 How do I solve this?

                              <span>Hey all,
 Are there non-GPT LLM integrations for Emacs? I&#x27;m looking for a free software or open source model that can either be run locally or self-hosted and integrated with Emacs. I&#x27;ve seen lots of OpenAI GPT integrations but I really think the Emacs community could get behind an open, free model, even if it&#x27;s less impressive for now. 
 Is anyone working on this? I&#x27;m not a great elisp coder but I&#x27;d love to help.

                              <span>As many of us have noticed, there&#x27;s an awful lot of packages dealing with Large Language Models (LLMs, in short, and right now just Chat GPT but soon probably other alternatives as well). There&#x27;s some interesting in this for sure, but I feel like I haven&#x27;t seen people recognizing that this isn&#x27;t just another interesting trend we can integrate into our favorite editor, this could be a really pivotal moment for emacs, because I contend there isn&#x27;t another application out there that is so well suited to working with LLMs.
 First of all, the primary thing you want when dealing with LLMs is integrate it with your writing environment. Emacs can do that, and already does, via many different packages. And with Emacs, you can use it to write just about anything. Code, documentation, technical paper…</span>

                              <span>Due to the nature of my work, I sometimes have to abandon a project for a few weeks to work on something else before returning to the original project. When coming back to the old project, I often discovered (the hard way!) that I had forgotten some crucial concepts related to that project. I created a simple package to allow me to quickly add notes to any org heading and then surface the notes for a heading (and its parents) when clocking in again after a long time (14 days by default).
 The package can be found at github:durableOne/org-cc
 This is very much a work in progress and I&#x27;m not a programmer by training so any feedback and suggestions for improvement are welcome.

                              <span>New features for PDFs:
  
2-D precise notes
 Support for multi-column formats org-noter-pdf-set-columns
 Integrated highlighting of selected text (customizable toggle org-noter-highlight-selected-text)
 Many bug-fixes
 Some old PRs implemented
  
Other new features:
  
DJVU support (untested by us)
 org-noter-start-from-dired opens file at point or marked files
 Consistent usage of selected text for note title or body
  
The last point requires a bit more explanation. In the previous version of org-noter, the rules for how selected text would be used and for the default title was dependent on the note insertion method -- whether it was a precise-note or a page-note and on the setting of the custom toggle org-noter-insert-note-no-questions.
 Now, for all insertion methods, the primary default title is &quot;short&quot; selected text and the secondary title has the format &quot;Notes for page  [V: % H: %]&quot;. &quot;Short&quot; is defined by the customizable variable org-noter-max-short-selected-text-length (default: 80). See the README for more details.
 If you have un-dealt-with PRs on the author&#x27;s repo, please redirect/resubmit them to https://github.com/org-noter/org-noter.

                              <span>The text-display library offers the Display typeclass for developers to print a textual representation of datatypes (and data) that do not have to abide by the rules of the Show typeclass.
 This release brings two contributions, one pertaining to the laziness of the List instance, the other brings an instance for Void. 
 I also cranked the &quot;Documentation&quot; lever to the max with this release, so here are:
  
Tutorial for new users
 API Reference
 Design of the library
 Comparison with other libraries
  
The book is made with mdBook &amp; LiterateX.
 Questions welcome although I encourage you to read the book beforehand, the answer might be in there ;)

                              <span>I&#x27;m developing a RESTful service which backend uses &#x60;aeson&#x60; to parse request from user&#x27;s post message.
 it works well while the ADT is so complex and deeply nested it&#x27;s would take lots of time to manually maintain a JSON schema to user .
 I&#x27;m wondering if there is a way to generate JSON schema from Haskell&#x27;s&#x27; ADT/records automatically ?
 there is one I found but it seems not longer being updated and deps is out of date https://github.com/yuga/jsonschema-gen/ .
 Thank you

                              <span>Fourmolu is a configurable formatter for Haskell code forked from Ormolu.
 The bulk of this release is merging Ormolu 0.5.2.0 and 0.5.3.0. The one new feature is a new no-space option for the in-style configuration. As is the norm, binaries are available in the GitHub release (linked below), or can be built from source or Hackage.

I am using DWM. Do I need to switch window managers? Is there a way that I can download and get emacs29 to work properly on my system?
 ​
 --update--
 The install info helped me install it properly without switching window managers, but the second error persists. I think it has something to do with me using straight.el. Is there a fix for this, or to I need to go back to package.el?

                              <span>I recently started developing my own emacs config (with a lot of help from the Emacs from Scratch series by System Crafters) after using Doom Emacs for more than 2 years. I&#x27;m mostly done (probably never fully, but oh well) and trying to nail down some features I&#x27;d like.
 The one that&#x27;s got me going at the moment is binding ESC to &#x60;abort-minibuffers&#x60; while in normal mode. I&#x27;ve set the &#x60;evil-want-minibuffers&#x60; custom variable to &#x60;t&#x60; and would like to be able to exit any minibuffer by pressing ESC while in normal mode, which is not the case at the moment.
 (use-package evil
 :init
 :custom
 (evil-want-Y-yank-to-eol t)
 (evil-want-minibuffer t)
 :config
 (evil-mode 1)
 (define-key evil-normal-state-map (kbd &quot;&quot;) &#x27;abort-minibuffers))
 ​
 This is a stripped down version of my evil config at the moment (no further detail needed) along with the best solution I&#x27;ve come up with so far. It works, but I&#x27;m guessing that there&#x27;s a more elegant way to achieve this.
 Bonus Question: The &#x60;evil-want-Y-yank-to-eol&#x60; variable doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing anything even if I turn it on. Haven&#x27;t dug around to find out why yet, but any clues as to why this is happening would be appreciated.

                              <span>Recently started using Emacs and its just aweeesommmee! I&#x27;m using vanilla Emacs, I&#x27;ve gone through the tutorial, and watched the System Crafters&#x27; Emacs From Scratch playlist. I was wondering if I should switch to a &quot;distribution&quot; of Emacs. Would they let me faster navigate text and code, tabs and windows? I actually liked the keybinding of the Emacs more than Vim (Though I use C-jkl; instead of C-bnpf for moving in the text). So I have no problems with Emacs keybindings until now. What additional advantages would Doom or Spacemacs give me over vanilla Emacs? Would it worth the hassle of learning their new keybindings again?

                              <span>Hi all, i&#x27;m trying to write my config from scratch. I&#x27;m wondering what are the best practices to set up keybindings in a clean way. I know about the reserved keys (C-c ?, etc.) but I&#x27;d like to know stuff like when to define bindings in the init file (after loading the packages or before), when to define new maps, how to group bindings together in the init file so that it doesn&#x27;t turn into a mess. 
 ​
 Is there a resource or a config example that can guide me into this?

                              <span>I&#x27;m not quite sure how to phrase this question, as I don&#x27;t entirely understand how the inferior-python-mode works, but I believe it is derived from comint-mode, which from reading Mickey Petersen&#x27;s post and personal experience, is quite cumbersome. For instance, looking at the help documentation for a function, e.g. help(list) produces:
 WARNING: terminal is not fully functional Press RETURN to continue 
 Scrolling through the documentation is then quite awkward, and even though I hit can hit q to quit, it sometimes hangs and there is some funny indentation going on afterwards (&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;).
  
 However, if I run vterm, or even just term, enter my shell (which is zsh) I have no such message, and it works just like a non-Emacs terminal, allowing me to scroll and quit comfortably.
  
 Is there a way to call Python via vterm or term when running a :session in an org-src block, or when doing M-x run-python? Or at least get better scrolling behavior?

 Anybody have any tips?

                              <span>There are things like
 % Deliminators \DeclarePairedDelimiter{\abs}{\lvert}{\rvert} \DeclarePairedDelimiter{\norm}{\lVert}{\rVert} \DeclarePairedDelimiter{\ceil}{\lceil}{\rceil} \DeclarePairedDelimiter{\floor}{\lfloor}{\rfloor} \DeclarePairedDelimiter{\round}{\lfloor}{\rceil} 
 That I&#x27;d like to access from org documents. Currently, I have different setup files that I include inside the individual documents. I am wondering if there is a way instead to just set these in my configuration.org file so that I can have access to these types of shortcuts in all of my org-documents by default.

                              <span>Ox Zola started as a personal fork of the famous ox-hugo exporter, but, since the number of users is growing, I thought it was time to make it a completely different package; from now on, Ox Zola will run on top of ox-hugo itself. This way, you can install the official ox-hugo package and receive all the updates without being restrained by the progress of Ox Zola.
 Even so, I suggest pinning ox-hugo to the most recent working version to avoid breaking changes after updates.

                              <span>Is it possible to use a java annotation processor in Scala, or wrap it in some way to make it work? From what I have gathered so far, the java annotation processor only works with the java compiler and thus java sources. However, I am wondering if there some way to wrap the java annotation processor code in Scala, so that it can be used with Scala classes/sources.
 The use case is a well established library for generating yaml files based on Java class annotations (simple getter/setter classes). I would like to have these classes in scala if possible

                              <span>In response to a post last week, Stephen Downes reminded me that Ludwig Wittgenstein had a zettelkasten practice. In particular there is a translated and published book Zettel from 1967 which contains 717 zettels from Wittgenstein’s Nachlass, or works left behind following his death in 1951. I’ve had a copy lying around for a bit, but finally spent some time with it. The book cleverly has a parallel text form with the German on one side of the page and the English on the facing page. I’ve also seen translations of the book in both Spanish and Italian for those who might prefer those.

                              <span>Hi Haskellers! 
 I probably have the wrong idea about Arrows, but at an oversimplified level I had always thought that they were interesting because they &quot;represent functions as data&quot; in some sense, which is interesting in that it would allow for composition and reasoning of that data separated from execution (e.g. a composition of Arrows could be inspected and validated or modified before execution). Anyways - under the above assumption I dived in with a real use-case but hit a few hurdles that probably mean I have a total misunderstanding and would appreciate any guidance!
 Heres a small, and yes very dumb example, but hopefully gets at my core misunderstanding - where I am not sure that I can recover the composition of these Arrows. Say we have these Arrows:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; -- Adds 1 to the input plus1 :: Arrow a &#x3D;&gt; a Int Int plus1 &#x3D; arr $ (+ 1)
 -- Adds 2 to the input plus2 :: Arrow a &#x3D;&gt; a Int Int plus2 &#x3D; arr $ (+ 2)
 -- A program defined through a composition of arrows program :: Arrow a &#x3D;&gt; a Int Int program &#x3D; plus1 &gt;&gt;&gt; plus1 &gt;&gt;&gt; plus1 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 I&#x27;d like to be able to inspect the program, and reason able its structure. For example I may want to find paired compositions of plus1 and replace them with plus2 instead as a sort of optimization, e.g. plus2 &gt;&gt;&gt; plus1.
 Using this very simple example to get a better understanding - is this possible?

                              <span>1) Just confirming... Is the &quot;prelude&quot; basically a synonym for &quot;global imports&quot;? 
 i.e. Stuff that all source code files can access, without needing to be imported.
 
 2) Can I add my own stuff to this?
  
i.e. If I have some functions/types that I wrote myself, that I&#x27;m using in pretty much every file in my project, can I globally import them to all other files in my project? (without needing import lines in every file)
 I&#x27;m predicting that some people will hate this question, and advise against it. But I&#x27;m just wondering if it&#x27;s technical possible or not.
 
Don&#x27;t worry, nobody else ever needs to see/touch my code.
 
  
I&#x27;ve tried figuring this out myself with many web searches in the past, but haven&#x27;t found any answers (or seemingly anyone even asking the same question?).

                              <span>I decided to try and investigate the &quot;Mirror&quot; functionality, and set myself the goal to automagically generate an HTML table from a case class / &#x60;Product&#x60;. 
 By aggressively plagarising this blog post, 
 https://blog.philipp-martini.de/blog/magic-mirror-scala3/
 I got somewhere... and I have a very simple test suite which shows I can do somewhere with this idea. 
 I&#x27;m struggling with &quot;Option&quot; however,
 https://github.com/Quafadas/scautable/blob/6513b39ef3ce3e1ce05ffc30018b55a06a374537/src/main/scala/scautable.scala#L171
 https://github.com/Quafadas/scautable/blob/6513b39ef3ce3e1ce05ffc30018b55a06a374537/src/main/test/scala/test.scala#L51
 and can&#x27;t seem to get an &#x60;Option&#x60; version of this to compile. 
 I guess I&#x27;m now a bit confused about which limitation I&#x27;ve hit. The limitation of having missed something obvious? Or the plagiarised derivation in the blog post is limited, because &quot;Option&quot; is higher kinded ? Or Mirror itself? I guess I&#x27;m a bit lost! 
 Any community hints, would be most welcome :-)! Feel free to discuss whether this notion itself is at all sensible either... should you wish

                              <span>Hi All,
 I started writing blogs for Scala beginners almost a year ago. Here is the link https://yadukrishnan.live
 I would like to get some feedback regarding it to evaluate if it is being useful for readers or not. I mainly intended to write blogs for people coming to Scala from other non-fp languages (like me). 
 I hope I can do something to make more people get started on Scala. 
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Hey,
 I&#x27;ve gotten a little tired of moving my fingers just to press the n key on qwerty keyboards, and I am seriously considering learning an alternative keyboard layout. I often have to switch between Linux and Mac, so my options are relatively limited to Dvorak and Colemak. Out of the box Mac does not even to support ColemakDH.
 Is it worth switching keyboard layouts, and if it is which is better for Emacs? 
 Also, I should note that god-mode and avy are two of my favorite package. I know both these packages are customizable, but have some assumptions that you are using a qwerty keyboard. I find that &quot;g&quot; is used a lot for god mode, but is out of the way on some of the alternative keyboard layouts.

                              <span>I am trying to have consult-ripgrep and helm-do-ag by default ignore backup files, those that end with a ~. I&#x27;ve searched around and played with adding to consult-ripgrep-args various incarnations of -g &#x27;!*~&#x27;; these work when I call rg from the terminal but not when part of consult-ripgrep-args (all files seem to be excluded). Likewise, I&#x27;ve tried setting helm-ag-ignore-patterns to things like &#x27;(&quot;*~&quot; &quot;\\.*~\\&quot;)) or adding arguments to helm-ag-base-command, but this doesn&#x27;t exclude anything (even when --ignore from the terminal works).
 Solutions that involve files with lists of patterns I do not think would work, because I&#x27;d like files ending with ~ to always be ignored, regardless of the directory I am searching (which might, or not, be under version control, or be part of a project, etc).

                              <span>I want to be able to toggle the global line highlight function to a key binding and so I wrote the code below to do it. I thought that Emacs would allow the use of a closure like this but I get the error message &quot;Symbol&#x27;s value as variable is void: hline-val&quot; so I&#x27;ve resorted to using a global variable which works fine. Can anyone tell me why this is happening?
 (let ((hline-val -1)) (global-hl-line-mode hline-val) (defun toggle-hline () &quot;Toggle global line highlight.&quot; (interactive) (setf hline-val (* hline-val -1)) (global-hl-line-mode hline-val))) (global-set-key (kbd &quot;&quot;) #&#x27;toggle-hline)

                              <span>I&#x27;m going nuts, I&#x27;ve been at this like 30 minutes ffs.
 Code:
 (defun scroll-down () (interactive) (dotimes (i 20) (scroll-down-line) (sit-for 0.1))) 
 Goal: literally just testing stuff
 Problem: Calling this function, interactively or not, results in this:
 scroll-down-line: Wrong number of arguments: (lambda nil (interactive) (let ((--dotimes-limit-- 20) (i 0)) (while (&lt; i --dotimes-limit--) (scroll-down-line) (sit-for 0.1) (setq i (1+ i))))), 1 
 I&#x27;m calling it from the scratch buffer like this: (scroll-down). Calling it interactively does the same. I have tried adding an argument to the function, the resulting message is the same, but the 1 at the very end of the error changes to 0. I have tried to change i to _ to indicate it&#x27;s not used. Nothing. I have read the docs for all the functions used. interactive has no required arguments, scroll-down-line doesn&#x27;t either, but adding 1 or nil doesn&#x27;t change anything. sit-for needs 1 argument, which I&#x27;m already providing, and dotimes needs two arguments, the braces containing the variable and the amount of times to loop, and the body, those are being provided.
 Just WHAT THE HELL does this program want me to do? I really don&#x27;t understand it. I even tried using toggle-debug-on-error, wanna know what that did? NOTHING. No debug at all. It&#x27;s not even my config, I tried this with emacs in quiet mode, no config at all, it behaves the same way, not even the debug mode works.
 I&#x27;m at a loss, idk.

                              <span>Hi, I was wondering if anyone can help me with this weird code completion issue I have in TSX. 
 It seems that code completion is not picking up attributes from &quot;base&quot; types ie. from &#x60;HTMLAttributes&#x60; interface that require values like &#x60;class&#x60;, &#x60;style&#x60; etc. It will happily autocomplete stuff that can be used naked like &#x60;contenteditable&#x60;, &#x60;hidden&#x60; etc. It will also autocomplete props defined in React component etc. 
 I&#x27;ve tried this with lsp-mode and eglot but I have the same problem in both. I think my overall setup is fine - everything typecheck correctly and when I put invalid attribute name like &quot;classx&quot; it flags it. I&#x27;ve attached few images to show what I&#x27;m talking about if my text explanation is not clear.
 Notice that &#x27;class&#x27; is missing
 class typechecks correctly
 classx will report error

                              <span>Both Udemy and Rock the JVM offer online classes on Cats, Cats Effect, and FS2. I&#x27;m trying to figure out which ones to purchase. Does anyone have any comparative experience?
 The classes on Udemy have about half as much video (in terms of time) and are about 1/5th the price (e.g., $20 per class), but they also claim to have plenty of exercises, and I&#x27;m big fan of learning by doing, rather than just watching. So I&#x27;m a bit torn.
 If I don&#x27;t have to solve problems myself, I often just zone out and don&#x27;t remember much. This is why I have enjoyed Coursera and edX classes. On the other hand, I&#x27;ve also heard good things about Rock the JVM, in general.
 I watched a bit of the free Rock the JVM class on Scala for beginners, and it had you download the code from GitHub that they were writing in the video, but it didn&#x27;t seem as if they had you do anything other than watch.

                              <span>Default emacs -Q has the useful behaviour that C-S- (and left) extends the selection while C- does not. However, the help fromC-h k C-S- gives this:
 C- (translated from C-S-) runs the command right-word (found in global-map), which is an interactive native-compiled Lisp function in ‘bindings.el’. 
 which seems to say that they are mapped to the same function, which is patently untrue!! It does not document what function C-S- actually points at.
 Another thing, if we explicitly add that to our config like this:
 (global-set-key (kbd &quot;C-S-&quot;) &#x27;right-word) 
 then it operates like the unshifted variant, offering further proof that it was not pointing at the same function before the re-mapping.
 Not a hassle, just a curiosity. Some hidden magic happening?
 Bonus points for explaining the following from the same key help - what is a &#x27;field&#x27; in emacs? A search in the emacs manual &#x60;C-h i&#x60; is not fruitful:
 Value is normally t. If an edge of the buffer or a field boundary is reached, point is left there and the function returns nil. Field boundaries are not noticed if ‘inhibit-field-text-motion’ is non-nil.

                              <span>PDF viewing within Emacs is supposed to work out of the box, correct? I&#x27;ve tried opening a PDF in Emacs and then pressing C-c C-c (I read to do that, somewhere) but nothing changes when I press the hotkeys--I can still only see the raw data/text of the PDF file.
 I&#x27;m on Windows 10, if that matters.

 US Mobile has cheep phone plans
 Switch and send the monthly savings to support Magit!
  
I have both a personal phone and a business phone. Neither sees a lot of heavy use from month to month. 
 I recently discovered and switched to US Mobile and have been very impressed both with their customer service and user experience. 
 They even have a special offer where the first 100 days are free when you transfer your number to them:
 https://www.usmobile.com/
 They use both T-Mobile and Verizon towers (Black Sim and White Sim respectively) so even up here in Alaska I get decent coverage.

 PS. I&#x27;m not affiliated with US Mobile, just a happy customer.

 I want to have a TODO which would happen on several days a week at different times. I know I can have it like this:
 TODO Training   
 But the problem is when I mark the TODO as DONE it moves every instance by 1 week and not only the one for that day. Is there a way I can achieve this functionality?

                              <span>EDIT: I solved it. To have the file local tags shown in the locally customized colors, I need to add this line to the # Local Variables:
 # org-tags-special-faces-re: &quot;:\\(tag1\\|tag2\\|tag3\\):&quot; 
 With tag1, tag2 etc. being the names of the tags I set with #+TAGS: at the beginning of the file.
 --
 I would like to set new tags in orgmode on a per file basis and give them certain colors.
 The #+TAGS: setting on the first line of the file works fine, the new tags are set and I can choose them with pcomplete.
 But when I try to change their faces via # org-tag-faces in the # Local Variables at the end of the file, something strange happens. They change their color only if I have set them globally before via (setq org-tag-faces ...). So they do change their color, but only those of the tags that are explicitly named in the global list through (setq org-tag-faces ...), the other, new tags only defined in the actual file via #+TAGS: are in the color of the heading and do not change their face. How is that?
 Does anyone of you know a solution? Thanks a lot for hints and help!
 I work with Emacs 28.1.91 and Org mode version 9.5.4.

                              <span>I have been trying to use the org-similarity package with my org-roam notes. I downloaded org-similarity from the github repo and have setup the following configuration:
 (add-to-list &#x27;load-path &quot;~/.emacs.d/org-similarity&quot;) (require &#x27;org-similarity) ;; Directory to scan for possibly similar documents. ;; org-roam users might want to change it to &#x60;org-roam-directory&#x27;. (setq org-similarity-directory org-roam-directory) (setq org-similarity-language &quot;english&quot;) ;; How many similar entries to list at the end of the buffer. (setq org-similarity-number-of-documents 10) ;; Whether to prepend the list entries with similarity scores. (setq org-similarity-show-scores t) ;; Whether the resulting list of similar documents will point to ID property or ;; filename. Default it nil. ;; However, I recommend setting it to &#x60;t&#x27; if you use &#x60;org-roam&#x27; v2. (setq org-similarity-use-id-links t) ;; Scan for files inside &#x60;org-similarity-directory&#x27; recursively. (setq org-similarity-recursive-search nil) 
 So I do C-c n f and search for a note called gradient_descent.org. Then I run org-similarity-insert-list and it gives me the following error:
 FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: &#x27;/Users/name/OneDrive/Org/references/notes/.#gradient_descent.org&#x27; 
 I am unsure why it is searching for .#gradient_descent.org when the file name is gradient_descent.org.

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently toyng around with some game ideas in haskell and came accross following &quot;thinking-problem&quot;:
 if you have a &quot;main-loop&quot; and some arbitrary (really big data - for example map data or similar...) the easy aproach would probably be something like this:
 main some_data &#x3D; do [...] -- do the magic main some_data 
 But is it wise to carry this (potential really big data) always through the recursion?Hence I thought about some diferent solutions:
 main &#x3D; do -- the concurent feature/nature of MVar could be also -- beneficial if one have multiple (game)-loops? some_data &lt;- newMVar some_data&#x27; loop where loop &#x3D; do [...] loop 
 Question about approach Nr.2: The Do-Notaion is only &quot;syntactic sugar&quot; therefore: are MVars also just recursive parameters which are carryed along the recursion or do MVars be treated diferently?
 So it comes all down to how haskell implements the parameter of its recursive functions (I guess...)(lazy evaluation and so ?!?)
 Whats your opinion?Are there different/more suitable aproaches out there?

                              <span>A couple of days ago I wanted to try something out using tree-sitter and thought that Cabal would be a nice little language to use for it. Not too big, but not too small either. Only problem was there was no grammar defined for it. Instead of finding another language for my experiment I opted to dive into the rabbit hole, despite having neither experience of tree-sitter nor a good understanding of Cabal&#x27;s syntax.
 Now I have something that could be a good base to build on. Hopefully someone can point out my mistakes... maybe even help me correct them.
 This is the repo for tree-sitter-cabal!
 MRs are welcome, of course.

                              <span>The script itself doesn&#x27;t depend on anything but to build/enter the development shell you need nix + flakes. 
 It generates a flake and a cabal file. Optionally it can generate the test and/or bench section for cabal. 
 After running the script just cd into the directory and run nix develop . And everything will be setup:
 Haskell language server Ghc Formatting Bla bla bla all that stuff. Just check out the flake to see what&#x27;s available.
 Hope this can help people getting started with haskell :) cheers

                              <span>So this is a question that has come up in a project where our unit tests must provide 100% coverage.
 Imagine that you have a library that includes a module like so: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;haskell module MyModule (A(..)) where
 data A &#x3D; A1 Int Bool | A2 String deriving (Eq, Ord, Show) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 For the purpose of this example, assume that there are no other functions in this or other modules that use values of type A.
 If you were writing unit tests for your library, would you consider that A must be tested and, if so, how?
 MyModule defines a number of functions A1 :: Int -&gt; Bool -&gt; A and A2 :: String -&gt; A, as well as some functions like (&#x3D;&#x3D;) :: A -&gt; A -&gt; Bool and compare :: A -&gt; A -&gt; Ordering generated via derivation.
 Can those be safely assumed to be correct? Should they be tested regardless (e.g., because there is no guarantee from the outside that we used deriving to create them, so their implementation may be incorrect)?
 What about if A is defined using GADTs, some other extensions, or contains some constraints? Are there any circumstances under which a datatype definition and instances of standard classes generated via derivation may fail and should be tested?
 Note that I&#x27;m not talking about cases where the type is accompanied by user-written functions. In such cases, yes, the functions may be part of the abstract datatype&#x27;s API and thus must be tested. I&#x27;m talking about the datatype definition itself, the constructors, record fields, and instances generated by GHC.

                              <span>I&#x27;m working on a programming language idea, and part of it is an IDE that has an unusual GUI. Rather than have code laid out in a traditional plain text file, most code would be split up into tables and cells, which connect to each other in various ways. Unreal blueprints is in the direction of what I&#x27;m thinking of.
 The language itself would most likely be implemented in Haskell, and I&#x27;m looking for ideas for how to approach the IDE. I have basic experience with GUI programming in Python using Kivy and Pygame, but I feel my existing experience is not enough for this project.
 I am wondering if Haskell could be a good choice for my situation.
  
If the backend is implemented in Haskell, then I think having the front end be in Haskell would make life easier
 Functional Reactive Programming seems super interesting
 I just like programming in Haskell
  
Some concerns or thoughts I have about the technology/resources I&#x27;m looking for
  
I would really like the GUI framework I learn to be cross platform 
 I would like it to have an emphasis on nice visual design (Maybe visual design is mostly work by the user rather than the framework? I&#x27;m inexperienced and not quite sure)
 I think it would be nice to learn GUI programming/design in a principled way, maybe with a theoretical bent
 I would prefer the framework to have very good tutorials
 If FRP is a good idea, is there any reason to prefer classical/denotative FRP to something like reflex? I&#x27;m really interested in the theoretical stuff, but ultimately I need a technology that is practical
 I&#x27;m not in a hurry to learn, this is mostly to have fun!

 I want to have a TODO which would happen on several days a week at different times. I know I can have it like this:
 TODO Training   
 But the problem is when I mark the TODO as DONE it moves every instance by 1 week and not only the one for that day. Is there a way I can achieve this functionality?

                              <span>My current Emacs session has started displaying blank character boxes instead of characters when the line starts with a # sequence, ie an octothorp followed by a space.
 Have I accidentally entered some unusual mode, or is it some kind of glitch that will end on restarting?
 I suspect it will disappear on restart, but I&#x27;m in an EXWM session now and I&#x27;m not ready to restart.

                              <span>I made a function (included below) that combines all the tables in a particular Org subtree and exports them to single TSV file. My function works well enough, but it&#x27;s a bit slow, taking usually about 1.2 seconds. I ran the emacs profiler on my function and found that the majority of the time was spent on calls to org-table-align invoked by org-table-move-column and org-table-export. In my case, those calls to org-table-align are unnecessary. Since neither org-table-move-column nor org-table-export provide an option to not invoke org-table-align, I made my own modified versions of those function that just comment out the calls to org-table-align. By doing this, my function now runs in 0.2 seconds, a 6x speedup!
 While the speedup is nice, I would prefer to not have my own modified version…</span>

                              <span>Hi all,
 I love Edwina mode, but I&#x27;m suspicious that it&#x27;s interferes somehow with the process of opening links to external buffers.
 When I try to open a link to a specific part of an org-file, using org-open-at-point for instance, it opens the file correctly, but then fails to jump to the right header etc. The same happens when, for instance, I open a link contained in a help buffer to view a function; it opens the correct file but fails to jump to the right part of the code.
 The reason I suspect Edwina mode is because when I switch it off everything works fine again. So it seems that somehow Edwina is interfering with this process.
 Has anyone else had this problem? I&#x27;m trying to look into it but I&#x27;m new to elisp and I&#x27;m not sure exactly where ti begin
 Thanks for any ideas,
 Mike

                              <span>Hello, I&#x27;m running Emacs on an HP Probook 4540S laptop. Intel i5 CPU, 8GB RAM, 240GB SSD, Linux Fedora with GNOME.
 I start Emacs with emacs -q to prevent loading any configuration. When I create a new .org file, there is a few seconds delay until the document opens up. Is that normal? It just happens the first time Org loads up. Then creating other .org documents have no delay.
 I tried disabling the garbage collector in early-init.el and it seems to help a bit. Does that mean that I should set back the GC threshold to about 2MB instead of the default 800Kb? I don&#x27;t want to go too far with it as I know it is not good to mess with the default value.

                              <span>I&#x27;m using the github default consult config-
 ​
 consult-grep works async fine.
 consult-ripgrep does not. As I type, no result candidates appear.
 ​
 I&#x27;ve had a quick google but nothing obvious, so before I go deeper, anyone have a quick solution? On both Debian Bookworm and Ubuntu 22:10 it doesnt work. &quot;ripgrep&quot; is installed on both.
 ​
 As I type my grep query I see that the project root is correct . There is an (!) exclamation mark there to the left of the entry field if thats any indicator.
 ​
 It&#x27;s going to be something painfully obvious, isn&#x27;t it?
 ​
  
Problem found : a .gitignore a few directories up. Solved by adding a .gitignore at the top of my projects directory containing &quot;!*&quot;.

Goal: Substantially reduce manual point-and-click trading labor.
  
Is such Haskell software already out there?
 What would be some benefits of doing it in Haskell, as opposed to using a ready-made trading engine made in another language? (If any finance folks here know of such existing engines, esp. compatible with Interactive Brokers, please share.)
 If doing it in Haskell, what do you think about using ReactiveBanana, as this gentleman did? At the end of the day a trading engine is just a loop in the imperative world, so FRP feels like a good idea; but that brings up the question of ReactiveBanana vs. other FRP libraries.
 How would you personally prefer to do it?

                              <span>Hello everybody. Haskell newbie here. Since I’m in software development is more than 30 years, last 7 in Scala, so my questions will be very straightforward and concrete: 1. I’m completely fine with GHCi, I need an IDE where I can “navigate to declaration” to learn quicker. I know VScode has, but unfortunately it doesn’t work for external ones, even Base.hs, IO.hs, etc. IntelliJ idea Haskell plug-in seems buggy, because when I add even one dependency (aeson), it starts complaining about versions and “navigate do declaration” stops working. It seems it somehow tied to lts-18. I tried 8.10.7, but still complains. 2. I’m completely fine with all types of monads, types, and type classes, I learnt about massive compile optimization when I use foldr, main question is how to distinguish tail recursion and non-tail. 3. Where do we store all the libraries. I found Hoogle. Is there only one place, 4. Which libraries we do use for - formatting - linting - other “good things” 5. Do we have kind of “recommended” resources to pass through in order not to ask dumb questions? 6. Do we have kind of stack of libraries which we use in all apps, like in Scala: - cats - cats-effects - fs2 streaming - circe (json) - http4s (http) - postgres, dynamo libraries - etc. 7. Forums, blog posts to follow 8. Other staff I need to know/learn. 9. Is difference between 8 and 9 such big as between Scala 2 and 3. 10. Any complete working repository to start with json/http/postgres Thanks in advance for all responses and help.

So many guides and courses seem to rely to heavily on GHCI in my opinion. I understand many people learn this way, but what is the point if I don&#x27;t know how to actually create a project?
 For instance, I&#x27;m trying to follow along with &quot;Learn You a Haskell&quot;, but quickly got discouraged with all of the GHCI use. I tried to create a Haskell project in VS Code, but I&#x27;m not even sure what should go in main!
 I learned other languages effectively because I was able to create bite-sized projects and experiment. I just feel very limited by the approach that functional programming language guides take.
 So my questions:
  
How did you guys learn to actually create, structure, and execute projects? Am I just doing a bad job at looking for this information? Like I said, I&#x27;m able to create a main.hs file, but am a bit stuck on what goes after &quot;main &#x3D; &quot; lol.
 Is there a reason so many guides stick with REPL? I&#x27;ve seen this from many FP languages. I&#x27;ve been wanting to learn an FP language but I keep bouncing around because I keep running into this problem. How are people learning these languages without knowing how to set up projects? I just don&#x27;t feel like that should be an afterthought!
  
Sorry to rant a bit, just am confused as to why this is the case. Maybe I just learn differently than others, but I find slapping things in the REPL to be a very ineffective way of actually understanding the concepts. I&#x27;d much rather make mini-projects and experiment!

                              <span>In order to improve my Haskell skills im looking for suitable open source projects which I could contribute to. 
 Fp Complete lists one (1)! project: Stack as newcomer friendly, and the latest stack lssue tagged as such is from 2019, so it doesn&#x27;t seem as if this info is actively maintained.
 Any suggestions? I terms of skill-level i&#x27;ve done (almost) 3 advent of codes in Haskell, and made it to StateT in the Data 61 fp course.

This week I&#x27;ve been working on my writing skills. I have an essay in the style of an interview due in 20230320. It is well underway. The interview is done, the transcription is done, and the first cleanup is done.  I&#x27;ve relaunched my writing workflow. It worked great for a few days, but then personal and family commitments evaporated writing time. I&#x27;m not giving up, though.

                              <span>If I do (use-package mymode :defer t) and mymode.el has some autoloads in them, will the package get loaded when the autoloaded function gets called? 
 The use-package manual tells that the package loading gets deferred based on some other use-package settings (like :hook) but I don&#x27;t understand if the same applies if there&#x27;s no other use-package settings but only an autoload inside the script.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve got an editorconfig file that sets an indent_width, and it works just fine if I visit a file and run editorconfig-apply. But if I open a buffer and set it to the same major mode (csharp-mode in this case, but I see the same behavior in python-mode and json-mode) and call editorconfig-apply, the settings aren&#x27;t applied. Is this intended, or am I missing a setting somewhere?

 I don&#x27;t mind having the messages logged, in case I find time to investigate, but these are not pressing issues. (&quot;docstring wider than 80 characters&quot; -- in someone else&#x27;s code? Who cares?) It&#x27;s intensely irritating.

                              <span>I have used Tramp to browse remote servers happily for years. But my sysadmin and I were working on something just now that involved log files, which can grow to gbs in size. He mentioned how he uses a &#x3D;vim -view&#x3D; or something like that for browsing big files, which I know is a different mentality than Tramp. The default Tramp I&#x27;ve used always downloads a copy of the file (at least, I think it does) to generate the buffer -- which seems a problem with the big ones, since I&#x27;m recreating a local large too-large thing to maintain the buffer. Is there a way to tell Tramp that for some files I don&#x27;t want to recreate the thing -- just view/search/highlight in it? Or am I misunderstanding the situation completely?

                              <span>Hello there,
 When I try using &#x27;C-c C-w c&#x27; aka I want to create a new Eyebrowse window setup, I get the following:
 Debugger entered--Lisp error: (wrong-type-argument number-or-marker-p nil) eyebrowse-free-slot(nil) eyebrowse-create-window-config() funcall-interactively(eyebrowse-create-window-config) call-interactively(eyebrowse-create-window-config nil nil) command-execute(eyebrowse-create-window-config) 
 Anyone have any idea how to fix this?
 Thanks!

 Is this possible to define without appealing to Eq? I imagine that from a lambda calculus perspective, this should be possible by comparing lambda terms directly (supposing x, y have normal forms).

 # end:
 I have this code in the beginning of my file. Yesterday, it was asking me confirm the use of local variable and then works perfectly . However now there is no confirmation and when i save nothing happens. I used M-: to try function and it worked. It have happened before then i deleted, added, tried many things and it started to work suddenly even it was totally same. Do you had similar issue or do you know how can i debug? 
 p.s. : i&#x27;m noob to emacs and the code is from SO.

                              <span>Lately I&#x27;ve been trying to replicate my LaTeX setup for mathematical writing in org mode. I have been able to get everything working fine when it comes to LaTeX exports, but I would ideally like to also export to HTML.
 In many fields of mathematics it is common for papers to follow number conventions along these lines:
 1. Section one Theorem 1.1.  (1.2) Corollary 1.3 2. Section two Lemma 2.1. 
 In LaTeX I would typically achieve this behaviour by using the amsthm package, putting this in my preamble:
 \usepackage{amsthm} \numberwithin{equation}{section} \newtheorem{theorem}[equation]{Theorem} \newtheorem{corollary}[equation]{Corollary} \newtheorem{lemma}[equation]{Lemma} 
 Then LaTeX to produce the outline at the start of this post would look something like this:
 \section{Section one} \begin{theorem}  \end{theorem} \begin{equation}  \end{equation} \begin{corollary}  \end{corollary} \section{Section two} \begin{lemma}  \end{lemma} 
 This means that in org mode I can just add a few lines to my LaTeX preamble with header options and then just write:
 * Section one #+begin_theorem  #+end_theorem #+begin_equation  #+end_equation #+begin_corollary  #+end_corollary * Section two #+begin_lemma  #+end_lemma 
 However, I&#x27;ve been struggling to figure out how to replicate any of this functionality for the html export. I&#x27;ve been trying to read the code that exports to html to see if there&#x27;s a good place to hook in so I can add numbers, but I&#x27;ve been struggling to understand how any of it works.

                              <span>By default, the right abstraction is a bit of type safety around raw SQLite.
 That is sqlite-simple.
 By design, it will last at least a few decades without much of maintenance by the upstream developers due to not having much of anything on top of SQite. But, it has some type safety for marshalling data types. It also has a quosi quoter for long SQL queries.
 It exposes the full expressive power of SQLite. So, you won&#x27;t need to wait for the upstream developers.
 If you want to re-use composable query functions or your application needs to run on different kinds of databases, then you should at least have a look at libraries with higher abstractions, such as beam, squeal, persistent + esqueleto, and selda.
 beam is a bit more complex, but it exposes more SQL features than other higher abst…</span>

                              <span>I could swear I saw a package a while back for working with non-IO environment types interactively in ghci a while back. Something to run actions in a separate thread and pass the results back to the caller, so that it can maintain a persistent environment yet still be easy to user interactively in ghci.
 I couldn&#x27;t find anything like that with a quick search, so I started writing my own. It was very simple at first, but as I started addressing more and more edge cases where things could go wrong, I ended up with a lot of subtle things going on. It reached a point where I started wondering if I&#x27;m duplicating work, or if it would add value to put what I&#x27;ve done on hackage. So does anyone know if something is out there already?
 For the curious, my work is available at https://github.com/chowells79/shuttle/blob/main/src/Control/Shuttle.hs . I haven&#x27;t got it to release quality yet, as I&#x27;m not sure there is a need to. But I have addressed all the technical edge cases I could think of, which at least is interesting for the curious. (The naming is also not great at the moment, but that&#x27;s another separate issue.)

                              <span>TeXmacs is a scientific text editor with a high-quality typesetting engine, of course inspired by LaTeX and able to import/export it (with some limitations) and produce HTML, PS and PDF.

 After using it for a while, it became necessary for me to add quick coding experiments to certain documents. This plugin allows us to run GHCi sessions right inside the editor, which divides interactions into separate cells. This gives us extra capabilities such as re-writing and re-evaluating one or all prompts, deleting interactions, etc. Correct and re-run as many times as needed.

 I&#x27;ve somehow borked my configuration and orgmode tables no longer properly align... a super frustrating problem to have when dealing with large data sets.
 I wondered if the community had any ideas on how to fix this problem?

                              <span>Hey there,
 I don&#x27;t know about you, but trying to figure out how to actually configure Emacs for modern web development is a nightmare most of the time since nothing gets properly indented for React projects and the like without a ton of work involved (which absolutely should not be the case in the year of our Lord, 2023 --&gt; Hoping for the day that there&#x27;s like an &#x27;IDE Emacs&#x27; or some bs that just does this for you).
 That being noted, I found this small snippet to be amazing for anyone who configures React projects with using &#x27;.js&#x27; files like I do.
 Just wanted to share the source of the snippet, and the snippet itself, aka include this in your &#x27;web-mode&#x27; config and this should fix any indentation issues for the HTML type segments in the JSX &#x27;return&#x27; statement of any React based &#x27;.js&#x27; files in a React project.
 Related source link aka flooose&#x27;s answer:
 - https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/20016/no-html-jsx-indentation-in-jsx-mode/20055#20055
 ​
 Related snippet I borrowed for my own config:
 (add-hook &#x27;web-mode-hook (lambda () ;; short circuit js mode and just do everything in jsx-mode (if (equal web-mode-content-type &quot;javascript&quot;) (web-mode-set-content-type &quot;jsx&quot;) (message &quot;now set to: %s&quot; web-mode-content-type)))) 
 Hope this helps, thank God for StackOverflow.

                              <span>Available here: https://github.com/rkallio/ol-straight. ol-straight provides a way of constructing an org link that references a straight package. Use org-insert-link to insert a straight type link in to an org document. Opening said link will take you straight to the package&#x27;s homepage URL.
 When exporting a document with straight type links, the links will be exported using the https:// protocol. 
 This package is mostly useful for writing a literate Emacs configuration, where a reference to a package may take you to the package&#x27;s homepage.

Can anyone tell me what the emacs terminology is for the type of buffer shown for (bookmark-list) and any pointers to how the interactivity of lines in Bookmark List is achieved would be good.

                              <span>Hi All,
 I was able to created 3 more episodes of Discovering Emacs the past month and wanted to share them here, and hope some of you find it helpful. Here&#x27;s a brief overview of what was covered in last few episodes.
 Using Whitespace Mode (EP 4):
 Takes a look at Emacs&#x27;s whitespace mode and discusses how we can simplify its configuration to make it more applicable for most use cases.
 Making Incremental Search Work for You (EP 3):
 Shares some of the ways I utilize Emacs&#x27;s incremental search. In addition it makes some configuration recommendations that you might also find useful.
 Efficiency With The Mark Ring (EP 2):
 Discusses the differences between global and local marks. It also explains when and how marks are added to these mark rings. In addition, it also shares some configuration recommendations.
 As suggested by some members of the community, I also created an accompanied YouTube video for each episode of the podcast. YouTube Channel | Podcast Episodes 
 If anyone has topic recommendations, please feel free to share them here. I will definitely add them to my todo list, thanks!

                              <span>I&#x27;m new to emacs, and I&#x27;ve learned the basics, installed some packages, and configured it to my liking the last 2 weeks or so. I&#x27;m using the basic emacs keybindings (no evil).
 One thing that has repeatedly caused me some headaches, is custom keybindings, either for functionality of packages that don&#x27;t provide their own keybindings, or for custom functions. For instance,
  
I want to configure a binding for consult-line (searches for occurrences, lists them in consult, allows to jump to match), something I&#x27;m probably going to use frequently. So I go for &#x60;C-c slash&#x60; , vaguely inspired by vim, which I&#x27;ve used for a while in the past.
 I try it in my config file and it works.
 I want to use it in org mode and realize it&#x27;s already bound to something else there. Shit.
  
How to best avoid this &quot;in advance&quot;, such that it&#x27;s unlikely to happen in the future, even if I install more packages or use more modes? I guess letting my own commands start with &#x60;C-c&#x60; is a bad idea.
 I thought about starting all custom commands with something else, like &#x60;C-some_key...&#x60; where &#x60;C-some_key&#x60; kind of works as something like a personal leader key. But when I use the same leader/prefix key for all personal keybindings, no matter what they do, I feel this breaks the logic of the seperation that we have with &#x60;C-x&#x60; vs &#x60;C-c&#x60; for instance. Whereas using multiple such preface keys seems to escalate keybindings and memorization efforts.
 Also using C might be difficult, as C-something is already bound to a bunch of stuff (eg &#x60;C-v&#x60; for scrolling). What else would be a good option? How are experienced people handling their personal keybindings?
 EDIT made: clarified that the binding I was trying to use was C-c slash-key, somehow it only displayed C-c, which made it confusing

                              <span>Hi, I would like to build an Emacs configuration from scratch. I know there are some alternatives out there such as Prelude, Purcell&#x27;s Emacs.d, and Crafted Emacs but I would like to build my own.
 By modular configuration I mean a configuration in which things are split up in separate files. For example:
 ;; in the main init file: (require &#x27;php) (require &#x27;javascript) (require &#x27;dired) 
 If I don&#x27;t want to use Emacs to code in a certain language I can just comment out the require statement.
 I&#x27;ve noticed that people who built modular configurations did not rely on use-package and they just used the built-in features.
 I was wondering if it&#x27;s possible to build a modular configuration using use-package? I guess use-package is just a macro and what it does it groups things together. Right?
 I think what I need to do is to just put all those use-package chunks into separate files? For example, all dired related stuff into a dired.el file:
 (use-package dired :ensure nil :after all-the-icons-dired :bind (&quot;C-x C-j&quot; . dired-jump) :hook (dired-mode . all-the-icons-dired-mode) :custom (dired-auto-revert-buffer t) (dired-listing-switches &quot;-agho --group-directories-first&quot;)) (use-package dired-narrow :after dired :bind (:map dired-mode-map (&quot;/&quot; . dired-narrow))) (use-package dired-subtree :after dired :bind (:map dired-mode-map (&quot;&quot; . dired-subtree-cycle) (&quot;&quot; . dired-subtree-toggle))) (use-package all-the-icons-dired :after all-the-icons) 
 and PHP related stuff in php.el, so on.. even if the use-package stuff is just 3 lines of code in that file (I may add more stuff in that file in the future).
 I can go with a programming.el that contains all languages but I think having a separate file for each language is better because I can disable and enable the languages I want easier in main.el.
 Please share your thought about this. I would be grateful for any suggestion.

                              <span>New job, embedded software. They have a Linux build server with some homegrown toolchain based on llvm with a mix of makefiles, scons and custom scripts. Huge codebase.
 Development happens on Windows 10 per company policy. I think I can survive the hostile OS with some mix of git bash/msys2/wsl2. Most devs are apparently happy to use some proprietary commercial ide, some vscode, some qtcreator, some vim on the build server.
 I&#x27;d like to give emacs at least a try but I&#x27;ve grown accustomed to use either lsp-mode or more recently eglot with clangd backend. It usually works flawlessly with locally buildable smallish projects and sane build systems (be it autotools, cmake, meson, never really had an issue). 
 Problems I foresee:
  
generate compile_commands.json: hope I&#x27;ll be able to install bear on the build server and that bear will actually work
 separate dev environment and build server: could I maybe generate compile_commands.json in the linux build server and copy it and have it working on the windows dev machine? 
 emacs on windows, native or wsl2? in the latter case cmdline or with some xserver, which one? I just need a few packages, vertico, consult, marginalia, etc. Org-mode would be nice. I think I could live without magit, but that would be sad.
  
Do I have any chance to keep my usual workflow? should I give vscode a try and live happy(ish)?
 Is there maybe a dumber setup for code completions and symbol look up that doesn&#x27;t rely on clangd?

                              <span>Hi, newbie here. I am using Emacs and in particular Org mode for almost a month now. 
 I have some tex document that I want to copy-paste to canvas, but it is a bit of a pain because I need to change say $\tan (x)$ to \(\tan (x) \) and what I do is a bit silly and tedious doing it one by one, and that might be the only way to do it, but I was wondering if there was a quicker way to do it? 
 Thanks!

 (defun heading-date () (interactive) (org-insert-heading) (insert (format-time-string &quot;[%Y-%m-%d %a]&quot;)) ) (global-set-key (kbd &quot;&quot;) &#x27;heading-date) 
 I&#x27;d prefer that it always use a top-level heading, not the current heading level. I&#x27;ve read the fine docs but I can not figure out how to set a top-level (single *) heading.
 I know that I can just enter a literal * character. But is there a &quot;correct way&quot; to insert a specific-depth level heading in org-mode?
 Thank you.

                              <span>Hello, I receive this error:
 Symbol&#x27;s value as variable is void: package-archives
 Even though I have this code in the init.el:
 (add-to-list &#x27;package-archives &#x27;(&quot;melpa&quot; . &quot;https://melpa.org/packages/&quot;)) (setq package-archive-priorities &#x27;((&quot;melpa&quot; . 100) (&quot;gnu&quot; . 50) (&quot;nongnu&quot; . 25))) 
 I checked to see if anything evaluates at all in init.el so I added this code:
 (message &quot;It works.&quot;) 
 and I see the message &quot;It works.&quot; in the messages buffer. I have my HOME environmental variable set in Windows. Any idea what may cause that package archive error?

                              <span>This is how I usually grep -r &quot;some_text&quot; ./**/*.py
 Emacs requires specific output, so: grep --color&#x3D;auto -nH --null -re &quot;t&quot; ./**/*.js . However, emacs outputs ./**/*.js is not a file or directory.
 Edit: This has been explained in the comments (the shell expands GLOBs/*, emacs doesn&#x27;t)
 rgrep failed also!!, in the second prompt &quot;search for &quot;xxxx&quot; matching the wildcard:&quot; I can&#x27;t put *.js or *.py!!!! it&#x27;s limited to a few choices!
 I must be missing something stupid here!
 Edit: Yes, I&#x27;m missing something dumb. rgrep second prompt gives you possible choices for the wildcard. To write your own wildcard you need to actually choose what you wrote by going up with the arrow key! I&#x27;m on emacs 29 with doom. I hope this is just a bug, not a feature!

                              <span>Most tasks require you to have multiple buffers open at the same time. These could be multiple files, or other secondary buffers like magit or speedbar. If you need to have multiple files open at the same time, where do you like to have your main file?
 Note: 
  
if you have multiple monitors, I&#x27;m assuming emacs is in your main screen if you&#x27;re doing some heavy editing
 the poll has no options for multiple buffers stacked vertically (i.e., upper and bottom), but feel free to vote anyway and leave a comment

 emacs: writing to child signal FD: Bad file descriptor 
 I use the form above in a function to open a terminal on the current directory. Am I doing it wrong?
 start-process-shell-command doesn&#x27;t raise the error (but I don&#x27;t use it because on quitting Emacs kills the processes launched with start-process-shell-command).
 My OS is Emacs 28.2 running Fedora 37.
  
Update Maybe I&#x27;ve run into https://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug&#x3D;58960 as suggested on https://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/help-gnu-emacs/2022-11/msg00260.html. If I run M-x shell before evaluating call-process-shell-command no error is shown, indeed.

                              <span>I tried to find an inbuild function for searching for values inside list-variables but did not find one. Then I wrote one recursively, but as I expected it bloats to quickly to be used on longer lists.
 I also looked a bit into loading the list into a buffer and then searching for a regexp but I don&#x27;t want to load a buffer (maybe there is a virtual buffer, which is not visible or active in a sense? Or a temporary file to be searched?).
 So what is the best way to search a long list of symbols for a symbol in a program?
 ​
 Here is my humble attempt:
 (defun arg-is-in-car (arg cons-arg) (eq arg (car cons-arg))) (defun list-is-empty (list-arg) (not list-arg)) (defun arg-is-in-list (arg list-arg) (if (arg-is-in-car arg list-arg) t (progn (if (list-is-empty list-arg) nil (arg-is-in-list arg (cdr list-arg))))))

                              <span>Greetings to all. 
 It just so happened that my Intellij license ran out. Well, I decided to look towards the exotic, and so far I have stopped at emacs.
 There were several questions(In Emacs I&#x27;m a complete noob). If there are java developers who write in Emacs, I hope for their help (and configs :)).
 Actual questions:
 1) Which is better: build emacs from scratch or use doomEmacs as a starting point?
 2) Which lsp servers are better to install for Java (sometimes I also write in Scala)?
 3) Which plugins to install for Maven and Gradle? Will there be auto-completion? 
 4) Will it be possible to create and run projects directly from Emacs? (Not so important, but still)
 5) How is Spring? Is there a plugin that is analogous to Spring Tools?
 6) Which plugins should I use to integrate git, sql, markdown, xml?
 7) Which plugins should I use for database integration? Is there such a possibility at all? Interested in redis, postgresql.
 What I plan to use it for:
 1) Development of the backend part
 2) JavaFX development of home projects.
 3) Minecraft modding. Purely on the fan.
 Thank you in advance for your help.

                              <span>Please recommend resources (of any kind such as book, blog, youtube channel) to me to learn haskell. I am a CS student and do code in several different languages, as part of learning, haven&#x27;t done any project or industry work and I have very very weak grasp at maths (fine with relation and functions in maths now). I just started reading learn you a haskell for great good since yesterday. I don&#x27;t get what 5 /&#x3D; 5 means, 5/5 :&#x3D; 1 then why its says False? Haskell has module but not classes at all, right? Some important concepts to make a solid grasp on? I&#x27;m just curious about haskell and because it&#x27;s so different and bla bla bla. But where are actually its applications because I&#x27;m desiring to become a future haskell dev these days, please give me big solid reasons to stick to it. 
 Please be kind. Thank you so much.

                              <span>I just released brick-tabular-list-2.0.1.0 on hackage.
 Everything that bugged me in API and implementation has been corrected. Before 1.0.0.0, the API was convoluted. Before 2.0.0.0, the API and the implementation were a bit difficult to understand.
 Now, the API and the implementation are simple and easy to understand.
 It seems there will not be breaking changes for the next few decades.
 If you want a tabular list in terminal emulators, look no further. You have found it.

 I&#x27;m proud to be a mentor for GSoC 2023 where we&#x27;ll be working on improving the Scala webapp template.
 Feel free to take a look to my proposal, message me in case of questions: https://github.com/scalacenter/GoogleSummerOfCode/blob/main/README.md#scala-webapp-template
 Also, be sure to check the other proposals which have very nice projects and mentors.
