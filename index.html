                              <span>Hi, I am working on a project and I need to write a backend in Scala. I was thinking of using Scalatra but I read some posts and received some feedback indicating that Scala devs prefer a different stack. I remember encountering something like this in the Rust community where backends written in Rust often don&#x27;t use ORMs ( but there are ORMs available).
 Despite my best efforts, I keep finding new frameworks mentioned here in Reddit that I couldn&#x27;t find searching on my own. I&#x27;ve also noticed that a lot of articles about Scala are kind of old. How do you keep up with new libraries/frameworks? So I want to reach out to the community and ask: what kind of stack would you use as a backend?
 I am familiar with Postgresql, but it might be the case that in the Scala community there is a special DB framework (like Datomic is for Clojure). I like Functional Programming but I don&#x27;t want to use monads. I settle with a simple flavor of FP(like Elixir). I&#x27;ve read that effects are easier to use over monads and that Scala has support for effects but I am unfamiliar with the subject. Is it the standard library or is it an external library.
 Thank you for your time

                              <span>How do you best combine these?
 I can&#x27;t figure out whether to use the customize interface to set options, or elisp instead. It seems like its super easy to quickly set options and faces using customize, but not everything can be set using it, so then I need to figure out when to use it vs elisp
 It sounds like you can also customize a lot using just use-package. I was thinking of putting all settings related to a package in its use-package declaration, then using customize for emacs built-in options and faces. Then maybe I could use elisp for hooks, functions, and more complicated customizations.
 What do you folks recommend?

                              <span>This may be a controversial topic, and I know not everyone is keen on iOS. Having said that, there are plenty of Emacs/org users who are also iPhone users. This post is for Emacs/org users who are happy with this hybrid world of sorts.
 I&#x27;m the author of plainorg.com and have had a fair number of users requesting agenda capabilities (scheduling, custom filters, multi-file support, different kinds of views, syncing, the list goes on). The thing is, building great and polished experiences like these for org on iOS (and anywhere) does require non-trivial effort with lots of iterations to get to that great experience.
 How would you realistically kickstart it and fund it (adverts are not an option)?

                              <span>Hi! I&#x27;m playing around with awesomewm. My experience would be drastically improved if lsp would be able to show completions, documentations and definitions from awesome libraries. I thought adding awesome library path to LUA_PATH would make lsp recognize the path and scan it, and be able to autocomplete and other things with it, like it does with the default or local libraries. Is there a way to make it recognize and process the awesome libraries?

 Cloning from git and building from source I get &quot;org version mismatch&quot; error.
 From homebrew/cask I have emacs-mac where the *Warnings* buffer spews warning after warnning like reference to a free variable or function not defined or wrong usage of quotes... the list goes on. But finally ends with an Error invalid argument opening file.
  
HELP! PLEASE!!
 Let me add that I&#x27;m on a mac running macOS 12.4 Monterey.

 TL;DR Questions
  
How do I prevent an update from bringing back these unused variables if I fix it? Do I have to fork it? Is there a way to fork it and allow updates to still offer themselves to me so I can use a diff/patch sort of thing? 
 
Why do you think the author included those variables if they&#x27;re unused? Did they just forget? If you can help me figure out what they were intending to do, I&#x27;d like to put the variables to use or just delete the lines with the variable declarations.
 
 Background
 I just started playing with emacs, but I downloaded some evil mode packages because I mainly use vim. To that end, I installed evil-tex. It gave me a bunch of docstring wider than 80 characters warnings, so I did M-x find-library RET evil-tex and broke up all docstrings …</span>

 Has anyone else noticed this? ... when moving the cursor up or down (without changing the column) sometimes (not always) doom-modeline fails to update the line number. Doesn&#x27;t matter how long I wait, it doesn&#x27;t update.
 If I turn off doom-modeline, it all works again (just not so pretty).
 It&#x27;s not one of the laggy issues documented on the doom-modeline github page as the line number is never updated (ie not just slow). Also, I tried those fixes and it&#x27;s happening on local files, not tramp.
 When the column is updated (left or right movement) both line numbers and column numbers are both updated correctly.
 This is emacs-pgtk-29.1_2 and doom-modeline-20230811.236

                              <span>How do you best combine these?
 I can&#x27;t figure out whether to use the customize interface to set options, or elisp instead. It seems like its super easy to quickly set options and faces using customize, but not everything can be set using it, so then I need to figure out when to use it vs elisp.
 It sounds like you can also customize a lot using just use-package. I was thinking of putting all settings related to a package in its use-package declaration, then using customize for emacs built-in options and faces. Then maybe I could use elisp for hooks, functions, and more complicated customizations.
 What do you folks recommend?

                              <span>How come some changes I make to my .el config files can be changed and taken into effect after &#x27;eval-buffer&#x27;, but some not? I have a subfolder &#x27;settings&#x27; with mode/package specific settings that are loaded into my init file.
 Say I add a new keybinding to my *keybindings.el* in the &#x27;settings&#x27; directory:
 ;; new binding (global-set-key (kbd &quot;C-c a&quot;) &#x27;org-agenda) (use-package which-key :init (which-key-mode) :diminish which-key-mode :config (setq which-key-idle-delay 2)) (provide &#x27;key-bindings) 
 And in my *init.el* file I have this:
 (setq settings-dir (expand-file-name &quot;settings&quot; user-emacs-directory)) (add-to-list &#x27;load-path settings-dir) 
 Having added the keybinding and run *eval-buffer* inside the *keybindings.el* buffer, I can use the binding right away. If I however remove it from *keybindings.el* and eval-buffer again, it persist.
 What gives here? It seems that generally removing bindings isn&#x27;t able to be affected by evaluation since I&#x27;m able to change the keybinding illustrated above from &quot;C-c a&quot; to &quot;C-c p&quot; and the new binding works, but the old binding appears to still be bound to the function.

 Everything here looks good using the vhdl-mode Beautify feature, except for one thing, and that is the closing parenthesis. How can I change the closing parenthesis to be in alignment with the word port, so it looks like the following?
 entity tutorial_led_blink is port ( i_clock : in std_logic; i_enable : in std_logic; i_switch_1 : in std_logic; i_switch_2 : in std_logic; o_led_drive : out std_logic ); end tutorial_led_blink;

                              <span>symMaybeMap :: (t -&gt; Maybe t&#x27;) -&gt; Parser t (Maybe t) t&#x27; symMaybeMap f &#x3D; Parser matchSym where matchSym [] &#x3D; Left [Nothing] matchSym (x : xs) &#x3D; valFor (f x) xs valFor val xs &#x3D; case val of Nothing -&gt; Left [Nothing] Just res -&gt; Right (res, xs) 
 In short, I am trying to achieve a kind of filter and then map effect on Either type based on my parsing result in a same function. This helps me avoid using partial function or duplication of pattern matching for sum types. Example:
 identifierTokenParser :: TokenParser (String, Int, Int) identifierTokenParser &#x3D; first toParseError $ symMaybeMap getVal where getVal Info {val &#x3D; Identifier str, startRow &#x3D; row, startCol &#x3D; col} &#x3D; Just (str, row, col) getVal _ &#x3D; Nothing 
 If here I have used symIf and then fmap kind of thing then there should have been another pattern matching that was fully redundant.
 Just to give context I am pattern matching on programming language tokens:
 data Token &#x3D; Illegal | Identifier String | Integer String | StringVal String | -- Symbols Comma | Semicolon .... 
 I became curious if it is some standard technique we use and is there any mathematical structure hidden behind this?
 I am quite new to haskell so not sure of Haskell standard patterns.
 Thanks

                              <span>I have recently started using OpenAI-based MacWhisper to dictate notes. Perhaps many of you have used dictation for your notes, but I find that Whisper has extremely high quality and gets things like punctuation, hyphenation, capitalization and so forth correct even with my strongly Indian accent. One of the benefits I have seen from doing this is that my notes have become somewhat more conversational than before. I find this to be a benefit rather than something bad, because it seems to be capturing what I am thinking now somewhat better. Perhaps this conversational tone of the note might be more relatable a few years down the line, but that is just a guess.
All the whisper models of all sizes are free but Macwhisper provides a free way of accessing these for the three smallest models. If you want to use the larger models you have to pay a one-time fee of $20 to make that possible. Perhaps other free tools even with the large models will become available soon. In terms of privacy, one of the good things here is that the model is sitting on your computer so the data never leaves the computer and it seems safe even for private notes for that reason.</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;d like to create links to inline latex equation in org mode in a way that makes the referenced equation obvious just from looking at it, without actually following the link.
 Let me clarify this a bit. When I write a latex file, I can create an equation with a label &quot;myeq&quot;. Then when I compile the document, the equation is going to appear with a number next to it, and if I reference &quot;myeq&quot; in the text, the reference is going to turn into hyperlink with the number of the equation.
 In contrast, the closest thing I can do in org mode, is adding a #+NAME property to the equation, and referencing it with a standard org-mode link. This translates nicely to latex links if I export it to latex, however, it is sort-of inconvenient if I look at the file in org-mode because the #NAME property disappears when I compile the latex fragments, so I can&#x27;t tell which equation a given link is pointing to without following it.
 Any ideas how to solve this problem?

 I also find a face name: org-default, but when I try to change the font of that face, Emac output an error said that face is invalid.
 I have try to use this code from another question on this sub:
 (defun my/org-mode-font-configuartion () (face-remap-add-relative &#x27;default :font &quot;Fira Mono&quot; :height 130)) (add-hook &#x27;org-mode-hook &#x27;my/org-mode-font-configuartion) 
 But when I use M-x describe-face, the text portion still hasn&#x27;t changed. Any help would be appreciated.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been using ido-mode for many years now.
 Fido-mode seems like it might be more supported these days, especially since it also seems to apply to completing reads out-of-the-box, whereas I have horrible hacks in my init.el to use ido-mode too that way. And it seems to be a bit better about showing hints or supporting information than ido-mode. (E.g., showing me the character too and not just the unicode name when I tab-complete in C-x 8 RET.)
 But I can&#x27;t find an equivalent for how ido-mode will cache files and directories that I find things in (and save this in ~/.ido.last), and then, if I C-x C-f and start typing a file name that isn&#x27;t in the current directory but is in a cached file or directory, it will show the message &quot;Searching for foo...&quot; and then jump right to offering it after a brief pause (the ido-auto-merge-delay-time, I believe).
 Is there an equivalent to this for fido-mode? I looked at recentf-mode, but it seems like it&#x27;s separate functionality that must be manually invoked, rather than being able to integrate into fido-mode and provide smart filename completion support automatically.
 Am I missing something? Or should I just continue to stay on ido-mode? Thanks!

 I am a newbie in Emacs world.
 I am using Turkish keyboard layout. Normally, I make # sign by pressing  in my MacOS computer. But i cannot make it in Emacs. I am currently using EmacsPlus@29.
 I encounter the same issue in other subtle signs.
 I want to make Emacs keyboard layout same as system. It seems that they are same but as i said, some keys is not available.
 ​
 Can you help me?

                              <span>I have been using message to show the output of a dictionary. So the definition goes to the *Messages* buffer and the echo area.
 So far so good. But when the dictionary entry is too long, the echo area shows the bottom of the string. 
 Is it possible to force message to show the beginning of the definition instead? 
 I don&#x27;t want to truncate the string, as if the definition is too long, I can still inspect the *Messages* buffer.
 thank you for any help

                              <span>One can open an android APK as a project in Android Studio. If the APK has been installed on a mobile that has developer options enabled, it is then possible to get a log of what happens during the apps start up.
 Install the app on the mobile, ensure that the developer options are enabled. In developer options enable USB debugging. Connect the computer to the mobile with a USB cable. At first connection you will have to authorize (on the mobile) access from the computer. In developer options go to &quot;Select debug app&quot; and choose, say &quot;org.gnu.emacs&quot;. Also enable &quot;Wait for debugger&quot;.
 See the following web page: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16929391/android-how-to-debug-apps-start-up-process
 Check that you can access the mobile from the computer by running from the command line e.g.:
 - adb -d shell
 ls
 Now open the APK as a project in Android Studio, if you have not already done this. In the device manager (View &gt; Tool Windows &gt; Device Manager), select you mobile under &quot;Physical&quot;.
 Start emacs on the mobile. You should get a requester &quot;Waiting for debugger&quot;. In Android Studio select Run &gt; Attach to Process. This should open a debug console, but this window will probably only show that Android Studio connects to the app, but then loses the connection (because the app crashes).
 All is not lost: In the debug window select &quot;Logcat&quot; at the bottom. This will probably also not show a lot, but notice at the top of the window the text &quot;package:myapp&quot; or some such. Change this to &quot;package:org.gnu.emacs&quot;, and you should now hopefully see a crash log.

                              <span>Here is how I succeeded in building Android emacs with the libpng library. The process is described in the emacs repo file ./java/INSTALL, but here are some additional details. My initial build of emacs with this library crashed at start up. I will describe in a separate post how I debugged this.
 I browsed to https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/libpng and made a git clone of the repo. I then used magit to select branch android13-release. There was no Android.mk file in that branch, so I looked for it in older release branches. The newest release branch that had an Android.mk was nougat-release, so I copied that file outside the repo, went back to branch android13-release and moved Android.mk into the repo directory.
 I compared the file to Android.bp but saw essentially nothing that was needed to change. I set LOCAL_SDK_VERSION :&#x3D; 25, but am unsure if that variable has any significance. I eventually compared Android.mk to CMakeLists.txt, and discovered that I had missed a file needed in my_src_files_arm: arm/palette_neon_intrinsics.c
 Building without that extra source file caused no complaint from the build, but emacs crashed at start up.
 To build with the libpng library I added the following option to configure:
 --with-ndk-path&#x3D;$HOME/projects/android/libpng
 After the build it is a good idea to check that the expected library files are actually in the build directory:
 ls cross/ndk-build

 UPDATE:
 I was able to fix my problem thanks to Protesilaos Stavrou, you can find more here.
 ;Function only run in Org mode, to separate it with emac.

 The defface is really finicky, you must have &#x27;((&#x27; for it to work.

                              <span>My before-save-hook, when inspected in a buffer with golang code, has the value (lsp--before-save t ws-butler). Afaiu the t means the global hook&#x27;s value should be used too. I can switch to another buffer and (probably) see the global value.
 Is there a more convenient way to see the effective (local and global at once, maybe even combined) value for the current buffer?

                              <span>More specifically, it would be great to have two keys moving forward or backward between sections, or begin block, to their beginning position. As I found forward or backward paragraph considers more in the block than I thought, at which you need repeat a lot of times to move out one block, which is inconvenient.

                              <span>Hi, based on my online research, it seems that setopt functions similarly to setq, but for user-specific settings. Does this mean that it is safe to use setopt for all the variables listed under M-x customize-option?
 Also, if a variable is not specific to a buffer (buffer local), will using setopt set its value globally, similar to how setq-default works? I mean setopt knows when to use setq vs. setq-default behind the scenes?

                              <span>Hi folks -- I&#x27;ve had my Emacs installed with Nix home-manager, but I&#x27;ve been stuck with Emacs 28 for a while because of that. I wanted to give Emacs 29 a try (the nixpkgs update seems imminent as of writing though), but I couldn&#x27;t make the emacs-overlay to work out for me. I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;m doing something silly and incorrect -- but with Homebrew with emacs-mac, I can use &#x60;--with-mac-metal&#x60; and other flags such as &#x60;--with-no-title-bars&#x60;, which I don&#x27;t see how I can do that with Nix setup. I&#x27;m fairly new to Nix and very possible I&#x27;m not seeing something obvious.
 I&#x27;d like to hear opinions on how people install Emacs on macOS -- do you use Homebrew for apps including Emacs even if you use Nix, or do you stick to Emacs on Nix? What are some of extra flags I should be aware of?

                              <span>I&#x27;m reading the book FP Simplified and find this part confusing. The author said that this function is impure (reading username from standard input) :
 def getUsername: IO[String] &#x3D; ???
 I don&#x27;t think so because the function just returns a data structure describing the computation of getting username. Additionally, the function doesn&#x27;t return values such as IO(&quot;alvin&quot;) or IO(&quot;kim&quot;) but IO(d()) instead, while d() represents defered execution codes. Am I wrong ?

                              <span>Hello fellow emacs users :)
 Long time basic user here.
 I like to play online radios while I work on emacs. Have this bit of code to play them on emacs:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; (defcustom emms-radio-channels &#x27;() &quot;User defined online radio channels.&quot; :type &#x27;(repeat (cons (string :tag &quot;Name&quot;) (string :tag &quot;URL&quot;))) :group &#x27;emms)
 (defun emms-play-radio () &quot;Show candidates from &#x60;emms-radio-channels&#x27; on a completion buffer. Play the selection using EMMS.&quot; (interactive) (let ((channel (completing-read &quot;Channel: &quot; (mapcar #&#x27;car emms-radio-channels) nil nil))) (emms-play-url (or (cdr (assoc channel emms-radio-channels)) channel))))
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Then, I&#x27;m using use-package to load my module and customize the list of channels (short example)
  (use-package multimedia :ensure nil :custom (emms-radio-channels &#x27;((&quot;openFM - smooth jazz&quot; . &quot;https://stream.open.fm/60&quot;) (&quot;jazz radio funk&quot; . &quot;https://jazz-wr06.ice.infomaniak.ch/jazz-wr06-128.mp3&quot;) (&quot;bbc radio3&quot; . &quot;https://stream.live.vc.bbcmedia.co.uk/bbc_radio_three&quot;) (&quot;swingFM&quot; . &quot;https://swingfm.ice.infomaniak.ch/swingfm-128.mp3&quot;) (&quot;radioSky - jazz&quot; . &quot;http://listen.radioskymusic.com:7006/live&quot;) (&quot;soundtrack radio station&quot; . &quot;http://streamingp.shoutcast.com/JamendoLounge&quot;)))) 
 It works great but my list is way longer than that and it is a bit of a pain to add new streams to it.
 I&#x27;m wonder if there&#x27;s a way to convert standalone org links to a list like the above. I&#x27;m fairly sure there&#x27;s a way but I&#x27;m a newbie to org mode besides basic outline and babel functions.
 Thanks for your input!

                              <span>Hello. I&#x27;m looking for a way to make my config more modular. Now I have a structure like this:
 emacs/init.el emacs/configs/modes-config.el emacs/configs/core-config.el emacs/configs/ui-config.el 
 emacs/init.el:
 (setq user-init-file (or load-file-name (buffer-file-name))) (setq user-emacs-directory (file-name-directory user-init-file)) (eval-and-compile (add-to-list &#x27;load-path (locate-user-emacs-file &quot;config/&quot;))) (require &#x27;modes-config) (require &#x27;core-config) (require &#x27;ui-config) 
 But I want to add nested directories like this:
 emacs ├── init.el ├── core │ ├── autosave.el │ ├── backups.el │ └── init.el ├── modes │ ├── evil-mode.el │ ├── init.el │ └── org-mode.el └── ui ├── init.el ├── modeline.el ├── reset.el └── themes.el 
 emacs/init.el:
 (require &#x27;core) (require &#x27;modes) (require &#x27;ui) 
 emacs/core/init.el:
 (require &#x27;autosave) (require &#x27;backups) (provide &#x27;core) 
 emacs/modes/init.el
 (require &#x27;evil-mode) (require &#x27;org-mode) (provide &#x27;modes) 
 Is there any way to split my init.el into multiple files *and* directories?

                              <span>Hi, going to be honest, I set these configs a long time ago and I&#x27;ve just been using the same configs for years now. I have the following in my ~/.emacs file:
 (setq package-list &#x27;(auto-complete restclient go-mode exec-path-from-shell)) (require &#x27;package) (setq package-archives &#x27;((&quot;elpa&quot; . &quot;http://tromey.com/elpa/&quot;) (&quot;gnu&quot; . &quot;http://elpa.gnu.org/packages/&quot;) (&quot;marmalade&quot; . &quot;http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/&quot;) (&quot;melpa&quot; . &quot;https://melpa.org/packages/&quot;) (&quot;melpa-stable&quot; . &quot;https://stable.melpa.org/packages/&quot;)) (package-initialize) (unless package-archive-contents (package-refresh-contents)) (dolist (package package-list) (unless (package-installed-p package) (package-install package))) 
 I&#x27;ve redacted some lines, but I tried to show what I feel like is relevant to my problem.
 I do not have auto-complete installed and every time I attempt to install it, I get a &quot;Not Found&quot; response.
 The following is an example of my ~/.emacs.d directory:
 .emacs.d/ auto-save-list/ elpa/ archives/ elpa/ archive-contents/ gnu/ archive-contents/ 
 I don&#x27;t see any files (visible and hidden) or additional directories within any of the directories mentioned above.
 Does anyone possibly know the issue I&#x27;m running into?

 Edit:Just want to add that I&#x27;ve also tried the following in place of using setq:
 (add-to-list &#x27;package-archives &#x27;(&quot;elpa&quot; . &quot;http://tromey.com/elpa/&quot;)) (add-to-list &#x27;package-archives &#x27;(&quot;gnu&quot; . &quot;http://elpa.gnu.org/packages/&quot;)) (add-to-list &#x27;package-archives &#x27;(&quot;marmalade&quot; . &quot;http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/&quot;)) (add-to-list &#x27;package-archives &#x27;(&quot;melpa&quot; . &quot;https://melpa.org/packages/&quot;)) (add-to-list &#x27;package-archives &#x27;(&quot;melpa-stable&quot; . &quot;https://stable.melpa.org/packages/&quot;))

                              <span>So basically, I want to export my notes which have relative images attached to them, which works really well when I am using it with just org mode. But now I have to export the notes to pdf to share it with the instructor. So I basically want the images to be explicitly embedded in the pdf file, and not a hyperlink pointing to the image.I am getting the desired results by removing the metadata while linking the image in the org file, like just doing [[./filename.png]]. I wanted to know whether there was some way to make this emacs&#x27; default behavior?
 I use pandoc to convert org to pdf directly. Pandoc uses pdflatex on the backend.
 Thanks for your time.

                              <span>I regularly move away from Emacs to check something else quickly, eg a simple google search.
 I have keybinds for searching Google from Emacs but I don&#x27;t have a nice way of going back without a mouse or showing all windows and then selecting Emacs.
 Ive used auto hotkey in the past to accomplish something similar, has anyone come up with a better method/found a better tool?
 Ideally I&#x27;d like to press C-x o since that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m used to in Emacs but I&#x27;m open to other keybinds.

                              <span>Emacs&#x27; cut/copy/paste bindings aren&#x27;t that terrible. Personally, I got used to them in quite a short time.
 However, problem arises when one is too used to those bindings. How many closed tabs in Firefox, oh boy.
 But we are on Emacs, there&#x27;s a solution for everything, some less practical than others:
  
Remapping C-x and C-c maps is quite a chore, since AFAIK many features are hard coded to those prefixes.
 
CUA mode is also not preferable since C-c and C-c are highly used prefixes
 
Having cut/copy/paste globally bound to different common keys could be an option, however binding settings are relative to specific application or graphical toolkit
 
 What are your experiences in this regard?

Everything is working fine (code navigation, completion, documentation etc) except code formatting. When I do eglot-format on a region of code with very long lines, nothing happens. I also have yapfify-mode installed in Emacs and if I do yapfify-region it works as it should.
 When I check the Eglot events buffer I can see a client request for rangeFormatting but the server reply with a result nil, it seems python-lsp-server does not pickup yapf to do formatting.
 Do I need to do additional configuration in Emacs to get python-lsp-server to use yapf and perform code formatting?

 N.B. These are not necessarily agenda files but archival files, or project notes in org-mode.

                              <span>tldr: I think Emacs 29 is slower than 28 so I downgraded it. 
 Longer version: I have 2 Apple laptops, one super new, the other super old. I ran either 29 or 30 on them in the past months. In the last couple of weeks I focused on the 29 branch, running the pretests and as of last week, installed the official 29.1.
 I guess I began to see slowness or lagging, since I explicitly began a bankruptcy on the older laptop - initially thinking I have too much packages. Everything was lagging: browsing org files, startup times, describe-variable took couple of seconds to return results, M-x completion with vertico had a noticeable lag with each key press, key press latency in writing, eglot jumping to definitions. So much so that I really started thinking about replacing my old laptop.
 Yesterday I decided that I want to test whether it&#x27;s due to Emacs. I reverted back to 28.2 on both laptops. It was night and day. The new laptop flies; the old laptop runs smoothly so I even reverted the bankruptcy, adding back all the packages I removed and it&#x27;s still as smooth as I remember Emacs running in the past. 
 This is not a bug report. It&#x27;s my own observation, running multiple versions of Emacs on old and new hardware, sometimes compiling from source, sometimes downloading from https://emacsforosx.com/. I just want to raise awareness, see if people have a similar experience. If enough evidence arises, perhaps someone who knows what they&#x27;re doing can run benchmarks or profiling and we&#x27;ll go from there.

                              <span>As i&#x27;m getting my Emacs config closer and closer to where i want, it inevitably starts &quot;behaving weird&quot;. This is something i&#x27;ve struggled with again and again, and it has, once or twice, lead me away from emacs. But now i want to understand this:
 What is the proper order to configure and load stuff in my config, so that everything works correctly?
 Currently i&#x27;m facing an issue with standard-themes. Normally, themes are what i put below &quot;emacs internal configs&quot; but at the top of my &quot;external packages&quot;. But the standard-themes-light theme doesn&#x27;t load correctly. Centaur tabs are dark, org-mode code blocks aren&#x27;t proplerly backgrounded. If i switch themes after starting emacs, and switch back to standard-light, everything is fine. I tried loading the theme as the last thing in my init.el, but that didn&#x27;t change the behavior.
 This is only one issue currently. I&#x27;ve had others in the past.
 Since i&#x27;m pretty new to writing my emacs config from scratch, could some of the &quot;veterans&quot; explain what i should be putting where? Does splitting the config into a few files help? What&#x27;s the &quot;best practice&quot; here?

                              <span>I havent used Emacs on a Mac in a year or two so I don&#x27;t remember if I&#x27;ve had this problem in the past but I am fof the next couple of weeks and I&#x27;m running into some annoyances with short cut clashes. 
 Notably Emacs search and replace (M-%) instead triggers the Mac OS screen shot until. 
 For those of you on a Mac which are you rebinding in this situation? The os shortcut or Emacs. 
 I though I had set the command key to not get passed to the os but that doesn&#x27;t seem to fix the issue.

                              <span>So I am currently a Java engineer writing basic CRUD stuff with spring boot. Spring provides all of the boilerplate to talk to the DB, provide HTTP endpoints, .. There&#x27;s no concurrency involved and it&#x27;s pretty basic stuff.
 Cats-effect is marketed as a &quot;pure asynchronous runtime&quot; while ZIO provides &quot;type-safe, composable asynchronous and concurrent programming&quot;.
 Both of these put quite the emphasis on &quot;asynchronous&quot; and &quot;concurrent&quot;, which makes me wonder: 
 Say I want to do what I do now, the basic HTTP crud stuff, but with Scala, is it overkill to go for http4s or zio-http?

                              <span>I was looking for a good language to implement a personal project I have (a search engine). After listening to Martin Odersky&#x27;s talk &quot;Simply Scala&quot; at ScalaIO Parris 2022, I decided to give Scala a try. I practiced some Scala 3 and everything worked great. So far I really like the language. I am at the stage of selecting the libraries that I will use for the project. I wanted to implement the backend in Scala but after I stumbled with the Lift framework and after reading other posts on Full Stack Scala, I really want to give it a try. Specially since my UI is going to be simple. I was thinking of using Scalatra for the backend and maybe Lift in the front end (if the UI gets complex enough). But I noticed that both frameworks only have stable versions that are compatible with Scala 2. This article (https://medium.com/@takezoe/scalatra-now-supports-scala3-4eb8988484a7) claims that Scalatra supports Scala 3. It makes sense, since (as I understand) Scala 3 is binary compatible with Scala 2. But the Scalatra docs only covers the Scala 2 version. There are no docs for the Scala 3 version. Is this because there is no meaningful difference between the APIs of the two versions? I also read a post that mentioned that Akka did not fully support Scala 3( I tried finding it again to link it here but I couldn&#x27;t find it). This gives me the impresion that Scala 3 is still not supported by most libraries.
 I have not tried to run any test projects because I still need to learn how to use sbt (I started learning Scala a couple of days ago). But I got cold feet. Before I proceed, in order to spare myself unnecessary hurdles, I would like some advice. Should I learn Scala 2 and wait until the ecosystem migrates to Scala 3? Or is it recommended to stick to Scala 3 and work around the few incompatibilities that some frameworks might have?

                              <span>I&#x27;m starting to think about various options for setting up a git repository for my org-roam documents. I don&#x27;t have anything ultra sensitive in there, but generally speaking it&#x27;s not intended for public consumption.
 I&#x27;ve thought of just making a private GitHub repository for it, but I&#x27;m a little apprehensive about doing that as I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if my notes somehow make their way into training data for large language models.
 What are some solutions that you folks use?

                              <span>I realize that this question might seem trivial, but I&#x27;ve been pondering something. When I initiate org-capture, I select a predefined template, and then the screen splits horizontally. The lower half of the screen is where I input the content I&#x27;m capturing. I&#x27;m wondering if it wouldn&#x27;t be more convenient to have the capturing process take up the entire window instead of being split. Is there any specific purpose for the upper area during the capturing process?
 I&#x27;m curious if there&#x27;s a customizable variable for this, and I would greatly appreciate your suggestions on the matter.

                              <span>Hi all. I&#x27;m having trouble logging in to a remote computer when setting csh as a default shell. I&#x27;ve turned on tramp-debug to 6 and the issue seems to be that Emacs sends the following hardcoded command in tramp-sh.el  &quot;exec env TERM&#x3D;&#x27;%s&#x27; INSIDE_EMACS&#x3D;&#x27;%s&#x27; &quot; &quot;ENV&#x3D;%s %s PROMPT_COMMAND&#x3D;&#x27;&#x27; PS1&#x3D;%s PS2&#x3D;&#x27;&#x27; PS3&#x3D;&#x27;&#x27; %s %s -i&quot;) 
 With the expectation that the shell output is controlled by the variables PS1, PS2, PS3 etc.
 However, from the man pages of csh, the prompt output is controlled by prompt, prompt2 and prompt3. Does emacs tramp have a way to address this? 
 I&#x27;m running GNU Emacs 28.2 (build 2, x86_64-w64-mingw32) of 2022-09-13 from windows. Again the issues seems that the csh that I&#x27;m trying to set as remote does not use PS1, PS2, PS3 and emacs has it hardcoded.

                              <span>Hi,
 user@host ~/org % file inbox.org misc.org inbox.org: data misc.org: Unicode text, UTF-8 text, with very long lines (1289) user@host ~/org % 
 Somewhere in inbox.org is at least one character that makes &quot;file&quot; think that it&#x27;s not a text file.
 In GNU Emacs 27.1, both files are shown as &quot;utf-8-unix&quot; in my modeline.
 So the issue with this wrong classification is not within Emacs but within some shell foo I&#x27;m doing outside of Emacs.
 Except the obvious bisect-remove-until-found-method: is there a clever (Emacs-)way to locate the character(s) that cause this?

                              <span>Thanks to the answers from my last question, I now have a cleanly-built and installed 29.1 on my Ubuntu 22.04 system. And as I get ready to explore some of the new features, I&#x27;m looking at my configuration with a wary eye; I&#x27;ve been using emacs (GNU, then XEmacs, then back to GNU) since my sophomore year of college (1987!), and my config shows it. Bloated, spaghetti-like, split among 15-16 files, etc.
 So, I&#x27;m deciding to take the &quot;configuration bankruptcy&quot; plunge and try to (mostly) restart from scratch. Yank almost everything out and start adding things back as I actually need them, not just because they look cool (and generally never get used).
 Those of you who&#x27;ve done this: any advice? I keep my config in GitHub, so for now I&#x27;m just creating a new branch to experiment on. I&#x27;m mostly concerned with not losing my history and desktop-mode settings.
 Edit: Just to clarify, despite the longevity I&#x27;m not really a &quot;power user&quot;. So there are a lot of features that I don&#x27;t come close to making the most of (Magit, etc.). My hope is that by cleaning this up and tightening things a little, I can grow into some new features.

                              <span>Using org-mode and mu4e. When I use emacs client as opposed to emacs-gtk and reply to a message by hitting R, typing the words I want to send and then going C-c C-c, the message sends andthe frame disappears. Then I have to invoke a new client to carry on with my stuff.
 I thought maybe C-c C-s might be my saviour but that just moves the cursor to the subject line and a mention in the echo area of a mark being set. 
 Obviously using emacs-gtk would be a work around, but I have not a clue why the client should be behaving this way. Your friend and mine, Google, has failed to furnish me with any viable clues.
 Help?

 I would like to improve my workflow for debugging any suggestions for packages or setups would be great.

 A couple of questions
 I seem to remember being able to hotkey from error to error on the output of the compilation at one time rather than using up-downs... how to you do this?
 Every time I compile I end up with yet another pane, I would like to fix the panes to left half full height edit and the make results on the right in a split plane. I know how to split panes but as I am compiling on the left I would like to have the results end up on the right pane... not overtake the left pane.
 Any other suggestions would be great.
 Kind regards for your help.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve googled this every way I can, but no dice. When I use emacs -nw while ssh&#x27;d from one Mac into another, everything works fine until I switch to another app on the local machine. At first I thought it was Cmd-Tab that was doing it, so I tried just clicking other apps, but the problem remains.
 It appears that any clicks I do in other apps are somehow registering inside of emacs in the terminal. Specifically, when I switch to another app, the emacs buffer also switches to another one. And usually when I click on something in another app (even the preferences app for Terminal itself), the Terminal will randomly insert I and O in whatever buffer is selected.
 Running Emacs 29.1, installed via homebrew. And I&#x27;ve had this issue on an older mac running Big Sur as well as a newer mac running a more recent OS, both ssh-ing into an M1 MacBook pro with all my files on it. 
 Ideas?

 any tips on figuring it out?

                              <span>justl is a major mode for driving justfiles. Justfiles are a way to save and run project-specific commands. Think of them like Makefiles, but they are purely focused on running commands and processes, and not for a build system.
 This mode gives the ability to execute just recipes from within the editor itself.
 The new release with the changelog details here: https://github.com/psibi/justl.el/blob/master/Changelog.org#013
 The major highlight in this release is support for TRAMP. Links with more details:

 As I am a novice, some info here might be wrong or misleading, but this is my best effort.
 Instructions for how to build Android emacs are in the emacs repo, in file java/INSTALL.
 I am using Ubuntu, so these instructions are Ubuntu specific, but should be easily adaptable to other linux based distributions. Note that Android Studio, Android SDK, Android NDK can be downloaded from the software provider, if they are not available in your linux distributions package manager.
 I first installed Android Studio. It is available in the Ubuntu snap store:

                              <span>Hi,
 ​
 I am writing a book and have over 250 plaintext files on the computer (all mailed from an app on the phone), about 20 are in org-mode.
 --- The mess ---
 - Snippets are unorganised in every way (made as I come up with them, jumping all over the place in the book-to-be, etc)
 - Each note contains multiple snippets, each of the snippets is divided by a marker.
 - Each snippet&#x27;s size can be a single line or multiple paragraphs.
 Each of the notes is named note-.txt
 --- The draft 0 ---
 Now I&#x27;m compiling the book&#x27;s draft zero out of the snippets, choosing some snippets, rejecting others from the same note.
 It&#x27;s daunting to see what I&#x27;ve left to do and what not, while not having much of an overview of the whole thing.
 ​
 Current workflow:
 - Placing &#x27;ACCEPTED--&#x27; in front of a snippet/org-header
 - Going over one file after another, when one is completely done with, put it folder &#x27;done&#x27;
 - Also, when snippets are big, I make the whole note into an org file, and can have some overview.
 ​
 --- The question ---
 I&#x27;m thinking of putting each snippet in their own file (via UNIX &#x27;sed&#x27; command) and have org-roam take care of the administration of the status (unread/accepted/rejected/need2ndview/need3rdview).
 Is this use-case something org-roam is capable of/handy for, and if not, what (package) would be advisable?
 ​
 TIA

                              <span>Hi,
 I know Emacs on Windows is always slow. But with 29.1, it seems much slower. Interestingly, I feel it is only slow at start-up or when you first use some function in a session. Once it is started or you have triggered the function, everything runs smoothly.
 Any idea why?

                              <span>We have a project with the backend in Haskell (basically a Servant-based CRUD app with a bit of extra data ingress and egress through AWS SQS and some background tasks for sending out emails etc.).
 This is an early product, basically a prototype we have been running with a key customer (soon two) but we have really strong interest and now need to start upping the pace of delivery.
 The current team has some great support from an experienced Haskeller, but only part-time, which has allowed them to get this far but we now need a full-time contractor to come on board and accelerate the project.
 If you have experience shipping actual products built in Haskell, especially in startups (or, at least, early in the project&#x27;s lifecycle), then please drop me a line (here or by email: gideon@converge.io). I would prefer freelance contractors to big consultancies. We are UK-based, additionally, which means we would prefer someone on UK+-2h timezone (but for the right person we can be flexible).
 (&quot;We&quot; is [https://www.converge.io](Converge), a ConTech startup trying to make the construction industry more efficient and sustainable by digitising the physical reality of the job site, starting with concrete -- which accounts for ~8% of all global carbon emissions, not to mention other types of environmental damage!)

                              <span>Hi all! I&#x27;m looking for ways - both technical-wise and organizational-wise - to set up org agenda. I&#x27;ve familiarized with org quite a bit now but getting into the agenda seems overwhelming every time I try to approach it. 
 I&#x27;d like to know good resources and opinionated usage examples. 
 Moreover, I&#x27;d like to know if org-ql is meant to be an extension or a replacement of org&#x27;s standard filter predicates. Org agenda&#x27;s built in filter predicates look quite cumbersome and I&#x27;d like to know if it would be possible to configure org agenda by just using org-ql languages or if I&#x27;m gonna need to use it anyway.
 Thanks in advance

                              <span>In OneNote I can do simple equations like 2+2&#x3D; 
 Once I press space after the &#x3D; sign it will automatically auto-complete the correct answer. 
 So essentially you can do simple equations in OneNote without bringing out a calculator. 
 Can we do this in Emacs Org Mode? 
 If we can&#x27;t its fine as it&#x27;s not a deal breaker or anything but I am just curious. 
 If my explanation of the feature I want isn&#x27;t good enough here is the Microsoft webpage where they explain it. https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/office/insert-and-calculate-simple-math-equations-in-onenote-6d8346d3-2c1e-490b-bcbb-f739d9323e1b

                              <span>I managed to do something in my config file to cause this org version mismatch error. This is emacs 29.0.92 built from source. I&#x27;m doing the literate config thing so my init.el is simply:
 (org-babel-load-file (expand-file-name &quot;config.org&quot; user-emacs-directory)) and my config is in config.org. 
 Googling this error says to specify my load-path before org gets loaded. I don&#x27;t know where org gets loaded - I don&#x27;t have a use-package org anywhere. Nor do I have a load-path. So I don&#x27;t know how to even start pin pointing what I did wrong.
 Would this have been better in r/emacs?

                              <span>Back when I started using Emacs a few years ago, I went all out and added tons of stuff to my setup. But as time passed, I realized I hardly use most of those packages. Nowadays, I&#x27;m keeping it minimal and sticking mainly to Org mode.
 I&#x27;m thinking of setting up a capture template for my journaling, kind of like this:
 &quot;j&quot; &quot;Journal entry&quot; entry (file+olp+datetree &quot;~/orgfiles/journal.org&quot;) &quot;** %^{Heading}&quot;) 
 The downside of this approach is that everything will end up in a single file, which might grow over time and become challenging to manage. However, I can archive all the journal entries at the end of the year and starting fresh annually to counter this.
 I&#x27;ve been thinking about whether it&#x27;s worthwhile to use a separate package, since org-journal appears to generate a similar date tree.

                              <span>I have org-latex-classes set up to support the memoir class:
 ((&quot;memoir&quot; ... (&quot;\\chapter{%s}&quot; . &quot;\\chapter*{%s}&quot;) ... )) 
 However, in the case of \chapter* I want to pass the section title to the exporter twice, once as a required argument and once as an optional argument. (I.e. \chapter*[title]{title}.) This is because the optional argument is necessary for memoir to put the chapter title in the running header.
 If I try \\chapter*[%s]{%s} it of course fails with org-export-data: Not enough arguments for format string. Is there a straightforward way to achieve what I want? Has anyone found another way to get running chapter headings working with memoir?
 (This is with Org mode version 9.6.7.)

                              <span>Given following function with 3 parameters:
 def foo(a: A, b: B, c: C): D &#x3D; ??? 
 If we know that a changes rarely, we can kind of curry it using OOP:
 class Foo(private val a: A): def foo(b: B, c: C): D &#x3D; ??? 
 Now, what are reasons to change, say, c to implicit like this:
 class Foo(private val a: A): def foo(b: B)(using c: C): D &#x3D; ??? 
 My thoughts so far:
  
Capability. Like CanThrow or DbTransaction - indicating function requires special scope for evaluation - e.g. scope catching specific exceptions or scope running database transaction, committing or aborting it in the end.
 Mutable data - to keep our class Foo immutable, we can pass so-called Context containing mutable stuff - caches for example.
 Stateful objects with lifecycle - if C has close() method, we have following options: a) pass c via Foo&#x27;s constructor and add close() to Foo, making it mutable b) pass c as ordinary parameter which clutters client code without much benefit c) use context function that provides implicit C in scope and closes C when it leaves the scope.
  
I&#x27;m calling out for other people&#x27;s experience - which of those are good ideas? Which are not-so-good ideas? May be there are other considerations?
 This is about dependency management, I would like to leave other uses of implicit parameters out of scope of this discussion.

 I have &#x27;name&#x27; variable that should be initialized in &#x27;init&#x27; method and used in &#x27;run&#x27; method. This variable may not be initialized, so I declared it as Option.

 Is there an way to avoid using var in this case?

                              <span>Why link statically against musl?
Have you ever faced compatibility issues when dealing with Linux
binary executables? The culprit is often the libc implementation,
glibc. Acting as the backbone of nearly all Linux distros,
glibc is the library responsible for providing standard C functions. Yet, its
version compatibility often poses a challenge. Binaries compiled with
a newer version of glibc may not function on systems running an older
one, creating a compatibility headache.
So, how can we circumvent this issue?
The approach we’ll focus on today involves the creation of static executables. These
executables are self-contained and do not dynamically load libc,
thereby offering enhanced portability.
However, we’re not out of the woods yet. Glibc is
not well-suited for static linking becaus…</span>

I know some programming, but I would rather start from a resource that assumes no background.
 I&#x27;ve also been told by many around the web that it&#x27;s better to start with another programming language then go to Haskell, is that true?
 And yes, I have read the sidebar, LYAH doesn&#x27;t have exercise so that&#x27;s a pass, Real World Haskell has barely no exercises while being quite long and seems quite advance which is also a pass from me, School of Haskell is too short, while suffering from a mixture of the last two. 
 The only three promising resources(for my learning style, which is text-based w/ exercises) Haskell from the Very Beginning by Whitington, the Haskell Wikibooks and Learn Haskell by Building a Blog Generator by Gilmi.
 Any advice regarding those resources is appreciated.

 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Now in the scotty code I just want to get all the ids (preferably a list of ints).
 I thought I could just use &quot;param&quot; and get the list of values as text, but it turned out I only got the first one.
 Code for getting the first one:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 get &quot;/add-entries&quot; $ do ids &lt;- param &quot;id[]&quot; :: ActionM Text text ids

 Does anyone know how I can achieve getting all of them?

 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;haskell import System.IO (stdin, hReady, hSetBuffering, hSetEcho, BufferMode(NoBuffering)) import Control.Monad (when)
 main :: IO () main &#x3D; do hSetBuffering stdin NoBuffering hSetEcho stdin False loop
 loop :: IO () loop &#x3D; do key  getKey&#x27; &quot;&quot;
 getKey&#x27; :: [Char] -&gt; IO [Char] getKey&#x27; xs &#x3D; do ready &lt;- hReady stdin if ready then do x &lt;- getChar getKey&#x27; (x : xs) else return xs
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

                              <span>I have defined a data type and want to make it an instance of ToJSON and FromJSON. The ToJSON part is very easy, but I don’t know how to do define the FromJSON instance:
 data InputType &#x3D; Name | Select | Date | Textarea deriving Show instance ToJSON InputType where toJSON Name &#x3D; String $ pack &quot;name&quot; toJSON Select &#x3D; String $ pack &quot;select&quot; toJSON Date &#x3D; String $ pack &quot;date&quot; toJSON Textarea &#x3D; String $ pack &quot;textarea&quot; 
 How would the FromJSON instance look like?
 Edit: Thanks for all your answers!

                              <span>I had a bit of an emacs hiccup and needed to remove my straight/repos and rebuild. 
 I noticed that org is being cloned despite me having
  
(straight-use-package &#x27;org) 
  
early in my init. And 
  
(use-package org 
 :straight (:type built-in)
  
Before I rush into spewing out config, I know this was an issue in the past, but is there a simple solution I&#x27;m missing? What could be causing it? 
 My emacs 29.1 has org built in. I guess I should also be asking if using the built in is correct in a straight.el environment.

                              <span>How is your experience with Dap-Mode so far? Have you been able to use it as your daily development tool for debugging? If so, is it stable for you?
 ​
 Background, I failed to set it up properly a couple of times. Once I set it up, then I experienced buggy behavior (like losing connection with the debug server when stepping through the code). Today, I decided to check out its latest state and hit another bug.
 This is the only config I made for python and I am on Doom Emacs
 (require &#x27;dap-python) (setq dap-python-debugger &#x27;debugpy) 
 and install the server in my environment
 pip install debugpy 
 I will give it another go for this week to see if it is stable.
 EDIT: Another issue (related to doom) I just came across is company completion in dap-ui-repl doesn&#x27;t work. Maybe doom is the problem :/

 When I try to open magit-status buffer with window1 or window2 active, it splits the terminal window horizontally to display it.
 How can I prevent this to happen? I want it the magit-status buffer to open in the bigger windows. If window is active, it would open in window2, and vice versa.
 I tried to use a different magit-display-buffer-function but it seems there isn&#x27;t one to do that. The closest one I found would open the magit buffer over the current active buffer.
 I also tried to use winner-mode, so I could hide the terminal window before using magit-status by using winner-undo, but since I move between many windows, using the undo got confusing. Maybe there&#x27;s a way to quickly toggle a window in the frame?

 My rough first draft is actually working, but the trouble is, running the AppleScript that collects the window list is very slow. It completes immediately outside of Emacs and in an Emacs shell. However, when I run it with call-process-shell-command, shell-command-to-string, or from a process started with make-process, it takes 2-5 seconds. 
 What’s happening? How can I improve the performance?

                              <span>Before emacs 29 I could easily use &quot;(&quot; to show details-mode and there was one line, above all files list, with the total used by those (non directory) files in the current directory.
 Listing files with ls and eshell/ls shows the total and with &quot;emacs -q&quot; the behavior is the same, so I know it&#x27;s not a package issue. I can&#x27;t find anything in the NEWS file that justifies this change in behavior. 
 Does anyone know how to fix this?

                              <span>I would classify myself as an intermediate elisp coder and would like to write a new package. I&#x27;ve found a small handful of tutorials and guides out there for how to write packages, but wanted to solicit opinions from the community about whether there are any good 1) tutorials or 2) example projects to draw from when starting fresh. I&#x27;m bound to make some mistakes but would like to start off on the right foot if there&#x27;s some best practices out there that folks find helpful.
 Thanks!

                              <span>With Zotra, you can get a bibliography entry from a url or a search identifier (DOI, ISBN, PMID, arXiv ID). You can even add a bookmark to you browser so that when you click it, the bibliography information of the webpage you&#x27;re visiting would be saved in some bib file. You can also get the links for attachments and download them from Emacs.
 This is done using Zotero translators, so it basically has the full power of Zotero. There is no need for the Zotero client, but it needs to connect to either Zotero translation server or zotra-cli as the backend.

 So, I wasn&#x27;t going to post this here but somebody bugged me enough to do it (again) and post this story about how I came to use Emacs as a non-coder.
 Enjoy. 🙃

                              <span>I am currently using spacemacs with the tree-sitter layer enabled. My emacs version is compiled so that native treesit should work, and I am indeed able to apply (for example) &#x60;python-ts-mode&#x60; to a python file and get all the treesit functions to work.
 As far as I understand it, the tree-sitter layer is using the external package, which has some disadvantages. What is the right way to transition from the external package to the native one? Disabling the layer seems to have other implications and the transition is not natural (for example, I don&#x27;t see my python-mode hooks apply to python-ts-mode). 
 I know this is a bit general, but perhaps someone has experience making the transition specifically with spacemacs?

I&#x27;m aware that the following is not new. It&#x27;s probably part of Plato&#x27;s Collected Works, book 7 or so.
The elements of programming, according to Abelson and Sussman (Structure and interpretation of computer programs, 2nd edition, Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press. (1996), page 4)
Primitive Expressions: represent the simplest entities of the language;
Means of Combination: building compound elements from simpler ones;
Means of Abstraction: naming and manipulating compound elements as units.
When techies lament that everything is &quot;abstractions upon abstractions&quot;, they lament the result of doing the process of combining small things into larger things, and then tre…</span>

                              <span>Has anyone managed to get links to images display inline? It&#x27;s a really cool feature that was added 2 years ago,
 for example:
  [[https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29655971/258917459-fd279e8f-61c8-4dfa-96b4-8edaa8a6378d.png]] 
 However, on doom emacs I can only get images that point to local files to display inline.

 I&#x27;ve tried changing (setq org-display-remote-inline-images t) variable to t and &#x27;cache (it&#x27;s &#x27;download by default) but to no avail.

 Do you guys really think scala is a good fit for the web or it&#x27;s just your tendency to be a single weapon samurai or smth?

                              <span>Hello!
 I’m an Emacs newbie. I’m on macOS (Emacs 29.1 with native comp and pixel scroll). I want to use Emacs for managing a lot of my Markdown notes in a specific folder, and also implements Org-Mode. I have thousands of notes in my folder. Coming from Obsidian, there was a very nice extension called Omnisearch that would index the content of my notes and allows me to search them easily (title and content). In Emacs, I think that rg.el (frontend for ripgrep) could allow me to easily search through my notes. I heard about org-roam and some built-in search but I’m not interested in this package. I will start with mardown-mode and org-mode, and may try Denote in the future.
 My pain points and questions are the following:
 ​
  
Do you know which package could best match the search features of Omnisearch? As a beginner I’m a bit lost with the sheer amount of packages to do search (helm-rg, helm-ag, helm-org-riffle, deft, rg.el, counsel…). I settled on rg.el but I am not sure.
 When I open Emacs, it always start at the directory ~/. If I only want to manage the files in the notes directory, how should I go about that? Should I always use Dired to go to the directory and then exit? Or should I create a project (project.el ) for the directory containing all my notes? I see that a lot of package have features to interact with projects. I am a bit unclear about when to create a project or not.
 I installed Helm because it is always mentioned (I prefer a single package to do the thing rather that the popular alternative that is a combination of a lot of small packages), but should I even use Helm at all if I want to use Emacs to write, edit and search notes? I’m a bit unclear about the real value for me (I’m probably not advanced enough).
  
Thanks for your help!

 I have no idea what I was trying to do with M-^M.
 Is it a valid key binding and, if so, what keys is it?

                              <span>Hey! This is something I&#x27;ve been using on and off for a while. And now that eww got an upgrade (being able to watch videos!) I got reminded of it. 
 It essentially tries to mimic Vimium, a vim navigation like extension in browsers. 
 Anyway, the code is not the greatest, there will be bugs, etc, its a WIP.
 As of now, it requires Avy, shr, and shrface. Let me know what you think, I will try to spend some time on it if it gets traction but I am also re-viving my youtube channel with videos on Emacs(already have a few scheduled!), so time is limited :)

                              <span>Hello.
 I am trying to configure dap for C# debugging. Currently, I have dap-mode and dap-netcore installed and enabled. But when I try M-x dap-debug, I get the error
  
Have you loaded the ‘coreclr’ specific dap package?
  
I installed it from Nuget using
  
nuget install Microsoft.NETCore.Runtime.CoreCLR
  
but it did not work as well. I could not find any useful info on how to load it. How can I load it so that I can make dap-debug work?
 Edit: 
 my launch.json:

 However, Arabic text is significantly larger than English text, owing probably to the font itself. How can I define height for Arabic separately?

                              <span>Hello,
 I am installing MSYS&#x27;s Emacs 28.2 on my new work laptop.
 I could not get Spacemacs devel branch to load. The error message is an invalid Win32 file.
 Native elisp load failed: c:/Users/xyz/.emacs.d/eln-cache/28.2-10075233/subr--trampoline-6b696c6c2d656d616373_kill_emacs_0.eln, %1 is not a valid Win32 application.
 When I looked into the eln cache directory, several eln files had zero bytes. Those are the ones that were tripping up the loading of Spacemacs.
 I deleted the files, and restarted Spacemacs, but got the same message again, and the same zero-byte files were recreated.
 Emacs 28.2 was running OK on my old laptop, and had no problem creating the eln files.
 Any thoughts on what may be going on?

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;ve implemented a new package treesitter-context, which is similar to nvim-treesitter-context, to show code context.
 It&#x27;s based on the built-in treesit in Emacs 29.1, so you have to update Emacs to the latest version if you want to try this package.
 It supports only a few languages, such as c/cpp, java, rust, python. There is a guide in README to help you add support for other languages.
 Here is an image showing how it looks like. Enjoy it :)

There is a treesitter library available for ObjC but there doesn&#x27;t seem to exist a corresponding objc-ts-mode i Emacs. Or does it and I simply fail to configure Emacs correctly?

 Ive installed both the haskell compiler and cabal tool, checked that they are installed in a powershell terminal. I have the following extensions on vscode endabled: coderunner, haskell and haskell syntax. 
 why does ghci say error: variable nor in scope? Its this way everytime I try to run any code in haskell

                              <span>So I&#x27;m trying to map across tuples of the form (1,(2,(3,()))) and the below code works
 class F a b where f :: a -&gt; b class MapT a b where mapT :: a -&gt; b instance Num a &#x3D;&gt; F a a where f &#x3D; (+1) instance MapT () () where mapT () &#x3D; () instance (F a b, MapT as bs) &#x3D;&gt; MapT (a, as) (b, bs) where mapT (a, as) &#x3D; (f a, mapT as) test :: (Int, (Double, (Float, ()))) test &#x3D; mapT (1::Int, (2::Double, (3::Float, ()))) 
 I think the elements have to be a member of a typeclass (in this case Num) for this to work, and I don&#x27;t think you can use the same MapT typeclass on different typeclasses of elements, but is there a way to use different functions of the same typeclass elements?

                              <span>Can anyone explain to me why Haskell doesn&#x27;t use the standard type system used for numbers in math? N (counting numbers) are a type of Z (integer) are a type of Q (rational) are a type of R (real) are a type of C (complex)? If Haskell did follow this type structure there would no need for &quot;fromIntegral&quot; and things like this:
 myPlus :: Int -&gt; Double -&gt; Double
 myPlus x y &#x3D; x + y
 would compile. What is the motivation for the numeric type system Haskell uses? Why are Ints not treated as a subtype of Reals? Maybe I&#x27;m missing something and the reason is obvious...but wouldn&#x27;t it be more logical to follow the usual math type system?

 I&#x27;m very happy to announce the release of Yampa 0.14.4 and yampa-test 0.14.4.
 Yampa is a fast, elegant Functional Reactive Programming implementation. Yampa prides itself in being a long-standing community project. It has now been around for 20 years!!! See https://github.com/ivanperez-keera/yampa#features for details on Yampa&#x27;s features.
 This release introduces a benchmark that can be used to evaluate the performance of a proposed change to Yampa, as well as to compare different ways of writing the same expressions. We hope that the benchmarks will improve and grow over time, and that they will help speed up the process of evaluating pull requests submitted to the project.
 Performance can be tricky to evaluate precisely, so no eyes are too many. We invite everyone to go t…</span>

 What have other Ubuntu-users done, in this case?

                              <span>Hi, I am trying to have a simple window toggle, bound to a single key combination. I only use a single frame and generally have only one or two windows. I tried binding other-window to M-o, but when I tested it with ibuffer and a help page, it didnt switch me from the ibuffer window to the help page. Do these windows have special properties and is there a way I can account for that in my simple window switcher? 
 ​
 Thanks

 I get the error: error while checking syntax automatically: (wrong-type-argument stringp nil) and no syntax checking is done. All my checkers look fine as well. Does anyone have idea what could be causing this issue? Or how I can go about finding out whats going wrong?

Hey everyone! Since we have tree-sitter now built into Emacs in the newer versions, I&#x27;ve updated evil-texobj-tree-sitter to work with the builtin treesit package. The queries are not as complete the implementation using elisp-tree-sitter, but should cover most of the common usecases. You can find more information in https://github.com/meain/evil-textobj-tree-sitter/pull/93
 Removing hard dependency on evil-mode was one other most upvoded issue on the project and so I have added integration with thing-at-point for use without evil-mode. This happen a little while ago, but thought I would add it as well in this update.

                              <span>Hi.
 Since the update to Emacs 29 my Emacs starts very slow. It takes 6 seconds instead 1 with 28.2 to the Dashboard. C-x C-f also takes a lot longer to open a file or create a new file.
 So, probably it&#x27;s just my setup and some plugin is causing it. How could I troubleshoot what it is?

                              <span>This will probably just be me rambling, but maybe someone finds some use in this.
 For about 3 years or so i have tried to make emacs work for me. I always could see the potential. It was always clear to me why i should like emacs and what benefits it would give me. But it just never worked for me. From Doom over Spacemacs to emacs-from-scratch and a self writte Config based closely on what systemcrafters did, i never could make it work for my daily stuff. I would tinker for weeks, but when it came to actually doing work, i switched back to either vscode, or neovim lately.
 4 weeks or so ago i wanted to give it another go with my own setup. And by that time i realized that i mostly tried to replicate vscode or neovim in emacs. Evil mode, sidebars, explorers etc. So this time i fundamentall…</span>

 Do I still need eval-and-compile before setting the options?
 Is (require... still necessary? 
 I commented everything except the two setq lines and everything seems to work, but I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m going to encounter some side effects. 
 Can someone with more experience than me explain if that&#x27;s fine?

                              <span>I’ve had to do some PowerShell scripting at work recently, and I prefer to do all of my coding in Emacs whenever possible. I have tried various packages for PowerShell, but have found them either incomplete or unmaintained; so about two weeks ago, I decided to try and write my own package, named koopa-mode. 
 koopa-mode is a minimal major mode for PowerShell that has the following features:
  
Syntax highlighting and formatting
 The ability to spawn – and send code to – a PowerShell process in a new buffer
 Autocompletion for cmdlets
  
This is a work in progress and there are a few bugs. Nested indentation does not work as expected and there is this weird bug when using koopa-mode in Windows where autocomplete appends white space to cmdlets. I also started writing Emacs Lisp two weeks ago and have very little experience with LISP, so it is also likely my code is inefficient or just flat out awful. 
 With that said, I love Emacs and want it to thrive, and someone suggested awhile back that the best way to support Emacs is to contribute to it. I wholeheartedly welcome any code contributions or suggestions and hope someone gets some use out of this mode.

 I have pass setup and installed the password-store in my Emacs. After I used the password-store-edit command, two buffers opened. One for editing my password and another for the Async Shell Command.
 After I saved and killed the first buffer, what should I do with the 2nd buffer? Can I kill it?

 Currently working in Scala but have some background in Python and JS,
 I feel very confident in my abilities as a programmer however when it comes to dynamic programming in Scala it&#x27;s a little tricky, Scala doesn&#x27;t like circuit breaks so it makes for a bit of a clunky solution when it comes to Leet-code type questions. 
 I was thinking to interview for places in Python or JS because a. my interviewer is much more likely to know one of them and b. it&#x27;s just much easier for these kind of questions... however it&#x27;s clear I&#x27;m not as fast in those languages as in my everyday work language, so that&#x27;s a big downside... 
 wdyt, should I ask to be interviewed in another language than my daily Scala?

I am now using Scala 3, which I think has better metaprogramming capability than Scala 2 without having to use macros. However, I am still somewhat of a novice Scala programmer, especially when it comes to metaprogramming. What I want to do is, given a case class, I need to call an (applicative) function on each of its elements depending on their type and then use mapN to build an instance of the case class. 
 Probably a code sample would say it better than I can.

                              <span>Formify is a library that converts your case classes to the &quot;x-www-form-urlencoded&quot; format, which is required by some APIs like Stripe and Twilio. The output from Formify can be passed directly to UrlForm from http4s.
 This allows you to interface with Stripe in a simple and functional manner without relying on their Java client. Just model your data as you would with Circe and POST it in the usual manner. Check it out here.
 I wrote this for an e-commerce platform and wanted to share it in case you were looking for something similar.
 Thanks, M.

 The yesod-test library seems to have a lot of useful primitives to build on; I’m curious in particular about how folks…
  
initialize test db with fake data 
 mock database calls or just run tests against an in-memory PostgreSQL database
 use dependency injection to mock calls to 3rd party services within handlers
 incorporate effect systems like Polysemy &amp; Effectful into handlers
 create abstractions to make assertions on the response HTML easier
  
I can find very few writings on this topic on the web so any insights from industry would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

                              <span>TL;DR: Check out this Haskell Competitive Programming Template I&#x27;ve created for solving competitive programming challenges (e.g. CodeForces). It covers splitting test cases, input parsing, and output formatting for some common patterns so that you can focus on the algorithm as a pure function.
 I am a Haskell enthuiast who likes to use Haskell for solving coding challenges in competitive programming (like in CodeForces). Over the years, I settled on a common pattern for most solutions which I wanted to share with you all. Most of the times, my main function is just parsing the input into test cases, solving each test case, and then format the output. So, all my IO resides on a single line main program where as the actual solution is a pure function from some input type to some output type.
 Formalizing this pattern in the template, I have a solve function for input type i and output type o:
 solve :: (Parser i, Formatter o) &#x3D;&gt; Splitter -&gt; Solution i o -&gt; IO () solve splitter solution &#x3D; interact $ unlines . map (format . solution . parse) . splitter . tail . lines 
 I defined 2 type classes - Parser and Formatter - to support parsing and formatting for some common input/output types. Splitter and Solution on the other hand are just type alias.
 class Parser i where parse :: [String] -&gt; i class Formatter o where format :: o -&gt; String type Splitter &#x3D; [String] -&gt; [[String]] type Solution i o &#x3D; i -&gt; o 
 I have added few useful instances for Parser and Formatter type classes, but more can be added easily. For the Splitter on the other hand, I just created couple of common splitters - fixedSizeSpliiter when each test case has fixed number of lines and dynamicSizeSpliiter when number of lines per test case can be derived from the first line of each test case.
 Feel free to share your experiences, improvements, or suggestions.

                              <span>Hey everyone,
 I am working on something to automatically encode Haskell datastructures as SMT bitvectors. One thing to note is that I am restricting the primitive types to just Int and Bool, this restriction is what makes this task tractable I believe. I am currently somewhat struggling with GHC.Generics.I will outline an example of what I want to achieve here:
 haskell data MyMaybeInt &#x3D; MyJustInt Int | MyNothingInt 
 Given the above, I want to encode how many bitvectors are necessary to store this particular ADT. We assume that the size of &#x60;Int&#x60; here is 32 bits.
 For this example the amount of bits needed is 33 (one bit for the tag + max bits needed of all constructors). So the equation for the number of bits needed is: num_bits_for_int(num_constructors) + max_size(constructors).

Another installment of the What Are You Working On? thread.
Things I&#x27;m reading:
Wolf, Maryanne. Proust and the squid: the story and science of the reading brain. 2010.
Benedict, Marie, and Murray, Victoria Christopher. The Personal Librarian. 2021.
Programming  work/fun:
zkdictionary.py - I&#x27;m striving for a fast, efficient way to store key characteristics of my ZK in a dictionary that can be easily and efficiently queried.
I&#x27;ve started to look at creating a modified-over-created note trend to track my rework ratio over new work in my ZK.
Music I&#x27;m listening to:
GLY
Jon Kennedy
Alex Cortiz
Parra for Cuva
Emapea
and stuff of that vibe
Things I&#x27;m writing about:
Richard Feynman and developing the cognitive skill of curiosity.
Ivan Illiah and the second-order consequences of modernity.
Ideas I&#x27;m studying:
Attentions role in experience.

 I have some kind of love-hate relationship with Haskell since my sophomore year (2 years ago). I feel like I have invested time on it reading through textbooks and solving leet code-style problems with it, but every time I try to do any open-source work, I find myself very dumbfounded by how much I don&#x27;t understand and wrap my head around.
 ​
 I was just wondering is it really that hard or I&#x27;m doing something wrong in my approach to learn it?

 I&#x27;ve never tried Haskell, though I&#x27;m interested in fiddling with it due to its purity in FP.
 What are you using it for? Which personal projects have you written in Haskell?
 EDIT: After some hours in creating the project, looking at the official Haskell docs that apparently are outdated, finding that there&#x27;s no real IDE or Vs code plugin that makes programming in Haskell minimally doable, I gave up. Going to Scala, cyaaa

 How can I set an &quot;absolute&quot; value?

                              <span>Been running Doom for a few weeks now and loving it. I&#x27;m now trying to build a more organized note-taking system with org and org-roam.
 I recently started getting the following error message with some of my org files on startup:
 Error (org-roam): Failed to process ~/org/example_org_file.org with error Wrong type argument: integer-or-marker-p, nil, skipping... 
 It only happens on some of my files and I really don&#x27;t know why. One thing that I realized triggers the error is including URLs; deleting all URLS fixed a few of my files. But two remain. One is just a few lines of text. The other is my main index / table of contents.
 I upgraded my system today (Macbook Pro M1), so this may have caused the issue somehow, as it wasn&#x27;t present even this morning. I&#x27;m using the emacs package emacs-macm which upgraded to 29.2 yesterday. I thought that this may have caused it, because I know that Doom doesn&#x27;t officially support 29.2. But I un-installed and re-installed 28.2 via emacs-plus, and the error persists.
 Can anyone offer any help? I&#x27;m happy to provide more info.

 The following works, but I want to do this without actually modifying the function, and also by not just replacing the opt variable with the params variable that I introduced.
 ​
  (defun org-latex-special-block (special-block contents info) &quot;Transcode a SPECIAL-BLOCK element from Org to LaTeX. CONTENTS holds the contents of the block. INFO is a plist holding contextual information.&quot; (let ((type (org-element-property :type special-block)) (opt (org-export-read-attribute :attr_latex special-block :options)) (params (org-element-property :parameters special-block )) (caption (org-latex--caption/label-string special-block info)) (caption-above-p (org-latex--caption-above-p special-block info))) (concat (format &quot;\\begin{%s}%s\n&quot; type (or params &quot;&quot;)) (and caption-above-p caption) contents (and (not caption-above-p) caption) (format &quot;\\end{%s}&quot; type))))

 All attempts have resulted in the same result.

                              <span>Hi all
 For various corporate reasons I&#x27;m using EMACS on Windows 10, with a shared folder tree to a Vagrant VM. I tried running emacs in the VM but even with a local X server the performance isn&#x27;t great.
 I&#x27;m a &quot;lite&quot; poweruser under Linux and I have a lot of stuff like flyspell, flymake, lsp etc, Prelude, that I like to have configured.
 Now, a lot of the packages I use rely on Linux utilities (aspell, lsp server, etc) which are not available under Windows 10.
 I could possibly install cygwin but are there other options which I am overlooking? Can I get EMACS inside the VM running faster? Maybe use emacs-server? Does anyone have any suggestions to improve this configuration?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hello
 I have a particular issue related to indentation when using braces and brackets inside tabular-like environments handled by AUCTeX. I am using AUCTeX 13.2.1 with Emacs 29.1.
 Things work all right within regular content. As such, the following code is correctly formatted
 latex { xxxx { zzz } } [ yyy ] 
 Custom environments are also correctly formatted
 \begin{aaaa} { xxx } [ yyy ] \end{aaaa} 
 However, tabular as well as any other tabular-like environment handled by AUCTeX does not respect indentation; here, what I mean by handled is those environments whose formatting is set to LaTeX-env-tabular as well any other environment I append using LaTeX-add-environments and set to LaTeX-env-tabular.
 As an example, as soon as talltblr is on the list handled by AUCTEX, Emacs does not indent content inside brackets
 \begin{talltblr}[ caption &#x3D; {Somthing}, label &#x3D; {tab:something}, % ... ] { colspec &#x3D; {Q[l] X[c,m] Q[3cm,mode&#x3D;math]}, hlines, vlines, row{1} &#x3D; {font&#x3D;\bfseries}, } X &amp; X &amp; X \\\\ Y &amp; Y &amp; Y \end{talltblr} 
 I expect the following would be the correct formatting
 \begin{talltblr}[ caption &#x3D; {Somthing}, label &#x3D; {tab:something}, % ..., ] { colspec &#x3D; {Q[l] X[c,m] Q[3cm,mode&#x3D;math]}, hlines, vlines, row{1} &#x3D; {font&#x3D;\bfseries}, } X &amp; X &amp; X \\\\ Y &amp; Y &amp; Y \end{talltblr} 
 One obvious solution is to remove or not to include environments in the list. However, I really like how AUCTeX formats tables. It adds required indentation between &amp; and \\ to show where inner environments start. Hence, the code is much clearer and more readable with multiple inner and nested tabulars. The indentation would be a great addition to it.
 I ask this question in hope that perhaps someone has already sorted it out. I would also be grateful for any clues and pointers to start with.
 Thanks

 I find that it causes issues with org-appear and also that my cursor jumps out of the region after I type menu:Can this be done with compose-region instead so that it can work like prettify-symbols but keep the prettifying to inside the link?

                              <span>I am new to emacs and trying to build it from the source for native compilation. I actually want to install 28.1, as it is officially supported by doom. I have tried using emacs-plus, but it only has 28.2 and doesn&#x27;t give me a clickable app (there might be some flags here which I am unaware of). But the important thing is I am unable to get 28.1.
 Then I decided to build from source, but I am continuously getting the error:
 checking for dlfunc... no
 usage: dirname string [...]
 checking for gcc_jit_context_acquire in -lgccjit... no
 configure: error: ELisp native compiler was requested, but libgccjit was not found.
 Please try installing libgccjit or a similar package.
 If you are sure you want Emacs be compiled without ELisp native compiler,
 pass the --without-native-compilation option to configure.
 I do have libgccjit installed and added it to DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH. I am not quite sure why emacs is not able to find libgccjit?
 Or if there is any simpler way to install emacs 28.1 from a mirror with native compilation and all the defaults (--cask), it would be ideal.
 Let me know if any additional material is required from my end.
 Thanks.

                              <span>I just wrote a blog post trying to separate the Zettelkasten method as a note-taking method (among other things) and other note-taking methods developed for other possible purposes and with different mechanics. Basically the main argument is that any note taken in obsidian, logseq or any other &quot;digital brain&quot; app is not necessarily zettelkasten.
It is written from a somewhat fundamentalist and provocative point of view, basically because I understand that there is a commercial rise in the indication of note-taking as a miracle cure, which can be very frustrating for people who embark on setting up a Zettelkasten unnecessarily.
The article is written in Spanish, but as we all know, it can be automatically translated online using the different online translators available today.
I would like to know what you think of the proposal.

                              <span>I watched this video and it gave me the exact insight to move a step further in my approach:

I am currently using Things 3, but occasionally and begrudgingly flirt with OmniFocus. The reason is that my project are quite complex. (My TaskPaper project file for my book on habits has 447 lines and 7300 words) Things can&#x27;t meet the complexity I need. My project management is a mix of information, task, sub project, dependencies and stuff. So, I thought that I am just too unskilled using OmniFocus.
But I think just mix two concerns that should be separated.

 Seems like the aeron UDP should be the first choice, which transport are you using.

 I find there are some operators do not exists in Akka/Pekko stream now but exists in RxJava/Flux etc , Seems people are still happy with it?
 Fs2 and ZIO have rich set of operators too.
 So what operators do you wanted but still missing?

                              <span>Backgroud:
 - the classic remoting is using netty 3.10.6 which has CVEs
 - the classic remoting code is not been touched for years
 - the new Artery is better for spliting the control message and user messages etc.
 - Akka just removed the classic transport in 2.8.0.
 ​
 There are two options now:
  
Remove it totally at the next 1.1.0 release, reduce the maintenance burden.
 Fix the CVEs by upgrade to Netty 4 in 1.1.0 but remove it in 1.2.0

                              <span>As far as I can see, the single biggest feature org-roam adds to what &quot;plain&quot; org-mode already has is back-linking.[1] I&#x27;m wondering just how useful that is in practice.
 My own (limited) experience showed that org-roam is definitely a step up from org-roam when it comes to creating back-links. But just how significant that step up is depends on how much use I&#x27;d make of those back-links when subsequently reading my org-roam nodes. And that is hard to assess without first building up a big enough set of nodes.
 So my question is addressed to those who have made a sufficiently serious move into org-roam to have built up a decent database of nodes (and, as a result, back-links). To those people my question is:
 Just how useful do you find back-links -- i.e. not the back-linking process, but the links themselves, when reading/reviewing/interacting with your notes -- to be in practice? 
 thx.
 [1] I guess searching might be a bit easier too, along with node name completion. But back-linking seems to be The Big Thing.

 I want to get the name of the table passed into &quot;print-shapes&quot; so that I can pass that name to (org-sbe). Is that possible? Thank you.

                              <span>I am new in emacs but have experience in vim . I was following distrotube video to config emacs . In my ~/.config/emacs/init.el i put
 (org-babel-load-file (expand-file-name &quot;config.org&quot; user-emacs-directory)) 
 And I made an config.org file following him. But I got an error see in below.
  ■ Warning (initialization): An error occurred while loading ‘/home/raihan/.config/emacs/init.el’: File is missing: Cannot open load file, No such file or directory, /home/raihan/.config/emacs/config.el To ensure normal operation, you should investigate and remove the cause of the error in your initialization file. Start Emacs with the ‘--debug-init’ option to view a complete error backtrace. 
 How can I solve this?

                              <span>A lot of themes I try on emacs (macos, version 28.2, from homebrew) have weird heading styling: 
 https://preview.redd.it/i1zgvmn5p6gb1.png?width&#x3D;2934&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;ce34361d6966a1137c6cfd3acb0955e2c903c631
 The underlining only happens for some headings and starts at different places. I would like to either fix it or just remove all the underlining styling. The screenshot above is using solarized. But similar things exist for other themes:

 this is with catppuccin theme. Only some of the headings have an extra dark background.
 I tried booting emacs with the only customization being the theme and the issue still exists.
 Does anyone know how to remove or stop these themes from trying to do extra styling. Thank you

                              <span>So, with match types we can easily express &quot;type of the first tuple element&quot;:
 type FirstElement[T  head } val good: FirstElement[(String, Int)] &#x3D; &quot;yep&quot; // val badAsExpected: FirstElement[(Int, String)] &#x3D; &quot;nope&quot; // error 
 How to do the same for case classes? Using the same match type 
 case class Foo(a: String, b: Int) val wishThisWasGood: FirstElement[Foo] &#x3D; &quot;but it isn&#x27;t&quot; 
 predictably fails with match type reduction failed. It would be great to have a parity of generic programming features for tuples and case classes.
 Another related question please. I&#x27;m trying to define a match type and a corresponding function that filters elements of type String from a generic tuple. It works on type level:
 type OnlyStrings[X  EmptyTuple case x *: xs &#x3D;&gt; x match case String &#x3D;&gt; String *: OnlyStrings[xs] case _ &#x3D;&gt; OnlyStrings[xs] val works: OnlyStrings[(String, Int, String, Long)] &#x3D; (&quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;) 
 but fails on value level:
 def onlyStrings[X  EmptyTuple // Found: EmptyTuple.type, Required: std.OnlyStrings[X] (...) case x *: xs &#x3D;&gt; x match case s: String &#x3D;&gt; s *: onlyStrings(xs) // Found: String *: std.OnlyStrings[Tuple], Required: std.OnlyStrings[X] (...) case _ &#x3D;&gt; onlyStrings(xs) // Found: (xs : Tuple), Required: X 
 this one should be fixable with a more clever type bound, right?

                              <span>Dear Zettlers,
I am currently in search for a good software solution to design visuals and diagrams for my work. Here are some examples that I made using draw.io:



For the book, Christian created more visually pleasing images:


Most of the time, I ignore my software and use the image capture function of The Archive which vastly (!) speeds up my process (important to me). The images look like this:


All images protected by copyright 4.0 (enforced by Interpol, Blackrock, the Illuminati, my secret identity and third personality). So, to the lurker who likes to &quot;borrow/bite&quot; other people ideas:

I&#x27;d like to improve my visual game.
I&#x27;d like to stop pestering Christian if I need something more pretty.
Sometimes, I use using software as a creative technique.
In few cases, I just want something pretty for myself.
And what is better than appropriate skills by just buying shiny tools? Currently, I am looking at OmniGraffle. But perhaps, you have something way better for visuals like the above?
Many thanks

In general, I&#x27;d like to understand how advising functions works since I have not found much beyond the manual, and the examples did not really aid in my understanding beyond the general principle of modifying functions&#x27; behavior. For reference, my edited function is shown below. Any help is very much appreciated.

 This is the code I used.

 I know the transcoding I want can be done by adding #+attr_latex: :options [name of theorem] above the special block, but I&#x27;d like to know if I can add a parameter the way I want for added convenience, maybe with the org-special-block-extras package.

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying centaur emacs. And it seems really promising.
 But I&#x27;m lost. I found no explanation how to use it on github or internet.
 Tutos, shortcuts/command explanations to navigate, search , debug ?

 Downgrading to 2.4.0 fixes the issue for me.

                              <span>Right now the doom-modeline for Treemacs looks like the image.
 In the source code for Treemacs, I found: (doom-modeline-def-modeline &#x27;treemacs &#x27;(bar &quot; &quot; major-mode))
 But I would like to append (treemacs-workspace-&gt;name (treemacs-current-workspace)). How can I make this?
 I already tried the following, which kinda works, but I would like to add it to the use-package-statement as configuration and this doesn’t seem to work. I was wondering if someone here already has made customisations to show the current workspace-name from Treemacs in the doom-modeline.
 (doom-modeline-def-segment treemacs-workspace-name &quot;The current treemacs workspace name or number. Requires &#x60;treemacs-mode&#x27; to be enabled.&quot; (when doom-modeline-workspace-name (when-let ((name (cond ((and (fboundp &#x27;treemacs-mode) (eq major-mode &#x27;treemacs-mode)) (treemacs-workspace-&gt;name (treemacs-current-workspace)))))) (propertize (format &quot;- %s&quot; name) &#x27;face (doom-modeline-face &#x27;doom-modeline-buffer-major-mode)))))
 (doom-modeline-def-modeline &#x27;treemacs &#x27;(bar &quot; &quot; major-mode treemacs-workspace-name))

                              <span>Hello all, I am wondering what the current state of the Web Assembly back-end is for GHC? Is the best way to compile to wasm to use the back-end from ghc-wasm-meta? Also, does anyone have any information about how to call functions written in Haskell in a browser? In my experiments with C++, one can tell emscripten to keep certain functions in the wasm binary by prefixing their return type with &quot;EMSCRIPTEN_KEEPALIVE&quot;. Is there a Haskell equivalent for this?
 EDIT: I think my answer I was looking for can be found here. It seems like this is how you get to keep haskell functions in the wasm binary. I am not entirely sure how to match up JavaScript types with Haskell&#x27;s, though.

                              <span>A little Context: I am new to FP and Haskell. on my way, I found many cool entry points and Tutorial courses. the official first-steps itself is a great point to begin with, 4 Lectures Course has a rich study plan for theories.
 Learning by building projects is next phase in the learning path. And.. in my quick research I can&#x27;t find a list either. So I thought A list of Project Based tutorial would help anyone with an &#x27;appetite&#x27; for real world experience.
 tldr: caught sight of any tutorial for building projects in Haskell ? append it here... ✍️✍️

 So I was trying tio run stack so I can use ghci, however whatever I do I keep on encountering this problem
 I tried downloading the stack to use haskell in WSL, I use a kali distro and zsh, does anyone have any idea on why does it encounter this problem?
 Thank you

                              <span>Hey fell@ws!
 Probably one of the most discussed topics right after Data related ones!
 Yet, we all know things are moving at a fast pace lately.
 I am looking for a lean library without much fuss around easy to manage and set-up for a, as of rn, one man show project. 
 I came along big frameworks like &#x27;play&#x27; saw akkahttp to be very popular and of course lately Zio.http.
 Play seems to be very very big and asking for a big learning curve. Akka longs like the mongo(db) of the scala world - not really liking the direction they went w/ their licensing change which happened before I even heard of - I still do not know how to asses the risk of Zio doing it alike.
 I have only very small needs:
 -postgresql driver
 -lightweight threads
 -simple http handling
 I haven&#x27;t settled on how to server the FE yet, would be nice to find something which integrate nicely but using other tech isn&#x27;t the end of the world.
 I &#x27;just&#x27; need to have simple CRUD on the backend. 
 Correct me if I am wrong, but from what I read there are no standard libraries for that, right?
 What are you using on your backend projects and why? 
 Would be amazing to hear from you guys and your enormous experience!
 ​
 Thanks &amp; Cheeers!

 * Tuesday, 08/01/2023... * Friday, 08/04/2023... ** 09:22 &lt;-- this is the one I just made * Tuesday, 07/25/2023... &lt;-- riddle me this??? 
 I use yearly format for org-journal. All entries are made in 2023-01-01.org

                              <span>Hey there,
 I&#x27;m sick of writing notes to my phone. Anyone have any good workflow recommendations for a Google Pixel 7 running termux as well as a Raspberry Pi device on LAN?
 ​
 Asking since I&#x27;m debating if I should just use Emacs via Termux (although probably clunky) and just make note files that get ingested into a folder on LAN that later get slurped up and incorporated as new tasks under a &#x27;* Phone Notes&#x27; heading or something.
 I&#x27;m also planning to probably use Syncthing on LAN too somehow to facilitate the syncing.
 ​
 Curious for your thoughts thanks!

                              <span>Hello, I am a medical student from Argentina. I discovered the Zettelkasten method a while ago and was very interested in it, and I wanted to introduce you to my &quot;study method&quot; (actually it is much more comprehensive than a study method).
I did this method in the format of a planner or agenda, which can be downloaded in PDF at www.researchsheets.wordpress.com
This planner has 10 sections, but the method I want to show you corresponds to &quot;section 7: Research sheets&quot;. They consist of a template similar to the Cornell method in appearance (top margin, left margin and bottom margin), but with a totally different operation, since these &quot;Research sheets&quot; will serve us to hierarchize and breake down the information, and then add it to a glossary / thesaurus in Microsoft Excel.
The procedure itself is somewhat difficult to explain, so I prefer not to confuse you further and invite you to download the planner and go directly to section 7 - Research sheets.
As I said at the beginning, I think it has some similarities with the Zettelkasten method. I hope my method is useful to you and I am available for any questions or comments.
Thank you very much for reading me!</span>

                              <span>If we are working in a monad, we can use overshadowing for a series of modifications:
 data Config &#x3D; Config { -- multiple record fields: configXXX :: YYY , (...) } modify config &#x3D; do config &lt;- m0 config config &lt;- m1 config config &lt;- m2 config -- etc. return config 
 But if we are not working in a monad:
 modify config &#x3D; let config&#x27; &#x3D; f0 config config&#x27;&#x27; &#x3D; f1 config&#x27; config&#x27;&#x27;&#x27; &#x3D; f2 config&#x27;&#x27; in config&#x27;&#x27;&#x27; 
 is confusing, it&#x27;s easy to choose the wrong config.
 So how is this pattern usually solved? Using the Identity monad&#x60;?
 Also, since this example use a datatype with multiple record fields, and maybe data in several layers, how can we uses lenses to solve the pattern? I&#x27;m not used to lenses.

 As both vs code and my emacs are running tree-sitter, shouldn&#x27;t they be the same?

 It doesn&#x27;t do anything to associate this with dart files from what I can gather. Has someone trawled through the docs and made this work with Dart? My understanding, after taking a brief overview, is that I need a dart-ts-mode and dart-mode maps to this. The creation of this mode is beyond my scope. (I had a cursory look into c-ts-mode but backed out as it doesn&#x27;t look trivial ;))
 It&#x27;s not critical to have, but since I&#x27;m doing a small flutter project I thought I&#x27;d ask.

                              <span>At the very bottom of the Quick Start section, it says:
  
Add any configuration which relies on after-init-hook, emacs-startup-hook, etc to elpaca-after-init-hook so it runs after Elpaca has activated all queued packages. This includes loading of saved customizations. e.g.
 (setq custom-file (expand-file-name &quot;customs.el&quot; user-emacs-directory)) (add-hook &#x27;elpaca-after-init-hook (lambda () (load custom-file &#x27;noerror))) 
  
I don&#x27;t really use the customize feature, anyway, but my config has had the following lines in it since &quot;forever&quot;,
 (setq custom-file (expand-file-name &quot;custom.el&quot; user-emacs-directory)) (when (file-exists-p custom-file) (load custom-file)) 
 and it was never attached to any hooks. Let&#x27;s say that I did, some day, use the customize UI to customize a package in my Emacs. When would be the appropriate time to load my customizations file? Before my packages are loaded? After? What would happen if I load a customization for a package that doesn&#x27;t exist yet, because I&#x27;m at a new computer and the package is being downloaded/installed for the first time?

                              <span>Hi everyone, I am a bit lost here (no coder). I have been reading about CSS, org-mode, babel... and I do not find how to instruct the html export properly.
 I have a CSS file, and I am exporting org-mode documents using this CSS as html (the target being pdf documents). It works so far with html. I have been tweaking the CSS file so that my exported doc enforces the company style sheets and looks.
 What I am missing is my logo to be displayed in the top left corner as it would be on any company letter.
 How to instruct org-mode so that this logo is displayed properly in every page of every document.
 I guess this must be added somehow in some property in the org with the size and position ... or maybe in the CSS? I am lost, please help!
 Thanks

 What I am missing is my logo to be displayed in the top left corner as it would be on any company letter.
 How to instruct org-mode so that this logo is displayed properly in every page of every document.
 I guess this mustbe added somehow in some property in the org... or maybe in rhe CSS? I am lost, please help!
 Thanks

                              <span>Just for the sake of having an example, let&#x27;s use the packages evil and magit in a hypothetical init.el. Don&#x27;t take them too literally and get hung up on exactly what evil and magit do/are: pretend they are package-a and package-b if that&#x27;s more helpful.
 EDIT: It was immediately brought to my attention that using magit and evil in the following example is, indeed, a poor example because of magit being autoloaded by calling magit-status. Let&#x27;s just pretend we&#x27;re talking about some other packages, instead.
 magit defines a function called magit-status, and evil defines a function called evil-ex-define-cmd, and I&#x27;d like to use it to define an ex-command for magit-status.
 So, somewhere in my init.el, I&#x27;ll have to write: (evil-ex-define-cmd &quot;git&quot; #&#x27;magit-status)

I now have emacs 29.1 and scimax latest running beautifully in iTerm2 ... It took three days of background tweaking, 
 I use this for opening, 
 $ emacs -nw -q -l /Users/xxxxx/.emacs.d/scimax/init.el 
 It started with I decided to upgrade to emacs 29 using Brew following JKitchin&#x27;s page, 
 I cleaned out Emacs 28 built from source, 
 I installed Emacs 29 with 
 $ brew install --cask emacs ... Worked very well, got me a useable emacs 29.1, the installation moved the emacs.app to Applications,
 Do not bother with 
 alias emacs&#x3D;&#x27;$(/Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs -nw)&#x27;
 in .zshrc.
 I upgraded to the latest scimax using Github Desktop and copying the scimax folder to 
 /Users/xxxxx/.emacs.d/scimax/ 
 There are other little bits of tweaking, but they are easy stuff. 
 Thank you for all the guidance shared,

                              <span>Hi all,
 I just switched to emacs coming from a vim background and was wondering about the integration of evil-mode into notmuch. Currently, major modes like org-mode and magit are supported thankfully (using evil-collection) but unfortunately, I haven&#x27;t come across a good way to integrated evil-mode with notmuch. Much of the bindings of notmuch and evil-mode overlap with each other, thus hampering the bindings of notmuch. Currently, I&#x27;m just disabling evil-mode in every notmuch buffer and am using the standard emacs bindings.
 So as per the title, is there a way to integrated notmuch and evil-mode? Or perhaps use just a subset of evil-mode in a notmuch buffer (like simple &quot;j&quot; and &quot;k&quot; for moving around for example).
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I usually run Xtoolkit based Emacs (the version without any gtk code at all) and it runs perfectly fine. I&#x27;ve tried the old GTK version and the Webrender fork in the past and now recently tried the pGTK version. They all run extremely slowly. I don&#x27;t have exact measurements but were talking ballpark half a second for anything to happen when I hit a key. It gets much better when I disable transparency but it&#x27;s still far, far behind the X toolkit version.
 Based on what I&#x27;ve seen elsewhere I was expecting the pGTK version to be faster (like the tui version which is noticeably better than X) or at the very least equivalent with the X toolkit version.
 I installed Emacs via nix from the emacs-overlay.
 What am I doing wrong that it&#x27;s so slow?

At the end I want to select as a target a file from the list of files with this special property and insert under the block * History
 What would be the best approach here, to have the file selected in the minibuffer (fuzzy matching) used as a target in the capture template?
 Thanks for your ideas

                              <span>I feel like there&#x27;s been tons of threads on this topic but they just left me feeling more unsure after looking through them. Here are my concerns which mostly revolve around Org-mode:
  
CommonMark vs Org-mode for writing only? I feel like the only advantage of the Org syntax are footnotes and tables.
 
Is the Org syntax set in stone? Like if I don&#x27;t use any advanced features or extensions will my org files be fine with future updates to Org-mode? I have heard stories of org files being outdated and breaking.
 
Does large org files get slow (50k-70k words though I doubt my files will ever get that big)? 
 
Reference management on Emacs vs Neovim? 
 
Is exporting from Org-mode to Docx easy? According to this article there&#x27;re still issues with the final output Docx files sadly, cause then I will have to open up Pages to fix them which may cause further formatting issues.
 
Org on Emacs vs Org on Neovim?
 
Is Emacs or Neovim better for LaTeX?
 
Is Emacs much slower than Neovim? I only plan to open it when working on a project and not to take notes all the time so a bit slow startup time is acceptable - being slow while working is unacceptable though.
 
Is Emacs high maintenance?
 
 And if I do choose to use Emacs, should I use Doom-Emacs or just the vanilla config files - I heard Doom disabled some obsolete settings which make it faster/the same speed despite having pre-installed extensions?

Recently, I switched from using tables to using column view for some use cases, and there are many advantages for me in that. What I am missing in column view is hl-line-mode. Sometimes it is difficult for me when being at the far right with the cursor, to see in the far left what line I am in and what values correspondent to the ones in the far right.
 Hl-line-mode is turned on, but it doesn&#x27;t highlight the current line when in column view. Does anyone of you know of a way to make it work? Thanks in advance for your help!

                              <span>I use vertico with prescient for filtering. Consider a directory that contains a file called abc.txt. When I call find-file there and type a.txt it matches abc.txt even though my prescient-filter-method is set to literal only. How do I make prescient actually treat . like a literal character?
 Here is my config for this, there is nothing noteworthy here.

                              <span>Hello /r/scala,
 sorry for asking you to do my job, but I&#x27;m trying to assess how much &quot;future proof&quot; is a scala codebase we inherited that we are interested in making the primary product for my company. I just studied a bit the language (and I loved it), observed the ecosystem and lurked here and somewhere else, but I&#x27;m not able to do this kind of risk assessment on my own as I might be influenced by some echo-chamber effect. I&#x27;m also incredibly sorry for being not precise in my descriptions, again I&#x27;m not super familiar with the ecosystem.
 The codebase has around 6-7 years I guess, and it&#x27;s a Scala 2 100k LoC web api backend based on a Play multiproject setup (many folders with an sbt project inside + a sbt project outside in the root folder, no src/main/scala structure).
 The signatures…</span>

                              <span>I just joined a group on LinkedIn yet there is nothing much going on apart from spams and scala unrelated this from recruiters who not think scala is any different to Scala and as a Scala dev you might prefer to work with express.. Anyhow :D
 I heard scala has an amazing community and I happy to join it as of right now!
 I recently was looking for a new stack for my next webapp projects. After working with golang for some weeks I was just frustrated on how bad the documentation is. As a former Java Developer I felt home right away with scala. Considering that I heavily do in data engineering and not being a fan of the Python Syntax and especially not pip I might found my swiss-army-knife with Scala!
 Still getting around with this massive eco-system. especially since it seems like it works just fine with every Java related (such as frameworks, libs) I throw at my scala projects it will just do fine.
 I am also very excited to know that there are even Javascript and LLVM compiler to run system target bins.
 Seems like one language/ecosystem to rule them all. 
 How did you end up here?
 I mean kotlin does also make bold claims and golang is super hip, isn&#x27;t it?

 I know for Neovim there’s a couple solid resources like these:

                              <span>Org Babel (Shell) in a session ends up truncating output from the shell.
 MWE:
 test.py:
 #!/usr/bin/env python3 print(&quot;&quot;&quot; Stats: CPU Busy 24 (100.00%) Stats: IO Busy 15 (62.50%) Stats: Total Time Busy 24 (100.00%) &quot;&quot;&quot;) 
 test.org:
 #+begin_src shell :session test :results output ./test.py #+end_src #+RESULTS: : : ) : ) : ) 
 It seems like it ignores everything before %, which is rather surprising. I tried removing the %, and everything worked fine.
 Tested on Emacs 27.1 and Emacs master, Ubuntu Jammy (22.04), using emacs -q.
 edit: Also tested on Termux (Emacs 28.3), similar behaviour. Interestingly, I tried catting the file, and it also mangles the shebang by skipping the #, which is doubly weird.
 edit 2: New MWE: test.org:
 #+begin_src shell :session test :results output echo &quot;Hello world#&quot; #+end_src #+RESULTS: :

                              <span>I know of the variable org-export-preserve-breaks. I do not really like the behavior this produces, since it adds \\[0pt] to my .tex documents. I&#x27;d prefer if an empty line was added in-between instead. I&#x27;d also only want this to happen in the case where two pieces of text are on consecutive lines. Does anyone know how I can adapt things for this case?

 Ive purged all repos and build dirs and rebuilt but launching mu4e in emacs gives the error above. Any pointers gratefully received. (I tried 1.10 too but same issue).

                              <span>Hi Emacs community,
 I am trying to recreate the RStudio layout for the ESS (Emacs Speaks Statistics) mode. This is I want to improve the ESS module in doom (here it is the feature branch).
 I have made good progress, but I&#x27;m currently stuck on one aspect.
 Here&#x27;s the code I have so far:
 (defun my-rstudio-layout () &quot;&quot; (interactive) (add-to-list &#x27;display-buffer-alist &#x60;(&quot;^\\*help\\[R\\]&quot; (display-buffer-reuse-window display-buffer-in-side-window) (side . right) (slot . 1) (window-width . 0.33) (reusable-frames . nil))) (add-to-list &#x27;display-buffer-alist &#x60;(&quot;^\\*xwidget-webkit*.&quot; (display-buffer-reuse-window display-buffer-in-side-window) (side . right) (slot . 1) (window-width . 0.33) (reusable-frames . nil))) (add-to-list &#x27;display-buffer-alist &#x60;(&quot;^\\*R.*\\*&quot; (display-buffer-reuse-window display-buffer-at-bottom) (window-width . 0.5) (dedicated . t))) (add-to-list &#x27;display-buffer-alist &#x60;(&quot;^\\*R dired\\*&quot; (display-buffer-reuse-window display-buffer-in-side-window) (side . right) (slot . -1) (window-width . 0.33) (reusable-frames . nil))) (let ((ess-startup-directory &#x27;default-directory) (ess-ask-for-ess-directory nil)) (delete-other-windows) (ess-switch-to-ESS t) (ess-help &quot;help&quot;) (ess-rdired))) 
 My problem is with the xwidget buffer. I would like it to open in the same window as the help buffer, using a tab (activating tab-bar-mode, of course). 
 I aim to achieve something similar to this: https://bookdown.org/ndphillips/YaRrr/images/RStudio_Screenshot_Labels.png
 Would anyone know how I could achieve this? I&#x27;ve been struggling to figure out how because the manual isn&#x27;t clear about what variables we can use in the display-buffer-alist. 
 Any help or pointers would be greatly appreciated!
 Thank you in advance! 
 PS. Any other suggestions or hints about this function are also appreciated.

                              <span>Hey all,
 To preface, I am brand new to emacs and am currently exploring what it has to offer. I setup a simple init.el file like so:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; ;; Set up package.el to work with MELPA (require &#x27;package) (add-to-list &#x27;package-archives &#x27;(&quot;melpa&quot; . &quot;https://melpa.org/packages/&quot;))
 ;; Download Evil (unless (package-installed-p &#x27;evil) (package-install &#x27;evil))
 ;; Download Catppuccin (unless (package-installed-p &#x27;catppuccin-theme) (package-install &#x27;catppuccin-theme))
 ;; Enable Evil (require &#x27;evil) (evil-mode 1)
 ;; Enable Catppuccin (load-theme &#x27;catppuccin :no-confirm) (setq catppuccin-flavor &#x27;mocha) (catppuccin-reload)
 (custom-set-variables ;; custom-set-variables was added by Custom. ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful. ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance. ;; If there is more than one, they won&#x27;t work right. &#x27;(package-selected-packages &#x27;(catppuccin-theme evil))) (custom-set-faces ;; custom-set-faces was added by Custom. ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful. ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance. ;; If there is more than one, they won&#x27;t work right. ) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 It works perfectly on Ubuntu running under WSL, it does not quite work on straight Windows 11. On Windows 11 it does set the theme to Catppuccin so I know it&#x27;s sourcing the init.el file correctly but it evil mode doesn&#x27;t start working until after I manually toggle it via (M-x evil-mode)
 Also, if it makes a difference, I am using 28.2 on both WSL and straight Windows. 
 It&#x27;s just a minor inconvenience but if there is something I am missing that will fix it then I am all ears.

                              <span>Today I have upgraded my emacs to 29 from 28 and got a lot of packages complaining after fresh download from elpa. I use custom emacs with doom theme and lots of other packages, namely counsel, ivy, lsp, projectile, some minor ones. Suddenly, lsp started to complain a lot with warnings, projectile stopped running my projects with qemu (but pure terminal works), a lot of other problems -- warnings in different packages. What are the basic steps I need to check after an upgrade? Yes, I have downloaded all packages from scratch but problems are still there.
 Right now, the most annoying thing is the way I run qemu with tun/tap interface enabled. If I run from separate console, my project starts as expected. If I run it as a command for projectile/run, qemu cannot open tap interface (resource is busy). Manual check of env in console/projectile does not show any significant differences.
 Edit: a bit more details

                              <span>The previous tree-sitter package was just a minor mode, and this made it much easier to migrate to and use. Having a new major mode means that all hooks, key-bindings, major-mode checks, use-package’s, derived modes, and config need to be duplicated twice. And it&#x27;s not only your own user config, but all packages need to add support for each new mode, even if they don&#x27;t care about tree-sitter. 
 Given that, the core developers must have had good reasons for not going the minor-mode route. Does anyone know some of the trade-offs that were considered? Maybe a link to the Devel discussion about it?

  &quot;factorial&quot; (if (zerop n) 1 (* n (funcall #1# (1- n))))) 
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 This will signal an error caused by the endless lambda macro expansion.
 Quote it
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;lisp
 1&#x3D;&#x27;(lambda ... #1#)
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 is a good idea, but ... then we cannot use lexical binding.
 They ((lambda ...) and &#x27;(lambda ...)) are different; as you can see:
 lisp &#x27;(lambda ()) ;; &#x3D;&gt; (lambda nil) (lambda ()) ;; &#x3D;&gt; (closure (t) nil) 
 Modify the byte-code
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;lisp (byte-compile (lambda (n) (if (zerop n) 1 (* n (funcall &#x27;_ (1- n)))))) ;; &#x3D;&gt; ^ placeholder

 Ah! Nice~ We can replace the placeholder _. Let&#x27;s take advantage of vector&#x27;s self-quotation:
 lisp (#1&#x3D;#[257 &quot;\211\300U\203\0\301\207\211\302S!_\207&quot; [0 1 #1#] 4] 5) ;; &#x3D;&gt; 120

                              <span>As I go about my work, often I&#x27;ll accidentally insert an n or p because I meant to hit C-n or C-p to navigate but get to the p before the C. q and g are common ones too, for similar reasons.
 However, I usually don&#x27;t notice until I compile the file, which tells me that I have a n or p somewhere and have to track it down, and there&#x27;s not always a line number. 
 If I use I-search-forwards these accidentally inserted characters are hard to track down, because there are so many legitimate uses of n and p
 Does anyone have any ideas on a way to make catching these rascals easier?

                              <span>I feel like this is probably down to me not being too good with lisp, so maybe someone can point out my error. The idea is, that i want to create an svg-tag (Package), that opens a URL on click. That&#x27;s the part i&#x27;ve got working. But now, the tag itself should be part of the url, which i can&#x27;t get to work.
 So, this works
  (setq svg-tag-tags (&quot;\\(ASGUPD\-[#0-9]+\\)&quot; . ((lambda (tag) (svg-tag-make tag)) (lambda () (interactive) (browse-url &quot;https://jira.internal.de/browse/&quot;)) &quot;Open in Browser&quot;)) )) 
 But this doesn&#x27;t
  (setq svg-tag-tags (&quot;\\(ASGUPD\-[#0-9]+\\)&quot; . ((lambda (tag) (svg-tag-make tag)) (lambda (tag) (interactive) (browse-url (concat &quot;https://jira.internal.de/browse/&quot; tag))) &quot;Open in Browser&quot;)) )) 
 This is what i have come up with so far. When running this i get the Error
  Wrong number of arguments: (lambda (tag) (interactive) (browse-url (concat &quot;https://elara-jira.elara-gmbh.de/browse/&quot; tag))), 0 
 I&#x27;m not sure if the tag is even available at that point. I assumed that it would work the same as creating the tag. Am i doing something obviously wrong?

                              <span>In order to have a more comfortable keyboard layout I&#x27;ve switched the Crtl key with the Alt key and Alt with Win-logo key using xmodmap. This makes transitioning between my Ubuntu desktop and Macbook pretty seemless and doesn&#x27;t kill my little finger. ;)
 In Emacs 27 this worked fine, Emacs 29 thinks I&#x27;m hitting multiple keys when pressing Alt or Win-logo.
 Alt+x should be C-x but I get A-C-x
 Win-logo+x should be: M-x but is M-s-x 
 How can I fix this?
 My init.el has these changes to make it work in previous versions of emacs:
 ;; xfce key-bindings
 (setq x-meta-keysym &#x27;super
 x-super-keysym &#x27;meta)
 ;; use fn key as control, maps better to my dasKeyboard setup
 (setq ns-function-modifier &#x27;control)
 This is the content of my .xmodmap file:
 clear control
 clear mod1
 clear mod4
 keycode 133 &#x3D; Super_L
 keycode 64 &#x3D; Alt_L
 keycode 37 &#x3D; Control_L
 remove control &#x3D; Control_L
 remove mod4 &#x3D; Super_L
 remove mod1 &#x3D; Alt_L
 add control &#x3D; Alt_L
 add mod1 &#x3D; Super_L
 add mod4 &#x3D; Control_L

 The 15th Haskell Implementors&#x27; Workshop is to be held alongside ICFP 2023 this year in Seattle. It is a forum for people involved in the design and development of Haskell implementations, tools, libraries, and supporting infrastructure to share their work and to discuss future directions and collaborations with others.
 We have a number of slots for lightning talks. Lightning talks will be ~7 minutes and are scheduled on the day of the workshop. Suggested topics for lightning talks are to present a single idea, a work-in-progress project, a problem to intrigue and perplex Haskell implementors, or si…</span>

 I checked with Scala, and Scala behaves exactly in the way he described as not optimal or as a bug/wart.

 Anyone knows why Scala behaves this way? Or if this is indeed objectively a wart or it is a subjective thing.

                              <span>By default links to other org files would open in other windows which was mostly fine. It got really annoying when doing a lot of org-roam link following so I changed it from &#x60;file . find-file-other-window&#x60; to &#x60;file . find-file&#x60;. HOWEVER I now sometimes would like to be able to open a link in another window. 
 Funny how that is....emacs user wants nuanced control. Are there any existing packages or easy elisp to enable this type of function? Was low key hoping it would work with C-u C-c C-o but that was a no go.

 The TL;DR is as follows.
 My capture templates usually end with \n%?. That is intended to position point on a new line in the capture buffer, ready for me to type in whatever text I want. And it has always done exactly that. However, what I now see is that where I have a template that clocks in, AND if I am storing clock info in a drawer, then that positioning goes awry. Instead of point being positioned at the start of a new line, it is placed right on top of the clock drawer. That forces me to manually move the cursor down before starting to type. (I know;…</span>

                              <span>I use mu4e with smtpmail-send; smtpmail-send-it can read the credentials from auth-source by default however mbsync (and other indexing utilities) requires using passcmd or the psas itself. Even if you were to use sed or awk to make the passcmd work with .authinfo (to avoid duplicating the password), you will not be using the emacs interface promot to enter the password but gpg’s.
 Here is what i’ve been doing instead, I’ve this elisp function;
 (require &#x27;auth-source) (defun salih/get-mail-password () (let* ((auth-info (auth-source-search :host &quot;mail.gmx.com&quot; :require &#x27;(:user :secret))) (password (funcall (plist-get (car auth-info) :secret)))) password)) 
 It will return the password associated with the host. If the file is encrypted you are promoted to enter your passphrase with epa.
 Since I run emacs as a daemon, we can eval this function in the command line like this emacsclient -e &quot;(let ((inhibit-message t)) (salih/get-mail-password))&quot; you will be promoted in the emacs session you are running.
 If you run this in a shell it is going to return the password with double quotes, but we can workaround that using simple string substitution in the shell. here is the final script;
 #!/usr/bin/env sh output&#x3D;&quot;$(emacsclient -e &quot;(let ((inhibit-message t)) (salih/get-mail-password))&quot;)&quot; output_without_quotes&#x3D;&quot;${output//\&quot;/}&quot; echo &quot;$output_without_quotes&quot; 
 And in mbsync config (isyncrc):

 https://imgur.com/a/i5B7Bmj
 and here is my init file: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; ; install all the icons for the tree (use-package all-the-icons :ensure t)
  ; (all-the-icons-install-fonts) (use-package neotree :ensure t) ; set the theme of neotree (setq neo-theme (if (display-graphic-p) &#x27;icons)) ; set key to open neotree to f8 (global-set-key [f8] &#x27;neotree-toggle) 
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 I&#x27;ve run (all-the-icons-install-fonts) and I can insert the file icons using all-the-icons-insert but they arent coming up in the tree. I also cant change the theme back to a basic one without any icons.

                              <span>Hi folks,
 Any reason why Emacs would not detect packages when I list them but they are visible under melpa package listing: Example is &quot;dirvish&quot; package that does not list in Emacs but it&#x27;s visible on Melpa site.
 My config for packages is
 (setq package-archives
 &#x27;((&quot;org&quot; . &quot;https://orgmode.org/elpa/&quot;)
 (&quot;gnu&quot; . &quot;https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/&quot;)
 (&quot;gnu-devel&quot; . &quot;https://elpa.gnu.org/devel/&quot;)
 (&quot;nongnu&quot; . &quot;https://elpa.nongnu.org/nongnu/&quot;)
 (&quot;elpa&quot; . &quot;https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/&quot;)
 (&quot;melpa&quot; . &quot;https://melpa.org/packages/&quot;)))
 ​
 (package-initialize)
 (unless package-archive-contents (package-refresh-contents))
 (unless (package-installed-p &#x27;use-package)
 ​
 ; Unless &quot;use-package&quot; is installed, install &quot;use-package&quot;
 (package-install &#x27;use-package))
 ​
 (require &#x27;use-package)
 (setq use-package-always-ensure t)
 ​
 Wonder if I&#x27;m missing something or perhaps the order of packages is wrong ? 
 ​
 Thank you

                              <span>Hey, ya&#x27;lls.
 Recently left Spacemacs in favour of rolling my own config for a variety of reasons. It took me a few weeks to put together. There were a lot of people that said, &quot;you can just put something together in the space of a weekend&quot;; that was very much NOT the case for me, having gotten used to functionality from Spacemacs, and also wanting certain things.
 Anyway, this is the first time I&#x27;ve put something like this together, and I&#x27;d love if anyone felt like taking a look and offering some criticisms/insights.

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking for a package (at least asking if anyone knows of one before I write one myself) to make space indented code behave like tab indented code, specficially the variable width part. So I can for example have a file of four space indented code and make it display like two or eight spaces.

 Turns &#x60;camelCaseTyping&#x60; into &#x60;camel_Case_Typing&#x60; (visually only) and of course its customizable.
 Will be trying it out on Javascript files and will be configuring some options.
 Not sure how handy it&#x27;ll be but have sometimes wished I was able to do this when I&#x27;m spending all day in JS land.

 So, with latest emacs 30 on Windows 11 and Powershell 7, do i have any chance to get a terminal in emacs, or will i need to rely on another terminal for that?

 lsp-mode
 If my mouse pointer is over my lsp buffer then keyboard chords using lsp-keymap-prefix fail. In this video you will see my mouse near to the cursor. I hit C-l (my prefix) then shift and it bugs out with mouse movement errors. If I do the exact same thing with the mouse NOT over the buffer it works. This is both with and without lsp-ui-doc-mode on.
 Has anyone witnessed anything similar?

                              <span>I&#x27;d like to have a &quot;mix&quot; between avy-goto-char-timer (which at the moment is the only thing I use from avy as it&#x27;s so great) and avy-goto-char-in-line, where the search scope is the current line. That is, I often need to jump somewhere in the current line, and I wish to type until the match is unique, at which point the jump should be performed automatically (like the former command already does). I could just use avy-goto-char-timer, but it would show all other matches in the buffer, so making it unique is harder and sometimes impossible, so I have to press the target key(s).
 Looking at the implementations, I&#x27;m a bit stuck though, as avy-goto-char-in-line uses avy-jump for scoping, which is based on regexes, but avy-goto-char-timer gets the candidate list with avy--read-candidates, where I don&#x27;t see how I would scope to the current line (and which looks harder to extend, as it&#x27;s quite complex). Is there an easy way I&#x27;m overlooking?

                              <span>I&#x27;m working on a small PowerShell major mode, and I am trying to create the fontification for multi-line comments using a syntax table.
 This is the code I have, which kind of works:
 ;; Comment syntax:  denotes a multi-line comment (modify-syntax-entry ?\ &quot;&gt; 4&quot; st) 
 It successfully comments out the lines
  
 But unfortunately also comments out the 10 in $x &lt; 10.
 I have not been able to find any good examples in either the documentation or SO, but the documentation on syntax tables seems to indicate this would be the correct approach.

                              <span>When trying to use tree-sitter modes I run into many silly problems.
 Take c-mode for example:
  
References to c-mode-hook.
 Key bindings that reference c-mode-map.
 use-package references to c-mode.
 My own functions that check: (member major-mode &#x27;(c-mode c++-mode objc-mode))
 Basically my whole configuration assumes C/C++ use c-mode or c++-mode and having to add checks for c-ts-mode is a hassle, enough that I don&#x27;t use c-ts-mode at all.
  
Is there some solution that doesn&#x27;t involve every check for c-mode also checking for c-ts-mode ?

                              <span>Hi everyone
 So I’m new to haskell so please bear with me for this silly question. I was doing some haskell using GHC 9.2.7 installed by ghcup. Then today I installed and set ghc 9.6.2 and cabal 3.10.1.0 and my simple toy programs don’t work anymore because libraries such as Data.Map are not found anymore.
 I thought they were part of the prelude? What am I missing? 
 Also follow up question: why is ghcup recommending me old versions of compiler and tools instead of the latest one? I’m using ubuntu 18.04 of that helps
 Thanks a lot to however take the time to help me :)

                              <span>Hi fellow Haskellers! I&#x27;m new to the functional programming world and wanted to give creating a Blackjack program a shot.
 Here&#x27;s the code
 Any comments or critiques are welcome! I do have a few specific areas for feedback:
  
When inserting a State function in the StateT function, I have to use something like
 (a,s)  get
 put s
 
 which seems very clunky. Is there a better pattern to use?
  
I couldn&#x27;t figure out a clean way for hands that are split to disqualify from being blackjacks. Any ideas?
 
I&#x27;m not super fluent in testing. How do I test IO portions of the code? Such as my function Actions.getValidTurnActions which requires the user to input a line.
 
 Thanks for taking a look at a beginner&#x27;s code. Much appreciated!

When I select a piece of text with the mouse in Org mode and then press &#x27;M-w&#x27; to copy the text, Emacs successfully copies the text, but the highlighted selection remains in an odd color that doesn&#x27;t go away, almost like it was highlighted in yellow or some other unusual color. I&#x27;m unsure of the cause of this issue, and it&#x27;s difficult to reproduce as it only happens occasionally. I&#x27;m not sure what might be causing it. Have you ever experienced anything like this? do you know what it might be linked to so I can tweak my Emacs config?

                              <span>So org transclusion lets you display/link sections of other org files into your current file and it updates in real time. 
 I&#x27;m loving it in general for text that sort of &quot;lives on&quot; but I have a use case in my productivity system where I want to transclude from a file I use every week but it changes. So I need to embed the transclusion as a part of my end of week review. 
 Currently I have to:
  
Delete the transclusion
 Go to the running weekly tracking file
 copy/refile it into my 5 daily files that are long term stored 
 delete it from the running weekly tracking file. 
  
What I would like to be able to do i.e. a sort of baking in of the source to everywhere it is linked. 
  
Go to the source of the transclusion
 search for the use of this heading as a transclusion across my org files
 overwrite the transclusion with the actual text. 
  
Before I go writing the custom elisp for this which seems like a bear. I wanted to confirm if anyone knows a simple way to achieve this.

 ​
 I have a function which I want to handle a empty yield : 
 for {
 x &lt;- myParam.myOption
 y &lt;- myParam.mySecondOption
 z &lt;- myParam.myValue
 }yield {
 // bunch of manipulation
 } 
 My probelm is this return an Option of my result that i cant manipulate. I was under the impression thta I could use a recover, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be the case. Is there a way of returning an error if one of the value ends up empty ?

                              <span>Since 29.1 has been released, I was hoping for a quick release of emacs-mac (aka Mitsuharu&#x27;s Mac port). In the past, an update has followed the official release by a couple of days only. 
 I looked at the official repo and brew emacs-mac formula, and both show no recent activity. Can anyone in the know update us?

                              <span>Unfortunately, some packages think a symlink file is different from the one it links to. eg Treemacs follow wont work if the treemacs workspace says &quot;symlink/file.txt&quot; but the file opened is &quot;~/long/path/file.txt&quot;. Understandable. Now I dont know the ins and outs of that complexity but certainly my use case would be simplified if consult-buffer could be configured to ignore the longer path so I dont open that file via the long path and the buffer indeed has a reference of ~/symlink/file.txt. eg see here , a picture makes it easier to understand : I&#x27;d like to see one or the other filtered so I can have some concistency in my buffer opening.
 Can anything be done or is there something already available? Or do I just need to suck it up and be more careful as to what path I use?

 Even from Project Error List in SPC-P-X, I can&#x27;t copy the error details.

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m trying to create a my first major-mode for HTTP requests in emacs, I&#x27;m stuck at the syntax coloring for regexs at the same line.
 let this be the HTTP request I&#x27;m trying to highlight:
 GET /print_hello_world HTTP/2.0 host: mydomain.com te: trailers sec-fetch-site: cross-site sec-fetch-mode: no-cors sec-fetch-dest: image accept-encoding: gzip, deflate, br accept-language: en-US,en;q&#x3D;0.5 accept: image/avif,image/webp,*/* {&quot;hello&quot; :&quot;world&quot;} 
 now in the first line want to highlight the first line GET with a face and the endpoint /print_hello_world with another face I tried using:
 (setq font-lock-defaults &#x27;(,((rx line-start (or &quot;GET&quot; &quot;POST&quot;) symbol-start (one-or-more (any alphanumeric punct)) symbol-end space) . &#x27;my-http-endpoint-font) ,((rx line-start symbol-start (or &quot;GET&quot; &quot;POST&quot;) symbol-end) . &#x27;my-http-method-font))) 
 but this will only highlight the method not the endpoint.
 the same goes for header values, I tried using this:
 (setq font-lock-defaults &#x27;((,(rx line-start symbol-start (one-or-more (any alphanumeric ?- ?_)) symbol-end &quot;: &quot;) . &#x27;my-http-header-key-face ) (,(rx &quot;: &quot; symbol-start (one-or-more not-newline) symbol-end eol) . &#x27;my-http-header-value-face ))) 
 this will highlight only the header with its face but not the value.
 I tried to check python-mode for how it is done but I didn&#x27;t understand how it is structuring it.

                              <span>Hi all,
 I use emacs in client/server mode by running emacs --daemon --nw at login and then running emacsclient -c to open new frames.
 After upgrading Arch linux this morning to emacs 29.1, my clients can no longer find the socket to connect to emacs. The daemon command runs and outputs the usual startup messages, but it&#x27;s like it doesn&#x27;t finish loading fully and never executes the daemon.
 I tried emacs -q --daemon --nw and this worked, so the problem is in my init somewhere. Ugh.
 I tried --debug-init but it found no problems. The only output I get in Messages is:
 Error loading autoloads: (file-missing Cannot open load file No such file or directory /home/alanm/.emacs.d/elpa/yaml-mode-20230714.440/yaml-mode-autoloads) Loading /home/alanm/.emacs.d/orgmode_customizations.el (source)...done Loading /home/alanm/.emacs.d/email.el (source)...done Turning on magit-auto-revert-mode...done For information about GNU Emacs and the GNU system, type C-h C-a. Package cl is deprecated 
 I&#x27;m not sure what is trying to load cl. It&#x27;s nowhere in my config, and the only cl- packages I have installed show as builtins. Not sure what&#x27;s up with yaml-mode, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s it because the problem was happening before I updated yaml. I&#x27;ve also tried commenting out my orgmode and email external .el files, and that didn&#x27;t help, so the issue is in the init file directly.
 I can run server-start in an emacs window and then connect, but I&#x27;d like to have a background daemon running instead.
 Any ideas? Here is my init.el, if it helps: https://pastebin.com/GNzhwcqU

                              <span>I wasn&#x27;t expecting the mac os upgrade to torch my emacs (sigh). I&#x27;m gun shy on just upgrading emacs ala brew because I don&#x27;t wind to wind up going down the &quot;fix up&quot; rabbit hole when I&#x27;m trying to get work done... so looking here for someone to tell me the latest brew emacs is all good for the latest mac before I take the plunge.
 (I was so happy emacs was getting tamed, really wasn&#x27;t expecting this kind of interaction... is this common on mac os upgrades?)
 Thanks for any info or tips. (I&#x27;m trying to stay as vanilla as possible in my emacs setup).
 ​
 EDIT: After googling around I found mention of this being fixed in the 29 branch. But also found a one liner fix to avoid upgrading in flow. So, for anyone else hitting this:
 (add-to-list &#x27;image-types &#x27;svg)
 will do the trick.

                              <span>I am currently try to implement my own Zettelkasten, mainly to keep track of all the notions I am reading around.
 I configured and used org-roam, but I wonder if a simple set of Markdown files could be better, more portable, and easier to synchronize between my work laptop and my home computer.
 Do you have any experience? How you implemented your Zettelkasten? And how you synchronize among different systems?

                              <span>Hello all,
 Like many of you I am upgrading my init.el to emacs 29.1
 To be able to bind C-i differently from  in GUI, I had the following snippet, it works. But I have never properly understood how/why
 (define-key input-decode-map &quot;\C-i&quot; [C-i]) (global-set-key [C-i] (lambda()(interactive)(message &quot;Ctrl + I&quot;))) 
 Now, define-key is flagged as obsolete, replaced by keymap-set.
 However I can&#x27;t seem to make the same lines work with keymap-set. I have tried replacing [C-i] by &quot;&quot; since (kbd &quot;) returns [C-i], but it does not pass the is-valid-key-p check.
 Any key-binding guru here, ready to settle the matter and help me and others understand the proper way to achieve this with the new API ?
 I know I could leave it as is, or rebind stuff to Hyper-I, but that&#x27;s not a satisfying answer
 Thanks !

                              <span>Hello, can anyone help me choose between neovim and emacs? I know what I want from an editor and am ready to spend a lot of time customizing one of these editors, but I don&#x27;t want to do it twice. So I will tell my preferences and it would be really great to get your advice.
  
I prefer to use an editor in terminal, without additional gui. As far as I know neovim is tui app, while emacs is not. However, I can run emacs in my terminal. How much I lost not using gui version of emacs?
 
I want to create and edit notes and to-do&#x27;s using an editor. I am not going to use it as a calendar as I prefer to use apple calendar on my macbook and iphone. How many advantages does org-mode have over simple md? Also I&#x27;ve read about org-mode for neovim...
 
I want to try to use an editor as ide too. I&#x27;m angular developer and I&#x27;m working on rather large project (main project contains about 7k files). I&#x27;m worried about the performance of the autocomplete. Unfortunately, I failed to find ready-made configs for emacs and neovim to open the project and see for myself.
 
I definitely don&#x27;t want to use my editor as browser, gaming platform, email client, window manager etc etc. Honestly, looks like neovim is winner here :)
 
I don&#x27;t want to use something like spacemacs, emacs-doom, etc., just self-written configs. And I don&#x27;t know what is better in this case - elisp or lua/vimscript.
 
I have no preference between emacs or vim hotkeys. Both are good.
 
Emacs startup time is significantly worse than neovim&#x27;s, even though I have very few plugins installed. Can I fix it without using client-server? It&#x27;s not a big problem, but it&#x27;s annoying.
 
 So i&#x27;m looking for a lightweight and fast editor for notes and development on angular. Should I spend my time on emacs or neovim? Thanks for your opinion and sorry for my english, I&#x27;m not native.

That means, my emacs installation on Windows Subsystem for Linux still using qwerty layout instead of colemak layout; and I want to have colemak layout when using emacs. On the Windows host as well as the WSL Ubuntu distribution, I&#x27;m having colemak layout. Though whenever I type something to emacs, it&#x27;s always qwerty. So I&#x27;m looking for help on how to tackle this.
 Thanks.

                              <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;m trying to setup notmuch in emacs through IMAP. Currently, I have a bunch of labels assigned to my email on gmail but unfortunately, when downloading my mail through mbsync and viewing through emacs notmuch, the labels do not appear (as tags?). 
 Is there a way to get these labels on emacs notmuch? Thanks!

                              <span>Hi, Currently I have been working on a springboot groovy project. Sadly intellij is used for most of the stuff here. I was trying to explore gettting lsp up with eglot and groovy-language-server. Language server is not able to detect other files in the project.
 My settings are 
 (use-package eglot
 :ensure t
 :defer t
 :config
 (setq read-process-output-max (* 1024 1024))
 (push :documentHighlightProvider eglot-ignored-server-capabilities)
 ;;Adding groovy server
 (add-to-list &#x27;eglot-server-programs \(groovy-mode . ( ,local-java11-path &quot;-jar&quot; ,(expand-file-name (concat local-abs-config-path local-abs-custom-utils &quot;groovy-language-server/groovy-language-server-all.jar&quot;)))))&#x60;
 )
 ​
 Please recommend how can i get syntax check and some language completion in emacs for springboot and groovy.
 Thanks
 ​

                              <span>Hi,
 I was using linum-mode in my Emacs 28. But when I upgraded to 29.1, this function was gone.
 I found a function called line-number-mode, which has no visible effect.
 Then I found display-line-numbers-mode, which seems to have the same effect as the old linum-mode.
 Why there are so many line number related functions and which one should I use?

 The other day I wrote a simple Haskell program that retrieves data from a REST API and processes it. The task at hand sounded simple enough to just start coding without too much upfront thinking.
 This blog post is about how I discovered the shortcomings of my original design and how I improved it with some simple refactorings.

                              <span>Hi all,
 ​
 ​
 I come from Rmarkdown, trying to reproduce some of my previous workflow. I made most everything the way I wanted. However, I like to keep html reports from my analyses, in rmarkdown I would generate standalone html files, ie, they dont point to png plots outside of the file, the plots are embedded in the html.
 ​
 - Is there a way to do this in orgmode export? So that the resulting html is including the plots, instead of pointing to the files locally?
 ​
 Thank you!

                              <span>Developing an effective and accurate ML model to solve a problem is one of the goals of any AI project. To optimize the model, we need to tune its parameters and hyperparameters and then evaluate whether the updates result in the anticipated improvements. This requires setting up key metrics and defining a model evaluation procedure. After implementing the changes and conducting evaluation, we can determine if the performance of the ML model has improved and whether we should use the updated version.</span>

 Unfortunately my emacs isn&#x27;t compiled with xwidget support (Had issues building from source on M1 Mac)

 Curious to know if it works for you :)

 .emacs.d/tree-sitter/:

 I just have watched https://youtu.be/SNx1Ab2oqw8 but author have same problems.

                              <span>Can someone please share their setup for dap-mode for debugging node.js programs.
  
I have added dap-mode and enabled dap and dap-ui.
 
Then I wrote a tiny .js file and tried debugging it in VSCode and it worked. VSCode even created .vscode/launch.json for me.
 
Then, I tried dap-node-setup which has failed, because it tried to download deprecated version of vscode extension: https://open-vsx.org/api/ms-vscode/node-debug2/latest/
 
I searched through dap-mode repo and found this issue #554, and this comment with instructions, but they are still for the old version of the extension.
 
I tried following the steps but using the newer version of extension at https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-js-debug
 
I extracted the content of .vsix file into ~/.emacs.d/.local/cache/.extension/vscode/ms-vscode.js-debug-companion
 
I think I just need to set dap-node-debug-path (pointing to that dir) and lastly, set dap-node-debug-program. And here I think where I&#x27;m failing. I&#x27;m not sure to which file in the directory to point it to.
 
 Does anyone know how to set up dap-mode debugging for node.js?

ABSTRACT: The editors vi and emacs were compared using a simple time-based experimental method involving common text manipulations and a post- test opinion survey by questionnaire. The subjects were twelve students; six were novices and six were regular users. Significant objective performance differences were confined to the novice users; here emacs consistently outperformed vi with respect to time taken to perform the tasks and the amount of help needed. Subjectively, novices preferred emacs because of its more predictable nature. Emacs was therefore the editor of choice for the novice users tested. There appears to be no advantage for a regular user of one editor to switch to the other.

                              <span>Hello, I&#x27;ve noticed that Emacs 29 comes with a useful function called duplicate-line that duplicates the current line. Surprisingly, it&#x27;s not bound to any key by default. To make it more accessible, I decided to bind it to the key combination C-S-d (Control-Shift-d). I was able to achieve this by using the following command in my Emacs configuration:
 (keymap-global-set &quot;C-S-d&quot; &#x27;duplicate-line) 
 It works but I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the proper way to do this, though.

                              <span>Hi guys, hope you all are doing great.
 I have a string with html content I want to propertize using html-mode so I basically do this:
 (with-current-buffer (get-buffer-create &quot;*temp-buffer*&quot;) (erase-buffer ) (html-mode) (insert &quot;

hi there

&quot;) (buffer-substring (point-min ) (point-max))) 
 the output I receive after running this code is this:
 #(&quot;

hi there

&quot; 0 43 (fontified nil)) 
 but when I go to the buffer interactively and run
 (buffer-substring (point-min ) (point-max)) 
 in eval-expression I got a html text with properties.
 what I&#x27;m missing in the non-interactive code? also if there is a better method for this please share .
 thanks in advance.

                              <span>How can I make Dabbrev and Corfu automatically show a pop-up for the words from my current buffer? For example, if I write &quot;example&quot; somewhere in a document, I would like it pops up automatically when I start writing &quot;exa&quot;. I have Corfu-global-mode corfu-pop-up mode and Corfu-history enabled.
 However, this popup suggestion works perfectly on org-mode! For any other modes, it just does not work. It would be very helpful to get it to work for other modes, especially for Latex mode and Python mode!
 Please let me know. Thanks a lot for your help.
 Here is my config for corfu: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; (use-package corfu :custom (corfu-cycle t) ; Allows cycling through candidates (corfu-auto t) ; Enable auto completion (corfu-auto-prefix 2) (corfu-auto-delay 0.1) (corfu-popupinfo-delay &#x27;(0.4 . 0.2)) (corfu-preview-current &#x27;insert) ; Do not preview current candidate (corfu-preselect-first nil) (corfu-on-exact-match nil) ; Don&#x27;t auto expand tempel snippets

                              <span>Hi all,
 Almost a year ago I wrote an article describing my note-taking process here (linked from the InternetArchive because I inadvertently changed/removed some stuff on my site). I got a lot of messages from people suggesting I open-source what I had worked on, so here I am.
 I don&#x27;t have much any knowledge wrt submitting packages into Melpa (let alone being able to test what I&#x27;ve done locally), so I&#x27;m asking /r/emacs for support. Without jumping too deeply into googling myself out of my own ignorance, I found this article, but it wasn&#x27;t completely helpful. So here are my main question(s):
  
How can I test that my package rolodex.el works before I submit a PR to the Melpa repo?
 What other things am I missing (README aside, I still wanna write that)?
  
Here&#x27;s my code if anyone wants to take a gander: rolodex.org
 It&#x27;s still early(ish) in its development, but it should work (at least the original code works in my init file), so it shouldn&#x27;t be judged as complete. 
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hey fellow Scala devs,
 I have been working on a summary of concurrency in the JVM (Java, Scala) and thought the following diagram might be useful for you to have as overview.
 Naturally we all leverage high level of abstraction libraries (actors, cats-effects) to be productive, but often forget the building blocks those libraries use under the hood.
 Cheers

But before that I wanted to use an intermediate language like Scala or Kotlin so that I can shift slowly to Java. Which one should I go ahead with?

                              <span>Hi, not sure if I&#x27;ll get any answers here but then again I&#x27;m not sure where else to find a community of functional programmers.
 Anyway, I&#x27;ve been interested in FP for a while and have naturally come across the STG paper by SLP Jones from 1992. This paper cites a lot of older works, such as the spineless G-machine, the G-machine, TIM, ABC etc.
 I find it really interesting to look through these other, older abstract machines preceding the STG machine but the thing is: is there anything succeeding the STGM? Or is it truly undefeated in its design for 30 years?

                              <span>I&#x27;m a tentative fan of Eric Normand, an ex-Haskeller working in Clojure (left because he didn&#x27;t want to spend too much time on typelevel, was working on Scrive&#x27;s Haskell codebase).
 ​
 One of his books is called Grokking Simplicity, an introduction to Functional Programming, and I&#x27;m wondering where his formulations and definitions of functional programming are incorrect, at least from a Haskeller point of view.
 ​
 A lot of these formulations are pretty accessible; i.e, in functional programming, you have a separate notion of actions (effects), computation, and values, but I&#x27;m worried that they might not be correct in a Haskell context. Any opinions on Grokking Simplicity?

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to implement bijective type level function that would work like UnHKD (a :: f Int, b :: f String) (a :: Int, b :: String) in purescript.
 First approach I thought about is to define it directly over records:
 class UnHKD :: Row Type -&gt; Row Type -&gt; Constraint class UnHKD t t&#x27; | t -&gt; t&#x27;, t&#x27; -&gt; t instance ( R.Cons label (f a) as&#x27; as , R.Cons label a bs&#x27; bs , UnHKD as&#x27; bs&#x27; ) &#x3D;&gt; UnHKD as bs else instance UnHKD r r 
 However, it doesn&#x27;t work:
 check :: Unit check &#x3D; toProve -- error: type class instance for &#x60;Prim.Row.Cons t2 (t3 t4) t5 t0&#x60; is possibly infinite. where toProve :: UnHKD () () &#x3D;&gt; Unit toProve &#x3D; unit 
 The second approach was to use RowLists. However, type inference was lost. Probably because RowToList is not bijective:
 class UnRLHKD :: RL.RowList Type -&gt; RL.RowList Type -…</span>

                              <span>I was thinking about PKMs, their types and uses and came up with the approach below and wanted to try these ideas out for size......
A PKM is defined as follows:
Personal knowledge management - Wikipedia
Alternative Definitions and Roles
An alternative definition for Personal Knowledge Management would be to define a PKM by its use. Looking at the definition of a Zettelkasten, we have:
Zettelkasten.de.
Using these definitions, we can conclude that there are two fundamental types of PKM:
In other words:
The PKM based on networked thoughts could be considered as an &#x27;Active PKM&#x27;. Its purpose being the generation of emergent ideas, and
The Organisational PKM could be considered as a &#x27;Passive PKM&#x27; for the archiving and retrieval of facts.</span>

                              <span>I am experiencing a fairly common issue using GNU Screen in conjunction with Emacs. In short, out of the box, Screen does not seem to support italic fonts when used with a standard terminal, e.g. xterm. Since lots of recent Emacs packages use italics, e.g. Marginalia, this is quite annoying. Without italics support, Screen places some ugly underlines to highlight text.
 A way to check italics support is to run chinfocmp -1 | grep -E &#x27;ritm|sitm&#x27;. When run inside Screen, the output is empty. When run without Screen, the output is not empty. I have not found a $TERM value that uses standard termcap or terminfo database entries that fixes this issue inside Screen.
 What is your setup for running Emacs inside Screen with good italics support? Related: https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?func&#x3D;detailitem&amp;item_id&#x3D;36676

Kickstart.nvim is not a distribution.
 Kickstart.nvim is a template for your own configuration. The goal is that you can read every line of code, top-to-bottom, understand what your configuration is doing, and modify it to suit your needs.
 Once you&#x27;ve done that, you should start exploring, configuring and tinkering to explore Neovim!

 There are many indentation guide packages out there, but I found most to be slow and inflexible. Plus I wanted to try out the idea of drawing vertical bars using font-lock and the :stipple face attribute.
 The result is indent-bars. Ultra-fast. Highly configurable — from barely-there to editor-flexing bling. With all the features you&#x27;d expect (all optional naturally):
  
color-blending for dialing in just the right level of glanceability vs. intrusiveness
 indentation depth-based coloring
 current depth highlighting (with zero speed cost + many possible styles)
 blank line support
  
Important note: I learned that apparently not all Emacsen properly support :stipple (despite happily accepting it as a face attribute). Linux/UNIX is safe, emacs-mac supports it on MacOS, but Windows may not at all (untested). Also, terminal emacs does not (to my knowledge) implement :stipple. Let me know how you fare.

                              <span>As the title says. When I use C-c C-d to read the documentation in a python file it opens a new buffer with the documentation but doesnt move my cursor over to the new buffer meaning i have to move to it before i can close it then move back. 
 Does anyone know how to change it so that my cursor moves to the new buffer but moves back after i quit with &#x27;q&#x27;?

                              <span>Hi,
 I have very little knowledge of emacs and what I am trying to do is to map the keysequence &quot;C-u 1 C-c |&quot; in orgmode to a key in evil mode.
 &quot;C-c |&quot; is bound to org-table-create-or-convert-from-region, so I tried this:
 (general-evil-define-key &#x27;(normal visual) org-mode-map :prefix &quot;SPC&quot; &quot;t&quot; (lambda() (interactive) (org-table-create-or-convert-from-region &#x27;(1))) ) 
 But now when I select a region and press SPC-t (which should trigger this mapping) all I get is the the error message &quot;this should not happen&quot; from emacs...
 I have no clue what this is supposed to mean, so my questions are:
 1) Why is this error message produced and what does it mean?
 2) What is the proper way to do the keymapping?
 Many thanks!

 I have now re-enabled desktop-save-mode in my emacs config.

 title says it all. I was preparing to write mail using my comfy mu4e setup (after some time of not using it) only to discover that for some reason the message body is in some non-monospaced font that nearly had my eyes bleed.
 This is news to me, I never had this happen before. How can I change this?
 Have a good day and thanks for your help :)

 (org-heading-components) returns heading components without extracting statistics cookies such as [1/1] or [50%].
 The goal would be to cut them out of the cookie heading string (nth 4 (org-heading-components)) and save them in a separate list. What could be a good solution?
 Any ideas?

                              <span>I’m looking for a blog post that I can’t find (can’t even work out what to Google to find it)
 Something was added to GHC (I think 9.X) which was some primitive that I think would help implement some kinds of effects systems very efficiently(?) maybe some kind of primitive continuationy thing?
 Does this ring any bells?

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 Having encountered Haskell for the first time back in 2019, I&#x27;ve been developing with it and off since then and even contributing to open source projects. It&#x27;s been a phenomenal, intellectually rewarding journey and it&#x27;s by far my favourite programming language.
 However, I&#x27;ve reached a point in my Haskell journey where I feel like I should either put it on the side and learn other things, or continue with it, but on a more narrower, specialized path. 
 I know Haskell is a general purpose programming language and can be used to solve any programming problem, but so are other programming languages such as Python or C/++. 
 But I can&#x27;t help but feel that since Haskell is unique, it must have a domain that it uniquely excels in. 
 What does r/haskell think this domain is? I really want to continue learning and mastering Haskell, but I need a sense of direction.
 Thanks.

My thesis centers on the adoption of functional programming in the software industry, its industrial readiness, as well as the benefits and challenges of its implementation.
 If you&#x27;re using Scala in your daily work (or even concepts and ideas from FP in general) at the company you work at and can spare ~5-7 minutes to answer the survey below (or share it with your colleagues, instead), I would be incredibly grateful!
 Participation is completely anonymous and your data will only be used cumulatively. I am going to share the survey results and their analysis, along with the conclusions from other types of research I am conducting, such as literature reviews and 1-on-1 interviews.

                              <span>Hi all, Just wanted to share that I made a micro-library for basic Dependency Injection in small projects.
 https://github.com/makingthematrix/inject
 It&#x27;s based on code I worked on at Wire, rewritten in Scala 3.3 and updated to take advantage of new syntax, and also it uses Rob Norris&#x27; typename microlib for finding names for types.
 Inject is available already on Maven Central, but also you can just copy-paste the source code - it&#x27;s just one file.

 Does anyone know if there is any way to display them in such a &quot;daily timeline&quot; grid?
 SOLVED: the reason it didn&#x27;t appear is due to the SCHEDULED: &quot;property&quot; (not really a property) added automatically by the org-schedule command. Removing it brought the tasks back to the grid.
 no \&quot;daily timeline\&quot; (grid)
 none of the repeated tasks display in the \&quot;grid\&quot;

It&#x27;s an advice added to org-display-inline-images function, which I assume replaces links pointing to youtube videos with overlay images. The problem is that part of this function returns nil and trips debugger (screenshot and stack trace below)
 I&#x27;ve spent over 20 hours trying to solve it already so any help/suggestions would be really appreciated. Not sure if it&#x27;s org-image-overlay or evaluation of (org-element-property :begin el) that yields that nil. Doom Emacs.

                              <span>Is there a function to do what action the title describes?
 I have long some running programs, downloading files for example, which don&#x27;t show any progress output when I evaluate them directly from org-mode file&#x27;s source code block it just shows the end result.
 When evaluating the code block in org file i get:
 #+RESULTS: : T 
 Whereas when running in repl I get
 Downloading  T 
 I would like to see the progress in the slime REPL rather than just the creation of the RESULTS block in the org file .

 but without this variable linked images don&#x27;t display
 is there any way to debug such a problem?
 I&#x27;ve tried for 3 hours adding advice, calling these functions in various places of config and NOTHING WORKS.
 SOLVED
 Also reported the issue on org-yt github - trying to finish it there. Seems to be related to the way links are handled in the document.

 At certain times (using lsp-mode) the corfu drop down just vanishes when I arrow through the completion candidates. Before I provide configs etc, does anyone else see this?
 There are no issues with eglot and the same corfu config. LSP and Company also dont see this issue.

                              <span>Hi,
 The pfuture-new function throws these errors frequently.
  error in process sentinel: pfuture-new: Could not create child process error in process sentinel: Could not create child process 
 I have two Emacs setups with the same configuration. Only the on on Windows has this issue. I guess it is Windows related.

                              <span>I&#x27;m moving soon and looking to set up a sort of contact queue to help me keep in touch with friends and such. I&#x27;d love to find some sort of package that lets me have a queue of contacts that I can configure to give me two or three people to write to or call each week, as scheduled org-mode TODOs. Extra bonus would be if I can assign some sort of approximate frequency or weight to contacts, like once a month, every 3 months, once a year, and so on. Does anyone know of something like this that already exists?

                              <span>Not strictly an emacs question, but I feel like emacs users are the primary users of Super key bindings. I&#x27;m forced to use a Mac for work, and primarily remote display Emacs through x2go and Xquartz. I can&#x27;t figure out how to bind a key to Super. By default, option is used for Meta, but command key combos seems to send international characters to emacs rather than get recognized as a modifier. When I&#x27;m running locally on the Mac, &#x60;(setq mac-command-modifier &#x27;super)&#x60; works, but since my remote emacs isn&#x27;t running on MacOS this has no effect. As far as I can tell, Super doesn&#x27;t show up in Xquartz configuration at all. Is this just a missing feature I&#x27;m going to have to live with? 
 And if you&#x27;re wondering why I don&#x27;t just run locally and use TRAMP, I am doing a lot of python debugging, dap-mode with debugpy is a vastly superior debugging environment to gud-pdb, and dap-mode is broken on TRAMP.

Ideally with an update mechanism of the date when the link is called and/with a function  update-last-update-link-at-point
 Is this possible? What would be the pain points? Would it bring value to anyone else?
 I guess the descriotion would have to be of the kind {desc}-{last-update}, with {desc} being freely adaptable...
 It would help in my case to overview what needs to be updated (I have also some kind of &#x27;meta&#x27; notes with many links )
 Thanks for your opinions

                              <span>I am trying to copy this conditional preamble for latex. I upgraded to org-9.7 on Vanilla emacs-29.1 w/ everything else working. The variable org-export-conditional-features is in the new code for ox-latex but I cannot find anything for org-latex-feature-implementations. Does anyone know where I can find this to patch into my config, or implement some other way? Thank you.

I tried quitting with C-g, but that deletes what I have done and leaves the .dir-locals.el empty. Plus, the next time I do C-c p E, it just opens this empty file instead of giving me the dialog to choose the variable to set. What am I doing wrong?
 This is my projectile configuration in init.el:  (use-package projectile :diminish projectile-mode :config (projectile-mode) :bind-keymap (&quot;C-c p&quot; . projectile-command-map) :init (when (file-directory-p &quot;~/projects/&quot;) (setq projectile-project-search-path &#x27;(&quot;~/projects/&quot;))) (setq projectile-switch-project-action #&#x27;projectile-dired))

 I&#x27;ve been playing with emacs for a few days now (coming from vim) and would like to know if there is a better way to switch between windows other than the default C-x o. On vim, I had the binding C-h (to move to left window) and C-l (to move to right window).
 Can I make similar bindings for emacs as well? Thanks.

 What I want to do:
 When i call org-occur it prompts for regexp and highlights the file. I can use a different key to trigger &quot;next error&quot;. However I&#x27;ve learned its possible to create temporary overlay maps so you can temporarily bind a key to call a function as well. 
 Example I use for my custom my/pop-global-mark-ring function. This lets me press the binding C-H-m to do an initial global mark pop, then create an overlay map where i can repeat press m to cycle the global mark ring. 
  (defun my/pop-global-mark-ring() &quot;move cursor to last mark in global ring, repeat calls will cycle&quot; (interactive) (pop-global-mark) (set-temporary-overlay-map (let ((map (make-sparse-keymap))) (define-key map (kbd &quot;m&quot;) &#x27;my/pop-global-mark…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to debug some &#x60;pytest&#x60; tests. In PyCharm it&#x27;s as simple as placing a breakpoint and pressing the play icon next to a test. I&#x27;m trying to replicate similar functionality in Emacs and I&#x27;m struggling.
 I&#x27;m using eglot and dab-debug is installed, but when &#x60;dap-debug&#x60; command is invoked, nothing happens.
 Advices?

 I want to create a document template engine. The program should work like this:
 You define data types (as yaml or using a GUI) and a document template. This file is rendered as website with forms for every data type. The data is saved to a yaml file. This file will be parsed and the variables will be used to fill out the document template.
 Here is an example:
 message: &#x27;#type&#x27;: textarea &#x27;#title&#x27;: Message name: &#x27;#type&#x27;: name &#x27;#title&#x27;: Name date: &#x27;#type&#x27;: date &#x27;#title&#x27;: Date 
 &#x3D;&gt; This file will be rendered as web GUI, the collected data is saved to a yaml file like this one:
 data: date: &#x27;2023-08-06&#x27; message: |- This is my message to you. Kind regards name: degree: &#x27;&#x27; first: Peter last: Ro…</span>

                              <span>Hallo a beginner here. (Sorry for my english)
 If a function, that is written in an end recursive form (so doesn&#x27;t leave any tmp variables / operations on the stack), called unto itself via ex. curry / uncurry (and friends) still end recursive as the stack frame changes into that currying function? So basically does haskell (the compiler) undestand that function as still end recursive or not?
 Thanks already

 It&#x27;s a pure Stack setup. I&#x27;ve tried many techniques using ghcup, different versions of Stack and GHC... The closest I could get is all the tests passing on Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS, but it reinstalls GHC 8.0.2 every time it runs the tests. (!)
 If this will take more than just a minute or two, I&#x27;m happy to pay for someone&#x27;s time — have tests passing so I can further develop it and use it. For a stretch goal, I&#x27;d love it to develop it easily on my Mac with VS Code — so, running on the current recommended ghcup, hls, and ghc, all on Mac silicon. 
 If this works out, I&#x27;m open to the person who gets this working again doing the new dev required — test and use it with the latest Oregon laws.
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Since one month i work for an institutional entity that has quite high security standards , and i work with OS Windows, I cannot ask to install programs due to policies, even not opensource ones as emacs and getting COMPLETELY crazy because I am collecting my notes from the notepad, and is so bad, there is any solution I can install doom emacs or emacs in a smart way?
 I can access to the internet, cannot use usb slot, nor run .exe files, do not have virtual environments, is out of question I can speak now with the manager to ask to review the policies. Apart from this not positive side, I like the institution a lot from an etical point of view. Was thinking to install a linux distro in the cloud and access from the office but not sure, I cannot share work data outside my pc, at this purpose I would have find a program that would allow to host on docker emacs: cloudmacs. Any recommendation?

                              <span>Some users were reporting problems when trying to set up notifications for scheduled org-mode tasks. I couldn&#x27;t find many examples for doom emacs, which got me slightly concerned.
 Does anyone have any configuration or advice for choosing the right package (org-notifications, org-alert, org-wild-notifier, org-timed-alerts) for setting it up? The end goal I expected to be standard system notifications (e.g. notify-send) that you could configure to appear 30 minutes, 1 hour, 1 day before a scheduled event.
 UPDATE1: It appears that org-alert isn&#x27;t working out of the box and requires some extra configuration - it is necessary to make org-notifications work.
 UPDATE2: seems that by default org-alert outputs to message buffer. Adding (setq alert-default-style &#x27;libnotify) seems to have solved it.
 UPDATE3: looks it shouldn&#x27;t be necessary. org-notifications should set alerting style to libnotify already when running (org-notifications-start), so adding it to (after! org... ) block should be enough (hopefully).
 UPDATE4: above doesn&#x27;t work. If anyone figured it out please let me know.

                              <span>I would like the agenda item to open in a full buffer when I select it with C-c a a and press Enter. Currently, it shows up in a horizontal split, with the previous buffer occupying the top half of the screen and the selected agenda item taking the bottom part. This behavior is annoying to me, and I want it to behave like the C-x 1 command, which opens the selected item in a full buffer. I&#x27;m not sure which setting I need to modify to get the desired result.

How to prevent GHC from inferring types with undesirable constraints by Nicolas Frisby
For a broad class of domain-specific constraints/languages, this is the first technique I’ve learned of that enables custom compile-time error messages in the particularly insidious scenario where the user’s mistake incurs polymorphism that the library author did not intend.
Lazy Layout by Jasper Van der Jeugt
Tumblr in particular has a fairly nice way to do photo sets, where these can be organised in rows and columns. I wanted to see if I could mimic this in a recursive way, where rows and columns can be subdivided further.

                              <span>The vast majority of the Rust projects are using Cargo as a build tool. Cargo is great when you are developing and packaging a single Rust library or application, but when it comes to
a fast-growing and complex workspace, one could be attracted to the idea of using a more flexible and scalable build system. Here is a nice article elaborating on why Cargo should not be considered as a such a build system. But there are a handful of reasons to consider Bazel:
Bazel’s focus on hermeticity and aggressive caching allows us to improve median build and test times, especially for a single Pull Request against a relatively large codebase.
Remote caching and execution can significantly reduce the amount of Rust compilation done locally on developers’ machines.
The polyglot nature of Bazel allows exp…</span>

                              <span>Given the expressivity of our favorite language, it would be possible to build a set of libraries that work very well between each other in order to perform AI related tasks.
 I&#x27;m thinking in making something that is very composable and easy to use through do-notation, in order to achieve tasks like completion through an LLM, creating and storing embeddings, analyzing pictures and audio, etc.
 All of this abstracted in some kind of interface (MTL, Free Monad and friends, or whatever other thing)
 Given that GHC can generate Wasm and we can make mobile apps with Reflex, one could be able to use these things in any platform easily.
 Does that sound appealing? (I mean, ignoring the shit ton of absurd hype there&#x27;s around ChatGPT, just focusing on the utility of a cohesive AI ecosystem in Haskell)

                              <span>I&#x27;m learning Haskell in my spare time. I&#x27;ve been using Effectful for some simple programs and I&#x27;ve really enjoyed the experience.
 I&#x27;d like to be able to be able to use it with WAI and a lightweight framework, like Twain, but I&#x27;m not sure how to integrate it.
 Using the Twain README snippet as an example (see below), how could I adapt the usage of ResponderM so I can instead use the Eff monad. This would allow me to use the builtin effects like Reader, etc.
 Also, is there a better way to access a reader environment? Should the environment go in the WAI Request&#x27;s Vault instead of trying to use a different monad? The library moved to using vault instead of a TwainM and RouteM monad which reminded me of Scotty.
 Thanks.

                              <span>Today, 2023-07-26, at 1000 UTC (that&#x27;s less than 30 minutes from the time of this announcement!) we are streaming the 8th episode of the Haskell Unfolder live on YouTube:
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;V7673JaWXaA&amp;list&#x3D;PLD8gywOEY4HaG5VSrKVnHxCptlJv2GAn7&amp;index&#x3D;8
 Many of Haskell&#x27;s abstractions come with laws; well-known examples include the Functor type class with the functor laws and the Monad type class with the monad laws, but this is not limited to type classes; for example, lenses come with a set of laws, too. To people without a mathematical background such laws may seem intimidating; how would one even start to think about proving them for our own abstractions? In this episode of The Haskell Unfolder we will discuss examples of these laws, show how to prove them, and discuss common techniques for such proofs, including induction. We will also discuss why these laws matter; what goes wrong when they do not hold?
 The Haskell Unfolder is a YouTube series about all things Haskell hosted by Edsko de Vries and Andres Löh, with episodes appearing approximately every two weeks.
 We also have a GitHub repository with the code samples from the episodes:
 https://github.com/well-typed/unfolder
 And we have a public Google calendar listing the planned schedule:

                              <span>I have a 3d printed ergo-mech split keyboard and I&#x27;m toying with the idea of building a streamlined portabl monitor/pc that will let me minimize my footprint on the go with my keyboard. 
 Ideally I&#x27;d like almost a tablet like experience where I just setup a monitor and connect my keyboard (considering making a bluetooth version) and go to work for writing / notes etc in emacs. Use case would be taking a train or chilling in a cafe. 
 Currently I have a standard laptop running ubunto but have 0 use for the keyboard so the monitor just sits further away from me than I&#x27;d prefer. 
 Any ideas?

 - Plain Theme
 - Tao Theme
 - Stimmung Theme
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hello; I am constantly getting long backtraces from Corfu in Common Lisp mode. It is triggered just by normal typing, on every new list, like in the schreenshot above. The same backtrace was also triggered when I opened the parameter list for the function definition, while I was typing &quot;array&quot; as the first parameter.
 Any idea what am I doing wrong? Do I need to enable/disable something, or is it just a bug? 
 I have built Emacs from the current git master: GNU Emacs 30.0.50 (build 1, x86_64-pc-linux-gnu, cairo version 1.17.8) of 2023-07-24, so I am on the edge, with other words, might be Emacs bug as well :).

                              <span>Hi all.
 I&#x27;ve settled on learning emacs for my creative writing, and am wondering how I can have a file of my characters open in one buffer at the part describing &quot;Stan&quot;, and the same file in another buffer showing the part describing &quot;Loretta&quot; (python fans will understand the choice of names).
 I&#x27;m aware I can have different files in different buffers all displayed at once, but I don&#x27;t really want my dramatis personae broken up into lots of single files. I also want to be able to add to the character descriptions as I&#x27;m writing and think of new bits about them and/or change things as I go along and come up with new ideas.
 As I&#x27;ve got a widescreen monitor, I want to be able to have those to one side and the story file open in the middle of my screen with my notes on location in a buffer to the other side. What I&#x27;ve found on YouTube has confused me as I&#x27;m failing to apply the information to what I want, and my google-fu appears to have gone down to the Crown for a pint.
 Please help this complete newbie. Thank you in advance.

                              <span>Hello,
 I am using doom emacs for rust. When I run compilation or test (with in example rustic-cargo-test) an compilation window opens. When I then go through the errors using next-error, the next error in the compilation window is moved into view, but only its top line. Since rust errors are very descriptive and spawn multiply lines, can I somehow instruct next-error to not only move the next error into view but also move to the top of the compilation window? That way I could see the full error message.
 Thank your for any help :).

                              <span>Hey there,
 I&#x27;m wondering if anyone can please point me to any Emacs packages for generating random events and tables from Mythic Game Emulator or anything similar.
 Asking since even though random table and random name generator sites exist, it would be a nice workflow to do it in Emacs via a function that spits out the same info in an Org Mode buffer than having to have so many browser tabs open for the same effect.
 It would be even better if it could spit out random scenarios given characters that you provide etc. I know this type of idea is borderline CharGPT but it would be way less daunting and more fun to just have something do this for you for solo players.
 ​
 Thanks!

                              <span>Are we allowed to post content related to Emacsens other than GNU Emacs in this sub? Yesterday, I posted an approach for a new Emacsen in a conceptual stage and that post was deleted. The concept is to rewrite the C backend with multi-threading support while maintaining full API compatibility with elisp code. The post contained information about working code demonstrating the concept.
 I hope that was some misunderstanding on the mod part. But if this post is deleted, then I&#x27;ll have my answer.

                              <span>This release adds BigInt/BigDecimal support and a way to create zero-overhead new types.
 What is Iron?
 Iron is a library bringing type constraints to Scala. You can attach predicates to type and ensure they pass at compile-time or runtime:
 scala val x: Int :| Positive &#x3D; 5 val y: Int :| Positive &#x3D; -5 //Compile-time error val z: Either[String, Int :| Positive] &#x3D; -5.refineEither //Left(&quot;...&quot;) 
 Check the README for further information.
 Main changes
 Support for BigInt and BigDecimal
 All constraints in io.github.iltotore.iron.constraint.numeric except Infinity and NaN now support BigInt and BigDecimal.
 RefinedTypeOps
 You can add smart constructors to your type aliases using the RefinedTypeOps trait:
 scala type Temperature &#x3D; Int :| Positive object Temperature extends RefinedTypeOps[Temperature]  scala val temperature: Temperature &#x3D; Temperature(100) val maybeTemperature: Option[Temperature] &#x3D; Temperature.option(100) val temperatureOrError: Either[String, Temperature] &#x3D; Temperature.either(100) 
 Other changes

To me, the problem is that ultimately accuracy still needed to be evaluated by &quot;professional annotators&quot;.
I don&#x27;t know yet what to make of it.
However, I am trying to keep track of AI as a most likely assistant in a literal sense. I am very suspicious:
Manfred Spitzer compares the effect of an ox and a tractor on work performance and health.[62/63][#spitzer2012]
If you harness an ox to the plough, you still have to work hard. You have to walk, steer the plough and so on.
If you hitch a tractor to the plough, you don&#x27;t have to work at all, you just sit and don&#x27;t exert yourself physically.
So we can distinguish two ways in which we increase our performance:
we increase the effectiveness of our efforts.
we replace our efforts with the efforts of others.</span>

                              <span>Hi, l&#x27;m a graphic designer from Argentina, (meaning I&#x27;m average-skilled in english and and a zero in programming)
 ​
 I found Orgzly while looking for an organizer / agenda for my android phone, and it became essential in my everyday routine.
 Sadly, there isn&#x27;t too much info available on the subject, let alone in spanish.
 So here is a question: I haven&#x27;t been able to make a notification to work in advance, e.g.: if I set the time for a task at 10 hrs., and the &quot;delay&quot; with a value of -1h, I understand it should trigger a notification at 9, but never did.
 Maybe thers some configuration in my new phone I&#x27;m not activating (Pixel 6) or in the app preferences.
 Any help would be appreciated.
 Thanks in advance
 ​

 They used to look like this:

 Also it seems that text under headline is no longer indented (second arrow on the first image). I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s a related issue, but if someone experienced recently a similar problem please let me know.

                              <span>After finding org-roam-ui, I was interested in how that package created a webpage that displayed information from, and interacted with emacs. From what I can tell, org-roam-ui uses simple-httpd and websocket.el to create a webserver which is used to transfer information between the page and emacs. 
 I wanted to see whether I could use that general idea to create a dashboard/launch page for emacs. Ideally, I would be able to make a page which could display my org agenda/calendar in real time, give me buttons for a few commands, display information from my ledger file, and let me search my org and roam directories. 
 I don&#x27;t have a very good understanding of how this works however, and my limited grasp took me just far enough to create a webpage, start the webserver in emacs, and access the page. I had wanted to start small (maybe a button that runs some arbitrary command or displays a message in emacs) but I don&#x27;t even know where to start with that. 
 I was wondering whether anyone had any specific resources that might help, or advice as to how I might tackle this? I&#x27;m reading more into how webservers work on my own but I&#x27;m a little lost.
 Any help would be appreciated!

 The same question applies to JSON. I discovered that there is a built-in package called json. I&#x27;m unsure if I still need to install the json-mode package.

When i tried typescript with this setup, it almost worked fine except, at points i was getting this error - json-parse-error \u0000 is not allowed without JSON_ALLOW_NUL . Searched about it and found similar issue from lsp-mode&#x27;s github - https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode/issues/2681 but unfortunately it didn&#x27;t solve the issue. If you have faced this or know what to do please help me out.

                              <span>I discovered that both spacemacs and purcell emacs starter kits out of the box turn on desktop-save-mode. This means that emacs tries to save its state, and recover it on start up. This does not work reliably at present in Android emacs: Android may terminate emacs at any moment, and that may leave an inconsistent saved state.
 Until someone comes up with a solution for this, it is important to disable desktop-save-mode. So add the following to the user (local) part of the start-up file(s):
 (desktop-save-mode -1)
 In spacemacs that is in ~/.spacemacs dotspacemacs/user-config()
 In purcell that is in ~/.emacs.d/lisp/init-local.el
 The emacs variable desktop-save-mode should then be nil after startup.

                              <span>Hi when I try to recall later entries from my kill-ring with yank-pop I have this weird behaviour where I have to call yank-pop three times to get further back in the kill-ring. If say I have this in my scratch buffer
 (setq kill-ring nil) ; nil (evaluated) 1. First Item 2. Second Item 3. Third Item 
 And then kill each line one by one with C-k when I look at my kill-ring with browse-kill-ring I have the expected:
 3. Third Item ------- 2. Second Item ------- 1. First Item 
 But then if I yank with C-y I get back 3. Third Item but now my kill-ring looks like:
 3. Third Item ------- 3. Third Item ------- 2. Second Item ------- 1. First Item 
 And so when I then immediately call yank-pop with M-y , instead of getting 2. Second Item I again just see the third item, and I always need to call yank-pop three times to actually start getting back into the kill-ring.
 I am running fairly vanilla Emacs, with no packages shadowing the yank/kill commands. Could anyone help explain why this happens, or anything I should look into to change so that I get what I imagine should be the expected behaviour where C-y gives me the third item, but then M-y should replace that with the second item and one more M-y would give me the first?
 Thanks a lot for any help / suggestions?

They sometimes use prop-line, sometimes -*- line. It&#x27;s hard for me to connect these two.

 Does it mean property line?

                              <span>I often spin up Android emulators, so I wanted the ability to get packages set up quickly, and what better tool for this than Emacs. 
 Hence, I put up together https://github.com/migalmoreno/fdroid.el which leverages the fdroidcl CLI to offer a completion-based interface to manage F-Droid packages. Happy to hear your thoughts on it!

Perhaps any beginners here might find it helpful, I tried to document it so that it is easy to get it up and running.
 I am happy about any suggestions or feedback on the code.

                              <span>For example, lazy evaluation makes debugging different from eager evaluated languages. At some specific points of a program, many expressions maybe partially evaluated. I suspect there should be something like call stack for function, but for partially evaluated expressions.
 Hence there should be some improvement to everyday&#x27;s debugger. But I&#x27;m not familiar with this. 
 If you have anything in mind, please bring it up here. It&#x27;s not necessarily exclusive to Haskell though. Thanks. :)

                              <span>Does &#x27;do notation&#x27; have any overhead that can be avoided by simply using bind:
 my example
 do hPutStr handle &#x3D;&lt;&lt; getLine 
 vs
 do msg &lt;- getLine hPutStr handle msg 
 If there is no speed difference which do yall think is more readable?
 Obviously, the second one is more readable for a novice but I do like the look of just binding &#x60;getLine&#x60; to &#x60;hPutStr handle&#x60;.
 EDIT: There is more code after this, it is not just this line.

                              <span>This thought is a little disjointed, will hopefully make more sense by the time I hit post.
Due to other obligations, I am not a full-time scholar or researcher. Trying to fit my deep work in here and there around my schedule leaves me feeling like I&#x27;m not making any progress at all.
I&#x27;d like to implement a method of tracking the amount of time I spend on reading, note-taking, uploading notes to my ZK, processing into my own words, etc. Uncertain what that looks like.
Does anybody here track time spent as a variable? How so?</span>

 I’m working on building a config from scratch, and I read Mastering Emacs, in which the author advocates using the customize interface, but a lot of configs and the Emacs from Scratch series use elisp.

                              <span>hello,
 I want to be able to open URLs from within my text files, by using the function M-x browse-url.
 Unfortunately I can&#x27;t seem to make it work, i am getting the error,
 &quot;No suitable browser for URL&quot; 
 I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of things I&#x27;ve found on the web, but nothing seems to work.
 some of the things i&#x27;ve tried include:
 (setq browse-url-browser-function &#x27;browse-url-default-windows-browser) (setq browse-url-browser-function &#x27;browse-url-generic browse-url-generic-program &quot;start chrome&quot;) (setq browse-url-browser-function &#x27;browse-url-generic browse-url-generic-program &quot;C:/Program Files/Google/Chrome/Application/chrome.exe&quot;) (setq browse-url-firefox-program &quot;C:/Program Files/Mozilla Firefox/firefox.exe&quot;) (setq browse-url-chrome-program &quot;C:/Program Files/Google/Chrome/Application/chrome.exe&quot;) (setq browse-url-browser-function &#x27;browse-url-firefox) 
 i didn&#x27;t try everything together of course!
 ​
 Any ideas what I am doing wrong here?

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to enable treesitter in Emacs 29 (installed on MacOS using homebrew and emacs-plus@29). I get the following error in *Messages* and no syntax highlighting in C++ code;
 Error during redisplay: (jit-lock-function 26033) signaled (treesit-query-error &quot;Node type error at&quot; 99 &quot;(true) u/font-lock-constant-face (false) u/font-lock-constant-face (null) u/font-lock-constant-face (nullptr) u/font-lock-constant-face&quot; &quot;Debug the query with \treesit-query-validate&#x27;&quot;)&#x60;
 This error is repeated several times in the *Messages* buffer.
 I have the following in my init.el;
 (use-package treesit
 :config
 (add-to-list &#x27;major-mode-remap-alist &#x27;(c-mode . c-ts-mode))
 (add-to-list &#x27;major-mode-remap-alist &#x27;(c++-mode . c++-ts-mode))
 (add-to-list &#x27;major-mode-remap-alist &#x27;(python-mode . python-ts-mode))
 (setq treesit-font-lock-level 4))
 I have installed all grammar (without any errors) in ~/.emacs.d/tree-sitter using treesit-install-language-grammar. I have also checked that c++-ts-mode is the major mode in the buffer. Do I need to set anything else to get this to work?

The first thing that I built is a way to use github actions to automatically tangle together all of my literate elisp config files (source project here) into one jekyll markdown page for a static website. Now, whenever I change my config it shows up in real time on the website.
 I&#x27;m still working on adding to it, but please check out the exported source. I&#x27;d love to share more about how I did this for anyone interested.
 In the future, I&#x27;ll start sharing small articles with more about how to solve common technical problems for python programmers in emacs.

Is there any possibility to shown a list of directories based on project... similar to the way bookmarks and files are shown by  consult-buffer.
 I&#x27;d like a list of &quot;org-attach-sources&quot; to be defined in the init.el, and this list of directories offered as choices when attaching files (with org-attach-copy).
 I am not a coder... if someone can lead the way and point me to something similar that I can adapt...

                              <span>Hi,
 I am new to emacs and its keybindings. So I thought, for the powerfull dired mode, hydra would be nice to help me get learn and lookup the keybdings.
 I want hydra do open when I press the &quot;.&quot; key while in dired mode, but I cannot get it to work. This is my attempt:
  (with-eval-after-load &#x27;dired (map! :map dired-mode-map &quot;.&quot; &#x27;hydra-dired/body ) ) 
 while
  (with-eval-after-load &#x27;dired (map! :map dired-mode-map &quot;C-.&quot; &#x27;hydra-dired/body ) ) 
 works!
 Why? How can I rebind the &quot;.&quot; key in dired mode?
 Thanks!

                              <span>When I Shift/Control/Meta click on a tab on the tab bar (using tab-bar-mode), Emacs closes. I tried disabling any such keybinding but it does not work. I cannot even check what happens with C-h k.
 Is this intended behaviour or is there a problem? Can I change it?
 I tried
 (define-key global-map (kbd &quot; S-&quot;) &#x27;ignore) (define-key global-map (kbd &quot; S-&quot;) &#x27;ignore) 
 and the same with &quot;nil&quot; instead of &quot;&#x27;ignore&quot;, and for C instead of S.

 Is there a way with advices to do something before the return function gets evaluated? From my understanding using filter-return would give me (find-file file) return value after it gets executed, I&#x27;d like to do something before it&#x27;s evaluated (i.e. before it visits the file and creates the new buffer).
 Not sure if advices can help here or it would be better to just redefine the whole function.

 How do I actually use the new org version? Any help is appreciated.

A Sixth Grade Vocabulary Notebook
The sixth grade language arts class at the school in Altadena, CA, which my daughter attends, has a weekly set of vocabulary exercises which they keep in a simple composition notebook. Each week the teacher picks two vocabulary words (eg: passage, intelligent) and throughout the week the students fill in bits of knowledge about the word itself. On Monday they write down the word, a preliminary definition of it in their own words, a quick sketch or drawing of their perception of the word, and any prior knowledge they have of it. On Tuesday they…</span>

                              <span>My name is Paribanú Freitas. I am a psychologist and university professor in my country, Uruguay. I am currently doing my doctoral thesis in &quot;social studies&quot; and I came to the zettelkasten method by different youtube content creators.
Through my work I have always been interested in the worlds of productivity and the articulation between educational processes and difficult resources of intellectual work. In fact, a few years ago I have been blogging on this last subject, although I do not publish very much on it: www.tdg.hypotheses.org .
Clearly for those of us who are knowledge workers at different levels (and especially if that knowledge is academic knowledge) I believe the zettelkasten method is really essential and definitive. Luhmann&#x27;s productivity clearly demonstrates it and I do not understand how the teaching of the method in depth and in a practical way is not part of the educational grids at the university level.
Currently, along with researching and implementing the method in order to support my doctoral research, I am thinking of opening an extracurricular and open course at my university on digital tools for intellectual work, study and writing techniques, time organization resources and other skills and technologies to be &quot;taught&quot; by Twitch. There are already many students who have shown interest in the proposal and I love that it&#x27;s on Twitch since I think I&#x27;m a bit of a geek despite my age.
Finally, this semester I have also created a discord community (in Spanish) for postgraduate students from Latin America. If anyone is interested, I leave the link in case it works: https://discord.gg/c7CX6TVExH
I&#x27;m glad I found this community and I&#x27;ll be participating in it frequently for sure. Thank you so much!</span>

                              <span>Hi! I recently started using org-mode, and I am quite impressed by how versatile and powerful this software is. However, I have been having a problem that I have not been able to solve when exporting my document to a PDF file. The problem is this: when exporting the citations and bibliography, I need these to be exported in Spanish, but I have not been able to get the &#x60;org-export-dispatch&#x60; to use this language.
 Right now, I am using emacs 28.2 and citeproc 20230228.1414 as my CSL processor. My operating system is Debian 12. For my biblography I am using the Chicago Manual of Style 17th edition (full note) citation format and my .bib file was exported from Zotero using the BetterBibTeX add on.
 In my init.el I have the following parameters:

                              <span>I have one project in akkahttp.
 It has more than 20 files each of which contains around 15 to 25 routes.
 Even if I change one line of code or I change entire file the compileScala task of gradle takes more than 1 minute to complete. It recompiles all the files in the project
 My configuration is as follows
 gradle: 7.4.2
 ------------------------------------------------------------
 Gradle 7.4.2
 ------------------------------------------------------------
 Build time: 2022-03-31 15:25:29 UTC
 Revision: 540473b8118064efcc264694cbcaa4b677f61041
 Kotlin: 1.5.31
 Groovy: 3.0.9
 Ant: Apache Ant(TM) version 1.10.11 compiled on July 10 2021
 JVM: 18.0.1.1 (Oracle Corporation 18.0.1.1+2-6)
 OS: Mac OS X 13.4.1 aarch64 
 scala: 2.13.8
 jdk: 1.8.0_31
 ​
 I am looking for an incremental complication mechanism which recompiles only those files in the project which are modified with respect to previous compilation

                              <span>I have been working with Scala for almost a year and a half, mainly using the Apache Spark Engine, lately, I have thinking about how to improve my Scala and maybe other libraries I should start learning for future proofing my career with Scala, maybe Akka or Cat, but, witch are the use cases for them and how do I start learning them without a real project.
 Any advice on what should I focus on and how to improve?

                              <span>Hi all,
 my team is currently at a crossroad. We&#x27;ve been building a couple of services over the years using the Play framework. Maybe it wasn&#x27;t the best choice back then, since we really only have an http (mostly) REST backend server, but coming from a Java background, that seemed like a good one-stop-shop.
 Now, given the current maintenance state of the framework, plus the fact that a few other teams have moved to spring-based solutions, we are evaluating where to move next.
 The first choice would be to use Akka-HTTP directly (despite the price), but then that would still require us to rethink:
  
DI framework (guice for play) and service lifecycle - do we need that?
 Actions and action composition - filtering and refining requests
 String translation
 Routes generation - we really liked how easy was to find routes information in play with routes files
  
I played a bit with http4s and tapir, and loved how clean the functional interfaces are, but my colleagues and managers are arguing that &quot;it is not widely used and we just wanna use frameworks/libraries that have good/active support&quot;.
 I did some research, and despite seeing that most of the libraries mentioned across the website have frequent-enough updates, I&#x27;m not sure which ones are more &quot;reliable&quot; on long term.
 Also, if anyone has any insight, or faced similar problems before, how did you get a resolution?
 Thank you all!

                              <span>In my journey with real-time data processing, I faced some challenges understanding Apache Kafka. Luckily, I discovered this guide which offers a comprehensive look at Kafka. It clarified many complex aspects for me, and I thought it could be helpful for others too: https://oso.sh/blog/what-is-apache-kafka. How have your experiences with Kafka been?

                              <span>Hi folks! I need participants for the research I am conducting as part of my Master&#x27;s thesis on the adoption of functional programming in the industry, its industrial readiness, as well as the benefits and challenges of its implementation.
 If you even briefly use some concepts and ideas from functional programming in your daily work and can spare ~5-7 minutes to answer the survey below (or share it with your colleagues, instead), I would be incredibly grateful!
 The survey results, along with the conclusions from their analysis, will be publicly shared as part of the Master&#x27;s thesis, but I will also try to present them in the form of an online article.

 I was able to clean up the code for the most part, with some minor modifications, but I&#x27;m not able to figure out what was going on in the uniqueLetters &#x3D; unique string line. I can, of course, define string but that shadows the earlier use of the variable. Is this just an error, or some historically supported hack, or am I misreading the original?

 This means a recursive type class. Right now I&#x27;m running into two problems: the base case doesn&#x27;t compile, and the compiler tries to match on the base case first, fails, then gives up. I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;m misusing some feature of the language.

                              <span>I always thought of integrating both together, yet with no success. org-roam usually has many files, which tends to make org-agenda much slower. I&#x27;ve been using task management paradigms to fulfill the missing context of the tasks in the agenda. Until I found this article recently Task management with org-roam Vol. 5: Dynamic and fast agenda which was really helpful. Ironically, I had seen it even before but i didn&#x27;t give it much attention because I assumed it will be deadly slow. After applying it, my agenda has become a little bit slower, but it was just fine. After this, I learned that using org-ql for the agenda (instead of org search) makes it faster up to 5 times, and there is cache support. Now the agenda loading speed is no longer a problem, and each task has full context and relation tags to its categories.

 Interface to Open Meteo for Emacs. The service provides weather forecasts, historical weather data, climate change projections, and more.
 Free Weather APIs go in and out of use all the time, hopefully this one will stay with us for a while.

                              <span>I installed haskell-mode and I want to launch the REPL GHCi with the command C-c C-z. 
 However, on typing C-c C-z, it shows error Could not find any installation of GHC. 
 ![Screenshot of above error]1
 And when I use same command again, it launches a new window with what looks like ghci. But when I try to type and execute something, it shows an error &quot;haskell-process&quot; has died as below. (If it matters at all, there is a tests.cabal in the directory where the current open file resides)
 ![Screenshot of haskell process died error]2
 If I enter y then it throws the same error as above about GHC not being found. 
 Now I have my GHC, Stack, Cabal, and HLS installations managed through GHCup. Therefore by default, I only have the ghcup path in the system PATH variable. 
 Since many places online said that there needs to be the ghc path in the PATH, I added the line export PATH&#x3D;$PATH:/home/axiom/.ghcup/bin/ghc to my .bashrc. But this didn&#x27;t fix anything. 
 Further, I looked for other solutions and tried two more things: 
 I added the following lines in my .emacs.d/init.el :  (setenv &quot;PATH&quot; (concat &quot;/home/axiom/.ghcup/bin/ghc&quot; (getenv &quot;PATH&quot;))) (setq exec-path (append &#x27;(&quot;/home/axiom/.ghcup/bin/ghc&quot;) exec-path))  Adding this also didn&#x27;t solve anything. 
 Then I replaced the above lines with (setq haskell-process-path-ghci &quot;/home/axiom/.ghcup/bin/ghc&quot;) and this didn&#x27;t help either. 
 I think the error Could not find any installation of GHC. is being returned from a piece of code in this file https://github.com/haskell/haskell-mode/blob/master/haskell-customize.el but I am not able to figure out how to fix my system according to what the haskell-mode code is trying to do before throwing the above error.

 I want to be able to connect a socket to my server:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;haskell connectionListener :: IO() connectionListener &#x3D; do sock : failed (Cannot assign requested address (WSAEADDRNOTAVAIL)) 
 How should I make the connection?

 The reason I thing this is a emacs thing and not a whitespace.el or even theme related thing is because it also happened to comments when I used a different theme (I used gruvbox-dark before and now I use catppuccin-mocha).
 Anyway, if someone could tell me what causes it and more importantly how could I disable it, I would be very thankful.

 Sorry if it&#x27;s a beginner or very obvious thing, but I swear I tried searching with a lot of different terms and couldn&#x27;t find anything related to it (I say this expecting the actual answer to be something very obvious)
 ​
 Update: I was looking for something to help me in the emacs docs, and in the face attribute page i foun this:
 :distant-foreground Alternative foreground color, a string. This is like :foreground but the color is only used as a foreground when the background color is near to the foreground that would have been used. This is useful for example when marking text (i.e., the region face). If the text has a foreground that is visible with the region face, that foreground is used. If the foreground is near the region face background, :distant-foreground is used instead so the text is readable. 
 Solution: add this to your init file
 (set-face-attribute &#x27;region nil :distant-foreground nil)

                              <span>Hi, I started using Emacs a few days ago and wanted to look into AUCTeX. Every online resource seems to have these inline previews enabled automatically after enabling the AUCTeX package, which is not the case for me. 
 The tutorial that helped me with the initial configuration of Emacs is Elpaca, so that is what I am using. This is my AUCTeX configuration. 
 (use-package auctex :ensure t :defer t :config (setq TeX-auto-save t) (setq TeX-parse-self t)) (setq-default TeX-master nil) 
 This seems to enable the package successfully, and I can compile files and preview them as PDFs, although it sometimes gets stuck on compilation and I have to try again.
 Also, strangely keybinding on my machine seems to be different than the ones in the documentation and guides, for example, &quot;C-c C-e&quot; does not trigger latex-insert-block, but latex-close-block.
 All of this seems very strange, and I have not found anyone having such problems online.

 As part of moving all my calendar needs to Emacs, I wrote a short package that displays the calendar of the org date/time picker in the minibuffer (with support for mouse selecting and other common calendar keybindings).
 Calendar in mini-buffer
 It&#x27;s done by advising org-read-date and so should work for all org related date picking.
 To use, copy the file in the gist somewhere accessible from Emacs, followed by
 (require &#x27;org-minical) (setq org-read-date-popup-calendar &#x27;minibuffer) (setq org-minical-exit-on-click t) 
 Comments are welcome.

                              <span>I have a working emacs lsp setup, and I can open a dart &quot;hello world&quot; program with no issues - the LSP package prompts to import the project root, triggers flycheck, completion works, errors are highlighted. All good. But... I have a more complex project setup (flutter create my_project) and my main.dart exists in the lib subdirectory. I created a .projectile in the project root, I also did a &quot;git init&quot; to be sure of &quot;project root&quot; purity.
 But here&#x27;s the issue: every time I open the main.dart , LSP asks me again to import it: it doesn&#x27;t remember it has done AND flycheck shows no errors. I&#x27;m out of ideas of what it can be. I&#x27;ve a feeling it&#x27;s going to be something painfully obvious.
 I removed the lsp session.el to check that wasnt corrupted too.
 (eglot deals with the same file in the same lib subdirectory with no issues.)
 Suggestions?

I tried copying the code for the grab() block, but I ended up with a cache needs to be active error message. Is there a way to fix this or find other ways to do this? Thank you.

 Next I tried to install Doom Emacs over that, but that failed because Doom Emacs wants to run emacs from the command line during setup and sync. I already had an emacs installed in termux, and Doom used that one, so everything seemed to go well until I then tried to run Doom.
 Next I tried spacemacs and that worked much better. However there are a number of things that need to be configured:
  
It&#x27;s very convenient to have an external keyboard during the setup and configuration.
 Before installing spacemacs, backup ~/.emacs.d to, say, old.emacs.d

                              <span>I am trying to match inline src blocks of the form src_python[]{} exactly once via regex search. I have the regex &quot;\\(src_python\\[.*]{\\)\\([^}]*\\)\\(}\\)&quot; which can match the src block, but if there are two src blocks of that form on the same line, the regex captures both of them as a singular inline src block. Is there a way like in python to specify that the pattern should only be matched one at a time? Thank you.

                              <span>An idea I&#x27;ve had for a package for a while is one that would use spaced repetition to teach keyboard shortcuts.
 My thinking is that it would draw the shortcuts to teach from a few lists, including: - Shortcuts manually set by the user. - Shortcuts for functions often called by the user with M-x. - A manual list of shortcuts the user could define (this could include shortcuts for programs outside of Emacs).
 A simple idea, but I feel what could make it handy is that, if the user uses a keyboard shortcut in the normal course of using Emacs, that would count as a &#x27;review&#x27; of the shortcut. So that would delay the next time that shortcut will come up.
 If a shortcut became a part of their regular use, the review time would get so long, they never see it again (so they&#x27;re not wasting time learning shortcuts they have already internalised).
 I&#x27;ve been using a very rudimentary and undocumented version of this for some time, and I&#x27;ve found it an enormously helpful tool to help myself learn keyboard shortcuts.
 Interested to hear if others would find this valuable, or if this is something only I&#x27;d find worthwhile. Also interested to hear any suggestions people may have.

                              <span>I have a stupid question. I create a trait that attempts to encapsulate a third party library. Initially there will only have one specific library instance implementation (Let&#x27;s called it library A). Later on there will add some others. To my best of knowledge, I can make use of type class for such purpose. The code is below.
 # Scala version 2.12.x # JDK 11 trait MyTrait[T] { ... some methods ... } object MyTrait { def apply[T: MyTrait]() &#x3D; implicitly[Logging[T]] implicit val lib1 &#x3D; new MyTrait[Lib1]{ ... } } 
 Now there is another question coming in. When using this library A, it depends on some external information. However, when creating type class, it can&#x27;t pass additional information because it&#x27;s created by initializing trait. Though I can directly pass those additional information during implicit trait initialization like &#x60;new MyTrait[A] { val a &#x3D; ...; val b &#x3D; ...; }&#x60;, it&#x27;s hard coded, and becomes global variables, which looks not right to me. 
 Any suggestions to achieve such goal in a better way? Many thanks.

                              <span>Hello there,
 I published a little mode to open a Scala REPL based on scala-cli (the next scala command).
 The repo is here: https://github.com/ag91/scala-cli-repl 
 And a blog that describes the features is here: https://ag91.github.io/blog/2023/07/22/scala-cli-repl-a-scala-repl-based-on-scala-cli/
 Hope this helps some Scala developer out there ;)

                              <span>I am using the Miryoku layout and have been reading about meow. 
 I was going to try out emacs but I want the aesthetic of Doom but without evil-mode. I would like to test out Meow and use Doom but disable evil. I don&#x27;t know how to go about doing this, I&#x27;ve jumped back and forth between vanilla and evil for the last two months. 
 Can someone help me in regards to how I can achieve this by what I need to add or change in the ~/.doom.d config. 
 I am confused fyi I do not program (yet) I will be next semester but for now I would just be using it for note taking and trying to tinker around with formatting academic papers. I believe there may be a package for helping with formatting MLA, APA with citations ect.

                              <span>I just started using lsp-mode, so far i only have problem displaying code issues. It always highlight code problems correctly but not always give an explanation. Sometimes i shows a pop up with explanation that matches c++ compiler but sometimes there is nothing at all or the pop up just disappear by itself. Is there a lsp-mode command to bring back the code error explanation?

 Something like etterna or whatever

                              <span>Hey, I want to be able to put a random value into the text buffer from a table in a separate org document. I looked around a bit and I think I&#x27;ll have to write a special elisp function for that. That&#x27;s fine, but I&#x27;m new to Emacs and I&#x27;m not sure how I&#x27;d go about solving this task specifically.
 Can someone who&#x27;s more experienced with emacs give me an idea on the correct way of getting data from a table in another file like that?

                              <span>I know this also comes down to preference, but i&#x27;d like to get some input.
 I&#x27;m currently 100% in neovim for my day-to-day work. I know want to also start a personal emacs config for a more &quot;gui&quot; like editor that can also do a bit more outside of text editing. In all my emacs attempts so far, i included evil mode, as it&#x27;s close to what i know from neovim. But i can&#x27;t help but wonder if i&#x27;m skipping a portion of what emacs is.
 So, with that said: If you started from scratch, migrating from vim, would you go with evil mode or stick to &quot;stock&quot; emacs keybindings? Maybe of interest: I use a ergo keyboard with thumb keys. So, Ctrl, Alt, Shift, Meh and Hyper are pretty easy to access.

 Executing &#x60;M-x diff-mode&#x60; can turn off the smart syntax highlight. How can I configure to do so?

I would like to specify white space between the margin (containing line numbers and whatnot) and the text inside my buffer. Just some nice empty space with the same background color as my buffer. What is the easiest way to pull this off?

 What are examples of functional Rust projects that are well done?

                              <span>SimpleX Chat is a fully open-source, private and secure messaging platform. It is the first, and it seems the only, messaging network that does not have any kind of user identity in its design (not even random numbers) - it uses anonymous pairwise identifiers instead.
 It is also a seed stage startup with a lot of user growth in 2022-2023, and a lot of exciting technical and product problems to solve to grow faster.
 We are looking for a systems Haskell engineer who:
  
wants to work in a startup (high pace and intensity, longer hours, a substantial part of the compensation is stock options, solving only customer problems and avoiding over-engineering).
 expert in Haskell, including: 
 strictness.
 network libraries.
 exception handling, concurrency, STM.
 type systems - we use ad hoc dependent types a lot.
 
 exceptionally pragmatic.
 has some expertise in network protocols, cryptography and general information security principles and approaches.
 
interested to build the next generation of messaging network.
 
does not suffer from &quot;not invented here&quot; syndrome, and at the same time interested to design and implement protocols and systems from the ground up when appropriate.
 
 We prefer links to projects and blog posts and short descriptions to CVs – please don&#x27;t send more than 1/2 of the page.
 You can apply via LinkedIn, or, better, just reach out.

                              <span>I want to make the most of the capabilities that org has. I don&#x27;t know how to combine org&#x27;s features to make it convenient to track various exercises, view the progress. I could use tables, tags, properties, drawers, headlines, timestamps, emacs diaries, calc, lists, checkboxes, etc. but how should I put it all together so that it makes sense and is convenient to use?
  
for multiple people
 running, ongoing record with number of sets, - weights
 wrestling moves
 drills
 date
 time duration
 repetitions
 sets
 weight being lifted
 muscle
 left or right side
 core, upper, lower body
  
My sense is that org is probably the best multifunctional tool to keep track of exercises - I am just not sure how to do it and hope someone could help.

                              <span>Hi all!
 I wanted to make a fair bit of progress before announcing it, but a few weeks ago, I started working on lightweight bindings to the Botan cryptography library&#x27;s C FFI. Initially, I was trying to revive the defunct Z-Botan bindings, but stripping it of its non-building dependencies proved to be infeasible, and the embedded version of Botan also proved to be out of date. Rather than give up, I decided to make a project of it, and start from scratch with fresh bindings to the latest version in modern Haskell.
 This approach has been extremely rewarding, and today, I am proud to share that I have hit a wonderful milestone - I am halfway through implementing the low-level 1:1 bindings.
 Right now, the bindings support:
  
Hashing
 Message authentication codes
 Symmetric ciphers
 Block cipher modes
 Public key signatures
 Bcrypt and Password hashing
 Random number generators
 Base16 and Base64 encoding
  
Frankly, it is awkward to use, isn&#x27;t versioned yet, and does not even have any algorithm constants (yet!), but as long as you can read the Botan C FFI docs, it works - and if everything keeps going as smoothly as it has, a friendlier high-level interface isn&#x27;t too far away.
 I don&#x27;t have a project page yet, but if you want to follow this project, you can check out the repo, or you can follow the devlog on the Haskell Discourse where I&#x27;ve been more-or-less posting daily.

                              <span>I just started my emacs and I have configured the display line numbers mode to be enabled on startup.
 However, I noticed that the &quot;emacs tutorial&quot; buffer does not open with the line numbers enabled.
 But if I open the &quot;Emacs guided tour&quot; buffer, the line numbers show up for it. Also for other files (example Haskell file I was editing, the line numbers are automatically enabled when I open it)
 So seems like only for the &quot;emacs tutorial&quot; buffer its not showing the line numbers. I&#x27;m curious as to why that is since the config clearly says it should be enabled globally. 
 My startup screen where the buffer links are shown for reference :

 A client library and UI for Lemmy, has most of the basics in working order now. interested to hear your feedback if you give it a go. other complex UI features like rich post composing and image handling will be ported from mastodon.el.
 it is designed to have a clean API layer, so the functions in lem-api.el could be used to create other interfaces.

                              <span>Imagine you have full customization on the bindings to native interactive functions, you can utilize and perfect the existing frameworks, which can be chord, modal or hybrid, what would you do most likely to operate the default bindings? 
 Rough idea: Can we design a more coherent keybinding based on the god-mode with sub-modes invoked by the default mode, consisting the following components
  
X mode (which obeys part of existing C-x things, but not all anyway)
 Convert mode (which converts keys in the default mode for a new layer of functionalities)
 Visit mode (which controls buffer navigation, page scrolling without changing the content)
 Insert mode (which allows characteristics input, including minibuffer) 
  
where default mode itself has a layer of functionalities such as p for previous-line, n for next-line.
 Any of those sub-mode is invoked by a char in the default mode, once invoked, you stay at one of those mode unless terminated by an escape key (i.e. g), where it needs consecutive press of gg for exiting insert mode.
 More intuitions: suppose we set the visit mode to the v, it navigates to the previous buffer by vp, once in the loop, you can navigates again by p, or n for next buffer until it receives the termination key g.

                              <span>Hi,
 Recently I kept getting these errors when using Magit.
  error in process sentinel: pfuture-new: Spawning child process: Resource temporarily unavailable error in process sentinel: Spawning child process: Resource temporarily unavailable 
 Most of the time, nothing seems to be broken. But sometimes, the Emacs window would freeze, and I had to kill the process.
 I am not using a MinGW or Cygwin environment.
 I can not figure out what is causing this issue.
 Thanks

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I wanted to let the community know that I recently made a fork of mu4e-send-delay that is compatible with recent versions of Emacs and mu4e. If you aren&#x27;t aware, this is a package that provides functionality to mu4e similar to Gmail&#x27;s &quot;schedule send,&quot; which sends emails after a designated amount of time, rather than immediately. In addition refactoring the codebase, this package is also compatible with Org-msg. There are other differences, and they are enumerated in the newly-renovated README.
 The original repository may not be maintained anymore, and has been inactive for the last several years at the very least. I use the package myself but had to clean up and update the code so it works with current Emacs. I thought I&#x27;d share my updated version.
 Anyway, here&#x27;s my fork: https://github.com/krisbalintona/mu4e-send-delay
 Cheers!

                              <span>One classic appeal of Haskell is that its type system allows experts to define very precise constraints within the program’s problem domain.
In my working experience, such powerful constraints are a double-edged sword for projects with long lifespans.
These sophisticated types do, as promised, statically prevent many kinds of costly mistakes and are indeed expressed via definitions that resemble the particular problem domain better than many other general purpose languages would allow.
On the other hand, the requisite definitions tend to be dense and leak noisy details of how exactly the domain-specific constraints were encoded in the GHC Haskell type system.
This is sadly often apparent in the poor quality of error messages that arise when these type-level programs catch a user’s mistake.…</span>

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m wondering how would you hide an entry completely if none of the tasks match? For example after you reviewed all your tasks in Inbox is it possible to hide Inbox from org-agenda view completely?

 By the way Inbox works by showing all entries that don&#x27;t have none of the &quot;ongoing&quot;, &quot;idea&quot; or &quot;today&quot; tags.

                              <span>Hi Emacs !
 I&#x27;ve been working for a few months on bringing the various helpful Emacs browser packages together in an extensible, multi-browser package. It is called ibrowse.el and its goal is to be able to control your browser through common actions, be it on browser tabs, history or bookmarks using Emacs.
 It relies on the completing-read built-in interface, and thus benefits greatly from integration with consult, marginalia, vertico and embark. 
 You can find it right there : https://github.com/nicolas-graves/ibrowse.el
 I would love to have some feedback and hope it will be useful to you. Let me know what you think !

 When Emacs starts up, it initially displays a cream pink hue that matches the background color of the ef-summer color scheme. That&#x27;s why I added this:

 NOTE: This question is not just about double-space vs. single-space. This is about which spacing to use within double-quotes. That&#x27;s the important bit.
 This is a question for all the double-spacers out here. You use the default (setq sentence-end-double-space t). How do you do the sentence spacing for quoted text? Do you write it like this?
 Bob said, &quot;I get three apples. You get two apples. Ok?&quot; Jess responded, &quot;No, I get three apples. You get two apples.&quot; Bob was not amused. Jess took out his bag, getting ready to collect apples. 
 Or do you write it like this?

 Any guidelines about this?

                              <span>I am very new to Emacs. I want to experiment with Emacs, and I stumbled across a few tutorials that show how to customise your own emacs.d - I thought if I could have (for instance) one stock config, one Doom Emacs config, and a couple of tutorial configs I could avoid getting stuck so hard that I have an unusable Emacs. I would like to avoid installing different copies of Emacs on the same machine, but if that is the way to go, I suppose it would not be the worst thing.
 Is it possible to have multiple Emacs configs? Is there a way to choose at startup which config or &quot;profile&quot; you want to use for that session? Or does Emacs even work that way?

                              <span>Does anyone remember any tutorial for debuggin emacs code? I am just looking for a way to inspect variables when emacs is in certain state. I&#x27;ve managed already to set breakpoints with edebug-set-breakpoint, but there seems to be no way to inspect variables.
 I&#x27;m on doom emacs, which doesn&#x27;t document anything, so help would be really appreciated.
 UPDATE: Thank you all for help. I stayed with edebug and will try to use backtrace-toggle-locals with backtrace to debug emacs code. However, the backtrace keeps disappearing after you run &quot;next-mode&quot; in edebug - does anyone know if you can &quot;make it stick&quot;? It&#x27;s impossible to debug code when it disappears each time you step to next line.
 Those are such basic things, emacs makes life really hard for new users.

 QQ: does anyone here actually use value classes/opaque types for their core?
 I think I haven&#x27;t run into any prod code base that actually uses this.
 I thought about trying it out for a personal project, but they seem weird to use. To me it looks like one of those things that look great in theory but in practice are kind of iffy.

 I really liked reading the scala documentation, but looking at a live project might be the final thing I need before diving into it.

                              <span>Haskell extensions (GADTs, KindSignatures, etc) are a very interesting thing. There are plenty of tutorials on how to use them - which is not very helpful for understanding where they come from.
 The question is simple: how to make a new extension? OR: how do people make a new extension?
 The question is also more complicated:
  
How do people manage to have so many slightly incompatible versions of the same language without generating dependency conflicts? 
 There certainly exists mutually exclusive extensions. What are some examples?
 Do we have a trivial demo extension, say, inserting a new keyword into the language which does nothing?

 How would you write the same for im0 ... imN :: Monad m &#x3D;&gt; m (Maybe a)? Something more elegant than
 pick [im0, ... imN] where pick (im:ims) &#x3D; im &gt;&gt;&#x3D; \m -&gt; case m of Just a -&gt; return $ Just a Nothing -&gt; pick ims pick [] &#x3D; return Nothing

                              <span>I have just got Haskell installed using GHCup in WSL2 (Ubuntu). However, there is a problem with the ghci interpreter.
 When I start ghci and I press enter, the interpreter doesn&#x27;t create a new line, but rather prints in the console the prefix ghci and get ready to receive the next command.
 A new line is only after I enter a new command and get the output in the same line.
 Below is an example of what I see in the terminal.
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;bash
 $ ghci
 GHCi, version 9.2.8: https://www.haskell.org/ghc/ :? for help
 ghci&gt; ghci&gt; ghci&gt; ghci&gt; ghci&gt; 4+48
 ghci&gt;
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 And below is what I would expect:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;bash
 $ ghci
 GHCi, version 9.2.8: https://www.haskell.org/ghc/ :? for help
 ghci&gt;
 ghci&gt;
 ghci&gt;
 ghci&gt;
 ghci&gt; 4 + 4
 8
 ghci&gt;
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 The question is: how can I solve it?

                              <span>I&#x27;m encountering the strangest issue - the org-pandoc-export-to-html5-and-open function seems to correctly export an .html file, but it doesn&#x27;t open it in the browser at the end. It says Running open, but nothing happens.
 I&#x27;ve checked that org-file-apps uses default program to open html (librewolf) and hyperlinks work with it correctly.
 Does anyone know what function is responsible for finding/opening files in ox-pandoc package? There was a similar issue in 2016, but the function author mentioned seems no longer available in doom emacs.
 UPDATE: I&#x27;ve traced the code down to this function in ox-pandoc.el:
  (process-put process &#x27;buffer-or-open buffer-or-open) 
 This should start pandoc with the name of the output file (.html). I will try to run edebug on it and see if values can be inspected.
 UPDATE2: I seem to be hitting a wall with edebug. Does anyone know how to use normal debugger in doom emacs? It doesn&#x27;t seem to have any run function or any debug- function? You&#x27;d think that things like that would be documented.
 org-file-apps:
 ((remote . emacs) (auto-mode . emacs) (directory . emacs) (&quot;\\.mm\\&#x27;&quot; . default) (&quot;\\.x?html?\\&#x27;&quot; . default) (&quot;\\.pdf\\&#x27;&quot; . default))

                              <span>There are several reasons I think Vim is more popular. Here are some:
 - The emacs subreddit has less than half as many members. 
 - Google trends shows that people search for vim more than emacs.
 - In the 2018 stackoverflow survey, vim came out as 6 times more popular than emacs.
 If vim is more popular, do you think this reflects a preference for vim—or are people just not aware of the existence of emacs?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been seeing the semicolon indent a lot when I don&#x27;t want it to. To reproduce this in the simplest case, I renamed my .emacs file and then started up Emacs 27.1 without it. I then created an empty new .emacs file, and on the first line I typed a semicolon and a few words. When I pressed Return, that semicolon indented about 40 characters.
 Can anyone tell me what&#x27;s going on and how to stop it?

 org-capture-templates value now is:
 ((&quot;t&quot; &quot;Personal todo&quot; entry (file+headline +org-capture-todo-file &quot;Inbox&quot;) &quot;* [ ] %?\n%i\n%a&quot; :prepend t) ...) 
 It should be enough to change [ ] on third line to TODO. However all examples I could find only use add-to-list function to create new capture templates instead updating the existing one. I&#x27;d rather not edit the existing files to avoid conflicts when updating (doom) emacs.
 Would you just create a new entry with a different letter? Or can you just a new entry with the same letter and org will use the newer one?

                              <span>I work with Python and never really used Emacs before. But now it is the best option I have on the remote server with tight security. Because of corporate complications, that I cannot talk about, the process of new app installing is long and ultimately uncertain. So, I am trying to set up Emacs to work with Python. I get a tutorial and everything. But the very first step is failing for me. I added this lines to the ~/.emacs
 (require &#x27;package) (add-to-list &#x27;package-archives &#x27;(&quot;melpa&quot; . &quot;http://melpa.org/packages/&quot;) t) (package-initialize) (package-refresh-contents) 
 I saved the file and restart Emacs and get this error:
  
Error in process filter certificate validation failed melpa.org, verification code 1026
  
I tried to google for it, but did not find anything. I suspect that connections like that might be blocked by some firewall rules or something similar - again, tight security. But it would be nice to find out if that is the case, because it is still possible that I just did something wrong or that I can fix it somehow without talking to server admins.

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I&#x27;m back with a follow-up on GPT-Commit, the AI-powered tool that generates commit messages. First off, I want to extend my gratitude to everyone who provided feedback on my previous post. Your insights have been invaluable in refining GPT-Commit.
 In this new blog post, I&#x27;ve shared real-world examples of how GPT-Commit works with different types of commits, specifically using actual commits from the Angular project. I believe these examples will give you a clearer picture of how GPT-Commit can be utilized in your workflow.
 The post also discusses the benefits of using GPT-Commit and how it can help developers save time and increase efficiency. 
 You can read the blog post here: https://ywkim.github.io/gpt-commit-real-world-examples-benefits/
 The examples are all based on actual commits from the Angular project, which you can check out here: https://github.com/angular/angular
 For more information about GPT-Commit, please visit the repository: https://github.com/ywkim/gpt-commit
 I&#x27;m looking forward to hearing your thoughts and feedback on these improvements. If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to share!

                              <span>Math-preview is a fantastic package for previewing latex formulas in emacs. However, I had big problems with getting it working on my non-WSL Windows machine. After hours of research and debugging, I realized the problem actually lied on the Javascript&#x27;s side (as math-preview relies on MathJax to render equations). That is to say, the &#x60;Jason.parse()&#x27; function in Javascript sometimes will wrongfully parse absolutely legit JSONs passed from the command line, throwing inexplicable errors.
 For example, &quot;#&quot; followed by a white space in a customized tex macro would lead JSON.parse to split the argument into two separate lines; and the &#x60;math-preview-mathjax-tex-digits&#x27; variable, which is by default defined as &quot;/?:[0-9]+(?:\{,\}[0-9]*)?|\{,\}[0-9]+)/&quot; will cause the inexplicable &quot;Invalid filename…</span>

 Is that possible to achieve? I have searched, and things equivalent to [a;8] are already super difficult to define. This must be more difficult, but it seems doable, because if n is not an integer, but a type, then it is indeed doable.

 Hello,
 I am currently reading a paper about an algorithm that hashes programs while respecting alpha equivalence (Interesting read! source: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.02856.pdf)
 The language they used for demonstration purposes is very very barebones (basically just the simply untyped lambda calculus, found on page 5)
 I thought I finally understand the entire paper but one quote was still left in my mind, namely on page 5:
  
&quot;This language is very minimal, but it is enough to demonstrate the 𝛼-equivalence challenge, and it can …</span>

 every time I define such a function. It would be way nicer if I can define a type class Every to merge all four of them. However, if I do
 class (Num t, Eq t, Ord t, Fractional t) &#x3D;&gt; Every t instance Every mytype x where x + y &#x3D; 3 ... 
 I will get the ‘+’ is not a (visible) method of class ‘Every’.
 How to do this properly?

 First a bit of context. Learning Haskell forced me through multiple &quot;epiphanies&quot; about building software (if you are on this subreddit you know) and the jump from OO languages with imprecise or non-existent type systems to working with pure functions and a mathematically coherent type system changed the way I build systems. Unfortunately, it took years of pain before I jumped into functional programming, simply because I didn&#x27;t know there was another way of doing things.
 Now, given that (arguably) the relational database + SQL is the standard way of working with data... is there …</span>

                              <span>I am using org mode on my Manjaro system for more than two years, but after the latest update to the latex repos, I can&#x27;t seem to export org files to pdf or preview latex fragments.
 The error I got whenever I try to preview my latex is:
 org-compile-file: File &quot;/tmp/orgtexNnJFiR.dvi&quot; wasn’t producedPlease adjust ‘dvipng’ part of ‘org-preview-latex-process-alist’. 
 I tried this, didn&#x27;t work.
 I checked basic exporting from org to pdf. I got the error:
 ! LaTeX Error: File &#x60;ulem.sty&#x27; not found. 
 Which is weird, since when I search for the file using pacman -F ulem.sty, I get:
 extra/texlive-core 2021.58710-2 (texlive-most) usr/share/texmf-dist/tex/generic/ulem/ulem.sty 
 Did some experience that before? 
 If the question doesn&#x27;t belong here, I&#x27;d appreciate it if you can direct me to the right place

                              <span>I try to use System.OsPath of filepath in my stack project, but the newest LTS snapshot (lts-21.3) ships with filepath-1.4.2.2 which does not contain System.OsPath (however, the nightly build does since it contains the newer filepath package).
 I guess this can be overcome by editing the resolver field in my project&#x27;s stack.yaml. Until now I have had stack.yaml in my .gitignore since stack init generates the file, but maybe it&#x27;s recommended to add stack.yaml to git repositories?
 Also strange that ghc-9.4.5 (used in lts-21.3) ships with filepath-1.4.2.2. That filepath version was released in 2021 but at the time ghc-9.4.5 was released (2023) System.OsPath was available in the newer filepath packages.
 Another question: Should I be progressive and start using OsPath in my new programs?

                              <span>What&#x27;s the best way to effectively spread a map-reduce type task across processors?
 I&#x27;ve got a piece of code that looks like this:
 bestSolutionScore solutions &#x3D; maximum scores where solutionsList &#x3D; M.toList solutions scores &#x3D; [ evalSolution s1 s1 | s1 &lt;- solutionList , s2 &lt;- solutionList ] evalSolution (k1, v1) (k2, v2) | somePredicate k1 k2 &#x3D; v1 + v2 | otherwise &#x3D; 0 
 I should be able to create all of the elements of scores in parallel, and the maximum is a reduce that should be able to be done in parallel too, and consume elements of scores as soon as they&#x27;re generated.
 But my feeble attempts at using a map ... parList evaluation strategy didn&#x27;t produce anything other that a lot of stack use.
 Any suggestions on how to spread this task across cores?

One of the problem I found it hard to learn is that they are using a lot of academic terms to explain some common structures in the codes. So I wonder, is there a better name, that is closer to real life for these &quot;math concepts&quot;?

                              <span>Since Scala is a functional programming language, which means it’s easily composable and very well suited for parallel computing, I’m surprised to see that there aren’t really any Deep Learning frameworks in the Scala ecosystem. 
 Intuitively, I was convinced that Scala and DL were a perfect match but it seems not to be the case. Is there any particular technical element that would explain why ? Is this purely performance related ?

 For users, the upshot is: there were certain methods in the Java reflection API that weren’t callable from Scala 3 — but now they are, as of Scala 3.3.0.
 But the blog post goes into detail about those methods and about how we implemented support for them. It may be of interest to JVM aficionados, Scala and Java language mavens, and compiler hackers.

 I&#x27;m using Emacs 29.0.2 (but same behavior on prior versions of 29.*), with native compilation. 
 Any ideas what may be causing this? It&#x27;s not a big deal, but a little annoying. Thx!

 I wanted to install doom on Arch Linux. Therefore, I downloaded emacs and also downloaded doom after that. The problem is that the doom command does not work for me. Maybe you want to tell me to add the path to .zshrc, but! I don&#x27;t have ~/.emacs.d/bin , I don&#x27;t have such a folder. In ~/.emacs.d/ I only have an empty auto-save-list directory

                              <span>Hi guys, hope you all are doing great. I&#x27;m using vertico and consult. I sort candidates based on history, so when finding files, it is almost always the file I need is the history file which is first candidate but when running find-file it looks like this:
 ​

 when I type anything the first candidate gets preselected automatically:
 ​

 I was wondering if there is some way to make consult preselect the first as in the second image, automatically instead of the directory ??
 ​
 ​
 PS: most of the completing-read commands preselect the first candidate out of the box.

                              <span>Continuing this emacs thread
 This was first reported with Fedora 37, and I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s KDE specific or not, but basically graphical emacs is unusable because the frame shrinks every time you interact with the minibuffer. Type M-x, watch your frame shrink. 
 People have suggested things like 
  (setq frame-resize-pixelwise t) ; nope (setq frame-inhibit-implied-resize t) ; nope 
 This does not work. I haven&#x27;t found a solution yet other than running emacs in terminal mode. However I do have a new piece of data to add.
 When, in an Fedora 38 environment where emacs is broken, I ssh -X to a Fedora 36 environment where emacs is not broken, and run emacs remotely but display it locally on F38, the broken behavior manifests.
 This means it&#x27;s nothing about emacs 28.2 that is the problem, it&#x27;s just some interaction with emacs and whatever passes for the X server and window environment. I have yet to find any KDE behavior stuff I can tweak to fix it, and emacs tweaks have been similarly ineffective. SO ... looking for more help if anybody has it. I plead ignorance on X vs Wayland and what would traditionally be emacs in X client interactions.

                              <span>I recently decided to try Eglot (Emacs 29) with intelephense for my PHP projects (project.el).
 Here is how I set it up:
 (require &#x27;eglot) (add-to-list &#x27;eglot-server-programs &#x27;(web-mode . (&quot;intelephense&quot; &quot;--stdio&quot; :initializationOptions (:licenseKey &quot;KEY&quot;)))) 
 I can start Eglot in a file of my project but nothing works even though the server is connected and running. I don&#x27;t think the problem comes from the lsp server as it is working when using lsp-mode.
 Is there something I forgot to do / not aware of? 
 Example of a request in Eglot&#x27;s event buffer with completion as an example (Shows &quot;No match&quot;): 
 [client-request] (id:21) Mon Jul 17 12:40:21 2023: (:jsonrpc &quot;2.0&quot; :id 21 :method &quot;textDocument/completion&quot; :params (:textDocument (:uri &quot;file:///home/hotel/Documents/TestProject/routes/web.php&quot;) :position (:line 17 :character 4) :context (:triggerKind 1))) [server-reply] (id:21) Mon Jul 17 12:40:21 2023: (:jsonrpc &quot;2.0&quot; :id 21 :result nil)

 On macOS, Emacs works fine with SF Mono.
 On Windows 10/11, the italic variant of SF Mono can not show on Emacs, but it can be showed on Microsoft Office and other Applications.
 Does any one know that how to config Emacs to display the font SF Mono correctly?
 Steps to reproduce:
  
Dowload SF Mono from Apple Websit or from my repo
 Install SF Mono font on Windows 10 by double click the *.otf font files ( If you dowload the SF-Mono.dmg file, you can unzip it by 7zip )
 Start Emacs with emacs -Q

                              <span>I just realized that there is an android port of emacs on f-droid; however, it seems to be almost completely useless, as it lives in its own little sandbox, so it can&#x27;t access my files unless I move them there. I have my emacs config files and my org-mode notes synced to my phone via syncthing. Is there anything I can do to make emacs see them and also keep them synced with my other devices? I attempted to make some symlinks with the adb shell, but I have no idea where in the directory tree is the emacs root directory located.

                              <span>I&#x27;m using flycheck in Org mode and would like to skip certain lines, like property drawer, from being checked by the tool. Is there any way to do this? 
 I suppose adding inline comment (like &quot;# noqa&quot;) wouldn&#x27;t work given it may not be recognized as comments. Otherwise, I would imagine that I need to use some hook to inspect each line and decide to filter in or out before the line being checked.
 I wonder if any standard solution already exists.

 Here are them:
  
fzf
 vim-visual-multi (only the multiple-cursor support, I don&#x27;t care about the other features)
 coc.nvim
  
Do you know any good Emacs alternatives for these?

 Is there a GUI version of emacs I could download but have the same experience with? and get good customize-ability to?
 I use VSCodium(VSCODE) but I want something more lightweight. Is there any way to make running CPP and Python code as good as VSC via emacs.

                              <span>Perhaps a &quot;sinful&quot; act, sometimes we still use vim for quick edits of small files even when we have emacsclient setup. Or it could be as innocent as going to a remote machine that doesn&#x27;t have Emacs setup. Fear no more, building on top of the work from https://github.com/kentarosasaki/vim-emacs-bindings, I made a few more keybindings available including
 - C-f, C-p, C-n, C-b, C-a, C-e, M-f, M-b
 - C-d, C-k, C-y, C-_
 - M-&gt;, M-&lt;
 - M-/
 - (for now)...
 All you need is to copy this to your ~/.vim/plugin/emacs-bindings.vim

                              <span>Is there a guide out there for doing so? I currently use mu4e with my GMail account, which I sync using mbsync. I&#x27;d like to try notmuch to see if it&#x27;s better for my workflow, but I don&#x27;t want to bork my current setup too much.
 I can&#x27;t find a good resource, although this blog post suggests it is fairly simple in doom. For standard GNU Emacs, do I just install notmuch from MELPA and configure it with the current maildir location?

 ​
 But in evil, it creates a read-only buffer only for the output. Is it something we could emulate closer to vim?

 I&#x27;m using https://docs.doomemacs.org/v21.12/modules/ui/workspaces/ to manage workspaces in emacs
 Say that there is one session, 2 workspaces, each workspace manages one project
 One thing I have noticed is: - On macos, each workspace has its own lsp pid - On linux, the lsp pids are the same on those 2 workspaces
 Do you guys know to fix this issue? Thanks in advance,
 Update: sorry for missing what I expect 🙏
 I expect the behavior on linux should be the same with macos
 The context here is: - Each workspace is a project - The project uses pyls as lsp

                              <span>I&#x27;m new to emacs, but intend to learn to use it for orgmode and latex. I&#x27;m not a technical user yet but I plan on becoming one.
 I had org-cdlatex and latex previews working yesterday and kept tinkering my config, but today cdlatex broke. After commenting the new lines in my config, some functionality is missing.
 1.- Pairing of the &quot;$&quot; delimiters doesn&#x27;t work. If I type both manually and write &quot;fr&quot; inside it does expand to $\frac{}{}$.
 2.- Writing the quote &quot; &#x27; &quot; doesn&#x27;t work in text mode. If I type the quote inside a math environment it works almost as expected. Typing $ab&#x27;b results in &quot;$a\mathbf{b}&quot; instead of $\mathbf{ab}$. Typing ab&#x27;b inside of a manually closed pair $$ still doesn&#x27;t work. Typing the quote in any normal text doesn&#x27;t work at all. 
 Doing C-h k &#x27; says that &#x27; is supposed to run org-cdlatex-math-modify. Trying to run manually with M-x after a text that should expand returns &quot;Wrong type argument: commandp, nil&quot;, and the Org&gt;LaTeX&gt;Modify math symbol of the menu bar appears greyed out.
 ​
 How should I start to troubleshoot this?

                              <span>Good Evening Scala Folks,
 A brief post to announce that Indigo 0.15.0-RC3 has been released, with an all new* axis-aligned physics engine.
 (* Read: Limited, inaccurate, no doubt buggy, but nonetheless rather satisfying...)
 (Please note that the lag in the image below is the gif recording, and doesn&#x27;t not reflect the true frame rate, which is displayed in the top left.)
 Animation of axis-aligned physics in the Indigo game engine
 There are lots of details in the release notes linked below:
 https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/indigo/releases/tag/v0.15.0-RC3
 If you&#x27;d like to see a simple game / demo built with it, here&#x27;s one I made earlier:
  
Code - https://github.com/davesmith00000/pong
 Play - https://davesmith00000.github.io/pong/
  
I hope you try building something with it. Please feel free to report any issues, or come and get help / hang out on our Discord server.
 If any of you have even the slightest passing interest in physics and / or maths ...then you&#x27;re already more qualified than I am to have built such a thing! Do consider joining in and helping me improve it.

                              <span>Perhaps somebody knows how to fix this.
 I have been having a weird problem, when once in a while, org-ctags gets loaded, and org-ctags-enable gets executed. Once org-ctags-enable gets executed, org-internal tags stop working (org-ctags wants a etags file for _any_ internal link). See https://www.reddit.com/r/orgmode/comments/13p9zog/internal_links_asking_for_tags_table/
 ​
 I don&#x27;t want that.
 I traced it and here is what I have:
  
help--load-prefixes contains org-ctags (among many others)
 I ask for describe-variable org-reverse-note-order
 org-ctags gets loaded, and org-ctags-enable gets executed
 looking at the source code of org-ctags, it executes (org-ctags-enable) when it gets loaded.
  
How can I remove org-ctags from the help--load-prefixes.
 But perhaps more importantly:
 should autoexecuting org-ctags-enable be considered a bug?

                              <span>I know a little about curry-howard isomorphism, which shows the relationship between formal system and type system. However I want to go further in this direction. Are there more such correspondences other than the usual STLC and dependent type systems? (I&#x27;ve also seen articles on linear types and linear logic) For example what type systems does modal logic correspond to? Are there any survey on this topic? Many thanks!

                              <span>I&#x27;ve recently migrated from straight.el to elpaca, and unfortunately this broke my hyperbole installation. I originally had hyperbole installed using the guide provided by the manual here---I&#x27;ve largely tried to reproduce this in elpaca but I keep getting the following error when my config tries to load the package (specifically on loading hypb-ert.el):
 Eager macro-expansion failure: (void-variable hyperbole-run-test) 
 I feel that I&#x27;m most of the way there, but I&#x27;m just missing something basic. What I&#x27;ve done so far:
  
have elpaca clone hyperbole from the source repo (&quot;https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/hyperbole.git&quot;)
 manually symlink the /kotl, /man, and /test folders from the /elpaca/repos/hyperbole directory to the /elpaca/builds/hyperbole directory (elpaca doesn&#x27;t do this for some reason)
  
Has anyone here gotten this working? I&#x27;ve dug around in the source code and hyperbole-run-test doesn&#x27;t seem to be mentioned much outside of a defal clause in hypb-ert.el itself. I&#x27;d greatly appreciate if anyone here has any insight!

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been using a package called super-save in Emacs, which automatically saves the buffer whenever the Emacs window loses focus. While it initially seemed like a convenient feature, over time, I&#x27;ve come to realize that it&#x27;s not always the best idea. There have been instances where I made mistakes in a file, such as accidentally removing a large number of lines, and when I clicked on a different window, the result got automatically saved without me noticing. This has led to some unexpected and unwanted changes in my files.
 I&#x27;m curious to know if anyone else has had similar experiences. Have you used super-save or any similar functionality, and did it prove to be useful in your case? I&#x27;m trying to weigh the benefits and drawbacks before deciding whether to continue using it. I believe that pressing the good old C-x C-s key combination is the best option. What do you think?

                              <span>Probably a silly question. I saw some Emacs gifs in sly’s README and found the font simple but comfortable. Would anyone using the same font mind sharing his/her setup?

                              <span>Hey there,
 I&#x27;ve tried LSP so many times and I&#x27;m too frustrated with how difficult and hard it is to configure. Trying to look at other people&#x27;s configs for this is a nightmare.
 I wanted to ask: Does anyone have an Emacs config that configured LSP or Eglot mode along with proper indentation that &#x27;just works&#x27; for the following modern web development frameworks and languages:
 React
 Vue
 Ruby On Rails
 JavaScript
 TypeScript
 Python
 HTML
 CSS

                              <span>Emacs comes with two built-in IRC clients, rcirc and erc. The latter has a history entry in its manual ((info &quot;(erc) History&quot;)) and thus sheds a little bit of light on its age:
  
7 History
  
ERC was originally written by Alexander L. Belikoff and Sergey Berezin. They stopped development around December 1999. Their last released version was ERC 2.0.
 ...
 2006
 ERC 5.1 was released. It was subsequently included in Emacs 22.
  
rcirc on the other hand is missing such an entry, but the copyright starts at 2006, roughly around the inclusion of ERC within Emacs. If you searche the Emacs manual for IRC, you end up with two mentions, one within Acknowledgments for ERC, one for &quot;Bug Reference&quot;:
  
3. Setup for IRC channels configurable by the variable ‘bug-reference-setup-from-irc-alist’. The built-in IRC clients Rcirc, and ERC, are supported.
  
Nowhere within Emacs do I find a comparison why there are two, and whether there are different use cases for both.
 With that in mind: what are the (architectural?) differences between ERC and rcirc? If ERC already existed, why was rcirc also included in Emacs?
 Thanks in advance!
