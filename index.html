                    <span>Non-technical Emacs newbie here trying to get a shell prompt in order to download some youtube vids.
 I&#x27;ve tried to write some functions but I cant find how to get prompted in order to paste the youtube url. 
 I&#x27;ve tried with a defalias function
 (defalias &#x27;you (lambda() (interactive)(shell-command &quot;/usr/bin/./yt-dlp -f18 -P~/Videos-Youtube-Downloads&quot;))) 
 And also with a defun function
 (defun youtube-download () &quot;download youtube video&quot; (interactive) (shell-command &quot;/usr/bin/./yt-dlp -f18 -P~/Videos-Youtube-Downloads&quot;))&#x60; 
 Both works but I do not get prompted to paste the youtube url. What am I missing in order to get prompted so I could paste the youtube url?
 Thanks in advance.
 New Edit: Working now. Thanks to @RadicalDownist / @ieure
 (defun youtube-download (Y-URL) &quot;Download Youtube Video&quot; (interactive &quot;sPaste YouTube URL: &quot;) (shell-command (format &quot;%s %s&quot; &quot;/usr/bin/./yt-dlp -f18 -P~/Videos-Youtube-Downloads&quot; Y-URL))) 
 If you do not want any shell output buffer. Replace shell-command line with:
 (call-process-shell-command (format &quot;%s %s&quot; &quot;/usr/bin/./yt-dlp -f18 -P~/Videos-Youtube-Downloads&quot; Y-URL nil 0)))

                    <span>Very recently I switched to native compilation branch of emacs (aka gccemacs). It works nice so far.
 Now a few questions arrived.
  
How to clean up eln-cache? I have multiple files of the same package, all the same size. Probably the older file is obsolete, can I identify obsolete files by its date? Is there already some available mechanism to use for deleting obsolete *.eln files?
 Example:
 -rwxr-xr-x 1 user user 628720 13. Nov 01:06 yasnippet-026a6aeb-f8d0d467.eln
 -rwxrwxr-x 1 user user 628720 12. Nov 20:11 yasnippet-4376b1db-f8d0d467.eln
 
Emacs is distributed with lot of lisp files, all those compiled *.eln files are kept at ~/.emacs.d/eln-cache/*/. The result is, every user on the system needs to compile those lisp files and every user allocates HDD|SSD memory for those lisp files. Is it possible to keep those *.eln files at a central location on the HDD|SSD (e.g with the emacs installation)? How to do that?

                    <span>Hello /r/emacs,
 recently I&#x27;ve been working a lot with tables (with text rather than numbers), and for the first time in years I came to the conclusion that Emacs is not the best tool for a task (especially one it could in principle be good at), and thus for now I&#x27;m doing my tables in Google Docs. 
 table.el is in principle suitable, but 
  
it is not snappy,
 having multiple lines per cell requires empty lines between them, otherwise they will be collapsed into a single line (since I need multiple lines per cell I can&#x27;t use the org-mode table editor)
 it has its own separate mode which doesn&#x27;t work well with org-mode (particularly I&#x27;m missing lists and org-ref links)
 it is easy to mess up the table structure by accidentally typing on the lines,
 it cannot temporarily hide rows or columns (a Google Sheets feature I didn&#x27;t expect to be so handy) and
 both navigating around and repositioning columns and rows is rather tedious.
  
Of course it is still a great piece of software, but I think it can be improved. I&#x27;ll start to tinker with it soon-ish, but my elisp knowledge isn&#x27;t the greatest, so I thought I&#x27;d ask here if anybody has ideas where to start. In particular, I have the hunch that child frames can be used to address the lack of snappiness, the empty lines issue and the lack of org-mode integration, but I haven&#x27;t used them much myself, so perhaps someone with more experience has thoughts about their appropriateness. Also if there are other ideas how to improve editing text tables I&#x27;d love to hear them.
 Cheers!

                    <span>Hi, I&#x27;m having a terrible time with haskell. I&#x27;m taking a class in college, office hours are offered but only when I&#x27;m working and i can&#x27;t make it in for help during them. I&#x27;m looking for someone available in the evenings 7 or later EST. The first topic I&#x27;m looking for guidance in would be parsing. 
 Thanks

                    <span>Hey there,
 currently I&#x27;m trying to learn Haskell but I am a person that depends heavily on exercises or practicing
 their newly acquired knowledge. I&#x27;m following learn you a Haskell and Real world Haskell but
 I&#x27;d like to get more experience and knowledge by doing exercises..
 Could someone point me in the right direction and to some exercises or old homeworks?
 Thanks in advance!

                    <span>Data.Vector.Unboxed essentially gives a Structure of Arrays representation - Vector (a,b) can be stored as (Vector a, Vector b). 
 This has some minor issues - deriving doesn&#x27;t really work, writing the typeclass by hand is really annoying, GHC cannot optimize away dead reads if you only use one field - but overall it&#x27;s a reasonably nice and composable abstraction.
 I&#x27;m currently playing with some code which accepts messages and must store them efficiently before they get batch-executed. To make this extensible I&#x27;d like some freer monads, more extensible effects style interface, composing the command enum like Either Op1 Op2.
 But my usecase could be seen as a mildly wonky Op-Based CRDT which means the operations commute and order doesn&#x27;t matter. It would be really nice if internally I could store everything as (MVector Op1, MVector Op2)behind the scenes.
 This lead me to a number of questions:
  
Is there an array-of-sums representation that stores Vector (Either Op1 Op2) as (Vector Op1, Vector Op2)?
 Is there a better way to derive unboxed vector boilerplate? I have seen https://hackage.haskell.org/package/vector-th-unbox-0.2.2/docs/Data-Vector-Unboxed-Deriving.html before but it feels like DerivingVia should be able to handle it if the monad was constrained to be representational
 Are there interface ideas to manipulate unboxed vectors structurally? Say, lift projection functions like Vector (a,b) -&gt; Vector a? In my case also things like pop one Op1 value, or take all Op2 values
 Is there an approach to structurally manipulate types in Haskell? Most code in Haskell only folds over the generic representation but e.g. StrictCheck has some tooling to add a functor at each level of a type, typescript has a bunch of tools for this like
  
 
type ExtractPII &#x3D; { [Property in keyof Type]: Type[Property] extends { pii: true } ? true : false; }; 
 If people have ideas to any of these points I&#x27;d really like to hear about them!

                    <span>Hello, I am working on two functions that filter values from a list of Cupcake type objects, and I am getting a &quot;Pattern match(es) are non-exhaustive&quot; error when running them, which causes any example I try on them to give me *** Exception: Assessed3.hs:(25,1)-(31,67): Non-exhaustive patterns in function priceRange.
 I really don&#x27;t see anything wrong:
 priceRange :: Price -&gt; Price -&gt; [Cupcake] -&gt; [Cupcake]
 priceRange minprice maxprice [] &#x3D; []
 priceRange minprice maxprice [CC p i] &#x3D; [CC p i | pricelower minprice p, pricelower p maxprice]
 where
 pricelower :: Price -&gt; Price -&gt; Bool
 pricelower (P x) (P y) 
 | x&lt;&#x3D;y &#x3D; True
 | otherwise &#x3D; False
 Assessed3.hs:25:1: warning: [-Wincomplete-patterns]
 Pattern match(es) are non-exhaustive
 In an equation for ‘priceRange’:
 Patterns not matched:
 (P _) (P _) ((CC (P _) []):_:_)
 (P _) (P _) ((CC (P _) (_:_)):_:_)
 |
 25 | priceRange minprice maxprice [] &#x3D; [] 
 For this it says I didn&#x27;t match the two cases in which the list inside is empty or non empty but I really don&#x27;t see how that will give me an error.

                    <span>Learn You a Haskell says, &quot;The most common use case with flip is calling it with just the function
 parameter and then passing the resulting function on to a map or a filter. &quot;
 I saw this: https://stackoverflow.com/q/14397128/9481613
 But what are some use cases?

                    <span>Hi,
 I just set up a new host with Xubuntu 20.04 LTS which comes with GNU Emacs 26.3 (build 2, x86_64-pc-linux-gnu, GTK+ Version 3.24.14) of 2020-03-26, modified by Debian.
 Of course, I&#x27;m reusing my config from here which worked on Emacs 28.0.50 (my previous host that died and had a snapshot release installed which I could not re-install) and which still works on Emacs 26.3 on another Xubuntu 20.04 LTS machine - the very same Emacs version.
 Therefore, I&#x27;m puzzled of this error message on startup:

                    <span>Hi,
I use the &quot;Saved Searches&quot; heavently, so the included Icons don&#x27;t tell me enough about the saved search. I&#x27;ve for example &quot;Saved Searches&quot; for Lisp and for Haskell programming.
The easiest way would be to use the language specific icons, so I&#x27;ve done this, but the Icons looks not so nice in the sidebar (I use the small icons), they are blurred. Is there is a Icon size, I could use, so the icons I create look as good as the built-in ones? :-)

Best regards
Michael</span>

                    <span>Hi all,
I find that I have these great ideas in my head but it becomes a challenge at times transferring those thoughts on paper.
The same issue  goes for taking notes. I often pose questions about the subject I am reading. But what are the “correct” questions I sometimes ask myself.
Can anyone recommend a book on the subject. 
I heard lots about Getting Things Done but wanted to know if others had other critics thinking methods.</span>

                    <span>Hey all,
 I have the following in my config
 (setq org-stuck-projects &#x27;(&quot;+project+LEVEL&#x3D;1&quot; (&quot;NEXT&quot; &quot;IN-PROGRESS&quot; &quot;WAITING&quot; &quot;DONE&quot; &quot;CANCELED&quot; &quot;DELEGATED&quot;) nil &quot;&quot;)) 
 And when I list stuck projects I get the correct output.
 The problem comes when I use the org-agenda-custom-commands like so:
 (setq org-agenda-prefix-format &#x27;((&quot;r&quot; &quot;Weekly Review&quot; ((agenda &quot;&quot; ((org-agenda-skip-function &#x27;(zin/org-agenda-skip-tag &quot;work&quot;)))) (tags-todo &quot;+tickler-DEADLINE&#x3D;{.+}-SCHEDULED&#x3D;{.+}&quot;) (stuck) ;; problem here (todo)) ((org-agenda-sorting-strategy &#x27;(priority-down)) (org-agenda-files &quot;~/.emacs.d/org/weekly-reivew-agenda-files.org&quot;)))) 
 Whenever I run this custom view, the list of stuck projects that is being produces is different than whats produces when I run the stuck projects command alone. I&#x27;ve tried passing the same list as I have above but doesn&#x27;t change anything. I&#x27;m not sure how to debug this :(
 ​
 Org mode version 9.4.4 (release_9.4.4 @ /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/Resources/lisp/org/)
 Any ideas/hints would be appreciated! :)

                    <span>Hi folks,
 Yesterday, I finished up putting my first custom keyboard together. It comes with a lot of extra keys, a couple of which are bound to &#x27;Hyper&#x27; by default. &#x27;Hyper&#x27; is a &#x27;modifier&#x27; provided by QMK (the firmware that powers this board) that maps to pressing &#x27;Control-Alt-Super-Shift&#x27; all together. Because there are no default mappings in the Hyper space, it seems like a good place to put some global Emacs shortcut keys that will absolutely-for-sure not ever get clobbered.
 While it would be easier to bind C-M-s- instead of H- and get more or less the same effect, I would like to be able to utilize C-x @ h (event-apply-hyper-modifier) as an option to &#x27;gracefully degrade&#x27; on computers where I don&#x27;t have my keyboard (for example: the Chromebook I occasionally play with Emacs on). That way those global binds can stay available and reasonably within reach. It doesn&#x27;t seem possible to chain C-x @ mod application functions together, but even if it were possible, chaining 4 of them together would get really old really quickly.
 I would prefer for this to get handled by Emacs instead of getting handled by the OS, just for that extra level of &#x27;don&#x27;t need to account for some random specific machine configuration&#x27;, but I&#x27;m open to suggestions on what to do there if no good options exist on the Emacs level. My main machine (the one the keyboard lives at) runs mostly Fedora Workstation, and sometimes Windows 10 Pro (though I almost never use Emacs in Windows).
 Thanks, all.

                    <span>I have been editing a lot of nginx conf recently, but I found that Emacs doesn&#x27;t auto indent for me in conf-mode.
 Is there a built-in setting to enable indentation in conf-mode? Or do I need to install an extra package to achieve this?

 Typically the files shown in Deft have the date/timestamp aligned to the right, but often times the date/timestamp end up moving a few spaces to the left for no particular reason.

                    <span>[SOLVED] Thank you all!
 I am attempting to create a custom theme using ThemeCreator, but this problem also appears for other custom themes that aren&#x27;t installed in bare Emacs, but come from the color-theme-modern package.
 For these themes, and the one I created and installed from a local file, the colors appear to be broken in my terminal (bash via GNOME terminal on Manjaro + GNOME). Using TERM&#x3D;&quot;xterm-256color&quot; changes nothing, and in fact using TERM&#x3D;&quot;xterm&quot; is slightly better (in the sense that it&#x27;s closer to the original theme).
 I suspect something fishy is happening though, as the real issues set in after I agree to run the Lisp from these themes. For example, let&#x27;s say I&#x27;m running wombat theme but want to switch to taylor. Everything looks fine (or what I consider fine) in wombat, I navigate up to taylor and hit enter, the colors change to something that looks nice but probably isn&#x27;t Taylor (maybe some previous selection that isn&#x27;t wombat), but then as soon as I allow the Lisp from Taylor to run, I get an absolutely horrible scheme that is almost unreadable.
 All appears well in GUI Emacs, but I am not interested in using that unfortunately.
 I have also tried other, more esoteric settings for the TERM variable, but to no avail. Any help would be greatly appreciated!

                    <span>Data.Functor.{Product,Compose,Sum} define instances of many type classes. While both the Deriving Via paper and the corresponding repository offer examples for letting newtypes derive via these functors, they all don&#x27;t compile with a current GHC. As many other features are showcased in the same examples, I haven&#x27;t managed to grasp what parts I need and where I need to make adjustments. A straightforward failed attempt at what I want to achieve would be:
 newtype MyPair a &#x3D; MyPair (a,a) deriving Applicative via (Data.Functor.Product (Identity a) (Identity a))
 I&#x27;d be glad if someone can help me out. I would also happily take code that only works on GHC 9.

                    <span>Hi there. A friend of mine wanted to publish a blog/site at both French and English. I told him about static generators and Hakyll from u/jaspervdj but the internationalization piece was missing. Of course there are other generators with internationalization but... Well here is one for Hakyll. * Generator source code * Use case and its source code --- If it already exists, ‏‏‎ please hide that fact from me. If not and if you enjoy it, please use it at will. There is a public docker image at registry.gitlab.com/swi18ng/swi18ng:latest for quick testing purpose if needs be (don&#x27;t forget to add -e LANG&#x3D;C.UTF8 if you use some special characters). And of course, don&#x27;t hesitate to give me some feedback. This would be greatly appreciated! &gt; P.

 When I filter by tag2, it displays the entries subtitle2 &amp; subtitle3, but won&#x27;t display the body text. 
 Is there anyway to display the body text along with the titles?

                    <span>I&#x27;ve finally come around to updating to org version 9.5. A change that I&#x27;m a fan of is the default for org-adapt-indentation is now nil since 9.5. However, my primary org file has been written with the hard indentation from org-adapt-indentation t. Is there an easy way to logically remove the preceding whitespace from this? I&#x27;ve tried using delete-whitespace-rectangle, but this doesn&#x27;t preserve the indentation of subsetted bullets.
 Is there any way to essentially shift the hard tabbed indentation to the left to remove the spaces but preserve the structure?

                    <span>Happy Saturday Fellow Scala People!
 Quick announcement that Indigo 0.10.0 is now available for all your FP Scala.js game building needs.
 This release features a completely re-written Clone system for when you just have to render thousands and thousands of things, and new variation on the theme called Mutants! It also contains many bug fixes, API improvements, and performance enhancements - it even works on Windows!
 Please note that this is the first Scala 3.1.0 version, so if you have an existing project you&#x27;ll need to upgrade!
 Full release notes: https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/indigo/releases/tag/v0.10.0
 The docs are - possibly for the first time! - up to date and are now fully checked by mdoc: https://indigoengine.io/docs/quickstart/setup-and-configuration
 We now have a Giter8 template! You could have a simple game up and running on your machine in 5 minutes - why not give it a shot? :-)
 To get started, try &#x60;g8 PurpleKingdomGames/indigo.g8&#x60; or &#x60;sbt new PurpleKingdomGames/indigo.g8&#x60; from your command line.

                    <span>How do you use org-roam for a Zettelkasten (ZK)?
I am interested in your init.el, in key-bindings, in capture-templates, tags (+filetags or others), categories (+category), other helping packages or other magic stuff I have never heard about. How is your org-roam specific ZK-workflow?
There is a lot of very good tutorial stuff out there about org-roam but not from experienced ZKlers. Even David Wilson (SystemCrafters, Emacs From Scratch) talks about that topic but do not dive into it very deep.</span>

                    <span>After using The Archive for some time,  there is one feature I couldn&#x27;t get used to it: the ESC shortcut for Reset Search. It happens quite often that while I&#x27;m writing a note I end up pressing ESC twice in a row (for example to cancel a search in the note, or the spelling box), and suddenly I lose the view of the note. While I can easily go back to the note, it still takes a bit of time to find the line I was at. Plus, there is an annoying break in the flow.
I was wondering if others had a similar experience and if they have a solution. Maybe redefining ESC with Keyboard Maestro, in such a way that one can still use this to cancel the other boxes (find, spelling etc.)? I find the role of ESC to Reset Search more intuitive in the Omnibar (when it&#x27;s active), rather than in the body of the note itself.</span>

                    <span>Hello! I&#x27;ve posted this to r/spacemacs as well, but I thought somebody here also experienced this problem.
 I&#x27;ve been experimenting with Org Agenda recently for my school schedule, birthdays and other TODOs. I saw on the Org layer site that it can have agenda notifications and I thought &quot;Great, I can have an useful agenda now that can remind me stuff!&quot;
 But I simply haven&#x27;t been able to get it working no matter what, this is what I have for my org layer in .spacemacs:
 (org :variables org-enable-github-support t org-enable-reveal-js-support t org-enable-org-journal-support t org-enable-hugo-support t org-enable-sticky-header t org-enable-valign t org-enable-notifications t org-start-notification-daemon-on-startup t) 
 Here&#x27;s my Spacemacs config, if it&#x27;s required. (also, I&#x27;m on the develop branch and it&#x27;s up to date with HEAD).
 Anyway, if I add this in my agenda:
 * TODO Go for a walk  * TODO Go shopping  
 I don&#x27;t receive any notifications for those 10 minutes prior. Is there something I&#x27;m missing? Is it something wrong with perhaps org-wild-notifier that seems to be the Org Agenda notifier thingie? Thanks for your time!

                    <span>There are a couple of simple ways to track the progress of your tasks in org-mode
 Simple todos:
 * TODO foo * DONE bar 
 Statistics cookies:
 * tasks [1/2] ** TODO foo ** DONE bar 
 But what if I want to track tasks like these:
 * Jump 20 times [13/20] * Read 3000 words [1340/3000] 
 It doesn&#x27;t make sense to break down this kind of tasks into subtasks, but I still need to track their progress in numbers.
 Ideally, I would also want org-mode to &quot;understand&quot; these numbers so that I can search/sort them out later.
 So, is there a good way to do this in org-mode?

                    <span>Just wanted to say that the new landing website is shaping up pretty nicely. I particularly like the Features page, which I wish I had when I started using Emacs. Org mode has so many features that sometimes I think newcomers get overwhelmed, and this page summarizes the most important ones and has plenty of links to good resources.
 I also use the Quickstart and the not yet complete Syntax pages when I want to remember some of aspect of the markup language.
 Thank you to the people putting in all the effort.

 I like to write in a light theme, but would prefer dark background for shell out of habit. Am using modus-themes.
 Is this something y&#x27;all have experimented with and see how it performs?

 is there any way to have it rank paths with exact substring matches higher than ones where all the letters are present but with tons of other things in between?

 While on the text/html line I am typing . o w3m RET I get the message displaying w3m /tmp/...done yet w3m doesn&#x27;t launch.
 If I use firefox instead of w3m the command sequence works fine.
 Am I missing a config setting somewhere? Or is the internal w3m confusing things?
 Thanks.

                    <span>i run emacs built locally from an up-to-date savannah clone - currently &quot;GNU Emacs 29.0.50 (build 1, x86_64-pc-linux-gnu, GTK+ Version 3.24.30, cairo version 1.17.4)&quot;. the OS is an up-to-date fedora 35 instance (KDE, not Gnome). 
 i&#x27;m using it to work with some scala 3 code courtesy of metals (0.10.9) and LSP. that&#x27;s because i can&#x27;t bring myself to invest time in vs code and because i&#x27;ve already set the record for intellij idea bug reports related to their scala plugin and scala 3:-). until recently, this setup worked well. 
 but during the last week, something strange started to happen. i use the tab bar in multiple windows. in one window with primarily text files, i was able to use the mouse to interact with the bar successfully (e.g. selecting a tab, closing a tab). but in a window dedicated to working with scala 3 code, use of the mouse with the tab bar began to fail.
 any attempt to interact via mouse button one triggered the error &quot;  is undefined&quot;. &quot;&quot;? &quot;describe-key&quot; only sees the &quot;&quot; event, no &quot;&quot;. if i switch from Scala mode to Fundamental mode, normal behavior returns (the mouse can select tabs, close tabs, etc). if i turn Scala mode back on, the failures return.
 i&#x27;m looking for suggestions about how to debug this. thoughts/comments?

                    <span>Yesterday I made a virtual machine with Debian 10 xfce and when I use emacs and hover over characters and it highlights it, it shows a different size. Idk how to better explain it but I can show exactly what happens:
 how it shows on small characters like &quot;;&quot; https://imgur.com/a/axr9Ot4
 how it shows on bigger characters like &quot;x&quot; https://imgur.com/a/S6pgAkl
 ​
 I really need to fix this cause i wanna work on this new machine instead of ubuntu. On ubuntu this issue is non existent.

                    <span>Over the past half year or so, I have really come to love Emacs and would like to contribute to this wonderful project. I sometimes do programming livestreams and typically use Emacs as my editor to try and introduce it to those who may not even be aware it exists. Since I am not much of a LISP developer, I feel like this is the best I can do to support the software and get more people using it; but I have found myself wondering how else I can contribute or introduce more people to Emacs. In my experience, once people realize how cool and versatile it is, they quickly become curious about its various functionalities. How can I help Emacs maintain its longevity?

                    <span>Hi guys,
 I&#x27;ve been iterating over my previous shot at a Big Sur style icon and I&#x27;ve produced a new version that I consider to be more polished and hopefully a bit less amateurish. The changes are:
 - The background is now vectorized and sports a slight shadow at the sides and bottom, this is based on a svg template for Big Sur icons. It should be easy to make the background circular or squircular for those of you that prefer so.
 - I further smoothed the curves by removing extra degrees of freedom.
 - The logo shadow is now blurry and less opaque.
 - There is a subtle radial gradient that spotlights the logo and turns darker near the edges.
 - The upper and lower halves of the logo are slightly more proportionate.
 I&#x27;ve learned the basics of Inkspace and, against my expectations, I actually enjoyed using it :)
 I&#x27;m sharing a png image and its svg source (not permalinks, sorry, I promise to keep them online for some weeks at least).
 - png: https://drive.google.com/file/d/14BDnwlGa17ds0CZI1kNBNghqt4TSqVEl/view?usp&#x3D;sharing
 - svg: https://drive.google.com/file/d/14L_roGCSD9dMnhL4Cq3w2_sfP4vvlk0_/view?usp&#x3D;sharing
 Hope you like it.

                    <span>I prefer isearch over evil-search as the evil-search-module but one thing that bothers me is that pressing escape during a search leaves the point at the current match instead of going to where the search was started.
 As a workaround, pressing Ctrl-g during the search instead of Escape imitates the vim behaviour which I like .
 Is it possible to make the Escape key send Ctrl-g just during evil/isearch?

 Haskell has separate namespaces for types and values. When types and data constructors share a name, Haddock, Haskell’s documentation generator, can get confused. In this post I show how to disambiguate types and values in Haddock documentation.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve looked around a bit and haven&#x27;t seen any examples of how you might differentiate different types of org link visually, perhaps with a font-lock; specifically differentiating the protocol (not the link content)
 For example, [[id:some-guid][Link Name]] would be a different color than [[file+emacs:file-path][My File]]. 
 Has anyone tried to do this before? 
 Just to clarify, the idea is not to apply different styles when publishing, but rather in-buffer. 
 (Bonus: how would you hook into a theme palette when specifying color?)

                    <span>Hi all.
 I&#x27;m learning spark, in an exercise I have used transform in spark sql query, it is this one:
 spark.sql(&quot;&quot;&quot;
 SELECT celsius,
 transform(celsius, t -&gt; ((t * 9) div 5) + 32) as fahrenheit
 FROM tC
 &quot;&quot;&quot;).show(false)
 I have defined the dataframe as follows:
 val t1 &#x3D; Array(35, 36, 32, 30, 40, 42, 38)
 val t2 &#x3D; Array(31, 32, 34, 55, 56)
 val tC &#x3D; Seq(t1, t2).toDF(&quot;celsius&quot;)
 tC.createOrReplaceTempView(&quot;tC&quot;)
 I am trying to do the same but without using spark sql, but I can&#x27;t do it. This is the code works in Databricks azure cluster,:
 tC.withColumn(
 &quot;fahrenheit&quot;,
 transform(col(&quot;celsius&quot;), f &#x3D;&gt; ((f * 9) / 5) + 32)
 ).show(false)
 In IntelliJ IDEA does not work. The errors are:
 - Cannot resolve symbol *
 - Cannot resolve symbol /
 - Cannot resolve symbol +
 Thanks for your help

                    <span>I have been working with Scala (Functional) and Clojure for the last ~ 4 years but I still can&#x27;t give a proper brief answer whenever someone asks me &quot;Hey, what is FP and why should I use it?&quot; 
 I generally start with concepts like immutability, local reasoning, referential transparency, functions as first class citizens, currying etc. But I soon find myself going all over the place. For example, I find myself giving unconvincing arguments when someone asks me &quot;what practical benefit does referential transparency actually provide to the developer?&quot;
 There are arguments like imperative programming depends on the order of execution of statements, while FP is declarative. But FP also depends on the order of execution (you insert into database and then read, you can&#x27;t do vice-versa). Sure, you can say that &quot;ordering&quot; that we are talking about here is in the context of mutating global state. There isn&#x27;t any global state in FP. But at the core of it ordering does matter right?
 Then there is the argument that immutability allows use of different cores in parallel. But I have never seen this happening in any business application, i.e, immutability used to parallelize processing. Sure, making a value immutable makes it thread safe (since no one can change it). But most real life scenarios require mutability. So we model them as Atomic, Ref etc and make them thread safe. But these things exist in imperative languages as well. So, what exactly is the connection between immutability and parallel processing &amp; thread safety.?
 Then we have the lazy evaluation of IO which provides referential transparency. I have used IO and I love it. But I can&#x27;t seem to find practical/objective points as to what benefits it provides. So when I say that all my DB operations and external API calls are an IO, I again find myself giving unconvincing answers about their benefits.

                    <span>Occasionally, I would like to find posts that I made on this forum, in response to a &quot;discussion&quot; started by someone else.  I find this difficult to do.  I can find discussions that I started easily, but not ones to which I only contributed.
I have tried using the &quot;search forum&quot; capability, but it is not helpful unless I can remember something specific and unique about the discussion and what I posted.  And in any case, it feeds the request into my default search engine (Google or Duck Duck Go, or whatever), which somehow diffuses the search.
Sometimes looking at the &quot;mentions&quot; will help, if someone commented on your post, but not that often and you still have to wade through a lot of not relevant material.
Am I missing something?  Is there some way to see my past posts (on someone else&#x27;s discussion)?</span>

                    <span>Is there any way to configure Org-roam or a similar wiki plugin to have separate libraries per project?
 I&#x27;m using Org as a scrivener replacement and I want to keep my novel wikis separate from one another and accessible in the tree view, but Roam seems to be a one-per-system kind of thing, unless I&#x27;m missing something in the settings.

                    <span>Hello, I do use that https://github.com/zonuexe/right-click-context/blob/c3c9d36ffbc9fb2bc7c2c4b75291dbcdb1c5f531/README.org
 from melpa stable. I kindly ask how do I :
 1) get the example working 
 ;;RIGHT CLICK MOUSE MENU (right-click-context-mode 1) (require &#x27;datetime-format nil t) (let ((right-click-context-local-menu-tree (append right-click-context-global-menu-tree &#x27;((&quot;Insert&quot; (&quot;FooBar&quot;getPosition :call (insert &quot;FooBar&quot;)) (&quot;Current Time&quot; :call (insert (datetime-format &#x27;atom)) :if (fboundp &#x27;datetime-format))))))) (right-click-context-menu)) 
 I get aforementioned menu in scratch buffer on start ... but when emacs fully loads the menu it is the default one
 2) make the menu contain:
  
xref-find-references for text which is marked in region
 xref-find-definitions for text which is marked in region
 ack for text which is marked in region

                    <span>When I use org-roam, I often want to insert a link to another org-roam node, but I find the completions seem little janky when using the brackets [[]]. Is it somehow possible to insert a link by finding it using an interface similar to org-roam-node-find?

 I have a modified version of Spacemacs. I used to run an emacs from scratch version now I use Spacemacs and like it... I always run from gui
 Target Goal: make the background transparent in emacs
 Stretch Goal: Ideally I could use the scroll+hotkey or some other key combination to adust.
 ​
 Thanks!!!

                    <span>My font setup looks as belows.
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;elisp
 (set-face-attribute &#x27;default nil
 :family &quot;FiraCode Nerd Font&quot;
 :height 130
 :weight &#x27;regular
 :width &#x27;normal)
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 But FiraCode does not support italic, so currently my emacs can&#x27;t display italic.
 I found another font that supports italic and matches FiraCode font: Dejavu Sans Mono
 Now I want to mix both fonts. Main font must be FiraCode and I hope only italic letters are displayed by Dejavu Sans Mono.
 Is it possible for emacs to do this? I hope so and I am expecting it can do that. How can I write proper configuration to achieve that?

                    <span>Hello! I am a new user of emacs, and really exploring the configuration options around. But I just found some very annoying aspects that are driving me crazy.
 First:
 How on earth can I just use tabs in a sane way?
 In VSCode I found tabs pretty smart. Press the key once, and it dropped you on the correct indentation level for the line, press it more times and it inserted spaces to your liking. In emacs apparently the default behavior stops at the first part, but for example, in PHP I&#x27;m writing a SQL string and to avoid wraping I press enter, but then it goes to the beginning of the line and if I press tab it just won&#x27;t work because it thinks it is still at the correct level of indentation. and to correct the string I have to press space for doing so. I have no idea how to search for this in google, and the few posts I found give no solution whatsoever, and some say &quot;just get used to it&quot;.
 Second:
 Are modes always &quot;wonky&quot;? For example, I am writing PHP at the moment, and web mode is pretty deficient for it, inserting a &quot;&gt;&quot; character when I write &quot;&lt;&quot; in a comparison because it thinks I&#x27;m writing an html tag. For that I installed PHP-mode, and now... formatting the file is impossible because it says that clang-formatter is not found. For web mode I installed Apheleia, and it works fine, but now I can&#x27;t use it with PHP-mode. So how can I configure it so it works?
 And when I was just using web-mode, it suddenly, and apparently at random, just go back to fundamental mode. And had to enable web-mode manually several times. This is what made me install PHP-mode in the first place.
 I hope someone has an idea of how to fix this stuff, or at least point me in the right direction. Thanks in advance!

                    <span>Hi, i just tried to update one of my projects to support GHC 9.2.That specific project uses some GHC-internal API and depends on the ghc package
 However, version 9.2.1 of that package seems to have a dependency that has been included to deliberately make it impossible to build (depends on unbuildable (&gt;1 &amp;&amp; &lt;1)).
 Is there an ETA when a working version will arrive on Hackage or some kind of workaround for this issue? I could not find anything on the GHC issue tracker.

                    <span>I have a project with ~200 hundred files and I wanted to move all of them one level deeper, so that all of my modules become prefixed with the name of the project. This results in me needing to rename all the module names, all the imports of those modules, and then also qualified calls in the code.
 Compiler guides me through that but it is a lot of manual work so I wrote a small script that does most of the work for me - it updated module names to reflect their paths and also corrects old imports to use the new name (it doesn&#x27;t take care of qualified calls though).
 Script is pretty naive, in the sense that it uses just regexes and therefore risks false positives, but it actually worked very well for my use case, I had only 2 false positives which I easily fixed. I still needed to do manual work to find those false positives and I needed to correct qualified calls, but it still felt like much less work than without using the script.
 Script: https://github.com/wasp-lang/misc/blob/master/hs-fix-modules.hs .
 How would you go about this problem, what do you do / use? I tried looking for existing solutions, including retrie, but it didn&#x27;t seem anything out there supports this kind of refactoring.
 If I wanted to make a proper solution that parses the code and looks at AST in order to figure out what needs to be updated -&gt; how would I go about that, where would I start, and is that feasible?

                    <span>I am writing some bit level functions for Word128 data type in Haskell, and one function involves extracting n bits from the t-th least significant bit in a word x. I also intend to write a function that will essentially be a reverse of this above function of extraction (a function that basically restores the extracted bits). I have designed a C pseudo code for the extraction function, and this what I have written so far for the extraction function in Haskell-
 In C :
 extractBits (unsigned int x, int t, int n) mask &#x3D; ((1 Integer -&gt; Integer -&gt; Word128 extractBits x t n &#x3D; x .&amp;. (shiftL ((shiftL 1 n) -1) t)
 The above code seems to be fine type wise. However, a suggested solution that we have for this function is as follows -
 extractBits x t n &#x3D; shiftL ( x .&amp;. (shiftL 1 n-1)) t
 Not quite sure however I think the function above does not seem to be logically the same as my implementation? They are giving different results for some values. Does it have something to do with how overflow is handled by each if these functions? 
 Additionally, I am having trouble thinking about the reverse of this function and how it can be implemented. Any suggestions if possible would be much appreciated. Thank you.

                    <span>Hey guys, 
 I am currently working through the LYAH book and on the bottom of this page it goes into creating a Monad by example. So far, so good... 
 The only thing I can&#x27;t get my head around at all is the final function:
 import Data.List (all) flipThree :: Prob Bool flipThree &#x3D; do a &lt;- coin b &lt;- coin c &lt;- loadedCoin return (all (&#x3D;&#x3D;Tails) [a,b,c]) 
 In my head a &lt;- coin results in a being: [(Heads,1%2),(Tails,1%2)]
 same for b, and for c it results in [(Heads,1%10),(Tails,9%10)] 
 Now.. why does (all (&#x3D;&#x3D;Tails) [a,b,c]) work?
 When I am loading it up in ghci and trying
 all (&#x3D;&#x3D;Tails) [[(Heads,1%2),(Tails,1%2)],[(Heads,1%2),(Tails,1%2)],[(Heads,1%10),(Tails,9%10)] ]
 results in (as expected) countless errors.

                    <span>The red book talks a lot about Laws, but I don&#x27;t understand the concept and why it&#x27;s useful. For example in the chapter 9 about Parser, it says that that map is structure preserving and one can stipulate that law the following way: map(p)(a &#x3D;&gt; a) &#x3D;&#x3D; p
 What does this actually mean and why is it useful? 
 Then they go on to make their laws executable by using a library:
 import fpinscala.testing._ trait Parsers[ParseError, Parser[+_]] ... object Laws { def equal[A](p1: Parser[A], p2: Parser[A])(in: Gen[String]): Prop &#x3D; forAll(in)(s &#x3D;&gt; run(p1)(s)&#x3D;&#x3D; run(p2)(s)) def mapLaw[A](p: Parser[A])(in: Gen[String]): Prop &#x3D; equal(p, p.map(a &#x3D;&gt; a))(in) } } 
 How is this different from testing? What is actually happening?

                    <span>macOS Monterey comes with Shortcuts -- the same facility you may already know from iOS to create automation workflows. Even pretty complex ones, including uploading files via ssh to a server. Didn&#x27;t expect it to be that powerful!
If you have or stumble upon a cool shortcut for Zettelkasten work, please do share!
Here&#x27;s an ages old iOS Shortcut that works on macOS Monterey as well. The classic. Generate Zettel ID 
https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/efb23d9a1e0b463c9d951913ffb913d8
Nesting/Using Shortcuts
The cool thing is you can use this Shortcut as a dependency of more complex workflows.

They can even be nested and include branching logic etc., it&#x27;s pretty wild, but also beyond what I&#x27;ve done so far.</span>

                    <span>Found this very interesting bit:

  
Linked information systems
In providing a system for manipulating this sort of information, the hope would be to allow a pool of information to develop which could grow and evolve with the organisation and the projects it describes. For this to be possible, the method of storage must not place its own restraints on the information. This is why a &quot;web&quot; of notes with links (like references) between them is far more useful than a fixed hierarchical system. When describing a complex system, many people resort to diagrams with circles and arrows. Circles and arrows leave one free to describe the interrelationships between things in a way that tables, for example, do not. The system we need is like a diagram of circles and arrows, where circles and arrows can stand for anything.


From Tim Berners-Lee&#x27;s original proposal for the worldwide web. Emphasis mine.
It is quite fascinating how this fact seems to be rediscovered again and again.</span>

                    <span>Hej fellow &#x27;macsers,
 TL;DR: wanna compile a number of lists (tracklists to show friends, one list per year), maybe in a kind of database. I want duplicates to be detected. Ideally, I want the ability to export to a nice-looking format. Package tips, programming suggestions, everything welcome. Thanks :)
 I have a somewhat unconventional taste of music - at least when compared to my friends. I rarely play music I enjoy personally other than some beat tapes which are simply lit when hangin&#x27; out together.
 Now, I have been asked by one friend of mine to compile a list of music that I have enjoyed throughought the year. Since I actually enjoy sharing/discussing music, I agreed. So I compiled a list of songs - free form, no format etc. 
 However, I&#x27;ve been wondering: I might be doing this every year from now on. First off, it was a bit tedious to do the freeform entry. Secondly, and more important, I don&#x27;t want to manually search for duplicates when compiling my 2022 list. Finally, it would be nice if I could have this list (or a subset of such a list) exported either in a nice-looking pdf or in some other conventient form. 
 Then, I thought to myself: well, since you can do practically everything with emacs, why shouldn&#x27;t it be able to help me out this time?
 Thus, I&#x27;d love to hear your thoughts on the matter. It might be some kind of database thingy that is able (programmably) to detect duplicates. It might be a program that does EXACTLY what I want. It might be a hint on how to do autonumbering on an unformatted file. It might be a tip on how to automate the &quot;finding duplicates&quot; process. Anything, really :)
 Thanks a bunch, have a good day, fellows! :)

                    <span>In clojure, I want to hide my debug forms in that way:
 Instead of
 (postmortem.core/spy :debug :emacs-reddit)
 I want to just display:
 :emacs-reddit, possibly with some custom text properties, like underlining.
 I&#x27;m guessing it should be possible with overlays, but I don&#x27;t know how to make them automatic so that when some text matches a regex, the overlay gets created automatically.

                    <span>I am a doom Emacs user. I tried using the consult-org-agenda command to go to and change the TODO org document but Hitting RET on the titles will not change (TODO to DONE) or (check the checkboxes) . To confirm that it related to Consult-org-agenda i used the usual org-agenda to go to the todo list and it worked fine there and after using org-agenda the consult-org-agenda also worked fine after i ran the org-agenda command to go to the todo list
 I am using emacs 27.2 and running the doom version 21.12.0-alpha
 After running consult-org-agenda buffer
 I am pressing RET on the titles but they are not changing
 After running org-agenda
 and as soon as i mark with org-agenda it works just fine
 then running consult-org-agenda
 and now here also it seems to work in this instance of emacs but as soon as this instance of emacs is closed i have to again open org-agenda to make consult-org-agenda to work
 This is the pastebin link to my config

                    <span>Recently, I have compiled the latest Emacs on Ubuntu to update from version 26 and get the native compilation working. Aside from a few hiccups, it went well. 
 However, when I began using it, I discovered that the Projectile is not aware of any of my projects. In particular, whenever I try to switch to a project, it says that that directory is not a project. In the past, it would show me an array of projects in curly brackets in minibuffer that I could arrow through and choose.
 Here is what I have in the &#x60;.emacs&#x60; file related to Magit and Projectile:
 (global-set-key (kbd &quot;C-x g&quot;) &#x27;magit-status)
 (put &#x27;upcase-region &#x27;disabled nil)
 (require &#x27;projectile)
 (define-key projectile-mode-map (kbd &quot;s-p&quot;) &#x27;projectile-command-map)
 (define-key projectile-mode-map (kbd &quot;C-c p&quot;) &#x27;projectile-command-map)
 (setq projectile-project-search-path &#x27;( &quot;~/sites/&quot; &quot;~/Projects/&quot;))
 (projectile-mode +1)
 (setq projectile-switch-project-action &#x27;projectile-vc)
 (eval-after-load &quot;projectile&quot; 
 &#x27;(progn (setq magit-repo-dirs (mapcar (lambda (dir)
 (substring dir 0 -1))
 (seq-filter (lambda (project)
 (file-directory-p (concat project&quot;/.git/&quot;))) 
 (projectile-relevant-known-projects))))
  &#x60;(setq magit-repo-dirs-depth 1)))&#x60; 
 ​
 There are do not appear to be any errors or warnings in the Messages or Warnings buffer. Any help on this is appreciated.

The whole thing is basically just a utilization of (goto-line) with a list of already defined lines that you can choose from.

                    <span>In the middle of function #1 I&#x27;m writing, I&#x27;d like to enter the minibuffer and run function #2 after the minibuffer has been entered, before function #1 has exited. I understand that trying to do the opposite (i.e., running a function in the middle of another function after exiting the minibuffer) can be tricky, as explained here, but I&#x27;m not sure if abo-abo&#x27;s solution can be adapted to my case.
 I&#x27;d like to avoid using the minibuffer-setup-hook for simplicity&#x27;s sake. The simple functionality I&#x27;m after is inserting the text at point as the first minibuffer text for the yas-insert-snippet command, but I can foresee needing similar functionality in more complex circumstances. Any help would be appreciated!

                    <span>I&#x27;m not a native English speaker and often make some stupid grammar mistakes. I find that Grammarly is pretty useful to catch those errors. However, Grammarly is only officially supported on websites. VSCode has an unofficial Grammarly extension, I&#x27;ve tried it and it works pretty well. Is there a similar Grammarly package on Emacs?

                    <span>I have a function as follows :
 data UnaryOp &#x3D; Move | Negate | Complement | Not deriving (Eq, Show, Generic)
 instance Arbitrary UnaryOp where

 encodeUnaryOp Move &#x3D; 0
 encodeUnaryOp Negate &#x3D; 1
 encodeUnaryOp Complement &#x3D; 2

 I am supposed to code a function, decodeUnaryOp, which has the following type signature and is supposed to be the exact reverse of the encodeUnaryOp function -
 decodeUnaryOp :: Word32 -&gt; Maybe UnaryOp
 And so far, I have framed my solution (the code for decodeUnaryOp) as follows :
 decodeUnaryOp w &#x3D; do
 0 &lt;- Move
 1 &lt;- Negate
 2 &lt;- Complement

 .......
 In place of the .... I intend to write something which will convert the UnaryOp to a Maybe type, however I am not sure how to proceed with this? Other than that, I think my code seems to be correct.
 Can someone kindly let me know to turn the result into a Maybe type? Additionally, if the code I have written so far correct functionally? Thank you.

                    <span>Hi guys!
 I&#x27;m in the middle of a project in which I need to do some kind of upsert to a nested map structure (3 levels deep), creating all the intermediate keys if they don&#x27;t exist and just retrieving them and continue going down if they do. The structure would be something similar to this:
 haskell data NestedMap &#x3D; M.Map Key1 (M.Map Key2 (M.Map Key3 [Item])) 
 You can assume Key* and Item are simple Strings.
 I wanted to try using Lens to do it, but I&#x27;m having trouble understanding some concepts. For example, I have seen that to manipulate map-like structures in this way at should be used, as well as non to provide the keys when missing and continue operating. However, when looking at the docs for non I have found this:
  &gt;&gt;&gt; Map.fromList [(&quot;hello&quot;, 1)] &amp; at &quot;hello&quot; . non 0 +~ 2 fromList [(&quot;hello&quot;,3)] &gt;&gt;&gt; Map.fromList [(&quot;hello&quot;, 1)] &amp; at &quot;hello&quot; . non 0 -~ 1 fromList [] 
 I don&#x27;t understand the second result at all. Shouldn&#x27;t the result be something like fromList [(&quot;hello&quot;, 0)]? Why it&#x27;s not the case?
 To be honest I&#x27;m also having trouble trying to think on how could I chain all the ^.s, ats, nons and ?~s into an expression to finally add a [Item] at the bottom of the nested map, but as I&#x27;m not understanding the non function I&#x27;ll need to go step by step.
 Could someone please help me understand this better? Thanks!

                    <span>This message might seem like it is about the romance of Haskell and Category Theory. But it is really about what kind of conversations we can or cannot have.
 A prequel.
 I once wondered whether Functional Programming is actually as good as I think. The default way I deal with questions is to ask the Internet. So, I formulated the question and put it into 2 communities.
  
In /r/AskProgramming, it has been received very well. All of the commenters engaged with the actual question.
 
In /r/functionalprogramming, it has not been received so well. Many commenters declined to engage with the question. People in comments told me that my formulation of the question is unacceptable and said bad things about my comments as well. Eventually a moderator stepped in and locked the conversation.

                    <span>It&#x27;s fairly easy to install Haskell, I followed this exactly:
 https://preview.redd.it/h0gesvexvpy71.png?width&#x3D;1704&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;fb888ea11ef30866b8efe2cbf235771fba126a2d
 I opened Terminal, typed curl --proto &#x27;&#x3D;https&#x27; --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://get-ghcup.haskell.org | sh, and hit enter.
 But for uninstalling Haskell on Mac, I can&#x27;t find anything? Specifically for OS X 10.15.7.

 Now I am left wondering: how do I uninstall Haskell?

                    <span>Hello,
 I posted my question in stack-overflow here, but I thought I might get a quicker response if I post it here as well. There was a question before on just auto-complete for python, but I am also looking for something that does syntax-filling automatically as well. I thought emacs-jedi (for python) was something close, but not fully what I was looking for. Any suggestions for just python or just tcl or both (preferably) is highly appreciated.
 Apologise if anyone feels I am repeating questions already asked.

                    <span>There are a couple of things that come to mind as a prelude to this issue:
  
switched to ZSH and Oh-My-ZSH a couple of days ago. 
 built Emacs 29 (latest from source) today on Ubuntu 20.04.
  
After installing the newly built Emacs, I noticed that the icon in the Ubuntu Dock didn&#x27;t seem to work. I removed the icon. I then went into Applications and launched an instance of Emacs. It worked. I added it to the favorites in the dock. I closed the instance. I then went to click the icon again. It opened a weird Emacsclient instance, which didn&#x27;t split the frame into three windows like it always does at startup (I have this written in .emacs).
 To summarize, whenever I launch from the applications, I can start a &quot;normal&quot; Emacs version. As soon as I add its icon to the dock, the icon begins launching Emacs(client) version.
 In the applications, I have three icons: Emacs, Emacs(client), Emacs(Terminal).
 Any help on figuring out what is going on is appreciated. For one, I would love to learn what this client thing is as I have never seen nor used it. It would also be great to get to the usual behavior of just getting good old Emacs after clicking the icon in the dock. If there is reason to this client madness and it can be beneficial in this case, I am all ears.

                    <span>We need a way(mode, keybinding) to send the keybinding we press, to the application opened in that buffer. 
 I tried exwm-input-release-keyboard and it has always worked flawlessly. I can open firefox, then use exwm-input-release-keyboard and then continue using firefox keybindings like C-c to copy, C-v to paste etc.
 But surprisingly, this did not work when I opened a file with nano inside vterm buffer. Any idea on how to address this issue?

 I use the modus-operandi theme but I would like to change how the magit diff seems ...
 If you check the active region it is gray background but the lines with differencies are with gray background as well. I think the inactive region is more readable ... 
 How can I set it up to hold the red and green background for the lines where the changing have ?
 I tried to change the magit-diff-highlight-s because this layer is graying it but ...
 Here is my screenshot to see it

The issue is the first frame that the is created by the client does not show the battery icon in the doom modeline as well as the custom banner for the dashboard that is set in the config is not shown but if i open a second frame it will fix all the issue with both the frames icons and banner.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve recently started with JavaScript.
 Indium is suggested everywhere as the standard development environment for JavaScript, so I&#x27;ve used it with some success. It works beautifully for Chrome, with evaluation of code, inspection, REPL, etc. but only up to a point.
  
When it comes to Node, I&#x27;ve no success. I can start the node server but I cannot connect to it. I&#x27;m not sure it starts the node server correctly; in the documentation it says that you can start the node server manually and then connect to it, but the code says otherwise (it always asks if you want to close the previous connection, doing nothing if you chose &#x60;no&#x60;, starting a new server if you choose &#x60;yes&#x60;)
 Evaluating TypeScript code leads to errors, even though the documentation and the discussions that I&#x27;ve seen lead to the impression that evaluating TypeScript should be no different than evaluating JavaScript code.
 Async functions cannot be evaluated with &#x60;indium-eval-last-node&#x60; since it only evaluates the code after the &#x60;function&#x60; token, ignoring the &#x60;async&#x60; token, which leads to the error that &#x60;await&#x60; cannot be used in non-async functions.
 The Indium setup documentation references functions that are no longer available, like &#x60;M-x indium-connect-to-nodejs&#x60;
 the last commit is from March 2021 and there are still open issues from 2017 and no responses from the developer
  
Developing such a huge and nice package is surely overwhelming. I (and maybe others) would just like to know if we should bother with it, that&#x27;s all. There might also be some people who would like to take it over, who knows. Does anyone have any info regarding this?

                    <span>Is it possible to start a section on the new page. I have a section(2) at the end of the page and the images in that section move to the next page and the next section(3) starts right at the end of section 2 before the images. I have tried using the [htb!] but that jumbles up the images of the entire document. I am exporting to latex.
 Expected:
 Section 2 -&gt; images -&gt; Section 3
 Current Output:
 Section 2 -&gt; Section 3 heading -&gt; Section 2 images -&gt; Section 3 images

                    <span>I&#x27;m currently trying to get a webbrowser to work in emacs under Windows. Not really as a Firefox replacement, but more for having documentation or single sites displayed.
 From my research it looks like EAF is the best option for that. From their docs it seems like they support Windows. I did the full install as the Readme advises and everything seems to be working fine. At least the &quot;demo&quot; application runs as expected.
 With eaf-browser i&#x27;m at a dead-end though. All i get is an empty buffer and a Message &quot;Process *eaf* exited abnormally with code 9&quot;. No further Information what failed. All dependencies are installed, update runs through fine.
 Has anyone gotten this to work under Windows?
 My current config for eaf looks like this:
  (use-package eaf :load-path &quot;~/.emacs.d/site-lisp/emacs-application-framework/&quot; :custom (eaf-browser-continue-where-left-off t) (eaf-browser-enable-adblocker t) (browse-url-browser-function &#x27;eaf-open-browser) :config (require &#x27;eaf-browser) (require &#x27;eaf-pdf-viewer) (require &#x27;eaf-demo) (eaf-bind-key nil &quot;M-q&quot; eaf-browser-keybinding)) 
 Any help on this would be appreciated.

                    <span>I’ve been an emacs user for years now and have yet to find a jsx/tsx setup that works perfectly (indentation, AC, etc). If anyone has a configuration they think works perfect, please post it. If not, I’ve been learning elisp for some time, but am at the point where I need to build something. Is anyone with experience (preferably also interested in having such a major mode) willing to help me make something like this? React is so popular and really needs solid emacs support
 With tree-sitter and lsp, I’m guessing it shouldn’t be that hard? Assuming the hardest part will be getting the indentations right

                    <span>I&#x27;m currently in the middle of finishing my thesis project and I need some small games that have been in developed in Haskell. The subject is automating texture management through using statically analyzable code to implement the games and then analyze certain functions for the textures they use.
 The reason I need source code for games written in Haskell is to be able to compare metrics from a game without my added structures and typeclasses vs with my typeclasses. I would change the way the game is written using my classes and see what the impact is on performance, compile size/time, memory usage. 
 I will cite all the games used and their developers of course. I&#x27;ve found some github repositories here and there of finished games, but wanted to see if any of you know of some good resources.

I like Haskell. In my experience, it is at once the strongest and the most approachable programming language in the world. Haskell is the answer to the problems raised by John Backus and Edsger Dijkstra. It also has a community that I am honoured to be among. So, whenever I see a problem that can be solved by a computation, I want to have a solution in Haskell because I expect it to naturally turn out better than an alternative.
 Actually I even expect that a program written in a language without algebraic types, parametric polymorphosis and lawful type classes will exhibit stupid, e…</span>

                    <span>We are pleased to announce the release of Copilot 3.6, a stream-based DSL for writing and monitoring embedded C programs, with an emphasis on correctness and hard realtime requirements. Copilot is typically used as a high-level runtime verification framework, and supports temporal logic (LTL, PTLTL and MTL), clocks and voting algorithms.
 Among others, Copilot has been used at the Safety Critical Avionics Systems Branch of NASA Langley Research Center for monitoring test flights of drones.
 This new release supports three new operators: atan2, floor, and ceiling. Additionally, the target directory of the code generated by Copilot can now be customized. Release 3.6 also includes a battery of unit tests for the library copilot-core. This release introduces other fixes in the code and in the documentation, and deprecates definitions that have been superseded or that were largely unused.
 Current emphasis is on facilitating the use with other systems, and improving the codebase in terms of stability and test coverage. Users are encouraged to participate by opening issues and asking questions via our github repo.

                    <span>I have a problem to solve which I&#x27;m almost sure has been encountered by people before (so expecting there to be reasonable library for that), but I don&#x27;t know what exactly to search for. - I&#x27;d like to run potentially long-running actions triggered by some user HTTP requests in a web app - These actions have to run on the server receiving that request. Imagine something like initializing user-scoped sqlite file in the filesystem where the haskell web server binary is running (so no external &quot;job runner&quot; service) - The actions should run in separate thread (async?) - For any user, there should be at most 1 parallel copy of that action running at any given time (i.e. if user triggers 2nd copy of that action while the first is still running, the 2nd action should be skipped)
 My idea about solution so far includes: - some data structure (?) for managing bunch of locks, addressed by integers (user ids) - ensure locks are released both when the async action fails or succeeds
 Here&#x27;s a dirty prototype (most likely not bug free) demonstrating what I&#x27;d like to achieve https://gist.github.com/jhrcek/5123bc0ad42522dff837be5580e9766e
 Is anyone aware of some libraries that would make this kind of thing possible?

                    <span>My new goal this year is to learn a new programming language and do at least one project with it. My current (uneducated) choice is between Haskell and C. 
 I’ve written down bullet points to help organize my thoughts, and I was wondering if anyone could share their thoughts on what to learn first and correct me if any of my thoughts are biased. I would really appreciate it!
 Here’s a little context for me first:
  
On a gap year before entering college as freshman next year
 Have done Java as part of intro to CS class + Python for majority of projects (overall ~3 yrs of coding experience)
 Interested in pursuing Machine Learning / ML Systems
  
My short term goal:
  
Push outside my comfort zone and gain a deeper understanding/practices in programming
 Prepare myself for rigorous CS curriculums I’ll soon face
 Hopefully, gain a small advantage in resume screenings when I apply for DevOps/MLOps internships after sophomore year.
  
Why Haskell?
  
The idea of Functional Programming itself interests me, and many have said it’s a great way to push outside the comfort zone and understand more deeply about ‘programming’
 I’ve heard many companies use Haskell for their “low-latency, high-volume database access”
 Project Ideas: Map-reduce?
  
Why C? (Or maybe C++)
  
Learning C will expose me to more fundamental inner workings of computer systems.
 As I am interested in ML Systems, I’ve heard “writing highly performant/error-proof systems-level code” is an essential skill to have/practice
 Project Ideas: Database, Distributed File System

                    <span>Steep learning curve is no problem. I’m learning for the long term, to build production ready stuff.
 I’m also planning on learning reflex and tailwindcss unless there is a better alternative.

                    <span>Is it possible to start a section on the new page. I have a section(2) at the end of the page and the images in that section move to the next page and the next section(3) starts right at the end of section 2 before the images. I have tried using the [htb!] but that jumbles up the images of the entire document. I am exporting to latex.
 Expected:
 Section 2 -&gt; images -&gt; Section 3
 Current Output:
 Section 2 -&gt; Section 3 heading -&gt; Section 2 images -&gt; Section 3 images

                    <span>Hi,
 Is it possible (in other words is there a Melpa package I guess) that lets me specify scheduled tasks with a duration:
  * TODO ... SCHEDULED:  
 rather than 
  * TODO ... SCHEDULED:  
 Note that in the first sample I specify 15:00hr + 1 hour rather than second example where I have to calculate the end time myself.

                    <span>I have the following codeblock:
  Let time &#x3D; if runFn1 isDone unit then do Case instant (runFn1 offsetTime (uninstant t)) of Just x -&gt; x Nothing -&gt; t 
 .......
 If I remove the Case it gets angry because of an unhandled maybe but with the case I am getting the following error:
 Unknown data constructor Just.
 What did I do wrong. Why does a Maybe Instant not have a Just?
 EDIT: solved on the purescript discourse. Needed to import Maybe(..) instead of just Maybe

 I noticed the default magit fetch menu does not have the force option. I wonder if it is hidden in the advanced menu mode. But I forget how to open that advanced menu mode...
 Could someone remind me?

 Could you give me a little help how I can get the exception ?

                    <span>I am a new user to Doom Emacs and been wanting to make these two changes to the doom mode line but i am unsure of how to do that:
  
Make the modes (like normal , insert , emacs , visual) written in text in the mode line rather than the color of the dot represent it. (Similar to this https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/140797/49694189-6913d480-fbc0-11e8-93ae-9578455dcd2c.png)
 When playing music with emms it show the whole path to the music . I would prefer if it just showed the song name not /home/$USER/Music/song.mp3 but rather just song.mp3

 Now you can run SPICE simulation for simple circuits in GNU Emacs. Since the circuit and graphs are in SVG format, you can easily share it on web or embed in a document.

                    <span>Recently, I compiled Emacs PGTK Nativecomp and running it on my machine which is fairly good. Surely, using nativecomp is a new experience and everything felt very fast as compared to Emacs 27. But yesterday, I was facing Emacs freeze while editing a simple dockerfile which is hardly 100 lines ig and I inspected it in Htop and found that Emacs using 100% CPU. Then I killed emacs and run another instance and profiled it while editing same dockerfile but again I left with freezed Emacs. Again I tried same and found in profiler that evil (especially evil-ex command), timer.el(IDK what it is) and selectrum(precisely selectrum--update) using CPU. Then I removed evil packages from my init.el and replaced selectrum with vertico. Now, Emacs is usable. But it still lags (not freezes) in between and its due to native compilation turned on. 
 Is this only happening to me or anyone else facing same issue? Is there any workaround for it?

                    <span>Hi guyz , I really love emacs but I use terminal over GUI. But have some problems here. Neovim modeline , tree, terminal interface are cooler that terminal emacs.
 Other thing is how to make it faster as performance ? I use emacsclient still need more performance.
 So any packages that would help me?
 Regards.

                    <span>Hello there,
 1st of all, I don&#x27;t mean for blog posts, like emacs&#x27;s org2blog package. I mean to actually develop the wordpress site itself by coding in emacs.
 Is there a simple way to do this?
 I&#x27;m guessing I&#x27;ll need ssh, tramp, git, ftps, etc... to set this up?
 Thanks in advance for the help!

                    <span>Hello there,
 I am planning on creating python blog posts in my wordpress site, by using code snippets from python projects that I develop in emacs.
 Anyways, my question is would the emacs package org2blog be a good solution for my use-case?
 Basically I&#x27;m going to insert Python code blocks as well as screenshots of my Python projects into the wordpress blog, then explain that stuff in the wordpress blog. Would org2blog be a good for this?
 I need to the code to be synax highlighted, and I want to be able to use custom themes for the code blocks.
 Thanks again for the help!

                    <span>Edit: emacs-plus and the devel version of emacs-mac now have patches to obviate this. A patch has been proposed upstream and we are awaiting feedback from the original author before it can be merged.
 ​
 Unfortunately, it looks like macOS Monterey regressed the performance of vfork, which means magit is once again slow and gets slower the more packages you have loaded. See https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gnu-emacs/2017-04/msg00201.html
 I&#x27;m curious if anyone out there has an M1 Mac w/ Monterey and Emacs 27.2 or greater and would be willing to run this and report back the timing information:
 (benchmark 100 &#x27;(call-process &quot;/usr/bin/true&quot; nil nil nil))
 Thanks!

                    <span>I&#x27;ve recently reached an initial milestone in the development of SLinC (Scala Link to C), a library in the vein of Java Native Access and Java Native Runtime. I&#x27;m designing SLinC to use cats&#x27; &#x60;Free&#x60; monad for a native effect type called NativeIO, and it&#x27;s powered by Scala 3&#x27;s macros and Java 17&#x27;s foreign incubator.
 An example usage of SLinC is binding to stdlib.h&#x27;s div method:
 C representation
 struct div_t { int quot; int rem; }; div_t div(int numerator, int denominator); 
 Scala 3 binding and usage
 //scala representation of div_t struct type div_t &#x3D; Struct { val quot: int val rem: int } //method binding for c stdlib&#x27;s div val div &#x3D; NativeIO[(Int, Int) &#x3D;&gt; div_t](&quot;div&quot;) //usage of our binding //Struct returns require native memory allocation, so an allocation scope is needed Native.scope( for result &lt;- div(5,2) quot &#x3D; result.quot.get rem &#x3D; result.rem.get yield println(s&quot;quotient: $quot, remainder: $rem&quot;) ) //natively allocated data is freed after this point .foldMap(NativeIO.impureCompiler) //compiles and runs the native kernel we just defined, prints &quot;quotient: 2, remainder: 1&quot; 
 The library is still in development, so it&#x27;s not as fully featured as JNA or JNR, but I&#x27;m hoping to improve it in the coming month. It&#x27;s also very promising performance-wise: despite me not putting much of any effort into optimization, it&#x27;s already rivaling JNR in performance, and resoundingly beats JNA.

                    <span>Greetings, fellow FP fans!
 This is not your typical r/scala question about type classes or another generic job post – you won’t see any “in this role you will…” or “Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science or equivalent.”
 You also won’t find any corny buzzwords like “bleeding edge,” “gamechanging,” “unmatched,” or – God forbid – “robust.”
 So… what are we doing here?
 Well, you’ve stumbled upon a Scala &amp; FP trap laid by myself, Alec, with Signify Technology – we’re the world’s only Scala &amp; FP specialist recruiting firm. And yes, I know that 80% of you just rolled your eyes or moved to close this post when you read “recruiting firm,” but give me a chance here.
 As I was saying; we’re the world’s only Scala &amp; FP specialist recruiting firm. We work with both the biggest names &amp; fastest-growing…</span>

 def size &#x3D; 2 and var size &#x3D; 2, val size &#x3D; 2.
 They only differ that former is a definition or function named size which don&#x27;t take any argument but returns 2 and the later is a variable which holds an integral value 2 and last is same as 2nd just that its value cannot be changed.
 Are there any other differences?
 Can you give more examples where you stuck at your time, related to the topic, and you wanna teach us?
 Like Haskell Another sessional came this, and I&#x27;m not been able to I&#x27;m new to Scala and not been able to pay that much attention and time to it, it needs. But unlike Haskell, I don&#x27;t want to drop scala.
 Anyways thanks for all help.

                    <span>I&#x27;d be interested in hearing how others handle the following question on using org headers and sub-headers.
 Suppose you have an Org file for some purpose -- a particular project, notes on a topic, a draft document, etc. For argument&#x27;s sake, let&#x27;s say it&#x27;s for a project called XXX, and the file itself is project_xxx.org. And suppose you want several sections. For example: a Description, a list of Tasks, a Journal area, a list of References, etc. Given that, there are at least two ways of setting up the org headings. 
 You could simply have the sections be level 1 headings, like this:
 * Description * Tasks * Journal * References 
 But that means that what make those four sectional headings all belong to Project XXX is nothing more than the fact that they all happen to be in the file projec…</span>

                    <span>Are there good options for automatically adjusting text size for a frame based on the current display?
 I didn&#x27;t find anything so I made a small package textsize that currently fits my needs quite well. It automatically chooses a font point size for the default face for the current frame, based on:
  
monitor resolution: if it&#x27;s lower res, typically want a smaller point size
 pixel pitch: higher point size on finer pitch screens
 manual per-frame adjustment available to shift the calculated value
  
For me there is one current omission where automatic adjustment is fired via window-size-change-functions, which does not fire if the resolution is unchanged. e.g. Going from my 1080p laptop to a 1080p external. The only options I&#x27;ve seen for that require polling, which feels kind of distasteful. Anyone know of triggers I might catch for that?
 I could add rules around monitor size and/or frame size, though personally I haven&#x27;t particularly wanted it. The manual adjustment is available for transient needs.
 I&#x27;d welcome comments both on the functionality, how I achieved it.
  
Is this reinventing another wheel I didn&#x27;t find? This EmacsWiki page outlines some details but I didn&#x27;t see automatic adjustment.
 
I feel like my coding of &#x27;thresholds&#x27; is clunky and a little obtuse - are the Elisp examples of something similar that&#x27;s cleaner and clearer?
 
My default pixel pitch thresholds are guesses, as my day-to-day doesn&#x27;t have a lot of variation on that.
 
 If you want to try it, load textsize.el and run (textsize-setup), and move things between disparate monitors (providing their resolution isn&#x27;t the same!). Tweak the customizations and let me know if you think the defaults could be better or if you would want other rules.
 I can put it on MELPA if there&#x27;s interest, but I feel like it could do with a bit more depth.

                    <span>Hi.
 I have been thinking about switching to Emacs from Vim. I was using Vim since I tried to use Emacs but it was difficult to understand the configuration.
 The main use I would give it would be for web development with React and node. Any blog that you recommend me to learn how to configure Emacs in general. 
 Thank you very much for your help.

                    <span>Hi guys, I&#x27;ve been learning haskell for school and I have an exercise Im trying to do where I have to implement a function firstWhen :: (a -&gt; Bool) -&gt; [a] -&gt; Maybe a, 
 the function is meant to return Just n if n is the first member that satisfies the condition and Nothing if no member satisfies the condition. So my first thought is to use foldl since it will check everything from the left to the right and I have my accumulator set to Nothing. 
 My current implementation is: 
 firstWhen p &#x3D; foldl (\acc x -&gt; if p x then Just x else Nothing ) Nothing
 The problem is it always returns the result for the final member. is there some way to make the function return the first member that satisfies the condition and then stop iterating? or am I thinking about this the wrong way? Thanks in advance for any tips or gentle nudges in the right direction :)

                    <span>Hey guys,
 I am currently trying to learn some haskell by going throught he LYAH book and got two questions.
 ​
 1) I think it was written when Applicative was not required for the Monad typeclass. It states in this capter (http://learnyouahaskell.com/for-a-few-monads-more) that there are some functions that do the same as the functions on Functors. But specifically written for Monads (e.g. liftM and fmap; ap and ).
  
Which ones are you using?
 Is there a rule of thumb?
 Perhaps something like &quot;always liftM when the value is an instance of Monad and only fmap when it is an instance of Applicative and not of Monad?&quot;
  
​
 2) There is a small task to do this tightrope walker example (http://learnyouahaskell.com/a-fistful-of-monads) with the Either type instead of the Maybe type.Thats what I did here and wondered if I could use the state Monad in combination with the Either Monad to clean up the code by avoiding all these &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;first &lt;- landLeft start second &lt;- landLeft first etc..&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  
Is this possible? ( I did not yet fully grasp the State Monad stuff, so it would also be a decent practice I guess)
  
​

 thanks in advance!

                    <span>Hey, let&#x27;s say I have following list of numbers and I want them to add to a list of tuples where the second tuple member will always be a constant string of &quot;ID&quot;. How to go about that?
 ids &#x3D; [1,2,3,4]
 I wanna achieve the following:
 tupleList :: [(Int, String)]
 tupleList &#x3D; map (\x -&gt; x &quot;ID&quot;) ids -- [(1 , &quot;ID&quot;), (2 , &quot;ID&quot;), (3 , &quot;ID&quot;), ....]

                    <span>this is my first time learning Haskell.
 i am trying to implement this simple function but getting this stack overflow exception
 can anyone help me to figure out what am i doing wrong here
 Haskell
 i tried the same implementation in other languages and its working just fine

 I confused about type of (join .)

(join .) :: Monad m &#x3D;&gt; (a1 -&gt; m (m a2)) -&gt; a1 -&gt; m a2 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; Can anyone explain why is it? And, How can we do reasoning to get the type of it? I think it&#x27;s partial composition applied or pointfree function. But, I still can&#x27;t figure it out.

                    <span>I&#x27;m a senior developer with interests in pure functional programming with languages like Haskell. But I&#x27;m tired of companies expecting tonnes of experience in Haskell, Scala etc. I would like to shift my career from traditional Java/C# developer to Haskell developer. But I could not find any jobs and even if I find something, they expect me to have years of experience in Scala/Elixir etc.
 I&#x27;m from India and almost no companies here use Haskell. I&#x27;m burned out and came to conclusion that I&#x27;ll never work in Haskell or any pure functional language. Is there someplace where I can find jobs for people with interest in Haskell?

                    <span>Hello, I&#x27;m a psychology student from an Eastern European country. Currently I&#x27;m using the method to learn more about the neuroscience of emotions and personality psychology and how they are related to each other.
I was reading some neuroscience textbooks in the past few days and I wanted to take notes from them, because I know little to nothing about neuroscience. However, I have some trouble with finding connections between the notes in my Zettelkasten (probably because there are only two dozen notes and because I have deleted my previous Zettelkästen a few times).
I thought that knowing the types of links would help me with making the connections. These are the types of connections I know of yet:
So, do you think that having a personal typology of link types is helpful in making more meaningful connections between ideas?
(P.S. Stupid me deleted my previous Zettelkästen because I wasn&#x27;t satisfied with the connections I made. Most of them were of the type &quot;This is a note about object X, this is another note about object X, I can sense a connection!&quot;, which is a link type better encapsulated with a tag. Because of that I got few insights over the months I had been using the method.)</span>

                    <span>I&#x27;ve seen advice here that says every note needs to be linked to at least two other notes. I followed this advice and got a bunch of feedback loops and not a lot of structure. I started giving myself permission to use Structure Notes as much as I want, and I find these structure notes to be much more helpful than direct links from one note to the next.
If I have a stream of thought that spans 10 notes, I find it easier to back to the structure note to click through each note than to do a whole bunch of to/from links in each note.
Anybody else experience this? Anything I&#x27;m missing out by not linking directly?</span>

                    <span>Helm-mode is off, but I suddenly have helm completions everywhere when doing Ctrl+R search (e.g. for find-file). Resetting my .emacs to an earlier state and restarting Emacs didn&#x27;t make a difference.
 Any idea what could be going wrong?

                    <span>I&#x27;ve encountered a small, insignificant (yet very annoying for me) difference between Doom and Spacemacs.
 In Info-mode: When I open it in Spacemacs and do Info-goto-node - it shows a bunch of nodes. In Doom: the same thing shows: &quot;Top. This is the top of info tree&quot;, and no nodes.
 I&#x27;ve been searching all over Spacemacs&#x27; codebase, yet I can&#x27;t figure it out. Can someone give me a hint of what that might be? Thanks!

                    <span>I have been using mu4e for a year and I am fairly satisfied with it except for how slow it can be. This slowness really annoys me when mu re-indexing blocks all other email operations including opening emails.
 I decided to switch to notmuch instead and upon configuring it (based on prot&#x27;s config) it seems much faster and the fact that there can be multiple open searches and emails is a huge draw for me.
 However, there are features in mu4e that I want to replicate in notmuch, at least in the beginning while I get used to the tags system. These include:
  
Moving messages between folders and deleting messages.
 Multiple accounts and automatic context switching. In mu4e, when replying to an email the correct email account is used.
 Viewing messages from a search without the related messages in a thread. The tree-view includes all messages in a thread (and is not aligned correctly by default) and the non-tree view shows a list of threads rather than messages.
  
Does anyone have a configuration that implements these features?
 Finally, to be able to use tags, I am wondering if there&#x27;s a way to sync notmuch&#x27;s arbitrary tags with the mail server. I have two machines that access the same mail server and I want to configure notmuch on them separately, replicating the email tags (I cannot ssh to either machine from the other and I don&#x27;t want to rely on a Dropbox like service to sync the notmuch database).

                    <span>I have been using tramp for a long time, but I find that tramp does not work today. I am using the latest commit ba278e4a9b, and I compile my Emacs from source on my Arch machine.
 I have tried connecting to a local mac machine and a VPS. Tramp stucks at &quot;Tramp: Opening connection nil for user@host using ssh...failed&quot;. I toggled debug on quit, and find that tramp stuck at tramp-maybe-open-connection . I also tried to use my mac machine to connect back to my arch machine, the mac machine is also on the latest commit ba278e4a9b, and they both have the same issue. Also, I have tried to open emacs using emacs -Q , but tramp failed also without loading my config.
 Tramp was working a week ago. All I did is compile Emacs from the latest source. 
 I am curious to see if that is my problem or a bug in Emacs. Does anyone of you unable to use tramp using the latest commit?
 Is there anything I can do to find out what is going wrong?

                    <span>So, I&#x27;ve put up a package for doing pomodoros in Emacs.
 I can&#x27;t say there is a shortage of timers in Emacs, but I wanted to try making one managed by transient.el, among other things. I managed to print the current state and history of the timer in the transient buffer, although I suspect displaying such data there is not the indented usage :-)
 Anyway, hope you like it: https://github.com/SqrtMinusOne/pomm.el

                    <span>If you didn&#x27;t know Emacs had a inbuilt-mode for controlling MPD Server.
 Although it is not comprehensive and requires more work , it is perfectly suited for controlling your music.
 I just covered the working of MPC-Mode on my blog here - https://pspiagicw.github.io/posts/the-weirdest-mode-in-emacs-mpc-mode/

                    <span>I manually added a package into package-selected-packages in my init.el in order to test package-install-selected-packages. After doing this the variable is no longer being updated automatically. Any new package I install through package-install now gets classified as a dependency unless I add it to selected packages by hand. Is this normal behavior? How do I get emacs to start automatically updating the variable again?

 I can call myfun from my terminal, it does work perfectly.
 ​
 1 . I close my Emacs, 
  
I start a new terminal session, 
 
start my emacs from command line.
 emacs 
 M-! (shell-command-to-string &quot;myfun&quot;) /bin/bash: myfun command not found
 
 It seems to me shell-command-to-string use &#x27;/bin/bash&#x27; to run command in Emacs only,
 My question is how to source my /tmp/shellLib.sh and run &#x27;/bin/bash&#x27; so that shell-command-to-string can recognize myfun in /tmp/shellLib.sh

                    <span>I am an ML engineer and a PhD Maths student.
 Most of my work uses rectangle arrays.
 I would like to learn Haskell, but I find myself needing a pragmatic reason to use haskell in a way that works with my very schedule.
 For example, in my PhD I was using matlab. It is slow and not open, hence I started using Julia.
 In my work I was using R, it in open but still slow, hence I started using Julia.
 What reasons can I tell myself to start using Haskell?
 Thanks

 ​
 But I think Monads are likely overmystified, what with the burritos and all. One thing, after I finish getting Monads, is that I&#x27;d like to explain Monads to my mother. She&#x27;s not a programmer by trade, but was studying for a Java certification years back, so it might be a little bit easier.
 ​
 I&#x27;m wondering, does anyone else want to explain Monads to their mother? Even if they didn&#x27;t want to do so, would you have a strategy for explaining Monads to your mother? Come and share, both proposals and experiences!

                    <span>Hi, I&#x27;m not sure if this is best place to post this question, but here goes. I&#x27;m working on a problem that requires an algorithm that finds all sequences of natural numbers that add up to a given number. So, for example, 4 is broken down into &#x60;[[1,1,1,1],[1,1,2],[1,3],[4],[2,2]]&#x60;. There&#x27;s a solution online I found (https://origin.geeksforgeeks.org/find-all-combinations-that-adds-upto-given-number-2/), but it&#x27;s for other imperative languages and doesn&#x27;t translate well to Haskell. I managed to write an algorithm that works (I think), but seems to be terrible inefficient for higher numbers. I think trying to parse through it would just further confuse anyone reading. I was wondering what someone more well versed in the ins and outs of Haskell would do to implement this algorithm. Thanks.

                    <span>I recently came across my old cluster of Zettels on Scott Young&#x27;s Drilldown Method. I thought at first that his method would only be helpful to enhance my Zettelkasten workfow. It turns out that it&#x27;s helpful for practicing skills too.
However, I&#x27;m stuck with one Zettel where I cite him making a weak argument to establish the goal of one of the stages. I&#x27;m not sure what to do with it. I&#x27;m confident in that I can improve it, but should I get rid of his or keep it?
Any hints would be much appreciated.</span>

                    <span>Now, I don&#x27;t have first-hand knowledge of this, and I don&#x27;t read German, but I&#x27;ve heard from two sources now that Luhmann&#x27;s books are incredibly difficult to read. One person described the book he read as &quot;a chaotic mess...It read, in my opinion, like something written by a sentient library catalog, full of disordered and tangential insights, loosely related to one another.&quot;
While I know that a great guitar builder can be a terrible guitarist, I wonder if it matters that the &quot;founding father&quot; of the Zettelkasten system wrote books that felt disorganized and random.
[And I understand Luhmann wasn&#x27;t writing for the masses but for the sociology community, so maybe his writing was par for the academic course.]</span>

                    <span>Hi guys, I&#x27;ve put together this macOS Big Sur style icon. It&#x27;s based on the Papirus icon but I&#x27;ve changed the background shape and also soften many curves and rotated the logo a bit. Here are the (non perma-) links to the source background raster and logo svg in case someone more skilled than I am wants to improve the icon.

                    <span>I&#x27;m using MacOS Monterey and the standard emacs GUI installed with &#x60;brew install --cask emacs&#x60;. When using &#x60;lsp-ui&#x60;, the documentation viewer, which appears in a childframe, causes a blank frame to be created when emacs is in full screen. This appears to happen with other apps as well that use childframes. 
 I&#x27;ve disabled using a child frame for the doc which is upsetting because the in frame version is way worse and doesn&#x27;t have clickable links.
 Anyone know of a workaround? I&#x27;m new to emacs and still just trying to get my emacs config to work without major bugs.

                    <span>I create a lot of documents using LaTeX and groff. When I&#x27;m editing LaTeX in emacs, thanks to auctex I can do C-c C-a to compile and preview the document I&#x27;m working on.
 I&#x27;d like to get similar functionality for groff documents. To compile my documents I usually run:
 pdfmom -t -e -p -mhdtbl -Tps report.mom &gt; report.pdf 
 Is there an easy way to get emacs to run that and preview the resulting PDF?
 Thanks :)

                    <span>I realize this is a common question - e.g. see here but I want to ask a slight variation on the usual case.
 I have created my own class file with definitions called my_article.cls, with code like:
 \NeedsTeXFormat{LaTeX2e} \ProvidesClass{my_article}[Article class with style modifications ] \LoadClass{article} \RequirePackage{titlesec} \RequirePackage{setspace} \onehalfspacing \RequirePackage[a4paper, hscale&#x3D;0.8, vscale&#x3D;0.8, includehead]{geometry} \RequirePackage{amsmath} \RequirePackage{amsfonts} \RequirePackage{amssymb} \RequirePackage{graphicx} \titleformat{\subsection}[hang] {\large\fontfamily{lmss}\mdseries\raggedright} {\thesubsection} {1em} {\underline} 
 To use this normally, I put this file in the same folder as the .tex file I am editing, and use \documentclass[11pt,letterpaper]{my_article}.
 I want to port this to org-mode, so that I can specify something like #+LATEX_CLASS: my_class at the start of the document.
 Is there someway that I can do this without having to repeatedly copy the .cls file into the working directory of the org file? I.e. specify this in my init.el file? For instance, this method in the worg tutorials is often suggested, but it seems to be for org-mode &lt; v8.0.
 An alternative I&#x27;ve tried is to use #+SETUPFILE:~/my_template.org, which is a file that contains various #+LATEX_HEADER:\usepackage{} lines. This works for declaring which packages are necessary, and for defining shortcuts, but I&#x27;m not sure it will work for defining pagestyles for example.

                    <span>Any must-have config to make TRAMP in Emacs more stable? I am using Emacs for macOSX v27.2 and even emacs -Q crashes continuously, sometimes due to completion with TAB or when sudo dmesg -c outputs lots of character in eshell. Force Quit is the only option. 
 Edit: I disabled company-mode and eshell over TRAMP got much faster and not lagging much.

                    <span>I use https://github.com/nnicandro/emacs-jupyter a lot and find it incredibly useful in my work. I recently discovered that I can donate to the developer (the last commit adds a liberapay link). I have no other affiliation with nnicandro. I thought that if you use emacs-jupyter as much as I do you might want to know about the possibility to donate.

                    <span>Hello! 
 Pretty sure I&#x27;m just being stupid but I can&#x27;t make blame echo work. The headings just appear empty.
 If I use &#x60;magit-blame&#x60; again and cycle styles, a couple of them actually works fine so maybe there&#x27;s something wrong with font colours?
 Any ideas?

 https://github.com/akermu/emacs-libvterm/issues/313 for a long thread of on some of the issues
 The main issues I have had are due to navigating when in normal mode and then switching back to insert mode (cursor can jump back to end of line) and other editing features like &quot;Change-Inner-Word&quot;. 
 I have also tried disabling evil in Vterm and using a Vim mode for zsh, but that is super slow and unresponsive (changing modes takes like 0.5-1 second).
 Im pretty new to being evil, so wanted to know if anyone has any nice vterm setup to recommend. I have tried the solutions offered in that issues thread, but haven&#x27;t had too much success.

 Recently I realized I have no idea how should I define version bounds for my library and I got pretty confused before I finally figured out the reasoning behind it (thanks to r/haskell and Adam Bergmark from Stackage), so I thought I would capture that reasoning in a short article: https://github.com/wasp-lang/haskell-handbook/blob/master/dependencies-version-bounds.md .
 I would appreciate any feedback, be it if I got something wrong or if I could improve clarity in some way.
 Article is aimed for Haskell developers that are publishing a library for the first time or are about to distribute their first executable.

                    <span>Greetings everyone!
 I am very new to the programming world and was introduced to this world by a friend of mine. After several hours of researching I accidentally stumbled upon haskell &amp; the world of functional programming!
 At this very moment, I find myself puzzled about whether I should mainly write in haskell or not since the syntax of haskell, compared to other prgoramming languages, is rather more attractive I dare say.
 So I am here to kindly request help from more knowledgable haskell programmers to help me answer several questions that I am currently struggling to find answers to:
  
Should I be worried about software performance in general? I have been considering writing several applications in haskell that are somewhat performance dependent and as previously mentioned, I would rather have them be written in haskell than not if the performance is not strongly affected by this.
 Does haskell have good graphics libraries? If so, what is the performance disadvantage it has compared to languages like C/C++? I am interested in working with something similar to Inigo Quilez work.
 What is the current status of AI research in haskell? From my very simple searching, I noticed that it&#x27;s not a popular programming language in the field of AI and I am honestly confused about why that is. Perhaps someone more knowledgable about this can explain to me why a language closer to mathematics is somehow further away from the mathematical research environment.
  
Other than that, I would like to thank you all for keeping this subreddit alive for newcomers like me to explore &amp; learn from!

                    <span>I&#x27;ve deployed a Website that uses the Yesod Framework on Heroku.
 The problem I have is with the Procfile. In the Yesod wiki it says that the file should contain:
 &#x60;web: ./dist/build/appname/appname production -p $PORT&#x60;
 ​
 However, that does not work. In the &#x60;heroku logs&#x60; it says that it can&#x27;t find said directory. Also tried removing the production keyword for the command as suggested in a stack overflow question. Also tried ./dist/build/appname and every other variation :))
 ​
 Does anyone know how that path is chosen? Is it somehow linked with the buildpack that I&#x27;ve used?
 Any ideas on troubleshooting this?

                    <span>This is my first time posting, so apologies in advance if I violate any community conventions.
 I recently started reading A prettier printer by Phil Wadler, which describes his algorithm for formatting documents. After describing the core operations, Wadler introduces the following laws required to reduce a document to normal form, &quot;taken together with the fact that  is associative with unit nil&quot;:
 -- text is a homomorphism from ++ to  text (s ++ t) &#x3D; text s  text t text &quot;&quot; &#x3D; nil -- nest is a homomorphism from + to composition nest (i+j) x &#x3D; nest i (nest j x) nest 0 x &#x3D; x -- nest distributes through concatenation nest i (x  y) &#x3D; nest i x  nest i y nest i nil &#x3D; nil -- nest is absorbed by text nest i (text s) &#x3D; text s

                    <span>Hi all, wanted to get a quick sanity check to see if anyone else is experiencing this or if I am doing something else wrong.
 Tab completion for structure template expansion isn&#x27;t working on my end.
 I can run C-c C-, to select my templates for inserting source blocks and such, but running say &#x60;&lt;p TAB&#x60; to try and insert a python source block doesn&#x27;t seem to work (meanwhile C-c C-, p works totally fine).
 Couldn&#x27;t find any recent posts on here, so just wanted to ask quickly before I do a deep dive and see if I have made an error.
 Emacs Version: 27.2
 Org Version: 9.4.4
 ​
 Just wanted to see if anyone else has had similar issues, or if I am being a Gordan Ramsey certified idiot sandwich :p
 ​
 EDIT: Solved, as u/john_bergmann pointed out just needed to activate org-tempo module.

                    <span>Can anyone tell me what type is :: I tried Seq and List, 
 Found: Seq[Int] Required: ::[Int] Found: List[Int] Required: ::[Int] 
 is :: an alias for something? or its its own type
 https://scastie.scala-lang.org/gkB5yTopSISwuicIzBNjqw
 on a side note, the operator are a bit hard to search on google, does anyone know if there is doc on the type ::?
 Thanks

                    <span>Hello, when I check my e-mail the mu4e-headers bar shows two strange icons, one looks like a christmas tree. LOL. I didn&#x27;t modify anything in my Emacs config. In fact, I removed the entire ~/.emacs.d/ and let Emacs reinstall everything from scratch but the problem still persists. Did something change in the mu4e configuration style lately? I remember a couple of months ago mu4e switched to using the new :maildir style for configuration, then I updated it and everything worked fine until now. 
 Here&#x27;s an image to see what I&#x27;m talking about: https://ibb.co/wzxN7gm
 And this is how my config looks:
 Fonts config ;; Default (set-face-attribute &#x27;default nil :font &quot;Hack&quot; :height 180) ;; Variable-pitch (set-face-attribute &#x27;variable-pitch nil :font &quot;Hack&quot; :height 180) ;; Fixed-pitch (set-face-attribute &#x27;fixed-pitch nil :font &quot;DejaVu Sans Mono&quot;) (defun king/org-fixed-pitch () (set-face-attribute &#x27;org-table nil :inherit &#x27;fixed-pitch) (set-face-attribute &#x27;org-block nil :inherit &#x27;fixed-pitch :foreground nil) (set-face-attribute &#x27;org-code nil :inherit &#x27;(shadow fixed-pitch))) Mu4e config :config (setq mu4e-contexts (list (make-mu4e-context ;; Personal context :name &quot;personal&quot; :enter-func (lambda () (mu4e-message &quot;Entering personal context&quot;)) :match-func (lambda (msg) (when msg (mu4e-message-contact-field-matches msg &#x27;(:from :to :cc :bcc) &quot;zolikydev@gmail.com&quot;))) :vars &#x27;((user-mail-address . &quot;zolikydev@gmail.com&quot;) (user-full-name . &quot;Zoltan Kiraly&quot;) (mu4e-sent-folder . &quot;/gmail-zoliky/[Gmail].Sent Mail&quot;) (mu4e-drafts-folder . &quot;/gmail-zoliky/[Gmail].Drafts&quot;) (mu4e-trash-folder . &quot;/gmail-zoliky/[Gmail].Trash&quot;) (smtpmail-queue-dir . &quot;~/Maildir/gmail-zoliky/queue/cur&quot;) (smtpmail-smtp-user . &quot;zoliky&quot;) (mu4e-maildir-shortcuts .

                    <span>I&#x27;m somewhat at a loss... I&#x27;m using emacs on windows 10 (yeah I know I know), and in some folders I just can&#x27;t seem to edit or create files. 
 In particular, I can&#x27;t write to files in the default windows &quot;Documents&quot; folder. I just keep getting the error &quot;Opening output file: Permission denied&quot;, but no other program has any problems creating or editing files in that folder. Anyone have an idea what the problem could be or could help debug?

                    <span>Is it me or native compilation seems to trigger more warnings than byte-compilation?
 I am getting the &quot;Warning: assignment to free variable&quot; for anything I setq outside of a lexical scope, as well as the Warning: the function ‘my-function’ is not known to be defined and I know that my-function is loaded, and even natively compiled. 
 Sure, I can defvar, and declare-function these warnings away, but why the difference? byte-compilation produces no such warnings.
 thanks.

                    <span>I am trying out multiple sessions of Doom with Chemacs2, and I want each doom configuration to use its own bin/doom and that requires the PATH for the session to include that sessions bin/doom.
 Chemacs2 uses its own functions to set the environment variable DOOMDIR
 ( (&quot;vanilla&quot; . ((user-emacs-directory . &quot;~/emacsen/vanilla/emacs.d&quot;))) (&quot;doom1&quot; . ((user-emacs-directory . &quot;~/emacsen/doom1/emacs.d&quot;) (env. ((&quot;DOOMDIR&quot;.&quot;~/emacsen/doom1/doom.d&quot;))))) (&quot;doom2&quot; . ((user-emacs-directory . &quot;~/emacsen/doom2/emacs.d&quot;) (env. ((&quot;DOOMDIR&quot;.&quot;~/emacsen/doom2/doom.d&quot;))))) ) 
 Is it possible to use something like that to extend the PATH, ie ~/emacsen/doom2/doom.d/bin/doom?
 One way I can think of is run emacs with a script that adds the configurations bin/doom before calling emacs, but I prefer it do it in the manner Chemacs2 sets the DOOMDIR, within an Elisp configuration script.

                    <span>Hey emacs lovers,
 I wanted a tool to discover and explore new code bases inside emacs. While I was looking for this tool, I saw some pictures of ranger and I really liked the layout. I wanted that kind of layout for emacs.
 So I wrote bfs :)
 ​
 BFS - by Tony Aldon
 bfs (Browse File System) implements for emacs a dynamic tree view of the file system à la ranger.
 This is a new &quot;environment&quot; accessible via the command bfs.
 I hope you will like it.
 ---&gt; https://github.com/tonyaldon/bfs
 ps: As I said in the README:
  
bfs doesn&#x27;t try to implement the features offered by ranger (only the layout),
 bfs isn&#x27;t a file manager (I personaly still use dired, wdired and any shell for more elaborated tasks applying to files).

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been working off of a few blog posts as well as the org-manual, and I can&#x27;t help but feel like I&#x27;m almost there.
 (setq org-agenda-custom-commands &#x27;((&quot;d&quot; &quot;Daily agenda and all TODOs&quot; ((agenda &quot;&quot; ((org-agenda-span 4)(org-agenda-tag-filter-preset (quote (&quot;&quot;))))) (alltodo &quot;&quot; ((org-agenda-tag-filter-preset (quote (&quot;-habit&quot;))) (org-agenda-compact-blocks t) )))))) 
 The code should show me four days of schedule plus whatever TODOs I have lying around that aren&#x27;t scheduled (showing both means this post doesn&#x27;t really tell me what I&#x27;m doing wrong). But it either fully excludes the Habit tag (which is sometimes used for recurring/upkeep style tasks, like mopping the kitchen floor, and that &quot;sometimes-but-not-always&quot; nature of them excludes this post) or the command fully includes it, with no middle ground. I had hoped that setting the filter preset for each phase individually would prevent this (by making it have no filter for the agenda, and then a filter for the todos) but I&#x27;m not sure what I&#x27;m doing wrong.
 The code as listed filters out habit from both agenda and todo. If I remove &quot;-habit&quot; from the second instance of filter, it shows habits in both places. It does feel like the filter preset is only being checked once, but I&#x27;m honestly in way over my head already and at a loss for how to fix it.

                    <span>I&#x27;m not (yet anyway) an eLisp wiz who can cook something up, but was wondering if there&#x27;s a module that allows to export header and or selected buffer text section to another external app - a glue between emacs and OS context menu functionality. So one can &#x27;export&#x27; to apps registered in &#x27;Share to&#x27; context. 
 I am aware and using org-export-dispatch but this is different workflow. I&#x27;d like for emacs to be &#x27;aware&#x27; of apps in context menu that accept text from other sources.

                    <span>Hey all. Ive used doom emacs for a while but recently got to making my own init file. Im quite happy and have basically all I need (you never have all you need but being realistic here). However I would really like to have a helper like in doom emacs, when I press my leader or even normal prefix keybinds I got a popup buffer telling me my options and that was really helpful to remember old or not so often used commands. Right now I think I don&#x27;t have too many struggles but that&#x27;s probably because Ive just made the file and have all the keybinds set up and read all the documentation of dozens of packages, if I ever dont use a leybind but remember vaguely how it starts, it would be awesome not to use some find functions or scouting my emacs file and or package files for the answer. 
 Sorry for slightly over explaining, help would be appreciated, thanks for your time.

                    <span>Yes, I know it sounds crazy, but I love how the tool-bar looks on macOS. The bigger adds some comfy padding to the text which I like. 
 However, the icons look old and ugly. Is it possible to remove the icons, but keep the titlebar? Couldn&#x27;t find anything online

                    <span>There is a package called binary-instances providing Binary instances for various commonly used types like vectors and aeson Value but I couldn&#x27;t find an analogous package for cereal.
 I prefer cereal over binary because the Double encoding in cereal makes sense, but cereal is lacking quite a few things that binary has, such as instances for Scientific. The lack of instances from packages can be quite an obstacle to consistently using cereal.
 Is there a package for cereal providing instances for Scientific? I couldn&#x27;t find one. I&#x27;m wondering whether to write a package cereal-instances similar to binary-instances. It would be my first Hackage package. I&#x27;m wondering whether people will find it useful and whether I would end up semi-plagiarizing binary-instances since the code is probably very simple and similar to the one in binary-instances.

                    <span>Whenever I&#x27;m browsing my news feed, inevitably some article about some how new low/no code framework comes up. Inevitably, these will be proprietary frameworks, and I haven&#x27;t spent a lot of time exploring them or figuring out how they work, but all this hype makes me wonder: How do these frameworks relate to Haskell?
 For me, I love Haskell because of it&#x27;s huge potential for abstraction. And at least a lot of the time, abstraction means less, and more concise code. So, in many ways, I&#x27;d like to say that many Haskell libraries are actually &quot;Low code&quot; frameworks -- I think postgREST might be a perfect example of this. You generate a whole, possibly very complex API (which would be a lot of work by hand) with just a bit of SQL. Heck, throw in some entity-relationship diagrams instead of raw S…</span>

 Wrong type argument: stringp, stringp
 Can anyone have a look and point out what I might be doing wrong ?

                    <span>The reason is sometimes my todo is like an infrastructure related task that will affect multiple projects.
 ​
 Think projects as verticals and such infrastructure tasks as horizontals.
 ​
 The horizontal infrastructure may or may not have progress cookies that are per affected project.
 ​
 example:
 ​
 ** TODO switch to new server
 which impacts 4 projects and therefore has a progress of 0/4 
 I know TODO dependencies use org-edna. so was wondering if i also need to use another package.

 I am fairly new to org-mode. I have been trying to do something for a couple of weeks now, but I have run out of what I might need to be searching for to find out if it is possible.
 I am wanting a table to look up information in this (or different, if possible) org files hierarchy/structure.
 I am including an example of what I am trying to do below. I am very sure I can&#x27;t be the first person to want to try this, my thoughts are not that unique or interesting. Does anyone have ideas for might work, or what I might want to consider trying as an alternative?
 Thanks all 🙂

                    <span>Hello, I&#x27;m slowly going to create my first library for Scala 3 (and 2.13 at some point) which I need for my web projects. I&#x27;m interested in creating native driver or wrapper for Java&#x27;s driver, asking here about opinions if using native driver or raw Java lib/wrapper would make huge differences besides more FP/Rx syntax for ReQL. I&#x27;m open for suggestions, if you are interested in project progress, here I&#x27;m leaving link for empty yet repository.

                    <span>Hello community,
 Do you have suggestions on state of the art libraries or frameworks to parse huge XML files? Alternatively, what&#x27;s the best approach in tackling this problem with Scala?
 ​
 Disclaimer: I don&#x27;t have a CS or IT background and have very little experience with pure Scala, I mostly use Spark and Python daily, but I wanted to start filling my skills gaps within the data engineering realm for a long-term goal. I think I know the difference between SAX and DOM parsing, so I was looking for something to implement the former (amirite? :D)
 ​
 Disclaimer 2: this question stems from an interview assignment that required something like this plus other features (streaming solution, JSON output), but after spending too much time just on learning the different parsing approaches I told them I wouldn&#x27;t proceed: even though it&#x27;s something easy for the average programmer, it clearly shows my huge gaps in knowledge and programming skills. But I still want to work on it in my own time.
 ​
 Thanks a lot in advance and sorry if it&#x27;s a silly question. Cheers!

                    <span>Haskell’s laziness gives us
great
benefits,
but comes with costs.
One of the most visible cost of laziness is hard to predict memory behavior, and so we
have, and need, tools to profile and measure the heap of our Haskell programs.
Most of the time, we live in a high-level world of type classes, monoids, and
isomorphisms. But at the end of the day our code needs to run on actual
machines, and when our code is run it needs to be performant. Typically, “be
performant”, means “have reasonable computational complexity” and so we usually
focus on good asymptotic behavior instead of constant costs. But when our
programs meet our CPUs, constant costs are important, and thus having low level
tools is helpful for low level optimizations, i.e., when you want to squeeze
that last 10% out of your prog…</span>

                    <span>I&#x27;m an academic trying to have emacs fit my daily needs. I have very specific ideas of how I want it to be changed. Much concerns org-mode, but there&#x27;s also packages like org-roam and pdf-tools that I would like to change. I know a little bit of elisp myself, but not enough to carry out my projects alone. Thus, I am looking for an emacs lisp programmer to hire on a per-project-basis. If anyone is interested, please let me now! Specifics will be discussed then.

                    <span>Hello all,
 I am new to Emacs and have used it in the past few months mainly for VHDL coding. It had these wonderful shutter and electric modes which auto-filled the VHDL syntax making it easy for me to code (I was new to VHDL and emacs saved me).
 I have been using python for a few years now and wanted to enjoy some fun python coding on emacs. I mainly use libraries like numpy, scipy, matplotlib (pylab), pytorch and so on. I would really like to find a shutter-mode equivalent kind of mode for python. However, I am not sure of what to use since google had so many options and none of them very widely recommended. 
 So I would like you guys to help with some mode/add-on that would help me auto-fill the functions from these libraries and also any cool thing that would make my python coding with emacs fun!!

                    <span>I would like my shell/term buffer names to reflect the process that is being executed. For that purpose I whipped together &#x60;proctrack-mode&#x60; as a proof of concept. Though I am wondering -- before I polish this up -- isn&#x27;t there something like this out there already?

                    <span>Hi, I have this odd thing going on with &quot;hi-lock-mode&quot; that I can&#x27;t seem to figure out. I want to highlight a specific word in python-mode. And have this package config
 (use-package python :config (global-hi-lock-mode t) (add-hook &#x27;python-mode-hook (lambda () (highlight-regexp &quot;pass&quot; &#x27;hl-blue)))) 
 This work when I open a buffer with the keyword (here I can see &quot;pass&quot; in hl-word list), but does not work if I start a new python buffer, or open a file without the keyword (hl-word list is empty).
 I&#x27;m sure its something simple I&#x27;ve overlooked, but does anyone have an idea here?

                    <span>Sometimes I want to create some one-off modes to control more of my day-to-day tasks from emacs. Elisp is fun enough to code in, however one thing I find somewhat daunting is putting things into a buffer so that it looks nice.
 I am sure there must be some higher level &quot;widget&quot; or tui libraries out there that speed up that process without fiddling with manual placement of text and text properties, faces etc. I would really love to collect together some libraries here that you know. I couldn&#x27;t find another comprehensive resource for this.
 To make a start, here are some I&#x27;m aware of:
  
magit-section: Create a ui like magit
 Taxy: Uses magit-section but in some cases makes it even more convenient and fast to put data into a buffer
 Tabulated List Mode: Not to forget the built-ins, tabulated list mode can also help setting up a buffer really fast if a tabulated list is all one needs
 Hierarchy: Put hierarchical data into a buffer with several convenience functions to display, query and action callbacks. Seems to be merged to emacs and even though the library is there, there is not documentation in the Elisp or Emacs manuals, so the git repo README is still useful for documentation.
 tree-widget.el: There seems to be a tree-widget.el in emacs core, seems this also can be used to build trees in buffers but I haven&#x27;t used it and there seems to be no documentation in the Elisp or Emacs manuals about it so I don&#x27;t really know how useful it is.

                    <span>Hi!
 I am trying to set up spacemacs for latex. There is one thing that I am not able to set up. I&#x27;d like that a tex file is opened in latex-mode (or LaTeX mode, I don&#x27;t know the difference actually), but it doesn&#x27;t happen. I have to set latex-mode each time. 
 In my .spacemacs I have:
 (latex :variables latex-backend &#x27;lsp latex-build-command &#x27;latexmk latex-build-engine &#x27;xetex latex-enable-auto-fill t latex-enable-folding t latex-enable-magic t latex-view-with-pdf-tools t latex-view-pdf-in-split-window t latex-refresh-preview t) and 
 and 
 (defun dotspacemacs/user-init () (add-hook &#x27;doc-view-mode-hook &#x27;auto-revert-mode) (add-to-list &#x27;auto-mode-alist &#x27;(&quot;\\.tex\\&#x27;&quot; .

                    <span>org-depend is nice, but it feels clunky to me - I use org-capture to add tasks to my to-do list whenever they occur to me, so I often end up with something like:
 * TODO Task 1 * WAIT Task 2 * WAIT Task 1.5 
 ...where I forgot there was a task that needed to be done between 1 and 2, and have to add it in later. In this situation, the &quot;chain-siblings&quot; trigger keyword to move tasks from &quot;WAIT&quot; to &quot;TODO&quot; doesn&#x27;t really work out - plus, what about situations where Task 1 is a blocker for multiple other tasks, not all of which need to be completed in sequence?
 The trigger that works based on IDs seems more generally useful, but also even less ergonomic. If you want Task 1.5 to be enabled automatically after Task 1 is done, you have to create a UUID for 1.5, copy it, navigate to Task 1, and create a trigger property for it with the copied UUID value - which would certainly be a pain in the ass to do from e.g. the agenda.
 Something like org-linker-edna would be nice, but its functionality is tied pretty closely to Helm (I&#x27;m an Ivy user). Is ergonomic dependency creation (that is, with completion) something I&#x27;m gonna have to script up myself, or are there existing developments in this space?

It supported generation of makefiles and automake, which was kind cool. But I got several errors, not sure if they are related to the native stuff.

                    <span>I&#x27;m trying to get the basic diagrams first program running. I&#x27;ve been using stack, so I&#x27;m shy about doing anything with cabal. That is to say, I&#x27;m generally in the dark about Haskell package install. I did a stack ghci --package diagrams which seemed finally to install diagrams (after nine stack.yaml extra-deps additions) and start up a REPL (8.10.4). IAC, I could get the basic starter code DiagramsTutorial.lhs to load from the ghci prompt -- after doing :set -package diagrams-lib and :set -package diagrams-svg as it errored on Could not load module ‘Diagrams.Prelude’ etc. All right, then I tried as the tutorial says, i.e., $ ghc --make DiagramsTutorial.lhs This, however, errored out just like the ghci load with 
 diag1.hs:5:1: error: Could not load module ‘Diagrams.Prelude’ It is a member of the hidden package ‘diagrams-lib-1.4.3’. You can run ‘:set -package diagrams-lib’ to expose it. (Note: this unloads all the modules in the current scope.) Use -v (or &#x60;:set -v&#x60; in ghci) to see a list of the files searched for. 
 and same for import Diagrams.Backend.SVG.CmdLine I&#x27;m confused over the whole stack versus cabal thing in general. BTW, what&#x27;s the most popular IDE for Haskell? I&#x27;ve been using Emacs, trying to use the org-mode babel depending on a REPL session, which is iffy at best. Also, a $ ghc --version says 8.8.4. I&#x27;m confused.

                    <span>I have been using Stack for long time and never gave Cabal a try because I read a while ago, when starting with Haskell, that Cabal is more complicated and can get me into problems like dependency hell and similar. Also, there was a compelling benefit of Stack handling ghc for me.
 However, recently I got more into learning about cabal due to trying to publish a library on Hackage and having to better understand what a cabal package actually is and how to determine version bounds for my library, for its dependencies.
 As a result I decided to write a small article that gives overview of what Cabal and Stack are and also compares them, based on what I learned: https://github.com/wasp-lang/haskell-handbook/blob/master/cabal-and-stack.md . I focused a lot on comparing Cabal with other package managers out there.
 I would love to hear if I got something wrong in it, or if I missed something - any feedback is very welcome!
 Article is aimed for Haskell beginners, but assumes they already had some experience with other programming languages.

                    <span>For the last two-three days, I have been trying to wrap my head around functional reactive programming. I came across threepenny-gui while I have been trying to understand the concept.
 My understanding is that the difference between reactive programming as opposed to event-driven programming is that in reactive programming, one describes the behavior of the UI as a time varying function rather than how it behaves when certain events are triggerred. For example, Spreadsheet allow for reactive programming since we can say that a certain cell is related to some other cell in terms of a certain formula -- instead of having to say [When those cells update, change this cell according to this formula]. 
 When I look at the different examples included with threepenny-gui, I get the impression that they have not designed their programs reactively. For instance, if you see Mouse.hs, you see that they are saying
  on UI.mousemove wrap $ \xy -&gt; element out # set text (&quot;Coordinates: &quot; ++ show xy) on UI.keydown wrap $ \c -&gt; element out # set text (&quot;Keycode: &quot; ++ show c) 
 which binds the \c -&gt; element out # set text ... handler to the events. This looks like event driven programming to me, instead of reactive programming. In a reactive program, one would just say that certain fields are bound to the coordinates of the mouse.
 I have also looked at Reactive.Threepenny and I think I understand the combinators but I do not understand how to use them to actually write reactive code.
 Is my understanding correct?
 If you have suggestions on how to phrase my code as reactively as possible in threpenny-gui, that would be welcome. If this is not the correct library for this sort of programming, what would be a good way to exemplify these ideas?

 That means the values in Racket has a Maybe semantics implicitly:
 #f is Nothing
 non-#f is Just a
 Therefore, or in Racket could be seen as a Maybe Alternative in Haskell.
  Nothing  Just 42 
 My question is, 
 What about other boolean operators, e.g. and, xor and implies ?
 For example, 
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; (and 40 41 42) ;; &#x3D;&gt; 42 (and 40 #f 42) ;; &#x3D;&gt; #f
 (xor #f 42) ;; &#x3D;&gt; 42 (xor 42 #f) ;; &#x3D;&gt; 42
 (implies 42 43) ;; 43 (implies #f 43) ;; #t &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Is there any well-known mathematical structures for and, xor and implies that play the same role as Maybe Alternative in Haskell?
 Thanks.

                    <span>We are trying to get a working Haskell dev environment on MacOS M1, and are having various problems with the different approaches we have taken.
 Our project currently uses an older nixpkgs that comes with ghc[js]-8.6.5, but this unsurprisingly does not work and is likely a wontfix.
 The obvious choice was upgrading nixpkgs to a new version. However it seems like entering a nix-shell with ghc does not work, even for a very simple project. It complains about a broken compiler-rt-libc, and allowing for broken packages leads to a failing build of compiler-rt-libc.
 Surprisingly nix-build does work for ghc, however our project is too large for nix-build to be practical for development, as build times are on the order of an hour.
 Another problem with newer nixpkgs is that ghcjs doesn&#x27;t work at all, again even on simple projects. It errors out with a complaint about the happy test suite failing.
 Yet one more problem is that while newer ghcjs on non-M1 MacOS does work, it is massively slower, taking on the order of a day to build our project, occasionally requiring restarts due to running out of file handles.
 There are also problems with running newer ghcjs versions on Ubuntu, as our project deterministically fails with an Data.Binary.Get.runGet at position 0: not enough bytes error.
 Due to the above we have been instead focusing on getting ghc-8.6.5 working on MacOS M1 without nix via Rosetta.
 However this has been very difficult due to C dependencies. We have uninstalled and reinstalled the necessary brew libraries in x86 arch mode, but cabal does not seem to be able to find them either way.
 So what I was more or less wondering was what other people have gotten working on MacOS M1, in case there is anything we can learn from that to get our project building on it.

                    <span>I&#x27;m going kinda crazy trying to understand what&#x27;s going on here...
 Do org blocks allow TAB indentation without going into special editing mode via C-c &#x27; ?
 I have the following relevant settings in my custom-set-variables block (i.e. edited via customize-mode.
  &#x27;(org-edit-src-content-indentation 0) &#x27;(org-src-preserve-indentation nil) 
 I used these settings because I was getting sick of editing code in the source block and having all the lines jump 2 spaces to the right.
 org-src-tab-acts-natively is set to t as well. 
 But now when I write
 #+begin_src python def hello(): | #+end_src 
 the cursor is stuck at the start of the line and I can&#x27;t use TAB to indent to add a new line, i.e. to make it look like:
 def hello( ): print(&quot;hello) 
 TAB used to work -- or atleast, I thought it was working. This github comment suggests that this facility was never actually available, and we always had to use C-c &#x27; to edit code properly.
 Now, I have also set org-adapt-indentation to nil, because I prefer org-headings, sub-headings and text to be aligned with the buffer edge. If I set it to 1, it looks like there is some aligning going on when I hit TAB, but this is not perfect. Does this explain the &quot;pseudo-indenting&quot; that I had before, and there really is no inherent TAB indent in org blocks?

                    <span>I just started learning Common Lisp, mostly because there is a university class I could take in the future in which they just assume you already know the language going in; and so I downloaded the Portacle IDE, which is a bundle of (a forked version of?) Emacs, SBCL, QuickLisp, and Git. 
 Currently, I am only using Emacs for my rudimentary Lisp programming, because I don&#x27;t quite understand how to use Emacs properly. To put it into perspective, I find the much maligned text editor Vim far easier to use than Emacs, even though I had never really used the terminal in such a involved manner before I started programming with Vim. 
 If I decided to download the &quot;regular&quot; version of Emacs to use for every programming language I know later in time, would that interfere with Portacle&#x27;s version of Emacs?

                    <span>I just started looking into the emacs and have only installed evil mode. For some reason every newline emacs indents the lines above and leaves the newline with no indentation. Creating a sort of backwards indentation, I must be doing something really wrong but I have no idea what causes this.
 The indentation in my config.org
 In that example, I want each line with fs to be indented rightwards. What causes this?

                    <span>Many language server implementations are incredibly buggy. I don&#x27;t want to test them all and maintain lsp-disabled-clients. If I don&#x27;t have a server configured for the language of a newly opened file, lsp-mode suggest to install one. I have found no way to disable the question, and Ctrl-g quits find-file before the new buffer gets displayed. This is super annoying as I now need to do Ctrl-x + Ctrl-f, Ctrl-g, Ctrl-x + b and select the file&#x27;s buffer in sequence to actually open a file. Any ideas?

                    <span>I have just updated lsp to latest and see that there is now some inline tooltip actions like on vscode for go tests. where if you click it will run your current test.
 It&#x27;s neat but I am happy with another way to run my go tests (gotest.el) and can&#x27;t find how it&#x27;s called from where the actions come from (gopls i guess?) and how to disable it ?

                    <span>Does anyone here use emacs + notmuch for email?I have it configured to receive emails from multiple accounts. It works well, is very confortable for reading mail!
 My problem: for the life of me, I cannot find a way to specify the sender-email. All my mails always send with the default mail account. Is there a way to tell notmuch to send with another email?
 I should specify: using the terminal, sending mail with msmtp/sendmail works well with multiple accounts. The problem is with emacs itself not using it correctly... Or something?
 If you use this setup, how do you do specify the account you want to use to send the mail? Is there a configuration that makes this work?
 (I tried just editing the field in the compose window, but that doesn&#x27;t work)
 Don&#x27;t know where else to ask, seems like a good place. Couldn&#x27;t find any good resource online.

                    <span>First I tried generating a LALR(1) parser via Wisent parser generator but it lacks support for some of the features of the PHP grammar so then I started reading books about parsing and constructed a parser-generator library for Emacs. I used this to automatically parse the official PHP YACC grammar and convert into into a format supported by my parser-generator library and export a Canonical LR(1) Parser in Emacs-Lisp for phps-mode.
 In the future I have planned to use this parser to build semantic data, bookkeeping of symbols and build the imenu index. It would be pretty easy to use the parser to transpile PHP to almost anything. My major-mode is in GNU ELPA

                    <span>I&#x27;m happy to announce that a new release of data-interval-2.1.1 is available. Here are key features, distinguishing it from other interval libraries:
  
Both open and closed, finite and infinite intervals.
 Full hierarchy of numerical instances up to Floating.
 instance Storable for unboxed vectors of intervals.
 Allen&#x27;s interval algebra.
 Sets of intervals with numeric instances.
 Both strict and lazy maps from intervals to values.

                    <span>Hi! I&#x27;m trying to learn Haskell for web development, and I&#x27;ve decided on IHP (for now, as it is the easiest way to get something working fast). But I am still fairly new to both web development and Haskell as a language, so it&#x27;d be great to have somebody on a similar level of knowledge to talk things through and help each other.
 We would work on a project from scratch (doesn&#x27;t really matter what, it&#x27;s just to practice and learn) for about one or two hours a day until we&#x27;re satisfied with how much we&#x27;ve learned. We can do it in either English or Spanish (my native language)
 So, I&#x27;m sending this to the universe, hoping there&#x27;s someone in a similar position to me... Just write here in the comments or DM me.
 Thanks for reading, and happy hacking!!

                    <span>Hi,
 There is an opening in my team for a software engineer. We are looking for someone who is already comfortable with Haskell, the main language used in my team, but also able to dabble in Go, or Python as needed (other services are written in Go and some tests libraries use Python).
 Please have a look at the job description for more details about the company and the technology: https://boards.greenhouse.io/symbiont/jobs/4134418004. You can apply via the Greenhouse website and send me an email directly if you are interested ([eric.torreborre@symbiont.io](mailto:eric.torreborre@symbiont.io)).
 This position is opened for local (New-York) or remote work, both in the US, Africa and Europe (the team is currently distributed across EU and Africa).
 I happy to answer questions about our business or the particular flavour of Haskell that we are using on the job :-).
 Thanks,
 Eric

                    <span>Does anyone have any estimates, authoritative or otherwise, of how much more concise Haskell is compared to other languages? 
 If we treat this as definitive:
 ​
 https://redmonk.com/dberkholz/2013/03/25/programming-languages-ranked-by-expressiveness/ 
 ​
 Haskell is about 33% more concise than Python, and 85% more concise than C++ / Java. It&#x27;s less concise than Coffeescript by about 22%. However, this resource is sort of obsolete, and SLOC is not necessarily a good metric (it doesn&#x27;t consider how many elements exist on one line).

  [Writing] / | \ [ebooks] [quotes] [essays] 
 I want to have something like
 (add-roam-node-hook &quot;Writing&quot; &quot;1:M&quot; #&#x27;(auto-fill-mode electric-quote-mode zen-mode ...) 
 Basically have the hooks run after nodes that have a backlink to writing. This way I can completely have certain experiences for certain nodes in relation to others.
 ​
 I&#x27;m also thinking of doing a mode just wanted some insight on the easiest path if something exists already

                    <span>This small package essentially provides glue code between org-odt-convert and org-table-convert-region, enabling one to open a spreadsheet file (e.g., xlsx, ods) or a text-delimited file (e.g., csv) in a special buffer, edit it with org-table- and orgtbl- commands, and then save it back to the original file in its original format.
 https://github.com/shankar2k/orgtbl-edit
 I made this package because I often find myself wanting to make small edits to CSV files that would be very convenient to do with org-table- commands (e.g., shift a column left or right), but I don&#x27;t want to deal with the overhead every time of importing the file, converting it to Org, and then exporting back to the same file format.
 Because a picture is worth a thousand words, here is an example XLSX file:
 An example XLSX file.
 And here is the same file when opened in Emacs using orgtbl-edit: 
 https://preview.redd.it/x9w92a5hj6x71.png?width&#x3D;987&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;2635f889459942277cbe6932530b5a9d3d399d89
 One thing to note is that for spreadsheet files, because this currently uses CSV as an intermediate format, when saving back to the original file, all formatting and formulas will be lost. 
 I hope some of you find this useful!

                    <span>PEL 0.4.1 brings better support for Erlang, incorporating features from several packages that support Erlang with or without an active Erlang node or server:
  
Integrated support for ivy-erlang-complete and company-erlang to work on Erlang code without an Erlang node while having full auto-completion and cross-reference navigation across Erlang project and the Erlang library.
 Support for EDTS
 Support for LSP via lsp-mode and erlang-ls
  
PEL attempts to unify the use of several commands. For instance you can use the M-. key for cross-refernce navigation with any of the supported cross reference packages that work with Erlang. You select the package you want to use via customization and that&#x27;s what PEL uses by default, mapping the command to the M-. key. During an editing session you can…</span>

                    <span>I am currently on ChromeOS 96.0.4664.25 (Official Build) beta (64-bit). After the most recent update (to this current version of ChromeOS), my emacs GUI appears garbled. The menus, text, etc. just leaves black marks and fonts appear one over the other!
 However, the emacs in terminal works fine.
 Has anyone using emacs on ChromeOS faced this issue? 
 I am not sure if this is the right place to ask, but I am also not sure if I should be asking this is the chromeOS subreddit.

                    <span>Hi! I recently switched to Embark, Consult, and Vertico. I&#x27;m having a swell time doing noun-verb instead of verb-noun. One thing I missed from my old setup was the ability to recall the last minibuffer I had open, using ivy-resume. Does something like that exist for Embark/Consult/Vertico, maybe as a plugin or something? Thank you!

                    <span>I while back I watched a video in which someone showed how to &#x27;embed&#x27; content from one org file in another, with keeping things in sync. This looked very useful but I can&#x27;t find the package name or video anymore. Does this ring a bell for anyone? I believe the package was quite new.
 Bonus question, I&#x27;m looking to combine a weekly and daily entries automatically. I would like to have a list of todo&#x27;s for the week, defined in my weekly entry, and display those at the top of my dailies automatically (creating the weekly if no exists yet). I don&#x27;t want to use carry over in org-journal as that doesn&#x27;t quite do what I&#x27;d like. I&#x27;m certain this could be achieved somehow 😃

 Hi there,
 I hope that the minibuffer prompts in emacs left bottom corner, such as M-x Find-file, which is produced by Function (minibuffer-prompt) defined in C source code, could be hidden/ disabled/ removed/ deleted.
 I have tried, but failed:
 (add-hook &#x27;minibuffer-setup-hook (lambda() (put &#x27;minibuffer-prompt &#x27;disable t)))
 (add-hook &#x27;minibuffer-setup-hook (lambda() (fmakunbound &#x27;minibuffer-prompt)))
 Could somebody help? : (
 ​
 Update:
 It&#x27;s done! Making selectrum + mini-frame + posframe pops up as company-mode does. Thanks _viz_ !

                    <span>I am trying to move my setup over to lsp-mode. I currently use selectrum and consult&#x27;s recent files command. This produces a list of recent files and a preview of each file. The problem I encounter is that I have a hook to call &quot;lsp-deferred&quot; in python-mode. When I am flicking through my recent files and encounter a python file, lsp mode immediately starts upon me being shown a preview of the file. Is there a way to have lsp start only when the file is actually opened?
 Minimal lsp and python configs are 
 (use-package lsp-mode :commands (lsp lsp-deferred) ) (use-package python :hook (python-mode . lsp-deferred) )

                    <span>I&#x27;m currently learning Haskell, and am looking for an IDE that has features like instant highlighting of errors.
 I&#x27;m trying to write basic functions like get an Integer-list as input and apply some function, nothing complicated. But I fail to find anything usable, that helps me doing this. I just want to instantly know when I write total garbage. For example if my functions have the wrong type, etc.
 I&#x27;m currently trying to tweak atom with ide-haskell, but I only get default syntax highlighting of keywords. When I run ghci my_program.hs I get shitloads of errors because my functions are not even syntactically right. Is it possible to get these errors in the IDE while typing (like in any other language)?
 Is this all that I can get from this plugin, or am I missing something?

 ​
 Gives an answer like this.
 My question is if i could zip the lists of a list, so that i could get [(0,0,0) (1,0,0) (2,0,0)] and so on.

                    <span>Hi,
 I have built a table where some cells are filled via code-blocks that call external scripts.
 Currently I update this table manually, however I would like to automatically update this table (identified by name) whenever I open the file.
 Is this possible?

                    <span>If I have 10 blocking operations and 5 threads, I get that I can only run 5 of those operations at once, and none of my threads are free til the operation they were given completes.
 I also get that if I make those operations non-blocking, I&#x27;m no longer limited in this way: I give an operation to a thread, it kicks it off, and then it&#x27;s free for more work.
 What I don&#x27;t get is how this is so. Is the thread handing the operation off to the os and saying &quot;tell me when it&#x27;s done&quot;? If so, how does the os not get jammed up in the same way as our blocking/5-thread app? It seems like at some point there must be a thing that waits on the operation to complete.
 If it helps, here is an example of contrasting behavior: the first is async and parallel, the second blocking and parallel.

                    <span>Hi ! 
 I&#x27;ve started learning and practicing Scala less than a year ago for my current job, and so far I love it. I learned following the Coursera course from the wonderful Martin Odersky, but I quickly realised that my company was still in the middle of its transition from Java to Scala, with most of our code base looking more like scalaified Java than pure FP Scala like I learned at the beginning.
 I like functional programming, I&#x27;ve liked it from the first moment I learned common Lisp even thou the language felt antiquated, and, well, I wouldn&#x27;t say I cried, but I was somewhat moved by the....purety ? Mathematicality ? of scala ( don&#x27;t judge, IK my sense of esthetic is somewhat weird ). 
 Things seem to be somewhat moving in this direction at work, and I wanted to accompany this, and satisfy my own curiosity, by learning the move fp-extremist stuff I could find in Scala. 
 I could easily find resources on cats and the rest of the typelevel ecosystem, but then I discovered ZIO and that became my latest obsession. I like the project, I like how ZIO code looks and what the whole obsessive typing of everything thingy brings to me as a Dev.
 And then I tried to learn Zio 2.0 ( because why start with the old one when the next one is almost there ? ) but I have a hard time finding learning resources.
 Which bring me to my question ( thanks for reading my life story if you did ) : is the Zionomicon, and Zio in general, worth the time and money I would invest ?
 
 TLDR : weirdo ranting on his new fp zealotry wants to know if paying 50+ bucks for the Zionomicon is worth it

                    <span>I just can&#x27;t make sens of org-mode&#x27;s indentation when using lists (ordered and unordered). Why does it creates an indented subitem everytime I press return?

                    <span>Apologies if this doesn&#x27;t make sense, but I&#x27;m struggling to find out how to express this question.
 Someone recently submitted a post or a comment about how they use use-package to configure all the packages they&#x27;ve installed in their init.el. I&#x27;m not sure exactly what I mean by all packages, I think I mean packages/settings that weren&#x27;t installed using use-package ensure, or straight inside the use-package configuration, or maybe even that the packages weren&#x27;t installed via MELPA, but by cloning a git repository. 
 In any case there was a comment that (briefly) explained how to configure the package setup and behavior using a use-package configuration; I thought I&#x27;d saved it but didn&#x27;t, now I can&#x27;t seem to find it. If anyone has any idea what I&#x27;m going on about, please let me know!
 EDIT: I believe what I was looking for was use-package emacs and storing Emacs settings like (setq inhibit-startup-screen t) there, as raised in this post, found by u/graduale and u/scbagley. From other comments, it sounds like you can also configure built-in packages like dired using use-package as well, so that&#x27;s helpful. If you have any further thoughts on this, please feel free to add them!

 Enjoy!
 NB: Thanks to me being on Org HEAD some recent changes with org-element caching have temporarily broken RSS publishing

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been doing a lot of video editing and it occurs to me that there is very little about this process which could not be done better with text/code versus the default method of graphical editing in every package I&#x27;ve been able to find.
 Has anyone done any text-based video editing/composition with Emacs? Either with elisp packages used to stitch the content together or with an Emacs mode for editing some sort of text-based markup that is fed to OSS libraries like gstreamer etc?

                    <span>AFAIU it should be possible to set things up such that the interactions with gpg-agent takes place in the emacs minibuffer. From what I&#x27;ve found it should be enough to do the following:
  
add allow-loopback-entry to ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf (then run gpgconf --reload gpg-agent)
 make sure that epg-pinentry-mode is set to &#x27;loopback in emacs
  
however, after doing that I still see that
  
when running emacs in X what pops up is pinentry-gtk-2, and
 when running emacs in a console what pops up is pinentry-curses
  
Clearly I&#x27;m missing something, but what?

                    <span>How to preview file contents like with ranger?
 I have browsed the dired chapter on emacs manual, but have not found how to do something very simple: preview file contents like with ranger. With ranger I can move up or down over a list of files with arrows, and I can preview their contents at the side, regardless of the content being simple text, image, pdf, etc. How can I do the same with emacs? I saw a video of someone doing that with Doom Emacs, however I am not keen on using Doom or similar packages, I prefer to have a simple init.el that I can understand.

                    <span>I had this problem:
 https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/qcj33a/problem_and_workaround_with_orgmode_function/
 So I moved the loading of org into my init.el file, prior to the tangle, which seems to work, but has left me with partial syntax highlighting, white text, no colours or org bullets.
 Doesn&#x27;t happen every time, tried font-lock studio, but I don&#x27;t get it! Toggling global-font-lock-mode off/on fixes.
 Any ideas? Will grab a screenshot when it happens next.

                    <span>I see doom already have zen,minimap, but i see sublimity(https://github.com/zk-phi/sublimity) which is more interesting. Currently that minimap just sucks in terms of ui. 
 How can i install it on doom emacs ?

                    <span>I&#x27;m happy to announce my first library on Hackage, jordan. Jordan provides abstract and inspectable JSON parsing and serialization, using the Applicative (for parsing) and Divisible (for serializing) typeclasses.
 Jordan has you define ToJSON and FromJSON classes in terms of instructions, such as &quot;serialize a string&quot; or &quot;parse an object with these fields&quot;. These instructions are then evaluated by various interpreters, which actually do the work of parsing or serializing. This has a few benefits:
  
Intermediate structures are entirely avoided: there is no Map.Map Text JSONValue anywhere in the library, and JSON fields are directly parsed using permutation parsers. This also means that we can always serialize a JSON directly to a bytestring, avoiding the need for anything like toEncoding from Aeson
 Since JSON interaction is kept abstract, you can generate documentation for parsers and serializers, directly from their definitions. This is provided in jordan-openapi.
 This library provides a fun excuse to use contravariant functors, so you can feel like a super small functional programmer
  
The github page for this project is located here. While I&#x27;m not gunning to replace Aeson or anything, I would really appreciate any feedback anybody has to offer!

I want to do this automatically via template haskell or generics, so that if a type is provided by an external library, changes in the library do not require manual changes to the consuming code.
 My specific use case is that I want to add all the fields from a settings object in an external library as command line options in addition to the regular command line options of the program, and I&#x27;d like to not have to manually change anything if a new version of the library adds or removes fields.

                    <span>When does static pointers change ? Currently I believe the following is true (correct me If I am wrong)
  
Will not change if I just recompile the code ? 
 Will not change if I recompile the code on a different architecture 
  Static pointers are module local, i.e. Say I have module M and say sptr :: StaticPtr Int is a pointer to an element in M, then sptr does not change if I update the source code of M&#x27;
  
​
 Is it also true that if sptr is the static pointer of created in module M and I add some unrelated entries in M (the same module) the static pointer sptr does not change ?

 Is it possible to retrieve all the contents of &quot;Sphere&quot;?
 I am trying to retrieve the contents through an external function which I make like this:
 SphereData :: obj -&gt; [] SphereData (...) 
 I am pretty new to Haskell and have been looking around on the internet for a solution, but none have had the specific &quot;problem&quot; that I have.
 ​
 I could maybe use pattern matching. In my head this is the best bet I have, but that won&#x27;t work, because &quot;obj&quot; is given and based on the pattern match either an Int or String is returned. In no way or shape can I return all the &quot;properties&quot; of this Set.
 ​
 Any ideas, tips, tricks?

                    <span>Hi again,
 Given the input [(GameState, (Int, Int))], I am trying to sort the whole tuple by the first Int so that it the whole tuple will be sorted in a list of ascending first Int order. I saw a stack stack exchange post describing how to do it with (Int, Int), specifically:
 mySort :: Ord a &#x3D;&gt; [(a, b)] -&gt; [(a, b)] mySort &#x3D; sortBy (compare &#x60;on&#x60; fst) 
 but I am not sure how to do it with [(GameState, (Int, Int))].
 I&#x27;ve attempted sortBy and sortOn, but I failed.
 Once again, thanks in advance.

                    <span>TL;DR: Is it possible to use the contravariant functor hierarchy to merge arbitrary keys into Morton order, without having things explode or be lawless?
 Morton Ordering
 If you have multidimensional data and interleave the binary representation of each key, you get a neat space-filling curve called a z-order curve. Ed wrote a series about using them to do sparse matrix multiplication.
 I&#x27;ve also seen them used when you need to crunch multidimensional keys into a single dimension e.g., when you need to be able to use a DynamoDB sort key to search across multiple dimensions.
 Contravariant Tricks
 In Ed&#x27;s discrimination library (see also: the talk Discrimination is Wrong: Improving Productivity), he uses the contravariant hierarchy to sort all kinds of things really quickly. Many instances …</span>

                    <span>EDIT: Problem Solved
 I was watching this great talk on Reproducible Research by Thibault Lestang, demonstrating the power of Org Babel. His org file is here:
 https://github.com/tlestang/org-mode-reproducible-research/blob/main/org-mode-examples/RR.org
 The initial C++ code block works great to produce the array initial_data, but the subsequent python code block to plot the array doesn&#x27;t work:
 #+header: :var timeseries&#x3D;initial_data :results file :dir &quot;./figures/&quot; #+begin_src python import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt timeseries &#x3D; np.array(timeseries) plt.plot(timeseries[:,0], timeseries[:,1]) plt.savefig(&quot;timeseries_vis.png&quot;) return &quot;timeseries_vis.png&quot; #+end_src #+RESULTS: [[file:figures/timeseries_vis.png]] 
 If I run the above I get: 
 #+RESULTS: file:figures 
 and no actual png output file is produced. If I run the block in :session mode that gives me IndentationError: Unexpected Indent. If I remove the indents and re-run I get SyntaxError: return outside function. I can get rid of this error by re-writing it as a function, and it then works. But I&#x27;d really like to know what is wrong with the original code, and how can I run it without :session? 
 Many thanks!

Because it’s a composed content type, the server should receive payload in json format and should respond in json format too but with content-type: vdn.example.com.v1+json Thanks

                    <span>For comparison: Akka actors can manage mutable state without thread-safety concerns, since each actor will only only process one message at a time.
 Taking the principle to fibers, is there any thread-safety or practical problems with using mutable state inside fiber (think vars), as long as the state is not share with other fibers? I&#x27;m not talking about Refs, which use AtomicReferences under the hood. I&#x27;m talking about closing directly over mutable state, and reading and writing to it as required on a per-fiber basis.
 An example of this may be the re-use of buffer: Array[Byte] in this part of the Cats Effect tutorial.

                    <span>I&#x27;m working on Scala library that implements ordered sets and maps. We all familiar with these mathematical concepts and widely use them in daily life. There is a lot of examples in our systems: activities are related to ranges of dates and time in job planning, filters with intervals in online shop, etc. Scala&#x27;s standard library provides the great collections framework. But it implements ordinary sets and maps, for ordered ones there is no such thing (upd: i&#x27;m sorry for some confusion with terminology, please see comment).
 Here is the first post describing some basic ideas https://ordset.blogspot.com/
 Project is now about 33k lines and is already somewhat useful. However, there is still a lot of work to make it really powerful. Any feedback is very welcome!

                    <span>Hi Zettelnauts,
now that a major leap forward (for me) is done with the second edition (the beta phase in German begins soon and after that I will attack the English translation), I am turning my eyes on more specialised applications.
The development of the second books so far was driven by beginning with Luhmann as the core idea and unfold it with the help of philosophy of science. So, I deem the foundation to be layed out.
The next two branches that start to grow (in my Zettelkasten first) are:
Specialised applications of the Zettelkasten
Thinking tools that work within the frame work of the Zettelkasten Method. Cognitive Mapping is an example. (Big shoutout to u/thomasteepe for the term Integrated Thinking Environment (originally Integrated Thought Development Environment))
The first aspect is now what I am preparing in my Zettelkasten. So, I want to ask you if I forgot an important user case. In my Zettelkasten, I have the following:
Students
Teachers (Mostly geared towards the German Schools System at the moment)
Bloggers
Visual Artists
Fiction Writers
Non-Fiction Writers
Lawers and judges
Theologicans (and studying the bible)
Scientists
Humanities
Non-Scientists (~private use like dog training, cooking, hobbies, child upbringing etc.)
Anything missing?
Live long and prosper

 One noob question, I am trying to sent emails with emacs but it save the messages in the &quot;sent&quot; folder, whereas I would like to send them in the &quot;Elementos Enviados&quot; folder but I don&#x27;t manage to do it because the space.
 I tried with Elementos%20Enviados but it is not use. I am using emacs 27.2 and offlineimap to synchronize my email locally

                    <span>Sometimes I narrow my shell buffer so that it shows only a few commands and their output. However, as soon as I type another command, the buffer is widened again. Is there some way to turn this behavior off? I&#x27;ve studied comint.el.gz and haven&#x27;t found a use of widen outside of save-restriction.
 Thanks.

                    <span>I am experimenting with writing some scripts in Emacs
 eg emacs -nw -Q -l ~/emacs/scripts/funcslib.el --eval&#x3D;&#x27;(somefunc &quot;param&quot; 5)&#x27;
 Does Emacs have some function for printing out the maximum memory used during its invocation?
 From the command line command with time gives me the time used even if it is not so precise.
 Do Unices have some similar utility for finding the maximum memory usage of any script at all?

                    <span>i am trying to start using emacs for a while now. However, i get stuck with several things to choose from. I have also heard it is too tough to get in into your muscle memory and such... Is it worth learning?? and can anyone suggest how i should get started... P.S.: i need to use emacs for programming purposes.

                    <span>On my Mac machine (but not on my Linux ones) I get the following information concerning tabs, I reckon:
 ​
 tabs
 I don&#x27;t understand where this came from, nor what this numbers mean. And how can I get rid of them?
 I&#x27;m on Emacs 27.2. I also have Centaur Tabs mode installed, but even if disabled I get the same.

                    <span>Okay, I&#x27;m not a programmer; even e-lisp boggles and confuses me.
 That said, I would really really like a way to integrate org-mode functionality on my Nextcloud server. So I was wondering if it&#x27;s possible to compile emacs to WASM.
 The biggest problem I foresee, as far as usability goes, is that the browser would swallow/usurp/hijack many of the default emacs key chords. For evil users, this is not such a problem, :-) , but not everyone is evil.

                    <span>Hi guys, I recently migrated to emacs and I&#x27;m looking to do more without leaving the editor. EXWM seems like something that gets me closer to that. Only issue is that I don&#x27;t think it can be used on windows. It&#x27;ll be great to open a media player like vlc, a browser (sometimes eww isn&#x27;t enough), watch youtube... etc from emacs. I&#x27;d like to know if there are independent solutions to these or a package that can do multiple. Any help is appreciated. Thanks

                    <span>I encounter some font spacing problems on macOS when I switch my font from time to time: especially when the default font :weight &#x27;light is used, something about bold constructs throws whitespace off, of all things -- the space character is rendered a bit too wide, then.
 (defun ct/use-face (font weight height) (let ((the-font (format &quot;%s-%d:%s&quot; font height weight))) (message the-font) (setq default-frame-alist (append (list &#x60;(font . ,the-font) &#x27;(min-height . 1) &#x27;(height . 45) &#x27;(min-width . 1) &#x27;(width . 101) &#x27;(vertical-scroll-bars . nil) &#x27;(internal-border-width . 24) ;; frame padding around the text &#x27;(left-fringe . 0) &#x27;(right-fringe . 0) &#x27;(tool-bar-lines . 0))))) (set-face-attribute &#x27;default nil :font font :height (* height 10) :weight weight) (set-face-attribute &#x27;fixed-pitch nil :font font :height (* height 10) :weight weight)) (defun ct/use-medium-face () &quot;Use Roboto Medium 18pt, for smaller screens&quot; (interactive) (ct/use-face &quot;Roboto Mono&quot; &#x27;medium 18) (setq-default line-spacing .2)) (defun ct/use-regular-face () &quot;Use Roboto Light 22pt, for larger screens.&quot; (interactive) (ct/use-face &quot;Roboto Mono&quot; &#x27;light 22) (setq-default line-spacing .3)) 
 I would love to replace this manual font switching, which might be broken, with something more robust that ideally adjusts to the frame size.
 Use case
 I&#x27;m switching from my MacBook&#x27;s 13&quot; Retina display on the go to a 1440p ultra-wide at my desk, and enjoy different font settings for each. The desk&#x27;s monitor is further away from my face and I use the 22pt font setting for most of the time there. That&#x27;s way too big for the built-in laptop screen, though, so I use the 18pt font variant there.
 Do you know of any well-tested package that supports changing font sizes (and weights) to make the best use of a frame&#x27;s size given the circumstances?

                    <span>Emacs has cooperative threading which AFAIK does not prevent a badly behaving thread locking up the UI. Since real multithreading is hard to add to Emacs could forking support alleviate this? 
 So unlike emacs-async which starts with a fresh emacs, you could create from lisp a copy of the current process with all the settings, variables, etc. being the same, so, for example, a lisp autocompletion library could use fork to spin up an other process and calculate the possible completions of the current position, returning these asynchronously to the parent process thereby not interfering with UI updates.
 I know creating processes is more costly than creating threads, but with today&#x27;s computers it may be still fast enough to produce asynchronous results for completion, etc. without blocking the UI thread.
 Forking is supported by all major OSs, so could this be a good enough solution for async processing?

 I have come across these two that always come recommended but i am not sure which one to get (if i could i would get both)! I came down to these two since these books are pretty recent!
 In your opinion which of the two would you recommend me provided i have no experience in programming?

                    <span>So, I was trying to compile GHC 8.6.5, with all dependencies installed and passing flag --enable-unregisterised to configure. I chose BuildFlavour &#x3D; quick and then started make. After a few minutes, compilation halts with the following error message:
  compiler/stage1/build/Parser.hs:1473:48: error: Not in scope: type variable ‘a’ | 1473 | newtype HappyWrap209 &#x3D; HappyWrap209 (([Located a],Bool)) | ^ 
 I can&#x27;t find this specific message anywhere, including the troubleshooting guide. The specific file seems to be automatically generated by Happy (version 1.19.11), using ./compiler/parser/Parser.y. Anyone knows how I could keep compilation going?

                    <span>Lenses (or equivalent) use to be all the rage and for good reasons. It&#x27;s really clever and its power is beyond limits. However, the name conflict between lense and traditional field selectors makes it a bit awkward to use : you either go full lenses or at all. Mix and match doesn&#x27;t really work.
 Also having to rely on TH induces some problems, and type errors can get overly complicated.
 I basically given up on them (the only real use being nested update which are kind of rare, and should be solved soon within GHC).

Oh my! It all blows up in our face! If there’s no monster, it doesn’t have 
 a head. When using head, tail, last and init, be careful not to use themempty lists. This error cannot be caught at compile time so it’s always good 
 practice to take precautions against accidentally telling Haskell to give you 
 some elements from an empty list.
  
In Python I would do something like:
 if len(arr) &gt;&#x3D; 1: return arr[0] else: doSomethingOtherThanReturnHead 
 How do you avoid this error in Haskell?

                    <span>So I recently posted a question to here and everyone who responded was very helpful. I&#x27;ve used emacs for 20 years but never managed to discover org mode until a month ago. Ever since then I&#x27;ve been reading everything I can get my hands on to better master this tool. I&#x27;ve found a couple of tutorials, guides, docs, and walk throughs but to a person new to all this, it can be a bit overwhelming. So, to help the next new guy who comes here I&#x27;m posting my org configuration complete with comments. 
 I doubt most people will use org anything like what I need to use it for, however this configuration shows you how to configure a lo of things that might not immediately be obvious and will hopefully serve as a good foundation for building your own work flow.

                    <span>I am still evaluating the idea but the goal is to enjoy flutter cross platform UIs with the purity and clarity of ps for my next startup beginning from January. Dart is not terrible, but I always miss the ML types and abstractions, and very specially the strict purity.
 I see there are many backends out there, and dart supports many purescript data types (with some lack). Also not sure how to deal with the mutable aspects of dart in the purescript side.
 If this is a feasible work to do under two months I would give it a try and ask for some help in order to build a robust open source backend with the goal of becoming a real ASAP.
 Is there any information relative to making new backends including standardized tests? Is there anyone interested willing to contribute?

                    <span>I have a function that has received :override advice twice:
 Signature (completing-read-multiple PROMPT TABLE &amp;optional PREDICATE REQUIRE-MATCH INITIAL-INPUT HIST DEF INHERIT-INPUT-METHOD) Documentation This function has :override advice: consult-completing-read-multiple. This function has :override advice: selectrum-completing-read-multiple. Read multiple strings in the minibuffer, with completion. The arguments are the same as those of completing-read. [.etc.] 
 I know that the &quot;outermost&quot; :override wins over the &quot;innermost&quot;, and if they are at the same depth then the last one to be added wins. But how I can see what depth they have and in what order they were added?
 Based on my init.el and package sources I suspect that in my case they are at the same level and the consult-* function was provided as advice second. But how can I be sure? I couldn&#x27;t find a way to inspect the details of a function&#x27;s advice with a look through the elisp manual.

                    <span>Interactive Emacs commands use various minibuffer histories and I often want to reuse a history item of a previous command which uses an other minibuffer history. In this case I restart that command, find the history item, copy it, cancel the command, start the command I want and paste the history item into it.
 This is cumbersome, so I created this small code which keeps track of commands&#x27; history usage, and it can show the recent history items of the recent commands for quick selection.
 Just load it, use Emacs for a bit, so it can track some minibuffer input usage and then invoke the command otherhistory-choose-from-other-history to quickly recall and insert a recent history item of a recent command.
 ;; -*- lexical-binding: t -*- (setq otherhistory-recent-history-variables &#x27;(minibuffer-history)) (advice-add &#x27;exit-minibuffer :before &#x27;otherhistory-store-history-variable) (defun otherhistory-store-history-variable () (setq otherhistory-recent-history-variables (remove minibuffer-history-variable otherhistory-recent-history-variables)) (push minibuffer-history-variable otherhistory-recent-history-variables)) (defun otherhistory-choose-from-other-history () (interactive) (let ((items (apply &#x27;append (mapcar (lambda (history-var) (if (boundp history-var) (let ((history (symbol-value history-var))) (butlast history (- (length history) 5))))) otherhistory-recent-history-variables)))) (setq items (butlast items (- (length items) (- ?z ?a)))) (insert (let ((char (- ?a 1)) chars (max-mini-window-height 1.0)) (nth (- (read-char-choice (concat (mapconcat (lambda (item) (push (incf char) chars) (format &quot; %c: %s&quot; char item)) items &quot;\n&quot;) &quot; &quot;) chars) ?a) items)) (message &quot;&quot;))))

                    <span>I just intalled emacs on a new machine and got a new error that I have not seen before (tl;dr, I fixed the error, am documenting the fix and asking if anyone has any ideas why the fix was needed).
 ​
 When trying to open org-agenda
 org-element-cache-map: Symbol’s function definition is void: native-comp-available-p
 ​
 I fixed this by adding
 (defun native-comp-available-p () nil)
 to my org configuration (just making sure this function is avaialble before calling org-agenda. (I am not using native-comp - still using Emacs 27.2)
 ​
 I can&#x27;t seem to track down where this function should be defined. Is there something I should have installed but missed? I was surprised by this error.
 ​
 Anyways hope this helps someone else and if you have any ideas as to where this error originated I would love to know.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve made a socket daemon of emacs , going through the guide
 https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Emacs-Server.html , in which emacs daemon runs as soon i startup systemd.
 But i&#x27;ve found that just running &quot;emacs&quot; doesnt connect with that server, we have to put
 &quot;emacsclient -nw&quot; or &quot;emacsclient --create-frame&quot; for gui, in order to have as many as client but one server. i put in gnome, &quot;emacs.desktop&quot; to run that emacsclient gui. but it takes &quot;2 seconds to load&quot; , while normal emacs command loads in 0.6 second. with in that, It automatically closes when i dont touch it . I also tried to add 8.8.8.8 &quot;emacs&quot; on /etc/hosts but it doesnt works. 
 I think dont understand , about client and server on emacs, which is client or which is server and what should i put in order to run emacs client in that server. 
 I&#x27;ve taken reference to make .desktop put &quot;emacsclient --create-frame&quot; and run from 
 https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/31704/run-emacs-gui-from-emacsclient
 ​
 anybody please guide me, 
 I&#x27;m on debian, emacs 29, doom emacs .
 Thank you please

                    <span>Is there a way to make a window fixed so that if/when I do ctrl-x-1 it stays on the screen? I use a version of Speedbar that does this but would like an org-mode window that stays open all the time.
 Thanks.

                    <span>Basically what the title says. 
 I&#x27;ve been using org-tree-slide, which works fine for simple presentations, but I&#x27;m looking for something slightly more elaborate while still working inside emacs (i.e. no org-reveal or beamer). Something that offers a few presentation commodities like simple animations and a little more control over slide appearance. 
 Is there such a package?
 ps: I&#x27;ve looked into org-present, but it seems to be even more bare-bones than org-tree-slide.

                    <span>Generators in Haskell can either take the form of lazy lists or some generator library.
 Lazy lists are wonderful to work with, but may be hard to create for some sequences (such as those which require the use of mutable state to generate efficiently).
 Various generator libraries make it easier to generate such sequences, but the trade-off is that using them is typically more cumbersome. 
 Theoretically, one would be able to get the &quot;best of both worlds&quot; by converting a generator to a lazy list. Is there a good way to do so in Haskell? If so, what is it?

                    <span>Hello,
 I&#x27;m trying to automate grading of Haskell assignments. I don&#x27;t know whether the students have defined all of the functions I need to test. Thus, I&#x27;d like to run something
 ghci&gt; try (map foo [1,2,3])
 rather than manually comb through submissions like
 ghci&gt; map foo [1,2,3]
 :1:5: error:
 Variable not in scope: foo :: Integer -&gt; b
 I know shell/bash well enough to do this there, but it would be nice to be able to do it in Haskell. Is it possible?
 ​
 (edit to note that I&#x27;m not fluent in Haskell myself (I&#x27;m trying to just keep ahead of the students), and have been using Haskell From First Principles as a guide).

                    <span>I started reading about optics in haskell, and was wondering if any of the haskell optics libraries supports the concepts of alignment from the view update literature?
 Here is an example of what I want to do:
 Source (a): [ { name: &quot;Patrick&quot;, age: 40, job: &quot;Programmer&quot; }, { name: &quot;Jonathan&quot;, age 30, job: &quot;Teacher&quot; }, { name: &quot;George&quot;, age: 20, job: &quot;Office worker&quot; } ] Target (b): [ { name: &quot;Bob&quot;, job: &quot;Policeman&quot; },//person added { name: &quot;George&quot;, job: &quot;Office worker&quot; }//Order changed, is now before Patrick { name: &quot;Patrick&quot;, job: &quot;Haskell Programmer&quot; }//job changed //Jonathan removed ] Expected result (a): [ { name: &quot;Bob&quot;, age: null, job: &quot;Policeman&quot; },//person added with default age { name: &quot;George&quot;, age: 20, job: &quot;Office worker&quot; }, { name: &quot;Patrick&quot;, age: 40, job: &quot;Haskell Programmer&quot; }//Job updated //Jonathan removed ] data Lens a b &#x3D; Lens { get:: a -&gt; b, put:: b -&gt; a -&gt; a } 
 How can I write the &quot;put&quot; function that takes &quot;Source&quot; and &quot;Target&quot; and returns &quot;Expected result&quot;? The put function must align the persons by name (key based alignment).

                    <span>Hi all, I&#x27;m loving Org Mode, but every time I edit an org document, I get conflicted between editing for the org-file and latex output. In particular when it comes to newlines. I frequently use \\ when I want to start a newline in my LaTeX output, but don&#x27;t want extra spacing. Is there a way to hide this symbol in org-mode? I find it visually quite distracting. I have hide-emphasis-markers activated, but this doesn&#x27;t affect the \\ symbol. Any way to hide \\? 
 Many thanks!

                    <span>Hello, some quick background on me:
  
I am trying to get into Scala as I wish to work with Spark. I have good scripting knowledge in a few high-level languages (PowerShell mainly, plus Python and general Bash/awk scripting), and I&#x27;d like to break into a more rigorous programming paradigm. Another potential plus is that my company product is written in Java. I don&#x27;t implement any code, but I do handle its technical implementation and design augmentations for customers. I may find an opportunity to leverage Scala in the JVM for some side projects to help me practice. 
 At any rate, my motivation for learning Scala is that it seems well-aligned with my goals and circumstances for entering a more programmatic world.
  
Books
 After looking around, I&#x27;ve picked out 3 books:
  
Programming in Scala Fifth Edition
 
Hands-on Scala Programming: Learn Scala in a Practical, Project-Based Way 
 
Programming Scala: Scalability &#x3D; Functional Programming + Objects
 
 I saw a lot of good things about Programming in Scala Fourth Edition, and being that it&#x27;s written by Martin Odersky, it seems like a solid choice. However, the Fifth Edition claims to have been overhauled for Scala 3, and it&#x27;s too new for me to find any reviews on how this overhauled edition has turned out.
 Hands-on Scala Programming has good reviews and seems like it might be oriented toward a beginner specifically with its &quot;project-based&quot; approach. However being published in 2020, I&#x27;d expect it to have been written for Scala 2. I figured if I am jumping into Scala, I should go for a Scala 3 book.
 The book by Dean Wampler seems like a solid book, but I can&#x27;t find much info on it in terms of reviews.
 Does anyone have experience with any of these books and could provide their 2 cents on it?
 Thank you!

                    <span>Beside the core Scala language what Scala frameworks or libraries are usually used by the Scala experts? I hear some names like ZIO, metals, Cats effect etc but its a kind of confusing to me, so I’m looking for a clear learning path along with best resources to learn it from.
 Thanks

                    <span>Sometimes I miss the simple 10p and similar 15d kinds of command combos of vim in emacs. Is there any emacsy command for those or is the recommended way is simply to use vile mode for such situations? (I think there is something grammatically wrong with the double &#x27;is&#x27; in the previous sentence, but I don&#x27;t know the correct way). I do use doom emacs on my chromebook (so no issues with this there) but on my other systems, I simply use vanilla emacs.

                    <span>I haven&#x27;t seen this error reported anywhere so I thought I&#x27;d check if anyone else is seeing it. I have all my packages installed via straight.el and use-package, and after a pull of all packages, org-agenda fails to load with:
 org-agenda-skip: Symbol’s function definition is void: org-in-archived-heading-p
 I tried clearing my straight cache and pulling a few more times, nothing seems to fix it. Looking at the elisp for org, the function org-in-archived-heading-p seems like its defined in org.el, so I&#x27;m confused as to why the symbol isn&#x27;t being found.
 Has anyone else seen something like this?

                    <span>Hello there! I&#x27;m using doom emacs and working in a web app, sometimes (as all devs) I write some code with prettier/eslint warnings, is there some function or something to apply the suggested fixes? (with out applying it to the whole buffer just that line)
 a silly example could be a missing return at the end of the line

                    <span>Windows decided to restart while I was asleep last night, so of course I didn&#x27;t have a chance to save and close Emacs.
 However, when I went to &#x27;recover session&#x27;, it doesn&#x27;t seem to be possible to get back to where I was.
  
the relevant .saves-[etc]~ file seems to only list unsaved files, so apparently if there were things I had had open but had saved they don&#x27;t appear. Non-file buffers also don&#x27;t seem to be listed.
 when i attempt to recover the session, it asks if I want to recover one of the six files listed, then seems to quit. Even when I press ! which the help tells me will &#x27;recover all remaining files&#x27;, it only reopens the one.
  
​
 I&#x27;m starting to accept the idea that I won&#x27;t be able to get back to where I was last night, but is there a way to set up emacs so that it saves all aspects of a session, so that next time I can actually recover and get back all my frames, windows, tabs, and buffers after a forced (or even voluntary...) shutdown, not just a single unsaved file?
 And (Or?) how do I get it to at least recover the other files M-x recover session knows about but doesn&#x27;t seem to be reaching?

                    <span>I only use non-Emacs software for two things. Web browsing and calendars. In my effort to never exit Emacs (I spend way too much perfecting it to spend time on other apps), I want to tackle calendars next.
 I currently use Google&#x27;s calendar. I have been looking for ways to use Emacs&#x27; calendar but I couldn&#x27;t find solutions that check all my boxes:
  
Ability to subscribe to multiple calenders (via ics urls).
 Ability to have multiple calenders (like in Google, for example, I have one for work and one for personal events).
 Ability to create, delete and edit events.
 Ability to sync calendars with Google calendars (and Microsoft calendars if possible), so I can check events on my phone.
  
I imagine that these requirements are shared by others, so there must be a way to satisfy all of them. I just couldn&#x27;t find it.
 Does anyone have a working setup for calendars that they can share?
 Thanks.

                    <span>Hi.
 It starts with loading plugins. I use a dashboard where it shows how long plugins take to load. On previous macOS is always was ~1.3 seconds. Now it&#x27;s ~3 seconds. Basically all operations take much longer. Magit is close to unusable.
 Is anyone also experiencing this?

 Trying gpg --homedir ~/.emacs.d/elpa/gnupg --receive-keys 066DAFCB81E42C40 as one answer from SO suggested does not work.

                    <span>I have a task that I&#x27;ve done using some Emacs and some command line tools (sort and cut), but it&#x27;s slow and error prone and I reckon I could do it all in Emacs, but I don&#x27;t quite know how.
 ​
 Please help me learn how to write some elisp to solve this...
 ​
 My problem:
  
I want to sort lines in a file based on a date string in the line itself.
 For simplicity: 
 There are two types of lines, but the structure is consistent within a type.
 type A might be: INSERT INTO tableA VALUES (something, something, &#x27;2021-11-11 11:11:11.111+00&#x27;, something);
 type B might be: INSERT INTO tableB VALUES (something, &#x27;1999-12-31 01:01:01.001+00&#x27;, something, &#x27;2021-11-11 22:22:22.222+00&#x27;, something, something);
 I want the second date string in type B
 
 So based on seeing uniqueA or uniqueB in the string I know where(ish) the date string is
 Naturally, each line has different data for the something values and different date-time strings.
 There is a chance that the &quot;line&quot; may actually be broken with new-lines in the text, so what I know is that it starts with INSERT INTO and ends with );\n
  
​
 What I&#x27;ve done
  
Emacs: Define keyboard macro to search for tableA, then isearch-regex-forward for ..-..- to get my date string, copy that string, move to the start of the line, paste with a following space. C-u to apply lots of times, iterate until I have done all the lines
 Emacs: Define keyboard macro to search for tableB, then blah-blah-blah paste date at start of line with a following space. C-u to apply lots of times, iterate until I&#x27;ve done all the lines
 Jump back to my shell. sort the file, cut -f3- -d&#x27; &#x27; the file and then I have my sorted file.
  
(I tried working out how to do the Emacs part in sed, but failed to see a useful example online...)
 ​
 This approach is complicated and error prone and not very reproducible.
 How would you go about it in Emacs?

                    <span>Hey everyone,
 cgroup-rts-threads is a new library that solves a problem we experienced while running our haskell code in docker containers.
 In short, the GHC RTS -N flag will happily spawn threads exceeding a container&#x27;s configured cpu limit, leading to drastically reduced performance.
 See the package README for details.
  
We&#x27;d be happy to accept contributions, including one to reduce the dependency footprint -- this code was previously part of a bigger codebase.
  
Somewhat relatedly, a quick plug: we&#x27;re actively hiring for a haskeller to join our team (remote - US/Canada/Argentina) to work on our dependency analysis tool and associated backend components.
 This is the first package we&#x27;ve published, and we&#x27;d love to contribute some more. Come help us do that!

                    <span>Hi there, 
 lately I&#x27;m learning Haskell and now I&#x27;m stuck at polymorphism. Are there any good recourses out there where I can read about that?
 I would need polymorphism for functions and datatypes.

                    <span>MotoRefi is hiring for a DevOps engineer. However, we are also really interested in finding someone with experience in Haskell and related tooling as well as Kubernetes to support the Insurance team. This role could be 25% Haskell with a focus on developer experience and tooling and 75% DevOps. 
 ​
 We have a JD here: https://boards.greenhouse.io/motorefi/jobs/4741981003
 We are also seeking Senior Software Engineers here: https://boards.greenhouse.io/motorefi/jobs/4741865003
 ​
 For both of those positions if you do get in contact with recruiting make sure to reference the Insurance team (that&#x27;s the team that uses Haskell). These positions can be remote, or in the DC, Austin, or Denver offices.

                    <span>Hello,
 does anyone know of an open source project/web app/library, written in Haskell, that makes terminal interface accessible via browser?
 An example of what I&#x27;d like to achieve:
 Start R repl process withing a docker container on the backend (e.g. &#x60;docker run -it --rm rocker/r-base&#x60;) and allow user to interact with it using terminal-like interface from their browser (with stuff like TAB completion working etc.)
 It seems that xterm.js is a popular choice to implement the client side of such a thing,
 but I&#x27;m looking for some inspiration of how a backend of such an application could be implemented in Haskell.
 Examples in other languages that do similar thing to what I&#x27;d like:
 Go: https://github.com/yudai/gotty
 Typescript: https://github.com/butlerx/wetty

                    <span>TLDR; When publishing your library to Hackage, how do you figure out optimal lower and upper bounds for dependencies so that others can easily use it but that you are still sure your library will work correctly? 
 I wrote a strong-path package, which I published on Hackage. I am using Stack to build it: I have stack.yaml and package.yaml as sources of truth, while strong-path.cabal is generated by Stack but I also commit it into vcs.
 When I started developing strong-path, I haven&#x27;t specified any dependency versions in package.yaml, since I knew it will pull whatever is provided by the Stack resolver I am using, and that worked fine for me.
 At some point I started needing the newer version of &#x60;path&#x60; package than the version that was present in the LTS resolver, so I added &#x60;path-0.9.0&#x60; und…</span>

                    <span>Please help me make a positional voting system kind of like the Eurovision, in which each country votes for their 3 favourites. The first favourite gets 3 points, second gets 2 and third favourite gets 1 point.
 votes :: [(String,(String,String,String))] votes &#x3D; [ (&quot;Belgium&quot;, (&quot;Portugal&quot;, &quot;Spain&quot;, &quot;France&quot;)), (&quot;Denmark&quot;, (&quot;Iceland&quot;, &quot;France&quot;, &quot;Belgium&quot;)), (&quot;Spain&quot;, (&quot;Portugal&quot;, &quot;France&quot;, &quot;Greece&quot;)), (&quot;France&quot;, (&quot;Iceland&quot;, &quot;Portugal&quot;, &quot;Spain&quot;)), (&quot;Greece&quot;, (&quot;Portugal&quot;, &quot;Iceland&quot;, &quot;France&quot;)), (&quot;Iceland&quot;, (&quot;Spain&quot;, &quot;Denmark&quot;, &quot;Portugal&quot;)), (&quot;Portugal&quot;, (&quot;Iceland&quot;, &quot;France&quot;, &quot;Spain&quot;))]

 votesCandidate :: [(String,(String,String,String))] -&gt; String -&gt; Int 
 and finally electionWinner, that knowing what each country voted and how many points each got, will tell you the winner
 electionWinner :: [(String,(String,String,String))] -&gt; String 
 for example:
  &gt; votesCandidate votes &quot;Portugal&quot; 12 &gt; votesCandidate votes &quot;Greece&quot; 1 &gt; electionWinner votes &quot;Portugal&quot;

                    <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;ve been doing some type-programming lately, and realized the stuff I&#x27;m writing is significantly different than the world as it existed in 2018. We now have quantified constraints, HKDs, kind-generics, and all sorts of other cool techniques. 
 Since 2018, there have also been lots of other books! I haven&#x27;t been great at keeping up --- but has anything superseded TwT? If so, there&#x27;s probably not much reason in pushing out a new edition.
 But if there&#x27;s sufficient interest, I&#x27;d be more than keen to put it together. Let me know!
 Cheers, Sandy

                    <span>I have tried a number of things including reinstalling Ubuntu 20.04, but I cannot get Org Capture to return to the previous (calling) buffer when I press C-c C-c. I checked the key binding and it reports org-capture-finalize. Same result in Gnome terminal and Alacritty. 
 Any ideas what variable or settings may have caused this behavior? It was working as designed a couple of weeks ago. I recently got doom package running, but no change when I comment that out in the config.

                    <span>Hey everyone,I&#x27;m trying to create a &quot;visit_count_file&quot; property for each org file I have. The code I&#x27;m doing should:
  
create the property value equal to 1 if it&#x27;s not here yet
 increments the property value each time you open the file
  
Here is what I came up with for now
 (defun lkr/increment-visit-count () &quot;increments the &#x27;file_visit_count&#x27; property +&#x3D;1&quot; (interactive) (org-entry-put 0 &quot;file_visit_count&quot; (number-to-string (+ (string-to-number (org-entry-get 0 &quot;file_visit_count&quot;)) 1)))) (defun lkr/update-visit-count () &quot;creates or increments the &#x27;file_visit_count&#x27; property&quot; (if (org-entry-get 0 &quot;file_visit_count&quot;) (lkr/increment-visit-count) (org-entry-put 0 &quot;file_visit_count&quot; &quot;1&quot;))) (add-hook &#x27;org-mode-hook &#x27;lkr/visit-count-update) 
 the problem is that it creates the property value in the first heading of the file if the heading is in the first line, and create the property at the top of the file otherwise. How can I do to always put the property at the top of the file?
 behavior:
 ​
 * first heading :PROPERTIES: :file_visit_count: 1 :END: 
 wanted behavior:
 :PROPERTIES: :file_visit_count: 1 :END: * first heading 
 I just started to fiddle with org mode and emacs lisp so I&#x27;m not very good at it. Thanks for reading.
 Bonus question:would it be easy to do the same but instead of putting it in a property drawer, putting it in
 #+visit_count_file: 1 * first heading 
 like this? what would be better in your opinion?Thank you again.

                    <span>I keep all my Org files in a Git repo, so the archiweirdval feature feels a bit redundant -- though I keep using it, because C-c $ / $ (in the agenda) is so convenient.
 There&#x27;s tons of .org_archive files littered around my repo, and if I complete two different tasks on different machines, I get merge conflicts in the archive files. I think I&#x27;d rather just have it delete the entries and use Git in the unlikely even that I need to dig through the archives -- I think it&#x27;s happened maybe two or three times in the 12 years (yikes!) I&#x27;ve been using Org Mode.
 I guess the only thing I&#x27;d be missing is explicitly recording TODO completion. If I just delete the TODO, it could have been done and closed, or unnecessary and not done. I&#x27;m definitely not going to change state, commit, delete, commit -- I think I can live with that loss for a cleaner repo.
 Is there a thing that makes archival work better with Git repos? What are y&#x27;all doing for this?

 I get an error when I try to run my projects in my Command Prompt.
 For example I created a very simple sbt-based Scala project (using IntelliJ IDEA 2021.2.3). The code is simple, I want to add 1 to x:
 package plusOner object Fish { def plusOne(x: Int): Int &#x3D; x + 1 } 
 Then I want to try the plusOne method in the SBT console by opening my project folder in the command prompt. The only thing I do in the command prompt is the following:
  
Change directory to the sbt folder
 Type sbt
 Type console
  
But as I type in console, I get an error (partial error message, click here for the full error message):

 How do I fix this error?
 My environment variables (User Variables and System Variables) can be seen here.

                    <span>After being convinced of the usefulness of code formatters by the excellent scalafmt, which is very widely used in the Scala ecosystem, I was on the lookout for a similar tool for Haskell. In 2018, most options did not completely cut it for me, due to e.g. only formatting certain parts of the source file or having many unfortunate bugs. Upon discovering Ormolu in 2019, I was first appalled by its style, but this reaction was only short-lived, as I found these stylistic preferences to be easily malleable via familiarisation.
I started using Ormolu for all personal projects, and submitted bug reports and minor pull requests. Therefore, an internship to work on Ormolu full-time came like a call!
As described in the announcement post, I worked on support for recent GHC versions, improved the C…</span>

                    <span>Hi,
 This is some part of my .emacs config file. When I start Emacs and input M-x sly or M-x slime, I usually would get an editor and a REPL. In the editor, I should have lispy-mode on automatically (if according to the config), however, I still need to M-x lispy-mode to get it to work. So I was wondering that where I did it wrong?
 ;; Emacs Lisp (add-hook &#x27;emacs-lisp-mode-hook (lambda () (lispy-mode 1) (show-paren-mode 1))) ;; Common Lisp (add-hook &#x27;lisp-mode-hook (lambda () (lispy-mode 1) (show-paren-mode 1)))

                    <span>Rather than having a control or special key based command for changing window sizes, or having to remember and use a lengthy Emacs function name (enlarge-window-horizontally) for example, I&#x27;d like to set up an evil statusline command like so
 (evil-ex-define-cmd &quot;ewh&quot; &#x27;enlarge-window-horizontally) 
 so I can use :ewh instead. (There are also other ways to get the same effect, but I&#x27;m using this for now.)
 This works (which is good), but it only grows the window by one character width, so I&#x27;d like to be able to use &quot;.&quot; to repeat it. However, this command does not appear in the ring for some reason, so whatever was used before :ewh is what ends up repeated.
 How can I use this alias/command I want while also having calls appear in the ring so they are eligible for repetition by &quot;.&quot;?
 Unfortunately, prefacing the command with a number like :5ewh does enlarge the window by five characters, but it also moves me to line 5. This approach would also be okay if it didn&#x27;t navigate to a new line.
 Thanks!

                    <span>I&#x27;m using emms with mpd, and for the most part it has been working wonderfully for me. The only things that I have not been able to get working are:
 (emms-random) ; this plays only one track randomly. The next song is the next on the playlist.
 (emms-toggle-random-playlist) ; same problem, songs continue to play in playlist order
 ​
 these two also don&#x27;t work:
 (emms-toggle-repeat-track)
 (emms-toggle-repeat-playlist)
 ​
 I&#x27;m on Emacs 27.2 and emms 20211019.2004.
 Any suggestions will be appreciated.

                    <span>Hello,
 I&#x27;m a emacs user from 1 year but Im not so professional.
 I&#x27;m using emacs 27 in Fedora. I make my own dotfiles. Im using everything with Emacs including music player, and I use emacs as IDE for some programming languages. My question is that, I use lsp-java but I guess it is effective with just springboot projects. But Im using various frameworks. How can I configure my Emacs as Java IDE as well. And debugging part is important for me. I&#x27;m dealing problems for configuring spring debugger. I also listen your ideas.

 void is already colored, because my lisp file detects the keyword. But I don&#x27;t know how to color the next one. Ideally it shouldn&#x27;t color the parenthesis. How would I solve this problem? Thanks!

                    <span>Not sure if this is a bug, or really where to go to start debugging.
 I&#x27;m on a mac, and testing this on a prebuilt Emacs 26 from homebrew, and emacs 28.0.60 I compiled. It seems that in my v28.0.60 if I open a tramp connection to a remote server that is behind a VPN, if the VPN connection is killed, emacs completely freezes. (to test, I just open a dired remote directory, and sever the connection. Instant beachballing.) I&#x27;ve tried setting tramp verbose mode to 10 and sending SIGUSR2, but am having trouble getting useful information (for me). Once the freezing happens, I can&#x27;t recover and its becoming extremely frustrating. SIGUSR2 can at least let me get back into emacs, but in a debug mode. The only message I could see was about a premature ending and Forbiddent reentrant tramp. (I don&#x27;t have the exact messages right now, but could get them.)
 I do have a copy of my v26 emacs, and it does not have the same problem. When the VPN/remote connection is killed, emacs locks up for a few seconds, before it simply times out, and I can keep going. Annoying, but not a show-stopper.
 In each case, I am starting with emacs -Q option and the only extra command I&#x27;m using before opening files is ido-mode.
 I did stumble on  this issue  which mentions that start-file-process-shell-command was changed between v26 and v28. Is what I am noticing something related to that?
 The behavior is very different between versions on the same computer (and ssh configuration), and I am loading things with the &quot;-Q&quot; option for no init file. Any pointers to how to track this down would be helpful. Did I compile without some magic flag in the configuration that was needed?

                    <span>I&#x27;m starting to have trouble with the performance in certain scenarios, even some things like typing text or text navigation (via up/down keys) is sluggish. 
 I suspect this is a bad third-party library, but short of manually disabling modes I don&#x27;t know of a good way to monitor the performance. Can anybody suggest workflows which help them identify slow logic?

                    <span>What is best way to replicate the functionality of Rust&#x27;s &quot;if let&quot; statement in Haskell? That is, what is the best way to replicate a statement of the form
 if let p &#x3D; a {foo} else {bar}, where p is an arbitrary pattern, bar is an expression, and foo is an expression potentially involving components of p.
 So far, I have 2 good (that is, not overly verbose) ways to do it, both of which require an extension:
 (\case p -&gt; foo; _ -&gt; bar) a (uses LambdaCase)
 fromMaybe bar [foo| p &lt;- a] (uses MonadComprehensions)

                    <span>Vital Biosciences is a company based in Toronto (Canada) building a medical device aiming to revolutionize medical diagnostics. Because of the size of our stack we use a variety of languages, to choose the most appropriate tech at each level of the stack. We use Haskell, SQL, and Rust, with a splash of C and Python where it makes sense.
 Quick Facts:
  
This is a remote position. If you prefer an office environment and live in or are willing to relocate to Toronto that works for us.
 We are looking for a mid/senior level hire. We love to hire junior candidates with great promise, but at this point the team isn&#x27;t yet large enough to share the training effort.
 The working hours for this position are in Toronto local time (ET)
 Authorized to work in US/CA is a slam dunk. Other countries are possible but we may need to do some investigation before we promise we can make it happen.

 I&#x27;m a haskell developer here and I was asked to share this posting. One of my favorite parts of the job is working alongside a science team and a hardware team to make a thing I can touch. It&#x27;s a refreshing change of pace from working at companies that just produce a cloud service. I&#x27;m happy to answer any questions to the best of my ability!

                    <span>I am obviously doing something wrong.
 I see in the wikibook it says 
 foldMap (g . f) &#x3D; g . foldMap f 
 so i tried g &#x3D; (+1) and f &#x3D; Sum 
 i get 
 Prelude Control.Monad Data.Monoid&gt; foldMap ( (+1) . Sum ) [1..10] Sum {getSum &#x3D; 65} 
 which is what i expected. 
 But when i try 
 Prelude Control.Monad Data.Monoid&gt; (+1) . foldMap Sum [1..10] :16:8: error: • Couldn&#x27;t match expected type ‘a -&gt; c’ with actual type ‘Sum a0’ • Possible cause: ‘foldMap’ is applied to too many arguments In the second argument of ‘(.)’, namely ‘foldMap Sum [1 .. 10]’ In the expression: (+ 1) . foldMap Sum [1 .. 10] In an equation for ‘it’: it &#x3D; (+ 1) . foldMap Sum [1 .. 10] • Relevant bindings include it :: a -&gt; c (bound at :16:1) 
 I tried bracketing as 
 Prelude Control.Monad Data.Monoid&gt; ((+1) . foldMap Sum) [1..10] Sum {getSum &#x3D; 56} Prelude Control.Monad Data.Monoid&gt; 
 but this is not the same as 65 which i would expect.

                    <span>I hit up the discord first, since I&#x27;m not sure the slot this will take up in the subreedit front page is worth it but:
  
What&#x27;s the best way to do Vue-style components and applications, but using Purescript instead of Typescript?
 I&#x27;m using Jest + Stryker to do (property-based, mutation) testing. Should I use them with Purescript (how?) or switch to some other testing framework?
  
I&#x27;m quite comfortable with Haskell, and I have an existing Vue.js + Typescript application that I wrote (and host at https://iguanasuicide.net/) but I&#x27;m not really comfortable with npm / node / vue -- there&#x27;s no specification I can read ala the Haskell Report so I&#x27;m always uncertain when editing the configuration. I&#x27;m even uncertain on the latest Typescript changes -- I learned it from the specification that is no longer updated.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve recently come back to the world of emacs and this time around I&#x27;m using sway for my wm. everything has been file except the font in emacs is always blurry, I&#x27;m in void linux so I had the option to install the gtk3, gtk2, and Xorg versions of emacs. Since I was running a wayland based desktop I thought to install the gtk3 version since gtk3 natively supports wayland as far as I know. like I said everything is fine just the text is slightly blurrier then I would like and can&#x27;t seem to find a fix for my specific situation
 ​
 Also I did try setting GDK_BACKEND&#x3D;&quot;wayland&quot; and that just gave me an error saying gtk can&#x27;t find display &#x27;:0&#x27;

                    <span>When this hook runs, whatever function call is first in line fails. Then, the rest of them run as expected. Note that I merely copied item one to the bottom of the list, and from there it runs. First thought is, the function is autoloading but not fast enough to catch the first call. I&#x27;m often wrong, though. How to fix? Thanks.

                    <span>I apologize for this question but I have been trying this for a while and getting a bit stuck.
 I have installed the Emacs Application Framework and been messing around with it. It&#x27;s awesome, but I can&#x27;t play video files in it! As far as I can tell, everything is set up as it should be but it simply is not playing anything.
 Here is the relevant portion of my .emacs file:
 (add-to-list &#x27;load-path &quot;~/.emacs.d/site-lisp/emacs-application-framework/&quot;) (add-to-list &#x27;load-path &quot;~/.emacs.d/site-lisp/emacs-application-framework/app/eaf-video-player/&quot;) (require &#x27;eaf) (require &#x27;eaf-browser) (require &#x27;eaf-pdf-viewer) (require &#x27;eaf-terminal) (require &#x27;eaf-video-player) 
 As you can see, the video player is indeed installed. I also installed qt-ubuntu from snap and ffmpeg from apt (I am on Ubuntu) to see if either of those would help (they didn&#x27;t but I haven&#x27;t restarted my computer since I installed those so maybe that would do something [update: rebooting did not do anything]?)
 The web browser, PDF viewer, and terminal work just fine (I haven&#x27;t messed with the other plugins yet). However, when I try to run the video player on a video file, this happens.
 As you can see, the video editor is in fact on, in some sense, but nothing is here! I am not a Linux or powerful text editor newbie (I am a recent veteran of Neovim which i customized heavily) so I know may way around installing stuff and troubleshooting, but I&#x27;m nowhere near experienced enough to debug super complicated issues, so I&#x27;ve found myself stuck here. Any ideas on what might be going on?

                    <span>I just came across Ctrl-Shift-E.
 It&#x27;s shy though:
  
it pops up a tiny window that disappears if I try to screenshot it (and comes right back after the screenshot is taken).
 
C-h k C-S-e doesn&#x27;t even help!?
 
C-q C-S-e doesn&#x27;t want to quoted-insert it.
 
Search engines have never heard of it apparently.
 
C-g doesn&#x27;t extinguish it. enter and esc do.
 
For both global and local, (local-unset-key (kbd &quot;C-S-E&quot;)) doesn&#x27;t unset it.
 
 So how does it behave?
 It opens a tiny window, that you can type in, and if you hit enter it places those contents at the cursor. But you can&#x27;t type spaces. The tiny window is draggable. The tiny window has a hardcoded character e at the beginning of it, for who knows why.
 What on earth is this?

                    <span>Using exwm I am hoping for a good emacs solution to viewing system processes and their resource consumption. For instance, I may want to see how much memory Slack is really consuming in my Firefox window. From the CLI something like &#x3D;top&#x3D; gives good information, but attempting to search for emacs wrappers of top has proved an exercise in frustration. What recommendations have you folks, for viewing resource usage of system processes?

                    <span>I have been a Emacs user for a year now . I don&#x27;t use a distribution of Emacs , I use my own init.el.
 I use evil mode and wanted to setup EAF Browser in my Emacs.EAF Browser works as expected but the keybindings between EAF and Evil clash . I have to switch to Emacs Mode for EAF and Evil Mode for others, this setup is very irritating and unproductive. How to use EAF Browser with only Evil Mode ?
 The EAF wiki only has instructions for DOOM Emacs and Spacemacs users , I tried to implement it for normal evil mode , but was unsucessfull. Does anyone have a setup they can share ?

 When using the type family as part of a program, I&#x27;m encountering an error as follows (summarised):
 Could not deduce: Last ts1 ~ Last (t : ts1) from the context: ts ~ (t : ts1) NB: &#x60;Last&#x27; is a non-injective type family 
 From my understanding, the last type in the list ts1 must be identical to the last type in the list t : ts1, the presence of an extra item at the beginning should not have an effect on which item is at the end. Therefore, Last ts1 should be the same as Last (t : ts1), but GHC cannot guarantee this.
 What changes can I make to get my code to compile?

                    <span>About six months ago, /u/bgamari wrote up this update on the status of GHC on Apple M1 hardware.
 With the release of the second generation M1 CPUs this past week, I&#x27;m curious how much closer we are to building binaries targeting the M1 CPU using GHC.

                    <span>So, we have Control.Monad.Trans.Cont for continuations:
 &#x60;newtype ContT r m a &#x3D; ContT ((a -&gt; m r) -&gt; m r)&#x60;
 &#x60;type Cont &#x3D; ContT r Identity&#x60;
 &#x60;reset :: Cont r r -&gt; Cont r&#x27; r&#x60;
 &#x60;shift :: ((a -&gt; r) -&gt; Cont r r) -&gt; Cont r a&#x60;
 We have &#x60;shift&#x60; and &#x60;reset&#x60; for performing continuation, but it is hard to wrap my head around what these does..
 Like, what does &quot;captures the continuation up to the nearest enclosing reset&quot; mean?
 Why does it capture up to the enclosing reset? How does it interact with callCC and others?
 I am lost. Could you give me pointers on how to understand it?

                    <span>Hi everyone,
 This might be a stupid or rather difficult question. When you are surfing on the web, and you come across a tutorial that you were looking for hours, and you consider that tutorial or parts of it a piece of gold to avoid boilerplate and save tons of hours of re-googling, how do you store that information using org-mode? 
 Technically speaking, we are talking about non-actionable information that could be used potentially in the future. Do you use org-roam for this kind of stuff or what? And how do you organize the files, independent from your GTD workflow (if you have)? 
 Would love to hear your methods, since I have a lot of tabs temporarily saved in bookmark on Firefox but I know that I would like to store that information filtered and processed by me. Thanks!

                    <span>Hi,I searched far and wide but, with my limited competency, I was unable to find a writing tracker for org-mode that could tell me how many words per hour I produce. I want to know this to become more prolific.
 Here&#x27;s an example writing tracker implementation done in Google spreadsheets: https://thespreadsheetwiz.com/automatic-writing-tracker/
 I don&#x27;t need something as elaborate. But there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any solution that pairs word count with clock data.
 There are a few packages that will count words for you, such as org-wc, which produces nice overlays of total word count per subtree: https://github.com/tesujimath/org-wc
 Or tracktable that embeds a table with a daily word count into your buffer: https://github.com/tty-tourist/org-tracktable
 But nothing that combines word counts with clock data, both of which I have in my file.
 Unless I missed something? Please let me know if you know.
 I use DOOM if it makes any difference.

                    <span>Hi there
 My colleagues and I have developed an ECS (Entity Component System) framework as a final project for a university course.
 The framework aims to have the ECS architectural pattern adopted in an idiomatic and concise manner.
 Advice and suggestions are welcome :)

                    <span>The first edition is just waiting for imagery by @ctietze and the online course will be one of my focussed work for the next couple of weeks.
The next Zettelkasten-related topic will be mapping.
This article might be of interest to you:
https://www.nngroup.com/articles/cognitive-mind-concept/
This will be one of the corner stones to connect the overall architecture of the Zettelkasten Method and thinking tools. Perhaps, I might even say integrate the tools with the environment.
The infobox on the right with all the *maps might be also of interest to you.

Cognitive Mapping is the initial reason for the image capture function in The Archive. It integrates the environment of thinking &quot;desk&quot; with the environment of thinking on your computer:

                    <span>Hi all!
 I&#x27;ve written a small &quot;proof of concept&quot; type package nrql.el for interacting with NewRelic (an application performance monitoring and logging tool). In my current job, I do a lot of investigation into our production issues. org-mode is a huge part of my daily workflow, and I wanted something that would make it easier to save NewRelic queries (and their results) in org-mode as I typically will export an org-mode heading to html to format the text in a way that is easy to share between many different services (Confluence/Jira/Github/ect.). 
 If there are any other NewRelic and Emacs users out there hopefully this is useful! Also, I&#x27;d love some feedback elisp wise as it&#x27;s my first serious attempt at writing a package for Emacs. A lot is still pretty rudimentary like error handling, but if you have interest in something like this let me know as it currently meets my needs, and I&#x27;m wondering if I should take it further.

                    <span>Starting with emacs -Q -l ~/.emacs.d/straight/repos/straight.el/bootstrap.el, I then eval-buffer this buffer:
 (straight-use-package &#x27;org) (with-eval-after-load &#x27;org-agenda (setq org-agenda-files &#x27;(&quot;~/todo.org&quot;)) (setf (cdr (assoc &#x27;todo org-agenda-sorting-strategy)) &#x27;(effort-up)) ;; Sort just by effort (setf (cdr (assoc &#x27;todo org-agenda-prefix-format)) &quot; %i %-12:c %-6e&quot;)) ;; So I can see effort in the todo list 
 If I then do M-x org-agenda t, I&#x27;m presented with
 todo: 0:30 TODO C todo: 0:15 TODO B todo: 0:45 TODO A 
 However, if I comment out (straight-use-package &#x27;org) (i.e. using the built-in Org instead of the latest version), I get the expected output of
 todo: 0:15 TODO B todo: 0:30 TODO C todo: 0:45 TODO A 
 org-version and load-history confirm that the first version is using Org 9.5, while the second is using Org 9.4.4. Did sorting agenda items by effort change in 9.5?
 For completeness, inbox.org just looks like:
 * TODO A :PROPERTIES: :Effort: 0:45 :END: * TODO B :PROPERTIES: :Effort: 0:15 :END: * TODO C :PROPERTIES: :Effort: 0:30 :END: 
 I&#x27;m on GNU Emacs 27.2, with Arch Linux, Linux 5.10.64-1-lts x86_54, and Org 9.5-g531577.

                    <span>In most programming modes, paredit-everywhere works by default, doing what I expect. Alas, it doesn&#x27;t in latex-mode, where I find myself spending more and more time.
 LaTeX looks difficult for the (incremental) recursive-descent parser one might use to hold a parse tree in-memory for structural navigation and editing. Is this a hopeless endeavor for an all-in-Emacs solution? Should I look into a tree-sitter plugin instead?

                    <span>I want to be able to select a region of text and wrap it with the \( \) that you use to input equations in org-mode.
 As far as I can tell, the way to do this would be to supply the output of (region-beginning) and (region-end) to a function that would insert text at a point.
 Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t find a function to do this, or even functions to manually set the point, and then use (insert) to place the text.
 Am I going about this in the way? I know it&#x27;s a very simple task just to write the tags, but I have to do it a lot and would like to automate it.
 EDIT: I figured it out, the function is a little hacky, but it does work. Note: the mess in the (insert) functions is to make it output \( \), disregard it.
  (defun kcr/wrap-eqn () &quot;Wrap equation in org-mode markers&quot; (interactive) (let ((point1 (region-beginning)) (point2 (+ 2 (region-end)))) (goto-char point1) (insert &quot;\\&quot; &quot;\(&quot;) (goto-char point2) (insert &quot;\\&quot; &quot;\)&quot;)))

                    <span>With gccemacs becoming more popular and the option to provide gcc switches to native compilation itself I’m curious what performance enhancing flags others are using and why.
 This post e.g.mentions various benchmarks suggesting O2 doing better than O3 (and it’s a very recent post!). Besides that I like to use “-march&#x3D;native” but haven’t tried much more..

If I delete the compiled file org-d208de9c-ca5ab453.eln, this issue gone temporary. Is there any way to permanently avoid this problem, or is this a bug of native-compile?

                    <span>I was doing a problem sheet to play around with haskell syntax and I have to write a function :
 graft :: Rose -&gt; [ Rose ] -&gt; (Rose , [ Rose ])
 graft &#x3D; undefined
 which takes a &quot;parent&quot; tree and a list of &quot;child&quot; trees and grafts each of the children to the leaves of the parent as we move from left to right. What is the most efficient way to do this?
 Notice how the function returns two pieces of data: the grafted tree as well as a list. This second value can be used if the length of the list of children does not match the number of leaves of the parent. For example, if there are not enough child trees in the list, your function should simply continue without modifying the remaining leaves and and return the grafted tree as well as the empty list. Conversely, if there are more children than there are leaves of the parent, then your function should return the grafted tree as well as the list of child trees which are left over.

                    <span>I have an exercise, where I have to write a function that returns True if the first parameter&#x27;s list&#x27;s length is larger than the second parameter (Int type).
 Now, there&#x27;s a test case where the first parameter is an infinite list ([1..]), therefore I can&#x27;t just simply write &#x60;| length x &gt; y &#x3D; True&#x60; in my pattern guard, since that would cause an infinite loop. How can I check if a list is infinite or not? If it&#x27;s infinite, then the function should always return &#x60;True&#x60;.
 ​
 EDIT: The second parameter is only a number, so my example should look like this:
 longer [1..] 3000 &#x3D;&#x3D; True

 Cannot decode byte &#x27;\xa1&#x27;: Data.Text.Internal.Encoding.streamDecodeUtf8With: Invalid UTF-8 stream
 for a long time, but before that everything was fine, one day this error just popped up and I certainly don&#x27;t know why. (My vscode is set to UTF-8 which shows in the right corner)
 I have looked up on google and found a similar problem in this google group. 
 Like if there is a {-# LANGUAGE ScopedTypeVariables #-} or a single line comment in the first line, this error will show up.
 Everything can build successfully so I think the problem is on VScode...
 Is there anybody encountered with the similar problem?

                    <span>This is a post introducing the new changes of Iron v1.1.2.
 What is Iron ?
 Iron is a type constraints (or type refinement) library for Scala 3. It uses Dotty&#x27;s inline and opaque types to evaluate constraints at compile-time.
 Here is a simple example: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;scala def log(x: Double &gt; 0d): Refined[Double] &#x3D; x.map(Math.log)
 log(-1d) //Compile-time error &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 New features of 1.1.2
 Mathematics
 This release make Iron closer to mathematics by providing two features: - A new A / B alias which has the same meaning than x € A / B(x) in mathematics. The old A &#x3D;&#x3D;&gt; B alias is kept but deprecated for retrocompatibility reasons.
  
A new algebraic system allowing the user to write their constraint like a mathematical equation: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;scala
  
def acos(x: Double / (-1d &lt;&#x3D; ?? &lt;&#x3D; 1d)): Refined[Double] &#x3D; x.map(Math.acos) acos(1d) //Right(0) acos(1.5) //Error &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Check this page for further information.
 Compile-time evaluation support for composed constraints
 Before 1.1.2, constraints like And, Or, Not etc... Weren&#x27;t evaluable at compile-time. They were evaluated at runtime only. This update now allows you evaluate complex/composed constraints at compile-time: scala def acos(x: Double / (Greater[-1d] &amp;&amp; Less[1d])): Refined[Double] &#x3D; x.map(Math.acos) acos(1.2) //Compile-time error 
 Note: Compile-time evaluation is also supported by the new algebra system.

                    <span>Hello, I am testing a method that deals with a Coordinate case class:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;scala case class Coordinate(azimuth: Double, elevation: Double)
 def method(arg: Seq[Byte]): Coordinate // represents a point on a globe &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 I need the method to be approximately equal to the value corresponding to the catalog entry for the byte sequence that represents it. Basically, I need this test to pass:
 scala val testValue: Seq[Byte] &#x3D; ??? assert(method(testValue))(approximatelyEquals(Coordinate(azi1, ele1))) //values from spec catalog correlating byte sequences to expected Coordinate values 
 The signature of approximatelyEquals is
 scala def approximatelyEquals[A: Numeric](reference: A, tolerance: A): Assertion[A] 
 I am unsure of how to make this work with the Coordinate class. I need an instance of Numeric for Coordinate, but it doesn&#x27;t make much sense, since for example it&#x27;s not possible to order points on a globe.
 Basically what I need is to make sure that the elevation and azimuth values are close to the azimuth and elevation values that are expected. As it relates to the title, I need to get an ADT to understand the typeclass of its arguments, if it has arguments that all have the same typeclass as this type does.

                    <span>I had to reinstall emacs, and now I cannot use magit. As per image... I&#x27;ve tried to search for the compat package. The only place where I arrived is this: https://sr.ht/~pkal/compat/, that leads to a not found page here: http://elpa.gnu.org/packages/compat.html. Now, does anybody have any clue about what could be going on?
 ​
 Thanks!

                    <span>I don&#x27;t know how well known or widely used they are, but I just wanted to say how blown away I am by the Modus Themes of Protesilaos Stavrou. Not only are they really beautiful but they&#x27;re incredibly clear (by design) and very customizable. I&#x27;ve stuck with the built-in deeper-blue theme for a very long time because of its clarity but this is the first theme that&#x27;s made me switch.

                    <span>Hello
 Which Emacs theme would you recommend for a glossy screen in order to minimize glare when working in a well lit environment. Currently I&#x27;m using doom-vibrant, and even though it looks great in a dimly lit room, when it gets brighter, there a lot of glare even with the screen at 400nits.

                    <span>For a long time, many Emacs users and I have always longed for tail-call optimization in Emacs.
 With the advent of Emacs 28&#x27;s native compilation, it&#x27;s only possible when we apply the highest available native-comp-speed (which is non-default) so it&#x27;s unreliable.
 Today I happened to jump into named-let in subr-x.el, which according to the manual can be used just like Clojure&#x27;s loop - which can be utilized in place of TCO funtions - therefore I decided to define a clone for the latter.
 lisp ;;;###autoload (defmacro clj-loop (bindings &amp;rest body) &quot;Evaluates BODY in a lexical context in which the symbols in the BINDING-forms are bound to their respective initial bindings or parts therein. Acts as a recur target.&quot; (declare (indent defun)) &#x60;(named-let recur ,(seq-partition ;; Convert vector to list (append bindings nil) 2) ,@body)) 
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;lisp
 (clj-loop [i 0] (if (&#x3D; i (expt 2 20)) i (recur (1+ i)))) ;; &#x3D;&gt; 1048576
 (defun fibo-2expt (num) (clj-loop [a 0 b 1 n (expt num 2)] (if (zerop n) a (recur b (+ a b) (1- n))))) (fibo-2expt 3) ;; &#x3D;&gt; 34 &#x60;&#x60; Although initial expressions&#x27; indentations are a bit funny &amp; there&#x27;s no destructuring, I think it&#x27;s still helpful to share, because I haven&#x27;t seen anyone suggestednamed-let&#x60; as a built-in workaround for TCO. (Sorry for shamelessly ripping off documentation from Clojure&#x27;s).

                    <span>Hello all, emacs newbie here, been using doom emacs for a few months now and I just discovered Ivy childframe/posframe. It was working well a while ago but since last week it has been acting weird. By weird I mean it changes the position of the mouse cursor from anywhere in the screen to the top left of the emacs window as you can see in the video. What can be causing this?
 My system info:
  
OS: manjaro 21.1.6
 Emacs: 27.2
 Doom: 21.12,0-alpha

                    <span>This seems a strange problem, but I find no good spell checker which works for LaTeX files.
 For example, the built-in TeX-ispell-document checks contents in equations, which should be unnecessary.
 Does anyone have a good solution for spell checking a long LaTeX file?

 I was recreating my config for the 10th time and came across - https://github.com/gilbertw1/emacs-literate-starter . I cloned the repo and every time I run the make compile, I get the following error:
 Symbol&#x27;s function definition is void: org-babel-tangle-file
 make: *** [compile] Error 255
 The repo is a few years old so a few things may now be obsolete. I tried adding (require &#x27;ob-tangle) but it still won&#x27;t work. 
 ​
 Help :)

                    <span>Hi guys, I&#x27;m sharing a minimal recipe to build emacs with native compilation in macOS. More precisely, to add native compilation to your already working build procedure. I&#x27;ve found that it&#x27;s extremely simple nowadays but also that instructions are scattered around the web, often outdated, sometimes hit-and-miss, sometimes buried deep inside complex build scripts that do a bunch of other things. So I wanted to get an up-to-date minimal working recipe and actually understand what I was doing instead of blindly copy&amp;pasting code. The outcome gladly surprised me as trivial.
 Assuming you have brew installed and have checked out emacs-28:
  brew install gcc brew install libgccjit ... ./configure --with-native-compilation ... 
 Remarks:
  
gcc is not the compiler used during the traditional build. Instead, the clang installed alongside your macOS command line tools will be picked as usual. But gcc will be the one compiling elisp to native code (please correct me here if I&#x27;m wrong).
 
--with-native-compilation flag is not required (it&#x27;s already the default!) but by adding it you ensure that any issue while enabling native compilation gets reported loud and clear. If there is any problem, try this in order to diagnose it: https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/jit/intro/tutorial01.html.
 
Be prepared for long build times. Also, you might feel disappointed the first time you launch your new build of emacs. But this is likely because the JIT compiler is compiling your packages (you may see a bunch of compiler warnings in *Messages*, new files appearing in ~/.emacs.d/eln-cache and some processes burning your CPUs).
 
I&#x27;m on Big Sur 11.6.
 
 EDIT: I&#x27;ve been using it for a while it&#x27;s really, but really, snappy! Now that I&#x27;m typing in this reddit textarea it feels clunky as in 2 hours average latency.

                    <span>Hello everyone, I am in a dire need of some help, we are forced to do haskell in our school and I don&#x27;t understand it in any way, it&#x27;s only for one semester and then we&#x27;ll never use it again, would there be a kind soul to help me with the homework? If so here is what I have to do
 Implement the function puzzle, it will simulate the game similar to 15 Puzzle. In our case, we have 25 squares, where 24 squares are ocupied by tiles with big case letters from &#x27;A&#x27; to &#x27;X&#x27;. One tile is free, it is denotated by &#x27; &#x27;. In one move, you can move a tile (denotated by its letter) into the free one. The function gets the original configuration and a sequence of valid moves. It will output the resulting configuration.
 If anyone would help me I would really appretiate it, though I am quite broke so I can&#x27;t afford paying, I am rellying on generosity and charity of this community

                    <span>Hello, I want to create a looping border color so that it has a RGB effect. Either one color at the time (which kinda seems possible) or a circle effect of that sort. Im finding a problem with my minimal knowledge of haskell, but i do have some in programming. Any pointer would be of a massive help.

                    <span>hi guys i am creating program to zip 2 list together but when one list runs out of elements it continues with last element. I comed up with this but it just zips 2 files like normal zip
 padzip :: [a] -&gt; [b] -&gt; [(a,b)]
 padzip [] [] &#x3D; []
 padzip [] ys &#x3D; []
 padzip xs [] &#x3D; []
 padzip (x:xs) (y:ys) &#x3D; (x,y) : padzip xs ys
 results should look like this:
 padzip [1, 2, 3, 4] [True, False] ~&gt;* [(1, True), (2, False), (3, False), (4, False)] 
 padzip [4.2] [42, 24, 21] ~&gt;* [(4.2, 42), (4.2, 24), (4.2, 21)] 
 Thaks for help.

                    <span>I would say ReactiveX is the most popular implementation of reactive programming outside Haskell. There is RxJS used heavily by angular, there is even RxJava - but i can&#x27;t find RxHaskell, except the archived github repository from 2013. Are there any good reasons why there isn&#x27;t an implementation? :(

                    <span>Hello,
 ​
 I found this interpreter for the lambda calculus using de Bruijn Notation and GADTS:
 https://proglang.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/teaching/functional-programming/2013/Code-20140123.lhs
 data FExp :: * -&gt; * -&gt; * where 
 App :: FExp e (a -&gt; b) -&gt; FExp e a -&gt; FExp e b 
 Lam :: FExp (a, e) b -&gt; FExp e (a -&gt; b) 
 Var :: Nat e a -&gt; FExp e a &gt; 
 ​
 data Nat e a where 
 Zero :: Nat (a, b) a 
 Succ :: Nat e a -&gt; Nat (b, e) a
 ​
 My Questions is: Whats the best way to parse expressions like \x y z -&gt; y to something of this type? 
 My problem is that i need a state to return the right Nat e a.
 Would it be better to write an Type FExp&#x27; that can also contain lambda expressions that are not well typed and write a parser with type String -&gt; FExp&#x27; and a second function of type MonadError m &#x3D;&gt; FExp&#x27; -&gt; m FExp&#x27;? Thanks for your help.

                    <span>I use emacs, search for it in helm-ag, then use helm-ag-edit to bring up a buffer with all the results, then use evil-mc to edit the results that are actually a valid instance of that identifier. 
 I feel like there&#x27;s gotta be a better, cleaner way to do this. At the moment it seems like lsp-rename isn&#x27;t working (maybe that&#x27;s coming soon as the haskell-language-server rename plugin becomes usable?). I&#x27;ve looked at retrie but can&#x27;t find any instructions for how one would go about changing an identifier. Does anyone else think they have a better method that&#x27;s ready to go?

                    <span>Hi
 I&#x27;m confused as to why the last line in the following code gives a compile error
 type CacheObject a &#x3D; { fetch :: forall m . MonadEffect m &#x3D;&gt; m a } get :: forall a m . MonadEffect m &#x3D;&gt; CacheObject a -&gt; m a get c &#x3D; c.fetch 
 while the following does not
 type CacheObject a m &#x3D; (MonadEffect m) &#x3D;&gt; { fetch :: m a } get :: forall a m . MonadEffect m &#x3D;&gt; CacheObject a m -&gt; m a get c &#x3D; c.fetch 
 The compile error starts with
  Could not match constrained type MonadEffect t3 &#x3D;&gt; t3 a1 with type m0 a1 
 Can someone explain why this is?

 ​
 How do I add I implement Foo.equals(Foo) for Foo / for every extending class? (So Bar.equals(Foo), Baz.equals(Foo) would need to be implemented.)
 Ideally Bar(x1) &#x3D;&#x3D; Bar(x2) &lt;&#x3D; x1 &#x3D;&#x3D; x2, Baz(y1) &#x3D;&#x3D; Baz(y2) &lt;&#x3D; y1 &#x3D;&#x3D; y2.
 Does it need to be a sealed abstract class rather than a sealed trait?Foo must be sealed because I need to use pattern matching.

They all have their own documentation and almost appear as separate projects. I just want to learn Akka at HOME on my own mini Raspberry cluster without paying AWS or playing with hosted PaaS or blah blah. Can someone give me a 2-minute breakdown of what I need to get there? It is all a but confusing :-). Thanks!

                    <span>The scripting language for the new Yarn 2 is prolog. I was putzing around with it today, learning something about it and trying to get it functional in Emacs. After a restart, this stuff suddenly appeared in *Messages*. 
 Emacs IDLWAVE mode version 6.1_em22. HTML help location not found: try setting ‘idlwave-system-directory’ and/or ‘idlwave-html-help-location’ Cannot locate IDL Assistant, enabling default browser. Loading system routine info in idle time... Failed to convert XML routine info, falling back on idlw-rinfo. [...] 
 Whaat? All I did was add ob-prolog, set a var for the program name, and put a #+SRC block in an Org file. Well, almost all.
 After getting schooled on Interactive Data Language and Emacs&#x27; IDLWAVE package (it has an info manual), and an hour of my life I&#x27;ll never get back, I tracked down the issue. I had created a prolog code file, likes.pro, and guess what file extension IDL files have. I had a likes.pro buffer and IDLWAVE liked it. 
 Fun fact: one of the authors of this package is Carsten Dominik.

                    <span>Hi, I was recently messing with my numworks calculator, on which I run [https://www-fourier.ujf-grenoble.fr/\~parisse/giac.html](XCAS) via KhiCas. I see that you can run Xcas under emacs as well, but I largely have to use khicas because of the memory limitations on the calculator, I trust there are better desktop-oriented cas systems out there 
 Is there 1. A good CAS for Emacs, and 2. Can I link it into Emacs-Calc?

                    <span>Hi, I have reached the end of recruitment process from a course-driven company that offers internship at the end. The last stage is - presentation.
 As a person who wholeheartedly dislikes microsoft office, I decided to work with org mode presentation. I tried out the default themes from reveal.js and I noticed they are minimalist (which is very pleasing but I was wondering-
 Data Science people I know uses microsoft office regularly and makes extensive graphical presentations. So will a minimalist presentation be bad for such environment?
 Which matters during a presentation (optional: in DS)? 
 Main Question: From your experience (optional: as a data analyst), which theme/configuration do you use to do regular presentations?

                    <span>I&#x27;m working on a large code-base using AutoLISP/VisualLisp - an old dialect of Lisp specific to AutoCAD. Please don&#x27;t stop reading now.
 For about 20 years the program used a built in IDE+debugger called &quot;VLIDE&quot; (Visual Lisp IDE). This program does what it&#x27;s supposed to do but is terrible.
 They have now deprecated this and urge people to use VSCode, which has some sort of LSP support via an Extension
 Supposedly this does all the cool stuff I need in VSCode. I would much rather use Emacs!
 What is involved in making this work with the best editor? Is it a drop-in replacement of some sort? Is it legal?
 I don&#x27;t really know how remote debugging works, even though I used it in my Java/EE days.

                    <span>New minor mode for emacs org-mode :)
 It adds bars to the virtual indentation provided by the built-in package org-indent.
 I hope you will like it.

                    <span>I&#x27;m developing a library for a bigger project which might be generally useful so I intend to publish the package if I end up finishing the project. I have not really used any logging framework with Haskell and from my research there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a defacto standard. Let&#x27;s say I use co-log in the library wouldn&#x27;t this force this onto people who want to use my library in their project? Should I not implement any logging at all and then add the logging in the parent project? Kind of miss just being able to put console.log(), console. error() where it&#x27;s needed and not worry about logging in the first place.

                    <span>Hello,
 I installed org-ref to work with references for a paper and I can&#x27;t get my Bibliography to show up when I render the PDF. The References are also marked as [?]
 When I run org-ref in emacs, my bibliography shows up and I don&#x27;t get any errors. I can also search and cite entries. They just don&#x27;t show up when I render as PDF or HTML
 I assume its because all I have in my Init file is, but I tried other configs I found online and could not get it to work.
 (use-package org-ref
 :ensure t)
 ​
 In the org file itself I have:

 bibliographystyle:unsrt
 bibliography:bachelorarbeit.bib

                    <span>Hi everyone. I recently started learning Scala, I know very less about it until now. I setup Visual Studio code for Scala, installed an extension called &#x27;metals&#x27;. I also installed scala and sbt on my OS. I already have jdk-openjdk (which is version 17 currently) installed.
 I researched a little bit and found scala 2.13.6 supports jdk 17. Still everytime I open a Scala file on VS Code, it asks me to install jdk 8 or 11 specifically. The twist is I can compile and run my programs on both on my distro&#x27;s terminal emulator as well on vscode terminal emulator.
 I just want some additional knowledge based on above issue happened with me and what if I completely uninstall jdk-openjdk and install jdk11-openjdk?
 would I be able to compile and run both Java and Scala programs piecefully (errors aside Lol).
 Thanks for your time and efforts.

                    <span>All, 
 I have around 15+ years of experience in java and most probably in mood to start a job as a scala developer from scratch. 
 Do you guys think its worth to make a move, just to learn scala and get hands on ?
 Let me know if there is any perks , cons to this.

                    <span>Hi, I&#x27;m new here!
I know the Zettelkasten method for two years now. I tried to use it, but I always have a problem with mathematical equations. Having to type them in LaTeX is very tedious, I wish I could draw them by hand at early stages of a note and maybe later write them with LaTeX. Do you know some tool that could work for me?
Thanks</span>

                    <span>I&#x27;m experimenting with using a clean build from straight.el in order to reproduce a bug I&#x27;m chasing down, but got sidetracked in this endeavor by experiencing some other weird behavior (a familiar story to all the members of the Church, I&#x27;m sure).
 I launch Emacs with emacs -Q -l ~/.emacs.d/straight/repos/straight.el/bootstrap.el, then evaluate the following buffer.
 (straight-use-package &#x27;org) (require &#x27;org) (with-eval-after-load &#x27;org-agenda (setq org-agenda-files &#x27;(&quot;~/todo.org&quot;))) 
 After this, I do M-x org-agenda t, move the cursor over an entry, and do C-c C-x e to assign an effort. If I then do e.g. &quot;0:15 RET&quot; though, I get a &quot;Symbol&#x27;s function definition is void: org-duration-to-minutes&quot; error. Weirdly, this error goes away if I remove the line (require &#x27;org) from the above config.
 I&#x27;ve checked, and the straight.el build files for org do have org-duration-to-minutes listed as an autoload in org-loaddefs.el. I feel like my brain is just mush after the work week. What am I missing?
 edit:
 I&#x27;m on GNU Emacs 27.2, with Arch Linux, Linux 5.10.64-1-lts x86_54, and the latest version of Org, 9.5-g531577.
 Doing M-x list-load-path-shadows yields the same results for both of these cases - after running org-agenda, 114 packages are shadowed (everything from the built-in org is shadowed by everything in straight/repos/org).
 The load history is a lot to parse through, but the only important thing I&#x27;ve found so far is that after I call org-agenda, org-loaddefs.el appears in the load-history of the version without a require statement, but not in the version with a require statement.
 edit2: Solved! See my comment below.

                    <span>I just noticed that Magit is on the Hacker News frontpage, with a link to a nice write-up about it from 2017:
 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;28954058
 Many here have probably already read the linked article, but more attention for Emacs is always a good thing! I also note that Jonas Bernoulli had some interesting things to say to the about the design of Magit: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;28958785

                    <span>Diddling my modeline config, I accidentally made it resistant to mouse clicks. After I reverted it, I looked for how this functionality is toggled. I found two variables, modeline-mousable and modeline-mouseable-minor-mode. Also spelled mode-line-mousable and mode-line-mousable-minor-mode. The former configures the active frame/window, the latter the inactive.
 &#x27;(mode-line-mousable ((t (:foreground &quot;cyan&quot; :background &quot;#007080&quot;))))
 I find no documentation on them. &#x27;Look up symbol in Info&#x27; fails. &#x27;apropos&#x27; fails. Everywhere I searched, fail. 
 Obviously, they work. Every theme I examined that configures the modeline uses them to set the mouse behavior. But from where?
 edit Or, maybe, I&#x27;ve missed the boat and make-mode-line-mouse-map is the key. But what does it have to do with themes?

                    <span>I use lsp-mode for some time now and am very pleased with it. I use it for python development.
 In my init I added a hook for python-mode like this:
 (use-package lsp-mode ... :hook ((python-mode . lsp)) ...) 
 When I want to use python code with org-babel I often switch to org-edit-special with C-c &#x27;. When I do this python-mode gets loaded but not lsp-mode? Is there a way to start lsp inside the org special edit buffer?
 Thanks for any help!

                    <span>I&#x27;m using tab-bar-mode , and I would like to force each buffer to have it&#x27;s own tab. When I close the buffer I would like to close the tab. (Excluding buffers that are not visiting files).
 At the moment I&#x27;ve bodged together a mix of functions to try to get this behaviour, and generally works, but not always (for instance when use org-refile to jump to a subheading in another file (which I do constantly)).
 I&#x27;m wondering if there might be a simpler way to achieve this behaviour? (Not a programmer, really struggle with this stuff). 
 Thanks in advance for all help, but: please don&#x27;t just tell me I shouldn&#x27;t be using tabs in the first place. I know many look down on tabs, and I have tried using buffers only for 2 years, and I hate it. I need some on-screen visual representation of the buffers I have open.

                    <span>Hello, Emacs people!
 I am an average non-technical Emacs and Anki user. 
 So, when I thought of integrating spaced repetition into my notetaking process (so I can work on my topics with less context switching), I discovered a variety of options.
  
Org-drill https://gitlab.com/phillord/org-drill/
 Pamparam https://github.com/abo-abo/pamparam
 Org-fc https://www.leonrische.me/fc/index.html
 Anki-editor https://github.com/louietan/anki-editor 
  
Do you use any of these regularly, and what are your impressions and suggestions, if so?

 Why would they do that? And does it mean the end of native compilation for emacs built there?

                    <span>I’m trying to use backpack to do some limited form of polymorphic unpacking (which GHC unfortunately does not support ‘natively’). Essentially, I want something like:
 data Node a b &#x3D; Leaf {-# UNPACK #-} !b | Node {-# UNPACK #-} !Index {-# UNPACK #-} !a {-# UNPACK #-} !Index type Index &#x3D; Int bimapNode :: (a -&gt; c) -&gt; (b -&gt; d) -&gt; Node a b -&gt; Node c d bimapNode f g &#x3D; \case Leaf b -&gt; Leaf (g b) Node l a r -&gt; Node l (f a) r 
 for particular types a, c, b, and d. The issue that I&#x27;m essentially running into is that I&#x27;m not sure how I can get my hands on the copies/instances of the &#x27;Node&#x27; type used by the library that implements &#x27;bimapNode&#x27;. A more detailed/precise description of the problem, a minimum &quot;working&quot; example, and my attempts so far are at https://github.com/noinia/nodedemo . (it&#x27;s a bit unweildy to describe the problem while flattening everything in one textual question; hence the ref. to a git repo that contains the proper file layout). Does ideas on how to proceed with this kind of thing?

From what I&#x27;ve seen, the options are backend developer, compilers and research, but I&#x27;d love to hear your thoughts. What options are there? Not asking about any specific job position or technologies, just career paths in general working with haskell.

                    <span>Since I wrote about a year ago that I am working on https://simplex.chat project, a small Haskell reddit group was exceptionally supportive - thank you all!
 I&#x27;ve spent a few weeks exploring which platform we should use to build our mobile apps - and Flutter/Dart with its unified compiled UI and a decent cross-platform seemed a strong contender. But having implemented the core transport protocol in dart, I do have some doubts...
 Having come through all the options, I&#x27;ve read that people use Swift across all platforms (iOS/Android/Mac/Windows) for applications logic, as Swift is an LLVM compiler, so it produces very fast binaries that run on Android without JVM.
 So, I am now thinking, wait a second - Haskell GHC is also an LLVM compiler. A short google search shows that people do compile Haskell code to both iOS and Android. And we already have most of the protocol logic implemented in Haskell - people use our SimpleX chat via terminal...
 While this all seems doable, the compiler configuration and low level bindings are a bit over my head - I am an application developer, so lots to learn here. Would anybody here who has the experience with Haskell on iOS / Android be interested to join the project (terms TBD) to at least help us set it all up, if not get involved longer term?

 The conclusion line will go inside the heading by default, But I want it to stay outside, (like we write conclusions.) How can I do it?

                    <span>BLUF: Can I set the &quot;ORDERED&quot; property on one line?
 I have a series of TODO tasks, and I want to set them to &quot;DONE&quot; in the order I do them. org-enforce-todo-dependencies is set to &quot;t&quot;.
 I set the &quot;ORDERED&quot; property like this for a few lists: :PROPERTIES:
 :ORDERED: t :END: 
 This looks inelegant to me. 
 The manual gives this example for single line properties:
 #+PROPERTY: NDisks_ALL 1 2 3 4
 Can I do something like this:
 #+PROPERTY: ORDERED t
 I have tried it for a few lists of tasks, but I cannot get it to work. I don&#x27;t know if that is because I am doing it wrong, or if it&#x27;s not possible.
 Edit: the single lines for &quot;PROPERTY&quot; are supposed to start with a pound sign and a plus, but Reddit markup wants to display them as headers; I added a space and another pound sign. 
 The single line syntax is here

 It is my perception that programming parallel, asynchronous programs seems alot easier these days with all of these solution components working well together.

                    <span>Hi!
 I&#x27;m using anki-editor to export anki cards from my notes. It works fine for english text, but it&#x27;s not working for portuguese text - it has punctuation like à ã á â.
 It gives me this error:

 How can I fix this?

 Edit: I was using url-retrieve instead of curl. Changed it back and fixed the error.

                    <span>When I use the find-file-other-window command, if my current frame is already split into two windows(via C-x 2) it will open the file in the other window. 
 However, if I have two ui frames open(via C-x 5 2), and I use find-file-other-frame, it always opens a new frame. How do I get it to reuse the existing other frame? The one that would be selected by C-x 5 o.

                    <span>Hey there. I&#x27;m trying to figure out how to export my org-mode agenda to a text file. The same text file every time, so that can be hard-coded into the function. 
 Here&#x27;s the problem:
 1) I&#x27;m running windows native build.
 2) I&#x27;d like it to run every hour without needing emacs to be open.
 Those two problems together put it way out of my knowledge area. I could probably figure out how to pipe the command to a text file, and I know I&#x27;ll want to use Task Scheduler to do the update timing, but how do you tell emacs to spit out that much data without opening it? It seems like it&#x27;s going to be difficult.

                    <span>Hi, I am working on setting up Emacs as essentially a Mariadb dev environment. I am wondering is any other SQL devs out there have figured out if/how emacs can export data from a SQL query output to a CSV. I have seen that Org-mode can do table exports, but it seems that it can only do that for exports made from Org tables and not database tables. (also, somewhat new to emacs and I have really messed with org-mode at all so I might be misunderstanding how all that works).

                    <span>Hello everyone,
 I have had a problem with emacs for a while (occurs in 25.3, 26.3 and 27.2 all the same) when trying to save files in certain folders on Windows. I get the following error message:
 Debugger entered--Lisp error: (wrong-number-of-arguments #f(compiled-function (ad--addoit-function filename &amp;optional wildcards) #) 6) ad-Advice-copy-file(# &quot;d:/Sync/testfile.txt&quot; &quot;c:/Users/user/AppData/Roaming/.emacs.d/backups/!drive_d!Sync!testfile.txt~&quot; nil t t) apply(ad-Advice-copy-file # (&quot;d:/Sync/testfile.txt&quot; &quot;c:/Users/user/AppData/Roaming/.emacs.d/backups/!drive_d!Sync!testfile.txt~&quot; nil t t)) copy-file(&quot;d:/Sync/testfile.txt&quot; &quot;c:/Users/user/AppData/Roaming/.emacs.d/backups/!drive_d!Sync!testfile.txt~&quot; nil t t) backup-buffer-copy(&quot;d:/Sync/testfile.txt&quot; &quot;c:/Users/user/AppData/Roaming/.emacs.d/backups/!drive_d!Sync!testfile.txt~&quot; 438 ((acl . &quot;O:S-1-5-21-1032860327-2127226913-1604572573-1001G:S-1-5-21-1032860327-2127226913-1604572573-1001D:(A;;FA;;;BA)(A;;FA;;;SY)(A;;0x1301bf;;;AU)(A;;0x1200a9;;;BU)&quot;) (selinux-context nil nil nil nil))) backup-buffer() basic-save-buffer-2() basic-save-buffer-1() basic-save-buffer(t) save-buffer(1) funcall-interactively(save-buffer 1) call-interactively(save-buffer nil nil) command-execute(save-buffer) 
 What exactly &quot;certain folders&quot; means I am not so sure about myself unfortunately. I can give a couple examples:
  
Standard Windows folders (e.g. &quot;Program Files&quot;)
 Folders managed by the App &quot;Sync&quot; (syncs local files with cloud storage)
 The Goolge Drive App, which does basically the same, does NOT give me this issue UNLESS I share the folder in question with other users
 My work-pc is managed using Windows Intune, on this device a cannot save a file anywhere using emacs
  
I really hope someone has an idea, I am completely lost here. Thanks in advance!

                    <span>What would be the idiomatic replacement for Racket&#x27;s in-cycle in Emacs Lisp?
 Simple example and totally not something I use: 
 #lang racket (define (mock msg) (list-&gt;string (for/list ([c msg] [f (in-cycle (list char-downcase char-upcase))]) (f c))))

                    <span>As of recent, I have been getting this error:
 byte-code: Symbol’s function definition is void: org-file-name-concat 
 whenever I called org-roam&#x27;s (org-roam-node-find) function.
 I was getting this error on a Linux machine (Arch) and on an Mac machine, both running Emacs 27.2. I tried installing v. 28, but the problem persisted.
 I then noticed that, if I loaded and evaluated the file org-compat.el (in org-mode&#x27;s lisp directory), the problem didn&#x27;t occur. The function referred to in the error message (org-file-name-concat) is defined in that file, and is conditional upon a specific version of Emacs.
 I discovered that the problem was caused by an incompatibility of sorts between the (old) version of org-mode installed with Emacs on my machines, and the (newest) version of org-roam installed by straight.
 Apparently, Emacs loads the old, default version of org-mode rather than the newer one installed later by straight (something which other users have noticed before).
 My fix consisted in deleting the old version from my machines.
 On Linux, I deleted the org directory on /usr/share/emacs/27.2/lisp/
 and on Mac, on /usr/local/Cellar/emacs-plus@27/27.2/share/emacs/27.2/lisp/
 I wanted to shared this information with other users who might be experiencing similar issues.

                    <span>I often run emacs in terminal by &#x60;emacs -nw&#x60;.
 When using Wayland/Sway, how can I copy a text region out of emacs to another window?
 When I use Ubuntu with X, I can do that by selecting the region, and alt+shift+\, and type &#x60;xsel -bi&#x60;.
 Thanks.

                    <span>I have tried to install Doom Emacs on a couple of VMs this evening (ArcoLinux and Manjaro) and it will not install. I get:
 &quot;There was an unexpected error&quot;
 &quot;Error: could not find package gitconfig-mode...)
 I noticed this post earlier on this subreddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/qcec4k/gitmodes_now_available_from_nongnu_elpa_and_melpa/
 I&#x27;m assuming this is causing the issue?

                    <span>I&#x27;ve written a transient.el menu with enough columns of shortcuts that the text starts to wrap at the right part of the screen when viewing on a smaller laptop display. Is there a best practice to modify the size of a transient&#x27;s window? Ideally I&#x27;d like to remove the wrapping continuation lines of the transient&#x27;s buffer, as the wrapping disrupts the layout of all the text. I&#x27;d also like to limit the transient window&#x27;s height, though I&#x27;ve been playing around with transient-display-buffer-action without luck. If I could limit the window height and width, I&#x27;m guessing transient-scroll-up and transient-scroll-down would allow me to see whatever parts of the transient buffer are hidden by making the window smaller...
 The only working solution I&#x27;ve found is to use the predicate keywords (e.g., :if, :if-nil) to change up my transient&#x27;s column arrangement depending on which computer I&#x27;m on, for example:
 (transient-define-prefix my-transient () [&quot;MISC&quot; [:if (lambda () (string&#x3D; system-name &quot;MY-LAPTOP&quot;)) (&quot;R&quot; &quot;Avy Char in Line&quot; avy-goto-char-in-line) (&quot;P&quot; &quot;Pop Mark&quot; avy-pop-mark) (&quot;DEL&quot; &quot;Other Buffer&quot; other-window)] ] [&quot;Help&quot; [:if (lambda () (string&#x3D; system-name &quot;MY-LAPTOP&quot;)) (&quot;SPC&quot; &quot;Avy char&quot; avy-goto-char)] ]) 
 But I would prefer the solutions in the first paragraph if possible. Thanks for any help!

                    <span>I&#x27;d like to build a fairly complicated scan operation (basically there&#x27;s a stream of bytes and the scan needs to identify key values and form &quot;sentences&quot;). For code cleanliness reasons I&#x27;d like to put that in a transducer, but I don&#x27;t see a relevant transducer method in https://javadoc.io/doc/dev.zio/zio-streams_2.12/latest/zio/stream/ZTransducer$.html. Fold is the closest thing, but to form sentences I need history. Is there a reason it&#x27;s impossible to do as a Transducer?

                    <span>So I love Scala. It&#x27;s the kind of love that every time I try to explore some new language, Scala comes in the way whispering &quot;this language lacks this and that&quot;.
 I&#x27;ve tried Rust, Go, Kotlin, Clojure, and more. None of them is as awesome as Scala... And I&#x27;m good, really good actually.
 (Yet... What&#x27;s with Travis Brown? Holy fuck, is this guy&#x27;s purpose in life is to slowly suffocating the community?)
 Besides that... At some point it felt like it was evolving crazy fast. There was a new shiny amazing library to explore every month... And now there&#x27;s just promises in the air and Scala 3 hasn&#x27;t really taken off, and seems like it just won&#x27;t.
 There&#x27;s also the job offers. From what I&#x27;ve seen, only some companies in Europe are hiring (mainly in the Netherlands), and the positions they offer are that of a Senior Scala Engineer with no possibility of growing.
 Also, the speed in which the Scala ecosystem grew in the previous years left every company using Scala, having a mix of styles in their software. Some using Play, and then Akka, and then Http4s (with tagless final) and then ZIO and modern functional effects libraries.
 I feel like I fell in a pit of overspecialization and now I can&#x27;t leave.

                    <span>Scala-native is exciting! Looking forward to not having to use sun.misc.Unsafe to escape performance issues due to GC pauses.
 But will scala-native be able to run without a mandatory GC since scala-library itself does not allocate and deallocate memory manually?
 If a GC is required then does that mean that the problem of &quot;having a mandatory GC&quot; &amp; &quot;GC pauses&quot; (similar to JVM) also exists in scala-native unless there is a version of scala-library written in scala-native?

                    <span>I’m new with VSCode and confused about shortcuts for something like methods override/implement, etc. Can I use shortcuts like in Intellij?

                    <span>Type-checking plugins for GHC are a powerful tool which allows users to
inject domain-specific knowledge into GHC’s type-checker. In this
series of posts, we will explore why you might want to write your own plugin, and how to do so.
I: Why write a type-checking plugin?
II: GHC’s constraint solver
III: Writing a type-checking plugin
In this first blog post of the series, I’ll be outlining a few
examples that showcase some limitations in GHC’s instance resolution
and type family reduction mechanisms. With a type-checker plugin, we
are no longer restricted by these limitations, and can decide ourselves
how to solve constraints and reduce type families.

Instance resolution
Recall how GHC goes about instance resolution, as per the user’s guide.
A typeclass instance has two components:

                    <span>The problem with Emacs and its modes is that you can not simply install something and click some minutes around to get an idea about if it could fit your needs or not. Some question comes up with all the (for me) known possibilities with ZK around emacs.
In the context of ZK I currently started using zetteldeft which is build on deft.
What is the difference between zetteldeft and deft - in description of feauters?


What is the difference between org-mode and org-roam?


Do I understand it correct that org-roam use sqllite database instead of plain text files? In that case it would be disqualified for ZK.


What is the diff between org-roam and zetteldeft?


Any other suggestions in the context of Emacs here?</span>

                    <span>I am pleased to announce that I have released Git-Modes on NonGNU Elpa as well as on Melpa. Git-Modes provides three simple major modes for editing Git configuration files.
 Previously these modes were available from Melpa as three separate packages named gitattributes-mode, gitconfig-mode and gitignore-mode. These packages have been removed and you should remove them locally too and then install git-modes, but make sure that it is already available before you do. That can take a few hours.
 The motivation for merging the packages into just one is that while many users may only regularly edit .git/config and maybe .gitignore, it is not such a bad thing if a major mode is ready to go when they first open .gitattributes.
 More in the announcement.

 As in the title; I can&#x27;t even change states, and the indicator in the modeline stays the same regardless of the keys I press.
 Any help would be greatly appreciated!

                    <span>So I downloaded a docker-compose.yml and it&#x27;s filled with comments. Before I do anything drastic and try and do actual work and make it myself, is there anything out there that will go from code to literate code?

                    <span>First, thanks to everyone for all their help and suggestions to my previous questions in this subreddit - very grateful to hear the cumulative experience of many Emacs users!
 My question here is about generating images from LaTeX source blocks in .org files
 The following source block (edited down to a simple use case) works fine and produces a .pdf, but this does not appear in the document when using org-display-inline-images.
 #+header: :packages &#x27;(&quot;\\usepackage{tikz} \\usetikzlibrary{shapes.geometric, arrows} &quot;) #+begin_src latex :file figure.pdf :results raw file \begin{tikzpicture} \draw[red,thick,dashed] (0, 0) circle (1cm); \draw[blue, thick, dashed] (0.5, 0) circle (1.5cm); \end{tikzpicture} #+end_src 
 Changing :file figure.pdf to :file figure.png results in a tiny image with all…</span>

                    <span>Hi, 
 I am using pdf-tools and when I call the outline buffer, it open in a vertical split. Is there any way to make it open with say, a fixed width instead? I have looked around for this in other people&#x27;s configs and can&#x27;t seem to find anything. Thanks!

                    <span>Hi everyone, 
 I’m a fairly new emacs user (I’m using doom emacs) and I wonder if it’s at all possible to make company add brackets to a function call so for example it inserts print() instead of print and makes me insert brackets by myself. Thanks in advance!

                    <span>Hello, 
 Recently, I learned about the starship prompt and i quite liked it. Since I use the eshell a lot i would like to know if there is a way to use the starship prompt with eshell. 
 I have already read about the Eshell on emacs wiki and the Starship guide but since I have zero idea about the lisp language i wasn&#x27;t able to figure something out.

 I haven&#x27;t written any decent elisp code for ~3 years now and admittedly I have forgotten the little elisp knowledge I used to have. Upgrading doom-emacs has been a challenge for me as it&#x27;d be difficult to deal with possible breakage. (Also, sorry to admit that but I have also shifted some editor usage to neovim.) I am not able to properly maintain https://github.com/MaskRay/emacs-ccls anymore. There has been a few client-side issues I would probably never know how to address.
 Would it be a good idea to merge emacs-ccls into lsp-mode and take advantage of the large community? :) Apologies that I probably am not able to help much on the migration...
 If you are interested, please let me know. If you use emacs-ccls, please show your interest, it may help someone to get decided:)
 Feel free to rename functions or variables. I still know how to adapt my key bindings:)

                    <span>I love emacs zone, to fool out peoples. It feels i&#x27;m some kind of mythological creater or some hacker type. But,
 When enabling zone, it runs on different buffer removing current buffer code, It makes me very unintresting because i&#x27;ve tabs. 
 Here is my code without using zone
 https://preview.redd.it/bg9vezz4jmu71.png?width&#x3D;1480&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;6f27a94d010855b1fcb4207e14420db8a7d80907
 when not enabling zone, my tabs, (config.el, packages.el) remains same and i&#x27;m ok with that.
 ​
 ----- but when enabling zone this happens in tabs
 https://preview.redd.it/enzxyewajmu71.png?width&#x3D;1920&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;923dbd01bb66a6674d23b2d54359f28a35e33cec
 It runs another buffer zone with other hidden buffer, and it looks so clutter and unromantic.
 ​
 Is there any way to use zone on the top of that code rather than opening to saperate buffer like in image 2, (with like that showing other tabs, than the tabs i&#x27;m running. I just want to on top of my code. 
 Thank you

                    <span>I have fixed a warning from flycheck about using forward-line instead of next-line, but the warning still remains.
 Is there some kind of state caching which causes this?
 What is odd is that the underlining is on the following line, rather than the forward-line command itself.

                    <span>I installed the emacs-27 in my windows-10 PC using WSL2(Ubuntu). Everything works as expected (like in a normal Linux installation) except some key bindings are non responsive. The most annoying one is the M-d (I use it for forward-kill-char/word). I suspect that this key is set to something in the windows and stopping emacs from accessing it. Any idea what it can be. I have searched a lot but not able to find the solution yet.

 From the NEWS file for v27.1
 *** &#x27;byte-compile-dynamic&#x27; is now obsolete. This is because on the one hand it suffers from misbehavior in corner cases that have plagued it for years, and on the other hand experience indicates that it doesn&#x27;t bring any measurable benefit. 
 Wut? There&#x27;s no upside to being lazy? Dang it.

                    <span>Hi, I&#x27;m trying to set up LSP over TRAMP, but having issues. Based on https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/page/remote/
 (lsp-register-client (make-lsp-client :new-connection (lsp-tramp-connection &quot;pyright&quot;) :major-modes &#x27;(python-mode) :remote? t :server-id &#x27;pyright-remote)) 
 is loaded in my emacs. 
 When a opening file on the remote, lsp-log shows &quot;Command &quot;pyright&quot; is not present on the path.&quot;. 
 If I run which pyright in a terminal outside of emacs, that is ssh&#x27;d into the remote, it returns the path for pyright: /snap/bin/pyright However, running the same from eshell returns &quot;no pyright in 
. So emacs seems to be searching for pyright on my machine, when it should be searching on the remote? I tried to add (add-to-list &#x27;tramp-remote-path &quot;/snap/bin/&quot;) based on https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/tramp/Remote-programs.html , but same result.
 How do I make Tramp find pyright on the remote machine?

                    <span>Hello!
 I’m interested in using emacs to edit my LaTeX files. For reference, I’m coming from using TeXstudio, to give a suggestion to what I’m hoping for. It seems that auctex is the de-facto standard package for editing TeX files, but do y’all have any recommendations on configuration / auxiliary packages / gotchas?

                    <span>I started doing Project Euler problems a while back using Haskell exclusively, and so far the language has worked pretty well. In particular, the language facilitates writing code using reusable components (e.g. a lazy list of primes, a function to check whether a number is a palindrome), and also benefits from utility libraries (e.g. Control.Monad, Control.Arrow, Data.List, Data.List.Ordered) and from a few other conveniences (Integer type, ^ operator). 
 Those of you who have done Project Euler with Haskell and some other language(s):
 What other languages did you use?
 How did Haskell compare to the other languages that you used?
 Do you agree with my assessment of Haskell&#x27;s strengths?
 Btw please refrain from sharing solutions to problems

                    <span>Errata: This is a repost with a different title of a post I just deleted, since the old title &quot;Is Haskell a better Python?&quot; created substantial confusion, and Reddit does not allow the changing of post titles. The original post-thread can be found here: https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/qbvfsh/beginning_programmer_here_is_haskell_a_better/
 ​
 I&#x27;m just a noob with a copy of &quot;Haskell From The Very Beginning&quot;, but I&#x27;d like to ask:
 ​
 Is Haskell a better Python? As in, Python is a deliberate attempt to make a very accessible programming language, but guess what? The textbook I just bought has 127 functional pages (albeit extremely concise ones).
 ​
 I&#x27;m wondering if Haskell might be a better Python for people beginning to code; i.e, people complain about Monads this,
 https://preview.redd.it/kqvdmwedanu71.png?width&#x3D;892&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;4165714f28e616ac30685a8095ca34fcb68427c1
 that, but a lot of it comes down to people starting with imperative paradigms.
 ​
 The benefits, likewise, are substantial. Haskell, in comparison in other programming languages, is very hard to make bad code in (because it simply won&#x27;t compile). For non-programmers coming into programming, Haskell is a way to learn to code but also to produce a relatively high-quality of code, whereas Python etc might be easier to learn, but it&#x27;s far easier to produce spaghetti code in other languages. Moreover, selling Haskell as &quot;a better Python&quot; to non-programmers also helps enlarge the Haskell community, leading to better library, compiler, and other forms of support, while making it so that many future programmers start from a functional paradigm instead of an imperative paradigm.
 ​
 Edit: I did contact Haskell Foundation about this subject, but I&#x27;d like to message them permission to post e-mail contents first, and I&#x27;d rather finish a few Haskell textbooks beforehand so I don&#x27;t feel like a poser before I do so.

                    <span>I lately grokked that Haskell just reveals the very nature of imperative program, or sequential code, that a thread of execution (by machine, as well as reasoning by human), is essentially single item (thus monadic) data dependencies chained together.
 IO has a phantom (yet magical) RealWorld item in the chain (though only at type level, not present at value level), you can imagine every IO step receives a new version of the RealWorld from the previous step. While ST has an even more general abstraction of it.
 Human brains seem to take single threaded reasoning for granted, so procedural code would appear more &quot;natural&quot; to humans. But data dependency is inherently &quot;multi-threaded&quot;, thus how referential transparency is more &quot;natural&quot; to the physical nature.
 We human perceive a single RealWorld despite multiple versions of it along the temporal axis. But thinking the data dependency way, no such single RealWorld actually exists at all, just as in Haskell (at value level).
 Then we have real difficulties in reasoning about effects (mutation done to the &quot;world&quot;) applied, if not sequentially organized. How &quot;unnatural&quot; we human are. Anyhow, imperative programs reflect this bug/feature of our cognitive workings, including monadic Haskell.

                    <span>Hi,
 I have seen that there are packages that allow you to generate (say) desktop-notifications for scheduled todo-items and the like, but what is a bit unclear about these solutions is how to make sure that Emacs is in fact running when a notification is supposed to be generated?
 Do you have Emacs always running in server-mode or do you start Emacs in batch mode every now and then via a con-job or how is this done in practice?
 Many thanks.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve always wondered this, but keep forgetting to ask:
For those of you who only use timestamps and/or alphanumeric IDs, how the hell do you find stuff?
I&#x27;m guessing you perform keyword searches, and then follow the links embedded in the notes themselves? But, especially if you&#x27;re using a timestamp, is there no way for you to simply scan through the file list and drop into a note that seems interesting based on the title?
Absolutely no judgment from my end. I&#x27;m genuinely curious who you approach your workflow, as I see a lot of diehard fans of the title-free approach, and just wondering how you navigate with it.
PS- In case you&#x27;re wondering, I use alphanumeric/tree with a title attached:</span>

                    <span>&quot;A Zettel is a Note.&quot;[1] I clearly remember the first time I read this line. The term is German, and the whole idea of a Zettelkasten was a foreign subject.  Thankfully, I could wrap my brain around an index card file or “slip-box,” because I had made a feeble attempt years ago to keep my growing pile of notes in just such a box. And because I was old enough to have used a library card file to look up books, I felt I might be able to handle this methodology for note-taking created by Niklas Luhmann.
My first recorded journal entry is around age 5 ---just a few lines of neatly penciled words describing what I did after school.  I have scattered notes and journal entries through junior and high school; however, it wasn’t until I read The Majesty of Books by Stirling W. Sill (around age 21) t…</span>

                    <span>As part of the second step of the Barbell Method of reading, I read the citations I denoted as useful to me.
This poses a problem: Reminding myself to read those citations.
I&#x27;ve attempted the following:
Add to my next actions list to add the citations to Zotero, then read them
Tag the items in Zotero that contain interesting citations
I&#x27;m kind of unsatisfied with these approaches. Not sure why. Could be a problem with my workflow or that the approaches themselves are inappropriate.
What do you think?</span>

                    <span>Q: Is there a Gmail Labs or some sort of add-on that would give each email a unique identifier similar to the one that The Archive creates?
I use Alfred to create a timestamp for YYYY.mmdd.hhmm for everything on my hard drive and in Google Drive... It makes finding and drilling down things so much easier.
One can just type in 202109301009 and boom pdf or spreadsheet shows up in finder....it&#x27;s like having an ISBN number for files. [I tend to use the format with periods.. e.g.  2021.0930.1009 since my brain reads this easier, and I can just type 2021.09 and find all files created in september of 2021]
If Gmail could do something like this automatic like The Archive, it would be so much better. 
Many Thanks,</span>

                    <span>Reading this manual is about as much fun as &quot;we need to talk&quot; with the spouse. Every once in a while, there&#x27;s a gem, though.
  Since changing properties counts as modifying the buffer, it is not possible to remove a ‘read-only’ property unless you know the special trick: bind ‘inhibit-read-only’ to a non-‘nil’ value and then remove the property. 
 The secret is out.

                    <span>edit: reposted with more clarity
 Org-refile offers the option to refile either to the top level of a file, or underneath a heading in that file - is there an equivalent for this with linking? I&#x27;m looking to write a function that will return a hierarchical list of all open Org files as well as the headings inside of them, and allow me to insert a link to any one of them, without having to leave the current buffer to store a link, or enter the heading manually.
 You can kind of patch this together using counsel-org-goto-all, which provides an alist of all headings from all open Org files, with entries (HEADER . MARKER). Just write your own Ivy action that uses (concat &quot;file:&quot; (marker-buffer (cdr x)) &quot;::*&quot; (car x)) in order to build the destination of the link and pass it to org-insert-link, then call that action on a goto-all candidate.
 However, this feels pretty bootleg, and doesn&#x27;t work when linking to files. I tried concatenating the results of calling counsel-outline-candidates and counsel-buffer-or-recentf-candidates, but this doesn&#x27;t give a nice hierarchical structure, and you have to start doing a bunch of ugly conditional stuff to tell if you&#x27;re dealing with a file or a heading inside the action. Is there a simple facility that Org or Ivy/Counsel provides in order to return a candidate list of open Org files and the headings in them, like Org-refile provides?

                    <span>Hi,
 Sorry if I disturb you with it!
 I have a working setup with lsp and mainly use org, haskell, web (and of course emacs) development ...
 Tried to config a simple layout (main and side windows only).
 I would like to share it with you maybe somebody can see it useful.
 it can help and it can be a good point to start with a working emacs ...

                    <span>I generally don&#x27;t use the mouse &#x27;at all&#x27; in Emacs, and find that some buffers showing a highlight where the mouse pointer is to be very distracting. (Maybe a theme problem of coloration?)
 ex: In Selectrum/marginalia/orderless if I hit find-file and start typing something, and the filter list is say 10 items long.. if the mouse _happens_ to be in the bottom couple inches of screen, well, Selectrum will show a full width highlight on the row the mouse is on; which can mean that as you&#x27;re typing, you&#x27;re seeing two highglight lines - the one that is targetted by seledtrum if you hit (say) return, and the one the mouse is over. Its annoying since they colour the same (maybe fixable in theme, I&#x27;ll check.) 
 Likewise, in buffer+ buffer listing, the mouse will highlight a row, as will the one I&#x27;m looking at with the keyboard.
 Changing themes (if a buffer supports a face for mouse at all) all over the place could be error prine and annoying.
 What I think I&#x27;m proposing is .. define (say) a minor mode that causes the mouse pointer to be ignored, hidden, or even blocked (don&#x27;t let the mouse enter the confines of the window the mode is applied to?) ... then I could add some hooks on say prog-mode to add this minor mode (as well as minibuffer, say). It woudl be easy to selectably add this minor mode, thus leaving everythign else to work as normally.
 *shrug*
 Any ideas?

                    <span>I love these global minor modes like Helm, Ivy, Selectrum, or Vertico, which all display a list of completions in the minibuffer that filters and updates the display with every key press. But their user interfaces are always operated only from within the minibuffer.
 Are there any Emacs Lisp packages like these which could display almost exactly what you would see in the minibuffer, but in an actual buffer as a major mode instead, along the lines of ibuffer but for listing arbitrary strings and not just listing buffers?
 I would like a tool that works in Emacs sort of like how you would use &quot;dmenu&quot; to make a menu from text taken from STDIN. But for my use case, I would like to take an arbitrary newline-separated list of strings and make an interactive menu out of it in a separate Emacs buffer. Also it would be nice to have the ability to re-order list elements, the ability to mark elements (like you would do with files in Dired), and the ability to copy the list of marked items to the kill ring or else insert the list of items as a string into some other buffer, the same way that pressing &quot;Enter&quot; in Dmenu will dump the selected items to STDOUT.
 So for example, I would maybe select a region of my text buffer, press my key chord to turn that text it into a menu buffer in a new window, filter/rearrange/select elements, then press Enter and replace the region from whence it came.
 Does anyone know of a major mode like this, or a way of configuring something like Vertico to work in the way I described? Or alternatively, is it possible to use something like ibuffer or list-buffers for displaying arbitrary lists of strings rather than just buffers?

 I tried to use c-b, which it is too much bigger. I also tried to use &quot;c-t-z&quot; zen mode, but :( it works only on that text file not other files get bigger , also same goes to &quot;c-x-+&quot;. 
 ​
 Any doctors , here, would you please help me , how can i add font size, and it would be not hard to look to codes until i die. Thank you.

                    <span>OS: Arch linux with 5.14.11 kernel.
 I compiled emacs (using the AUR package) which is currently at version 29 but I installed and compiled it when it was still version 28. 
 emacs --version GNU Emacs 28.0.50 
 In my config I have the following snippet:
 (advice-add &#x27;ido-find-file :after #&#x27;bhr/find-file-sudo) (defun bhr/find-file-sudo () &quot;Find file as root if necessary.&quot; (unless (and buffer-file-name (file-writable-p buffer-file-name)) (find-alternate-file (concat &quot;/sudo::&quot; buffer-file-name)))) 
 When I visit a system owned file like /etc/pacman.conf 
 Previously I would be prompted for a password and after I entered it the file would be opened ion a buffer read/write. 
 It seems tramp behaviour has changed though. For quite a while now I see: 
 Autosave file on local temporary directory, do you want to continue? (y or n) 
 Typing y opens the file in as buffer read/write but without prompting for a password. 
 Typing n after the Autosave prompt leads to a weird situation
 I see a message - Unsafe autosave file name
 (Buffer is opened read-only)
 New tramp buffer appears with name &quot;*tramp/sudo root@
&quot; and the following contents:
 /root 
 Try to visit again and there&#x27;s no prmopt and the buffer is opened read-only again. 
 Kill the tramp buffer. 
 I&#x27;m not sure why tramp behaviour changed but:
  
 How on earth does tramp open a file owned by root using sudo without prompting for a password? 
 Is it possible to have tramp prompt me for a password again the way it used to work.

                    <span>Tonight, I ran package-autoremove after deleting some packages manually - and every package it removed was a package in use. I mean, it removed use-package, for cryin&#x27; out loud. Along with bind-key and some treemacs auxiliary packages. This actually isn&#x27;t the first time this behavior has occurred, so I was watching for it. 
 I mean obviously, don&#x27;t use package-autoremove anymore. But wow. What is the method it used to determine that use-package was no longer need?

                    <span>Haven&#x27;t used citations in a while and wanted to understand where things stand. Org 9.5 is out, but last time I tried using org-cite it didn&#x27;t work - this big feature&#x27;s entire documentation is a single blog post. While the excellent org-ref (which I used extensively) - was upgraded and now can use CSL; should I just stick with org-ref and be done with it?

                    <span>I am working with angles that get represented as follows: the hexadecimal representation of an angle is
 def formula(angle: Double) &#x3D; Math.pow(2, 16) * angle / 360 // and then convert to byte array 
 Some examples:
  
30 degrees maps to 1555 (or Array(15, 55))
 -30 maps to AAEA (or Array(234, 170))
  
I can get it working fine for the first case:
 val transformedAngle &#x3D; BigInt(Math.pow(2, 16) * angle / 360).toByteArray 
 That yields the expected result of Array(15, 55), but putting in 330 (complement of -30) yields Array(0, -22. -86) instead of Array(234, 170) which is not what I want at all. How do I fix this?
 ​
 EDIT: I ended up doing this super manually, using the knowledge that the result of the formula must be fit in two bytes (as it is 2^16 times a number less than or equal to 1). I set
 val second &#x3D; formula(angle) % 256 val first &#x3D; (formula(angle) - second) / 256 Array(first, second) 
 IDK why this had to be so manual, but it works.

                    <span>Hello again, I&#x27;m here to ask about opinions and recommendation of mostly battle tested tools, frameworks and libraries for working with WebAssembly in this beutiful language, either on JVM or LLVM backend.
 I really enjoy using Scala for web backends (currently using it at work), and here is a little step, are there any libraries for running client-side Scala on the web? I&#x27;m impressed by how it works in F# (OCaml implementation for .NET, not realy comparable, I know), they made Balero, toolchain based on Blazor for C#.

                    <span>Coming from Java world perhaps i&#x27;m not fully achieved yet the Scala mindset of solving some problems. I&#x27;m interested in building an Scala 3 extensible app, whose behavior could be extended, customized via plugins. Bonus points if those plugins could be loaded/unloaded on runtime and their clients be notified accordingly.
 Possible solutions I&#x27;ve thinking about so far:
  
Overriding DefaultPluginManager from https://pf4j.org/ so the class can be aware of sbt generated classes (may not work with bloop/metals generated random name directories). But have trouble with Akka classloader, so I &#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;ll ever would work.
 Use https://github.com/moditect/layrry which is based on Java Modules. Not tried yet. Sbt does not recognize module-info.java which is essential for it to work. Possible solution is implement an Sbt Plugin. But, I don&#x27;t know if at the end this would work in development mode which is important.
 Mess with an OSGI runtime and spend 3 months figuring out how to make it work with Scala ecosystem.
 Implement the application around https://github.com/softwaremill/macwire and hope the wiredInModule feature (which support dynamic loading) would be ported to Scala 3 soon.
 Building a sort of dynamic bundler that compiles the application along with extensions using Scala 3&#x27;s given/implicits feature. (although technically that would not be a plug-gable architecture)
 distage-extension-plugins looks very promising but it&#x27;s no ported to Scala 3 yet.
 Using a DI framework like Airframe, but it doesn&#x27;t support dynamic loading.
 Using Guice? :-(
  
Is there any more Scala principled way of achieving that? or another paradigm that helps building a dynamic app ecosystem through plugins/extensions in Scala? or another long-term software management strategy or architecture that could work?
 PD: The reason I really really need Scala 3 is because I want to make it around new ADT implementation and use type-class derivation from them.
 Thanks!

                    <span>We&#x27;ve been looking to hire Scala developers, and we give a simple coding problem that I expected candidates to typically solve with a one-liner with a filter and a sum, but instead most all are preferring a 5-line solution with foldLeft.
 Should I take that as a sign of inexperience with the language? Are there shops that prefer foldLeft as a matter of style? Or is this one of those weird situations where the interview distorts things because candidates assume interviewers don&#x27;t want you to use &quot;built in&quot; functions? Are other companies demanding the use of foldLeft in interviews? Thanks for any insight that will help me judge fairly.

                    <span>Hi guys. Actually I was firstly going to learn scala 3 but I found that the documentation is in development and I currently might not be able to purchase a udemy/udacity/coursera/any other course, so hoping for financially free resources to help me learn. Hope you guys could relate. I want to ask, is scala 2 documentation enough to learn and clarify concepts of scala. I know a few other resources too such as, a geeksforgeeks tutorial, coursera&#x27;s courses, devdocs.io, and a few other websites. I am learning C (mainly) [ik slow pace] since march I guess and python 3 also. I have basic knowledge of some data structures too. So, if I follow above resources and practice coding on my pc, would it be enough. Have any advice, sure. I&#x27;m happy for that. idk what else to say, so. [Edit: I think I am also comfortable at command line, I use GNU/Linux OS as my daily driver.] Thank you for giving me your precious time and help.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve never fully delved deep into all of Emacs features and customization. I use Latex a lot for my math and physics assignments and I want to migrate from Overleaf to Doom Emacs.
 I have no idea how to begin, I really just want a split screen view with the .tex file on one split and the PDF file on the other split that refreshes and shows changes on every save of the Latex file.

                    <span>I&#x27;m trying to use it in conjunction with ob-sagemath, so that I can use .org files instead of Jupyter notebooks for Sage code. 
 I have Sage installed via Anaconda, so I have to use conda-env in to activate the environment variables etc. for Sage. I do the same with Python environments in org src-blocks and have no problems.
 Unfortunately I keep getting the error message 
 Error: You must set the SAGE_ROOT environment variable or run this script from the SAGE_ROOT or SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/ directory.
 Not sure what to do to fix this... (other than perhaps install Sage outside a conda environment, but I don&#x27;t really want to mess my (user) Python system)

                    <span>I don&#x27;t trust my hardware from my previous experience of losing files during tweaking around. So I decided to back everything up. Thats when i thought to keep everything in google drive.
 Pros:
 - Everything in online so you have no fear of losing them.
 - You can access them from anywhere without much configuration.
 - Its secured and scalable (gsuite is cheap)
 - Its available online all the time
 Cons:
 I have yet to face one.
 ​
 Configuration:
 - I used rclone to mount the google drive locally and then I can access it like regular directory structure. I did not face any noticeable slowdown during ivy-auto completion.
 - One issue you might face is - auto-saving. Slow-down occurs during auto-saving to remote storage so I just set a local directory as my auto-save destination.
 Here is a brief guide about my steps to set it up. (I am a newcomer so I would appreciate any suggestion.)

                    <span>Hi,
 Lately I was wondering about the most efficient/canonical way of quickly doing one thing (yes, only one) following a coundition result.
 In elisp, we have two possible constructs for that (at least?): and and when/unless.
 For exemple, at the very beggining of my configuration file, I have currently the following line:
 (when (fboundp &#x27;tool-bar-mode) (tool-bar-mode 0)) 
 From a generic point of view, is there any more value to use and instead or not?
 (and (fboundp &#x27;tool-bar-mode) (tool-bar-mode 0)) 
 Because if when is just a macro or something like that around if, I wonder if it is more efficient to directly call and?
 Thank you very much for your insight.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve had trouble getting indentation correctly configured in js2-mode for a long time now, and I&#x27;m finally just sick of it. I&#x27;m using editorconfig, and the indentation is sometimes right, but for chained calls it&#x27;s basically never correct. Here&#x27;s an example.
 const doAThing &#x3D; Promise.resolve(something).then(doSomething); 
 Looks harmless enough, right? But decide to split that line up, and you get THIS:
 const doAThing &#x3D; Promise.resolve(something) .then(doSomething); 
 Having my js2-basic-offset set to any value you care to name does absolutely nothing. What I want is this:
 const doAThing &#x3D; Promise.resolve(something) .then(doSomething); 
 I&#x27;ve tried using js2-bounce-indent-p (nothing happens when I hit ), I&#x27;ve made sure indent-tabs-mode is set to nil, I&#x27;ve tried with and without electric-indent-mode enabled (the same thing happens either way, it just happens when I type ( with electric-indent-mode enabled as opposed to when I hit  with it disabled), I&#x27;ve tried figuring this out for longer than I am comfortable admitting, and I&#x27;m just really frustrated at this point. It feels like emacs is trying to be really clever, when all I really want is for it to indent by the amount specified in my .editorconfig file whenever an indentation is called for.
 What am I missing?

                    <span>I have declared the following datatype
 data Poly a &#x3D; Poly [a] 
 and also a class:
 class Polynom p where substitute :: p a -&gt; a -&gt; a compose :: p a -&gt; p a -&gt; p a 
 I can make the datatype an instance of the class:
 instance Polynom Poly where substitute &#x3D; ... compose &#x3D; ... 
 I also want a Ratio of a Poly to be an instance of the same class; I have tried many syntaxes and language extensions, but none of them work; things like:
 instance Polynom (Ratio . Poly) where ... -- error: cannot use (.) there instance Poly p &#x3D;&gt; Polynom (Ratio (p _)) where ... -- error: no wildcards allowed type X a &#x3D; Ratio (Poly x) instance Polynom X where ... -- error: X needs another param instance Polynom (* -&gt; Ratio (Poly *)) where ... -- error: wrong kind 
 My goal is to be able to have substitute and compose work on a Ratio (Poly *); for example:
 rf &#x3D; Poly [1,2,3] % Poly [4,5,6] :: Ratio (Poly Int) result &#x3D; substitute rf 10 :: Int 
 Is this even possible in Haskell? If so, what syntax or language extension am I missing here?

                    <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;m trying to implement data schema validation through static type checking as explained in the following video between 5:23-8:46: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;BfaBeT0pRe0&amp;t&#x3D;323s
 The idea is that data schema is validated at runtime and the validations are represented as static types that can constrain the operations that can be performed on a given variable after it was validated.
 For example, let&#x27;s take a machine learning dataset with tables, and a table named &quot;emails&quot; which has many fields, amongst these are: &quot;personid&quot;, and &quot;email&quot;. A query result can be checked whether the returned data matches a set of validators, and then the returned variable will have these verifications expressed as its static type.
 For example:
 data EmailsTableColumns &#x3D; PersonId | EMail class Col a in…</span>

                    <span>Hello, I am the author of aeson-pretty, a JSON pretty-printing library compatible with the popular aeson.
 I am currently not using aeson-pretty myself, and this is unlikely to change in the foreseeable future. Yet it has a good number of dependent projects, including a few high-profile ones. So it would be a shame to abandon it.
 If anyone from the community enjoys using aeson-pretty and would like to contribute/take over, I would love to hear from you.
 Thanks!

                    <span>Hi r/haskell,
 I am Shuai. I am from a group of researchers from Monash University in Australia who are interested in making visual tools to assist in teaching and learning the Haskell language. I created the Chameleon type debugger to help Haskell programmers better understand types and solve type errors. You can check out our talk and our paper at ICFP2021. 
 If you know Haskell (whether you are a beginner or a veteran), I want to invite you to participate in my online user study (code challenge). You can check out some features of the Chameleon debugger during the study. The study is anonymous, and it will take you about 10 - 15 minutes to complete. But it will help us immensely. Click this link to proceed https://blend.ercu.be. 
 P.S. I know this is a form of self-advertisement after all. And therefore I have checked with the mods beforehand. To my surprise, they quite welcome my post here.
 Thank you,
 Shuai, Interactive Haskell Type Inference Exploration Team

                    <span>I am trying to make a simple three-argument function point-free. I saw a lot of helpful point-free „tools“ lately, including ((.).(.)…), but it‘s mostly trial and error for me using the type checker. I would love to see a systematic way to achieve this step by step, but I am also unable to see the next step. Please see my process in the comments. It’s a function calculating seconds from hours, minutes and seconds. Hints in small steps appreciated. :)
  past :: Int -&gt; Int -&gt; Int -&gt; Int --past x y z &#x3D; ((x * 60) + y) * 60 + z --past x y &#x3D; (+) (((x * 60) + y) * 60) --past x y &#x3D; (+) ((*) ((x * 60) + y) 60) --past x y &#x3D; (+) ((*) ((+) (x * 60) y) 60) --past x y &#x3D; (+) ((*) ((+) ((*) 60 x) y) 60) --past x y &#x3D; (+) ((*60) ((+) ((*) 60 x) y)) --past x y &#x3D; (+) ((*60) ((+) ((*60) x) y)) --past x y &#x3D; (+) ((*60) (((+) .

                    <span>Lists in Haskell are often used as persistent generators rather than data structures. This usually works very well, but can result in massive space leaks. Consider the contrived example below:
 main &#x3D; print leak list &#x3D; enumFrom  [0..] bigNumber &#x3D; 10000000 leak &#x3D; map (\n -&gt; list !! n !! bigNumber) [1..100] 
 I reworked this example to avoid space leaks by defining a Gen typeclass which supports generators of infinite lists:
 {-# LANGUAGE FunctionalDependencies #-} module Main where main &#x3D; print noleak genlist &#x3D; EnumFrom  [0..] noleak &#x3D; map(\n -&gt; gens !! n &#x60;idx&#x60; bigNumber) [1..100] bigNumber &#x3D; 10000000 -- For potentially terminating generators, val :: a -&gt; Maybe b and next :: a -&gt; Maybe a class Gen a b | a -&gt; b where val :: a -&gt; b next :: a -&gt; a newtype EnumFrom &#x3D; EnumFrom {value :: Int} instance Gen EnumFrom Int where val &#x3D; value next &#x3D; EnumFrom . (+1) . value idx :: Gen a b &#x3D;&gt; a -&gt; Int -&gt; b idx a n &#x3D; val $ iterate next a !! n 
 Although this approach works, simply being able to use a list would be far more convenient.
 My question: is there a way to make lists not leak space, or is there at least a solid library for non-memoizing iterators and generators?
 Edit: Thank you for the answers given so far! They have been very helpful.

                    <span>There is a legacy code base that uses SQUERYL that I need to live with. 
 Basically I want to support an API for querying data from a table with a filter. Squeryl has this lovely thing called a LogicalBoolean which from my understanding is used to deal with some nubby equality issues. 
 I would like “most people” to not have to “know about” logicalBooleans. Instead I would like to accept a function of the form
 (OrderObject &#x3D;&gt; Boolean) And then underneath the hood I transform this to an (OrderObject &#x3D;&gt; LogicalBoolean) and pass that along to Squeryl.
 Is this something that can easily be done? I assume it mustn’t be otherwise it would just be in the Squeryl framework itself

                    <span>Is it possible for org-mode agenda view to display a customized label for the week, in addition to the week number included by default? I use with my students a specific week system which does not match the week numbering in the year calendar. Therefore, I would like to have a display of a different week number which I could customize.

                    <span>So this is my story in a nutshell: So i am using vi since twenty years and never looking back. It&#x27;s so snappy, easy and powerful etc etc. I did try the evil spacemacs to get some decent IDE for doing IDE stuff. After a crack in the time space continuum somewhere in Berlin i woke up with Rust and got tricked into .. Microsoft visual code. 
 Please don&#x27;t judge me, throw the first stone if you are without sins, i mean, vscode runs on Linux and MS became Linux platinum partner so Torvalds himself took part in leading me into the valley of death and despair. However, I understood my mistake in misery and pain while writing a plugin for vscode. The attempt to map a keystroke to a JavaScript function i wrote took me more then 16 hours and many tears. And desperate cries and resentments to the cre…</span>

                    <span>I have made a minor « normal mode » for personal use, basically mapping navigation or editing commands to keys instead of self-insert-command. I mapped  in prog-mode to switch to it and it&#x27;s been serving me well.
 Recently, I had the idea of extending the normal mode bindings when a specific major mode is active. Specifically, I want  in my normal mode to call markdown-edit-code-block, but only when markdown-mode is active.
 I didn&#x27;t want to add a binding that checks what the major mode is with cond and whatnot, as it didn&#x27;t seem like a very clean or modular solution. Instead, I created a second minor mode with the one binding I need for markdown-mode and set it as a buffer-local variable. Now, when my normal mode activates, it checks whether the variable is non-nil, and calls it.
 It works, but since I don&#x27;t know everything about emacs, I&#x27;m wondering if anyone has encountered this problem before and if there&#x27;s an even simpler solution that I&#x27;m missing.

                    <span>Emacs goes back to default after I close emacs rather than applying my config file . I’ve tried quitting with the key bindings. Also I’ve refreshed emacs with m-x:load-file and m-x:eval buffer while in my config file. Doing this temporarily applies my config but than I close out of emacs and it goes back to its default. I’m using emacs on Linux.
 Edit: I wrote theme in the title but I’m talking about my config file as a whole

                    <span>I have been messing with my .emacs, so it&#x27;s possible I&#x27;ve broken something, but I have no idea what…but at any rate, as of sometime today I can&#x27;t get to any of the emacs package archives, and I&#x27;m getting a particularly odd message regarding MELPA in particular.
 Whether through package-list-packages or eww, I get certificate errors when trying to reach melpa.org, saying that its certificate has expired. However, it doesn&#x27;t expire for two months—and Emacs certainly seems to be aware of what the correct date is.

 And we have to make it so the type &quot;Fraccion&quot; is declared like this: 
 data Fraccion a &#x3D; F1 a | F2 a a | F3 a a a 
 So that functions can use Integrals as elements for the type. 
 We are desperate, since we can&#x27;t find anywhere how to make &quot;instance&quot; work like this, any help would be appreciated. Thanks!

                    <span>So I was making a little program I originally had written in (rather functional) JavaScript and wanted to replicate the functionality in Haskell, so I coded, googled some stuff every now and then, and eventually needed strip and a replace from to(which I manually wrote). I had written the entire thing (still rather small here) using the normal string (or [Char]) type. Though after reading up on how I could make a strip function I found out using Text is apparently a lot better overall and already has a strip function built-in (tho no replace from to). So I ported my program to using Text and noticed that some functionality just flies out the window which I did use quite a lot (Pattern matching for example), or is rather cumbersome to use (Concatenation, especially to normal strings; comparing with normal hard coded strings (less so than concat))
 So how should I replace such things when using Text? Constantly writing T. (as the package says one should) isn&#x27;t really all that nice either, though I mind that less. I&#x27;m mostly missing the pattern-matching/recursion stuff and being able to easily compare/concat a Text to a hardcoded string. The constant T.append (T.pack &quot;my string&quot;) myText just feels really verbose and unwieldly compared to &quot;my string&quot; ++ myText... The program does a lot of string (or well... text) manipulation, using pattern matching and concatenation quite a lot
 I&#x27;m currently on ghc 9.0.1

 Im following this tutorial ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;SadfV-qbVg8) to learn yesod better.
 but as soon as I do this :

 defaultLayout $ do $(widgetFile &quot;posts/new&quot;)\&#x60;\&#x60;\&#x60;

 I see this error

                    <span>Hi! I&#x27;m becoming fond of using ConTeXt instead of LaTeX for smaller documents. I was wandering if I could tweak org-mode&#x27;s LaTeX export function to use ConTeXt instead.
 My investigations found no pre-canned solution so far. It doesn&#x27;t seem obvious to me either: although it seem somewhat straightforward for me to convert the header and sectioning part to the ConTeXt markup, it really doesn&#x27;t for itemization etc.. I was wondering if there&#x27;s someone who has already archived it and can share his/her wisdom on this. Thanks in advance!

                    <span>Hey, I see more active people in org mode than in org roam sub reddit, so I put the question also here:
 I installed org roam yesterday and I struggle to put other properties aside the default ID property. I tried a &#x60;%^{testprop}p&#x60;
 in the capture template, but it says &quot;Capture abort: Wrong type argument: number-or-marker-p, nil&quot; I&#x27;d like to had a capture option that puts and asks properties (like : capturing a book, with the a property : &quot;object: book&quot; and another property &quot;author: &quot; that I&#x27;m prompted to fill, for instance.
 But if I remove the &#x60;%^{testprop}p&#x60;
 it works just fine if i put things like &#x60;%^{thing}&#x60;
 ... it&#x27;s just for properties that seem to have a problem. Also, I tested &#x60;%^{testprop}p&#x60; in a org capture template (not org roam) and it works fine.
 Here is my org roam part in my init file: (But if there is just a simple way you know, without debugging my init, i&#x27;d be glad too.) 
 &quot;&quot;&quot;
 (use-package org-roam :init (setq org-roam-v2-ack t) :custom ;:todo: doesn&#x27;t work (org-roam-completion-everywhere t) (org-roam-directory &quot;~/dossiers/perso/org_mode_dir/org_roam/&quot;) (org-roam-capture-templates &#x27;((&quot;d&quot; &quot;default&quot; plain &quot;%?&quot; :if-new (file+head &quot;%-${slug}.org&quot; &quot;#+title: ${title}\n&quot;) :unnarrowed t) ;:todo: doesn&#x27;t work (&quot;t&quot; &quot;test&quot; plain &quot;%? %^{prop}p&quot; :if-new (file+head &quot;%-${slug}.org&quot; &quot;#+title: ${title}\n&quot;) :unnarrowed t) )) :bind ((&quot;C-c r l&quot; . org-roam-buffer-toggle) (&quot;C-c r f&quot; . org-roam-node-find) (&quot;C-c r i&quot; . org-roam-node-insert)) :config (org-roam-setup))

                    <span>When previewing equations in Org-mode, even if the equations have multiple lines, it will only show up as a single line. Here is an example:
 ​
 Latex code
 Latex preview
 ​
 HTML export
 Is there anyway to make Latex previews appear as it should, in this case, in multiple lines?

More specifically, I don&#x27;t understand why depth is a parameter to measureDepth, where it is coming from, and how the depth is being calculated in measureDepth.

 Like anyone who is learning a new langue it&#x27;s normal to search about jobs, and I&#x27;ve notice that in almost every job description ask to you have experience em 3 languages Java, scala &amp; phyton, then, my question is: 
 It&#x27;s really mandatory knows all this languages to get a job with scala?

 It&#x27;s been a while since I&#x27;ve last coded in Scala and things have certainly moved fast. Previously, I have created a Scala 2 Play API project as a learning exercise. Would you be able to give it a quick browse, and advise how I could upgrade/improve it to leverage Scala 3 features? Thank you!

                    <span>I have recently been reading through notable &quot;commencement addresses&quot; by famous people, some of whom I recognize and admire, such as John Brodsky, Kurt Vonnegut, Bill Watterson, Neil Gaiman and Richard Feynman (and many others).  It struck me that this material would be an excellent source for people new to the Zettelkasten world, who might like to practice writing zettels from short and interesting (but not too demanding) essays.  It might even prove to be the source of some zettels that you want to include in your own ZK 
See: https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/05/20/the-best-commencement-addresses-of-all-time/
My apologies that these seem to be US-centric, likely due to the predilections of the person preparing the compilation.  If there are other sources of which you are aware, from other countries or cultures, please post a (some) link(s) to them.</span>

A Zettelkasten is a personal tool for thinking and writing that creates an interconnected web of thought. Its emphasis is on connection and not mere collection of ideas.

                    <span>I (current maintainer of Elpy) am not able to properly maintain the project anymore.
 Looking at the number of issues and PRs, the project seems to have a decent number of users and to be valuable to the community. I thinks it would be a shame to see it disappear due to my inability to keep it afloat...
 On the last discussion on the future of Elpy on github, some people showed interest in participating in its development (thank to them !). But a main maintainer to coordinate the whole thing and deal with core issues is still highly needed.
 If you are interested, please let me know, if you use Elpy, please show your interest, it may help someone to get decided :)

 ____________________
 The title is the short version. I&#x27;m new to both Lisp and emacs and there are not really a lot of paths for seriously learning Common Lisp that don&#x27;t eventually point to emacs as the best development environment for Lispers. This is great, I&#x27;ve been enjoying poking around emacs quite a bit, even if I&#x27;ve broken it a few times on the learning curve.
 Anyway, when I was poking around for options I came across Portacle an emacs fork designed to be a super portable and straight forward emacs implementation with all of the bells and whistles (like SLIME) for a Lisp developer built in.
 Portacle itself had some trouble with saving desktop preferences across sessions, UI scaling (co…</span>

                    <span>I have used ledger-cli for a while. I try to switch form cli to emacs ledger-mode and can&#x27;t figured it out how can i setup ledger-mode for multiply files.
 My config looks like
 meta.txt - description of account and commodity
 account Assets account Spending account Grocery alias Food account CreditCard .. and so on 
 main.txt - link to specific records file
  ... include 2020.txt include 2021.txt 
 2021.txt - specific file with transactions
 .... 2021/10/16 Grocery shop Food $50.00 CreditCard 
 And there is a problem, when a try to run any command on file 2021.txt, for example C-c C-o C-r bal, i have an error
  
Report: bal
 Command: ledger -f 2021.txt bal
 While parsing file &quot;2021.txt&quot;, line 6:
 While parsing posting:
 Food $50.00
 Error: Unknown account &#x27;Food&#x27; 
  
When i run command at main.txt it works just fine

                    <span>I have always wanted to write a completely hackable text editor which can be changed on the fly. I feel Emacs is the best when it comes to that.
 While I may start someday, what would be a good language to write it in? In my limited knowledge, the language should have the following properties:
  
It should be interpreted, not compiled
 It should have fast execution speed
 It should have good GUI-building capabilities
 It should be backward compatible
  
While many may suggest python, would that be good enough? I&#x27;ve heard it has slow execution speed and is not af all backward compatible. I could be wrong.
 Also, I believe the first step to writing such an editor would be writing an interpreter for the language in C/C++ and then writing the editor in that interpreted language? Isn&#x27;t that how Emacs is written?
 I would really like your inputs. I know the question is really broad but I guessed Emacs veterans on this sub would be best qualified to answer my questions. BTW what do you guys think of TCL/TK?

                    <span>i am working on C++ source that uses no indentation for C++ namespace. is there a way to add a comment in the file to tell emacs that at that particular line it should assume the indentation level to be at zero or to ignore specifically marked curly braces?
 i do not want to configure namespace indentation in general and i do not want to know how to do it (non-portable) with the help of lisp in my own configuration file.
 is there magic which can be added in comments to affect indentation on the fly?

                    <span>Most people use tree-sitter to just to do syntax highlighting, but that is only one of the use-cases for it. In this blog I talk about using tree-sitter to create code aware snippets for Golang in Emacs. https://blog.meain.io/2021/intelligent-snippets-treesitter/

                    <span>liftA requires Applicative, which requires Functor, so if you can call liftA on something, fmap should already be defined for it. How does it work?

                    <span>Alright, I know this isn&#x27;t really a Haskell question per se (being about emulating a Haskell language feature in another language) -- but I figured posting here would give me the best probability of getting an answer.
 Some of you may know that profunctor optics have been spotted in an open-sourced part of the Minecraft code-base, among other things. 
 While this is neat, emulating profunctor optics in Java (though I haven&#x27;t looked at the actual encoding in the library) seems relatively straightforward to me: Java interfaces with generic methods can be used to encode rank N types, and a lightweight encoding of higher-kinded-types in langues with only first order generics is well-known.
 What I&#x27;m interested in with this library is the among other things. I noticed in the library documentation that (at least according to package naming scheme), this library also seems to have an encoding of type families in Java. This seems to be backed up by the fact that one of the linked papers in the readme of the project also uses type families. 
 This is more surprising to me. I know Java generics are Turing complete, but as far as I know, there are no academic results that would lead me to believe that type families can be emulated in Java (as I remember, the paper essentially uses an encoding of grammars as a kind of fluent interface in the proof of Turing completeness).
 Does anyone know anything about this seeming emulation of type families in Java? Has anyone tried to wrap their head around it, or know of any academic papers on how this works, or is this encoding a novel result applied just in this code-base , that has yet to be rigorously studied?

                    <span>Hi all
 I recently got a used copy of Programming in Scala 2nd edition. I realized now that it might be outdated.
 Should I try to find a newer edition or would this do ?
 How much of a difference is there between 2.8 and 3.* now?
 Im a complete beginner in Scala.

                    <span>I have created basic code to create objects and upload them to a etcd database. The code is :
 //case class Teacher(firstName: String, lastName: String, age: Int) case class Country(name: String, region: String, population: Int, area: Int, popDensity: Int, coastline: Int, netmigration: Int, infantMortality: Int, gdp: Int, literacy: Int, phones: Int, arable: Int, crops: Int, other: Int, climate: Int, birthrate: Int,deathrate: Int, agriculture: Int, industry: Int, service: Int) object HttpJsonPostTest extends App { // create our object as a json string val country &#x3D; new Country(&quot;Lucas&quot;, &quot;luc&quot;, 32) // ignore this, itds not part of what im currently trying to achive val countryAsJson &#x3D; new Gson().toJson(country) // add name value pairs to a post object val post &#x3D; new HttpPost(&quot;http://127.0.0.1:2379/v2/keys/big_data_course1&quot;) val nameValuePairs &#x3D; new ArrayList[NameValuePair]() nameValuePairs.add(new BasicNameValuePair(&quot;value&quot;, countryAsJson )) post.setEntity(new UrlEncodedFormEntity(nameValuePairs)) // send the post request val client &#x3D; new DefaultHttpClient val response &#x3D; client.execute(post) println(&quot;--- HEADERS ---&quot;) response.getAllHeaders.foreach(arg &#x3D;&gt; println(arg)) } 
 But now im wondering how do i feed the object data from a CSV file, parse each data into the corresponding part like country etc ?
 And be able to view it in

 I wonder how to write parallel sum program in ZIO. More precisely I want to write a program which transforms a list of ints into its sum in parallel.

 But when i load it in http i only get the value : 
 action &quot;get&quot; node key &quot;/big_data&quot; value &quot;Marius&quot; modifiedIndex 11 createdIndex 11 
 while others get lastname and age as well, but i cannot understand why i dont but they do. I followed the same instructions as they did. Does someone have an idea what went wrong ?
