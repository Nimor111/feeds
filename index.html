                              <span>Hi! 
 I need to add to a Haskell tool the ability to communicate with gitlab, github and jira/bitbucket.
 Do any of you use the following libraries in production?
  
https://hackage.haskell.org/package/gitlab-haskell
 https://hackage.haskell.org/package/github
  
Would you recommend any alternatives to those?
 Do you know one for jira? I need to interact with issues, merge requests, comments, etc.
 Thanks,
 Ivan

                              <span>I need to create an system that tracks entities in 3d that moves around in a 3d structure. 
 Entities send observations to a server and the server responds with a decision where the entity should go to.
 My problem is that this type of thing is high risk and so should be correct. So i instantly thought of haskell. However i am not sure if I can do this with a 2 man team. This is basically 3d path planning with constraints. It should be able to read 3d objects formats and so on. 
 Another factor is speed. Several entities will connect to this and the system should not instruct to entities to move to a space such that at least 2 entities will occupy the same space(a cube or sphere or radius R) at the same time.
 Is Haskell the right language for creating, basically a hive mind? 
 Note: entities are robotic ants in a synthetic 3d structure and communicate via a small embedded chip.
 The ants might use c++ just for query and receive. The computations will happen on the hivemind server

                              <span>xref.el is a great way to navigate, but unfortunately it is only relevant for programming language navigation.
 I don&#x27;t find a way for xref.el to manually/automatically mark the current point to provide forward and backward navigation.
 Now: empx.el is here.
 empx.el can be based on:
  
Idle time
 Trigger function
 xref.el triggering method
  
Mark the current point to provide more forward and backward navigation records.

Harder-Coded: Simple Newtypes are for Scrubs by Curtis Chin Jen Sem
There’s quite a few fun and nifty things you can do in Haskell to avoid developer error. One notable one is the usage of newtype, which some other languages have adopted. It avoids parameter blindness and ensures values are only used in specific locations. The trick I’d like to show right now, is to use DataKinds (…</span>

                              <span>Hello there!
 I keep a backup of my google calendars in sync in a folder using https://vdirsyncer.pimutils.org/en/stable/, that in it self uses the vdir standard (https://vdirsyncer.pimutils.org/en/stable/vdir.html), meaning a folder with a bunch of .ics items.
 I&#x27;d like to know if there is anything I can do to integrate it with org-agenda. Meaning I&#x27;d like all the items to appear in org-agenda and org-agenda being able of modifing/creating/delete any .ics.
 Would I have to keep running imports/exports from/to a calendar.org? How would you approach this?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Anyone use orgmode or something similar on Neovim and with mobile app? Currently I only use Emacs for orgmode and for mobile app I&#x27;m using Orgzly-Revived. 
 In Neovim, last I checked Neorg plugin is the most promising org-mode-like (it doesn&#x27;t fully support .org file which is fine for me)--it has a mobile app as part of its roadmap but there&#x27;s been no progress for 2+ years. 
 What I like most about org-mode its org-agenda features (and plugins like org-super-agenda and org-ql that make it easy to view TODOs with preset filters).
 Something like VimWiki or markdown-like TODO lists aren&#x27;t suitable because they are too close to &quot;text-based&quot;, e.g. it&#x27;s not nearly as powerful when it comes to searching notes where it naively simply searches by words (I use org-goto to search TODO headlines which usually yields desired results quicker). Hotkeys to set deadlines, TODO state, tags, and priorities are very convenient. 
 A mobile app makes it super easy to quickly add a TODO note when random thoughts come up. The widget on the Orgzly-Revived mobile app e.g. shows my updated (via Syncthing) shopping list on a homepage of Android so I don&#x27;t even have to open the app (I can also select a pre-configured sets of filters to view their results from the widget, e.g. upcoming deadlines, etc.).

                              <span>Hi all,
 If I want to reduce the margins of a presentation (I usually have plots, I need the maximum screen real estate), I have to do it in the final version directly in the .tex file, which is annoying. 
 I have to add the simple command : \setbeamersize{text margin left&#x3D;5mm,text margin right&#x3D;5mm}, but it has to appear after the beamer theme. But org export settings seem to put the theme at the end of the preamble, or at least after #+latex_header or #+latex_header_extra. Any ideas ?

                              <span>Hi, 
 I&#x27;m the maintainer of Peloton, an actor library for Cats Effect that has recently been accepted as a Typelevel affiliate project. 
 While being heavily inspired by Akka, the main goal for Peloton was not to be as close to Akka as possible, but to adopt modern Scala 3 and make use of Cats Effect.
 To this date, most of the features incorporated into the project originated from personal requirements, but now, especially as an affiliate project, I need some feedback and feature ideas from the community. I created a discussion over at the GitHub project for this. Please join and discuss if you&#x27;re interested in Peloton. Of course, new contributors are also always welcome. 
 Thanks!

                              <span>given a type of data, how to know which functions accept it as an argument ? I am used to the dot (.) notation in other languages when I want to discover what operations are related to a type.
 I find myself asking copilot alot in Haskell, to the point where he is piloting and I&#x27;m just taking notes, what do you guys do ? is reading docs the only way to figure out what functions accept what types ?

                              <span>Hi everyone! Hope this message finds you well. I found this sub recently, and am curious about any uses this programming language might have for someone like me and the potential fields I&#x27;m interested in (consumer electronics, aerospace, automotive, etc.). I&#x27;m already well versed in Python and Matlab, and their purpose as a Mechanical Engineer, but is Haskell worthwhile to learn as well, or is it more suitable for more software oriented roles?

 I was editing some html doc files and found myself reaching for VS Code to find/replace stuff across many files. I&#x27;d like to move this task into my Emacs workflow. Or maybe a command line powered technique (ripgrep?) I can wrap in an Emacs function.
 How do you find/replace?

                              <span>As an experiment I&#x27;m trying to generate several defuns with one macro.
 I&#x27;ve come this far: &#x60;&#x60; ;; This works. If I run(msg 7)I&#x27;ll get amsg-7 ;; defun that if called prints &quot;7&quot;. (defmacro msg (n) &quot;Make amsg-&#x27; function that prints N.&quot; (let ((cmd (intern (format &quot;msg-%s&quot; n)))) (defun ,cmd () ,(format &quot;Message%s&#x27;.&quot; n) (interactive) (message &quot;%S&quot; &#x27;,n))))
 ;; Creating many of these at a time like this though ;; just doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything. (defmacro msg-many (m) &quot;Make many (0 .. M - 1) msg-&#x27; functions.&quot; (dotimes (n m) (msg n))) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;m missing something fundamental here. But how would I go about &quot;calling&quot; (or perhaps &quot;expanding&quot;?) a macro several times with different in-data?

 I am currently writing a package to simulate ACME. So far I have gotten mouse button functionality and mouse chording, but the buffer I&#x27;m using to display tag commands is 4 lines height. I would like to make it exactly one line.

                              <span>A new v0.3.0 release of hyperdrive-org-transclusion is now available on NonGNU ELPA. The main change is that this org-transclusion extension can now be activated/deactivated with the new global hyperdrive-org-transclusion-mode.
 Setup instructions have changed. In your init.el, please replace
 (with-eval-after-load &#x27;org-transclusion (add-to-list &#x27;org-transclusion-extensions &#x27;hyperdrive-org-transclusion) (require &#x27;hyperdrive-org-transclusion)) 
 with
 (with-eval-after-load &#x27;org-transclusion (hyperdrive-org-transclusion-mode +1)) 
 Please see the hyperdrive info manual for installation and setup instructions. hyperdrive-org-transclusion augments the org-transclusion package by Noboru Ota by allowing you to transclude hyperdrive content over a network. You can also transclude specific Org document headings by linking to them.
 This package is similar in nature to org-transclusion-http, which also lets you transclude content over the network (HTTP, not hyper).

                              <span>Hi!
 I recently switched to emacs for rust development.
 As you can see in the following picture, eldoc which is used by Eglot just writes down the documentation of a function/variable etc. in the window on the right side without any syntax highlighting or colors.
 https://preview.redd.it/hbye62r71dwd1.png?width&#x3D;2786&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;9bcbf1cf00c10227863b6ec14482730da89f13e0
 Is there any option, or plugin I am missing to get the output of eldoc with syntax highlighting? I found nothing In the documentation.
 This is the part of my LSP Config in my init.el
 (use-package eglot :ensure nil :defer t :bind (:map eglot-mode-map (&quot;C-c a&quot; . eglot-code-actions) (&quot;C-c d&quot; . eldoc) (&quot;C-c f&quot; . eglot-format-buffer) (&quot;C-c r&quot; . eglot-rename)) :hook (rust-mode . eglot-ensure)) (use-package rust-mode :ensure t :defer t :init (setq rust-mode-treesitter-derive t rust-format-on-save t)) 
 Thanks for any informations!

                              <span>I&#x27;ve decided to see how the copilot integration into emacs can work for me, and using the pre-built init.el located here https://robert.kra.hn/posts/2023-02-22-copilot-emacs-setup , I am able to get it to connect to my personal github account (at least the github website tells me I&#x27;m connected). However, I can&#x27;t actually use the feature since it just gives me a &quot;not authenticated / not authorized&quot; error when I try to do any copilot operation (such as copilot-diagnose).
 I&#x27;m wondering if there&#x27;s a way I can just use my MS account that my employer provides. I&#x27;m able to use copilot from the gizmo that is in my taskbar and on my browser, but I don&#x27;t see anywhere to change the authorization mechanism in copilot.el.
 I&#x27;ve dug into the copilot.el files a little, but I&#x27;m not really an elisp hacker and I can&#x27;t make hide nor hair of how they work - the authorization routine doesn&#x27;t have any reference to github or any other urls, just variables that don&#x27;t seem to be set anywhere.
 Ideas?

                              <span>I decided to try using symbol shortands in a new package I&#x27;m sketching and I&#x27;m enjoying it a lot, so I&#x27;d like to share an idea.
 In the beginning I did the obvious thing:
 ;; Local Variables: ;; read-symbol-shorthands: ((&quot;mypkg-&quot; . &quot;my-package-&quot;)) ;; End: 
 That I didn&#x27;t really enjoy. It looks a bit unclean and isn&#x27;t even that economic.
 But now I&#x27;m using this:
 ;; Local Variables: ;; read-symbol-shorthands: ((&quot;-&quot; . &quot;my-package--&quot;)) ;; End: 
 which means that public symbols need to be spelled out in full, but private a.k.a. double dashed symbol just need a - as prefix. So for example:
 (defun -private-fun (n) (+ n 42)) (defun my-package-api-function (n) (when (numberp n) (-private-fun n))) 
 I know some people had reservations with the notion of symbol shorthands, such as bad grepability. Maybe this approach alleviates some of the potential problems and could even be recommended as a general practice. WDYT?

                              <span>Hi r/emacs, I apologize if the title is a bit confusing.
 I use org-mode for all of my notes and logseq to view them on phone, but lately I&#x27;ve been maintaining an org journal based journal with encrypted files for every day. I was wondering if there were any apps that could let me read these encrypted org mode files as logseq does not have support for the same.
 I&#x27;m also open to using an alternate encrypted journaling system as long as (1) it is org-mode or markdown, (2) there is an android application for viewing notes and (3) I can sync files through syncthing.
 TIA!

 emacs beginner here 
 I&#x27;m currently try ti build my emacs config, but stuck with correct font naming in init.el
 I would like to use Victor Mono font, but don&#x27;t know what is correct name for this font in this instruction:
 (set-face-attribute &#x27;default nil :font &quot;???????&quot; :height 120) 
 When i put &quot;Fira Code&quot;, for example, it&#x27;s working and set up Fira Code font.

                              <span>UPDATE: OK, the problem appears to be due to the interaction of AUCTeX, with TeX-parse-self set to t, and reftex. When trying to run org-export-as-latex I get the error in question. This is the minimal configuration needed.
 (use-package latex :ensure auctex :mode (&quot;\.tex\&#x27;&quot; . LaTeX-mode) :init (setq TeX-parse-self t) (require &#x27;reftex))
 (Setting TeX-master also to t makes no difference.)
 I guess I could manually toggle the value of TeX-parse-self before any call to org-export-as-latex, but it seems like there should be a smarter solution...

                              <span>While doing exercises at exercism.org, I found a problem that includes the following line:
 import Data.Map (Map)
 What exactly does this line do and how is it different from
 import qualified Data.Map as Map
 (which I&#x27;d normally use)?
 I&#x27;ve looked at https://wiki.haskell.org/Import and I don&#x27;t see this format mentioned there (unless &quot;Map&quot; in parentheses is the name of a function which it probably isn&#x27;t because it&#x27;s uppercase). Looking at https://hackage.haskell.org/package/containers-0.7/docs/src/Data.Map.html also didn&#x27;t make me wiser.
 ANSWERED: The first &quot;import&quot; imports only the type &quot;Map&quot; (defined in Data.Map) and the import is not qualified so the type is subsequently available both as &quot;Map&quot; and as &quot;Data.Map.Map&quot;.

Is Haskell a poor choice?

                              <span>Hi all, I have been delving into Haskell. The one thing that I would like to have is a way to goto definition of functions / types. I tried to get this working via lsp server in Emacs, but the haskell-language-server-wrapper seems to hang. I&#x27;ve also tried using the haskell extension in Visual Studio that seems to at least be able to call the Haskell LSP. However, VSCode, can&#x27;t even show the definitions for functions / types in the same file!
 I&#x27;ve done some initial exploration and it seems like ghcide at some point could do this, but it&#x27;s since been merged into the main haskell language server and no longer supports this feature. It is supposed to work for local files, but alas it&#x27;s not working for me.
 This is how I &quot;git gud&quot; at new programming languages, through exploration of libraries that I am using. Go to definition is key for me. That way, I can learn how people who are experts write code. 
 I currently have a project setup using stack that I&#x27;ve been exploring, if that matters. 
 How do you do code exploration for even a small code base?

                              <span>With Haddock it&#x27;s easy to see how I can construct a value of some Haskell type. I can see the fields available in each constructor and the type expected in each of these.
 Is there anything similar to generate documentation for yaml/json configuration files?
 Think of the documentation for cabal files, for example. It has descriptions in prose of where each field can be used and the hierarchical structure of fields is not immediately evident.
 My current use case is that I have a Haskell type for the content of the yaml config file, but the audience writing these files are not Haskellers.
 An ideal solution would take a language-agnostic specification (with sums and producs of fields) and generate Haddock-like documentation which makes it clear what&#x27;s expected in the config file.
 Does anyone know of something like this?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve run into a tricky issue while trying to migrate to Scala 3. The main problem stems from a bug in Scala 2 Quill macros that affects schemaMeta. When you try to annotate schemaMeta with a type, it doesn&#x27;t return the correct type for batch actions. If you let IntelliJ infer the type, it ends up generating a massive, unreadable type with a ton of compile-time IDs, rather than a simple SchemaMeta[YourType]. This causes problems, especially for Quill batch operations.
 Here’s what happens when using the Scala 3 migration flag &quot;-quickfix:cat&#x3D;scala3-migration&quot;:
 implicit val daoSchemaMeta: YourPostgresContext.SchemaMeta[YourType]{ def entity: io.getquill.Quoted[io.getquill.EntityQuery[YourType]] { def quoted: io.getquill.ast.Entity def ast: io.getquill.ast.Entity def id1796633896(): Unit val liftings: Object }} &#x3D; schemaMeta[YourType](&quot;your_table&quot;) implicit val daoInsertMeta: YourPostgresContext.InsertMeta[YourType] { def expand: io.getquill.Quoted[(io.getquill.EntityQuery[YourType], YourType) &#x3D;&gt; io.getquill.Insert[YourType]] { def quoted: io.getquill.ast.Function def ast: io.getquill.ast.Function def id694044529(): Unit val liftings: Object }} &#x3D; schemaMeta[YourType](_.id) 
 Instead of just getting the expected SchemaMeta[YourType], you get this crazy output with compile-time IDs, which doesn&#x27;t work with Quill batch actions. There&#x27;s a related bug report here: https://github.com/zio/zio-quill/issues/1308.
 The kicker? Scala 3 requires explicit type annotations for all implicits, and we can’t bypass this even in &quot;migration mode.&quot; So, we’re stuck in a Catch-22: Quill macros don&#x27;t play well with type inference in Scala 2, but Scala 3 forces us to annotate everything, leaving us blocked by Quill.
 This essentially pushes us to go all-in on Scala 3 and Protoquill, which means a major rewrite. Has anyone else hit this roadblock? Any advice?
 EDIT Resolved: Seems like slapping @nowarn on every implicit schema allows to supress this error

                              <span>Hi, there,
My question is if I wants to learn more about Type 2 Diabetes Management, and I already know some knowledge. Then I start to write an outline with possible subtopics to explore and to check if I&#x27;m confident on these subtopics and concepts. Then it does not sound like Zettelkasten right? But I did think this approach make more sense to me in terms of studying a subject.
But if you guys have other suggestions, please feel free to speak, I just get confused on when to use Zettelkasten and what is it really.</span>

                              <span>Has anyone come across Emacs packages or code that supports the various SELinux policy definition languages such as the .te (type enforcement) , .if (interface definition) and several others?
 I did find some old (2003) code here: https://marc.info/?l&#x3D;selinux&amp;m&#x3D;106451121120495&amp;w&#x3D;2 . I wonder if something more recent and comprehensive exists.
 I&#x27;m finding myself having to deal with SELinux and manage policies so any info would help.

                              <span>Hi, all.
 I’m using vertico/orderless/marginalia and have been very happy with it so far.
 One small thing, though, is the sorting of files using find-file or find-file-other-window. I’d like the sorting to be by reverse date (most recent on top), but it gives it to me in something that looks somewhat random. I love the history of vertico for other commands, but I can’t quite get this to work.
 Suggestions?

 Emacs does everything and does it well.
 Enjoy!
 P.S. I do realise most things it can do are seperate projects.

                              <span>When checking which buffers to save with C-x s, the diff output (d option) would be displayed in a different buffer but the prompt would go back to the Save options (y, n, !, etc). Now for whatever reason, the cursor goes to the diff buffer, I have to quit the diff and then I am back to the save prompt in the minibuffer.
 Anybody else experience this issue recently?

                              <span>A while ago I came up with a function which turns Emacs + eat terminal emulator into really well integrated ssh connection manager, each connection in its own buffer starting with ssh-, it&#x27;s super handy and comfortable to work with. The one piece I&#x27;m missing is being able to quickly open the (remote) CWD in dired.
 I really don&#x27;t want to use tramp + dired to traverse remote directories, it&#x27;s terribly slow, but I&#x27;d appreciate a quick way, being in a directory at the remote host, to open dired right there. I do have a one-liner to build a path Emacs (tramp) can understand, and it even understands if it needs to use sudo:
 L&#x3D;&#x60;logname&#x60;; U&#x3D;&#x60;whoami&#x60;; H&#x3D;&#x60;hostname -f&#x60;; if [[ ${U} &#x3D;&#x3D; ${L} ]]; then echo \&quot;/ssh:${L}@${H}:${PWD}\&quot;; else echo \&quot;/ssh:${L}@${H}|sudo::/${PWD}\&quot;; fi 
 I&#x27;m looking for a good way to execute it and save the output to an elisp variable, or any kind of hack to do something similar with one keybinding/command.
 The &#x27;connection manager&#x27; can be found here: https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/1dab1b0/how_to_run_a_command_in_an_existing_eat_terminal/

 The name was bad, I hope you like punch-line a bit better. I decided to add a ton of new features here to make up for the bad name, they are:
  
Evil status
 Evil MC / and multiple cursors
 Macro recording
 Git branch and status
 Battery status
 Weather Information
 Eglot (just a little icon)
 Time
 Flycheck status
 Package updates
 Hidden vterm (and hopefully which command it runs)
 Copilot
 For macOS and Apple Music (song and artist information)

                              <span>For other programming languages, I have packages like slime, cider, clj-kondo, etc. - which majorly augment the elegance of the dev experience, compared to raw-dogging it with eglot, a language server, and a dream. 
 C++ has complicated builds, multiple build profiles, disparate build tools, etc.
 It&#x27;s a completely foreign dev experience from the languages I&#x27;m used to. (Haskell, Clojure, ELisp, CL, etc.), and there&#x27;s a swath of different dev tools, compilers, static analyzers, debuggers. It&#x27;s different. 
 I&#x27;ve seen references to CEDET - I do not know if this is still the way folks are doing things. What hacks have you written yourself to enhance your workflow? Is there a stack of modern, fledgling packages representing the future that ecosystem is moving towards?
 How are you folks doing it, in this Year of Our Stallman 2024?
 I imagine there are hackers in this beautiful digital landscape that have built a set of modern complementary packages that have evolved with c/pp as they have modernized, as well as make, cmake, gdb, and etc. 
 Thanks, and much love.

                              <span>Hello, I am asking this question to better understand what I believe to be a lack of understanding between the GHC interpreter and source files.
 When I declare fun1 &#x3D; (&#x3D;&#x3D;) in the interpreter, it is accepted and its type is deduced and shows as Eq a &#x3D;&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; Bool. Here&#x27;s an illustration;
 Prelude&gt; fun20 &#x3D; (&#x3D;&#x3D;) Prelude&gt; :t fun20 fun20 :: Eq a &#x3D;&gt; a -&gt; Bool 
 BUT, when I declare fun2 &#x3D; (&#x3D;&#x3D;) with the type declaration commented out in a source file,
 -- SOURCE.hs -- fun10 :: (Eq a, Ord a) &#x3D;&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; Bool fun10 &#x3D; (&#x3D;&#x3D;) 
 ,then attempt to link to the source file in the interpreter, there is an error which reads
 SOURCE.hs:2:9: error: • Ambiguous type variable ‘a0’ arising from a use of ‘&#x3D;&#x3D;’ prevents the constraint ‘(Eq a0)’ from being solved. Relevant bindings include fun10 :: a0 -&gt; a0 -&gt; Bool (bound at stupid2.hs:2:1) Probable fix: use a type annotation to specify what ‘a0’ should be. These potential instances exist: instance Eq Ordering -- Defined in ‘GHC.Classes’ instance Eq Integer -- Defined in ‘integer-gmp-1.0.2.0:GHC.Integer.Type’ instance Eq () -- Defined in ‘GHC.Classes’ ...plus 21 others ...plus six instances involving out-of-scope types (use -fprint-potential-instances to see them all) • In the expression: (&#x3D;&#x3D;) In an equation for ‘fun10’: fun10 &#x3D; (&#x3D;&#x3D;) | 2 | fun10 &#x3D; (&#x3D;&#x3D;) | ^^^^ Failed, no modules loaded. 
 Why isn&#x27;t GHCI deducing the type of the function when linking to the source file?

 Here is FILE.hs;
 xs :: [(Int,Int), (Int,Int), (Int,Int)] xs &#x3D; [(1,2), (3,4), (5,6)] select6thElem :: [(Int,Int), (Int,Int), (Int,Int)] -&gt; Int select6thElem [(_,_), (_,_), (_,num)] &#x3D; num 
 Next, I attempt to link to FILE.hs in GHCI and receive the following error messages;
 Prelude&gt; :l FILE.hs [1 of 1] Compiling Main ( stupid.hs, interpreted ) FILE.hs:2:7: error: Illegal type: ‘[(Int, Int), (Int, Int), (Int, Int)]’ Perhaps you intended to use DataKinds | 2 | xs :: [(Int,Int), (Int,Int), (Int,Int)] | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ FILE.hs:5:18: error: Illegal type: ‘[(Int, Int), (Int, Int), (Int, Int)]’ Perhaps you intended to use DataKinds | 5 | select6thElem :: [(Int,Int), (Int,Int), (Int,Int)] -&gt; Int | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Failed, no modules loaded. 
 I have looked at various other examples online, and can&#x27;t find a reason as to why my list of tuples of type Int,Int isn&#x27;t valid. Can someone help me find where I&#x27;ve went wrong?
 Thanks in advance!

 environment.systemPackages &#x3D; with pkgs; [ freeglut libGL libGLU ghc cabal-install libgcc];
 This other post seems to have had a similar issue to me https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/rjfigu/noob_question_about_graphicsgloss/ . But I should have these packages on my $PATH as I declared them in my configuration.nix.
 Thanks for any help!

                              <span>As I read through the Clean Architecture book, I learn about interesting metrics. One is Instability, and another one is Abstractness. I like the idea, but can&#x27;t properly see how to measure them in different FP languages. Instability might be okay, I count imports in the module, and I count how much times my module was imported. But what about abstractness, in the book it&#x27;s a percentage of the abstract classes in a module divided by total number of classes. But let&#x27;s say I write in Haskell, I don&#x27;t have abstract classes, or any other classes. I do have type aliases, data and newtype definitions and typeclasses, how can I measure abstractness in a language where not everything is a class?

                              <span>Hi want to configure a cabal package so that, when HPC is executed during testing with coverage enabled, it ignores certain definitions, for example:
  
Anything that is auto-generated (e.g., &#x60;Show&#x60;).
 Constructors and field accessors are assumed to all work.
 &#x60;Proxy&#x60;
  
I think there&#x27;s a way to extract the tix file and modify it, but I&#x27;m trying to make this automated, and configure cabal so that the right options are passed to HPC, and that way even hackage will pick it up when it reports the coverage of our library.
 Any pointers?
 (This is, specifically, for copilot-core).

                              <span>Working with the Exists ⊣ Const adjunction we can generate some wacky isomorphisms of forall a. a -&gt; f a:
  forall a. a -&gt; f a &#x3D; forall g x. g x -&gt; f (Exists g) &#x3D; forall g. Fix g -&gt; f (Exists g) &#x3D; forall g a. (a -&gt; g a) -&gt; a -&gt; f (Exists g) 
 The adjunction Exists ⊣ Const implies the existence of (. Const) ⊣ (. Exists), where (.) &#x3D; Compose:
  (. Const) hof ~&gt; f &#x3D; hof ~&gt; (. Exists) f hof . Const ~&gt; f &#x3D; hof ~&gt; f . Exists (forall x. hof (Const x) -&gt; f x) &#x3D; (forall g. hof g -&gt; f (Exists g)) 
 We now have an equation for any higher-order functor hof :: (k -&gt; Type) -&gt; Type. 
 Trying it with Applied a :: (k -&gt; Type) -&gt; Type yields forall x. x -&gt; f x  forall g a. g a -&gt; f (Exists g)
  (forall x. Applied a (Const x) -&gt; f x) &#x3D; (forall g. Applied a g -&gt; f (Exists g)) (forall x. x -&gt; f x) &#x3D; (forall g a. g a -&gt; f (Exists g)) 
 Trying it with Fix :: (Type -&gt; Type) -&gt; Type. The fixed point of the constant function fix (const x) returns the argument of the constant function: x. This against leaves us with forall x. x -&gt; f x.
  (forall x. x -&gt; f x) &#x3D; (forall g. Fix g -&gt; f (Exists g)) 
 The type-level fixed point Fix g is equivalent to the greatest fixed point data Nu g where Nu :: (a -&gt; g a) -&gt; a -&gt; Nu g. We can unfold this:
 &#x3D; (forall g a. (a -&gt; g a) -&gt; a -&gt; f (Exists g)) 
 Why not use Yoneda f (Exists g), does this give us something? Nope doesn&#x27;t look like it.
 &#x3D; (forall g a x. (a -&gt; g a) -&gt; a -&gt; (Exists g -&gt; x) -&gt; f x) 
 Ok ciao!

                              <span>Hi all,
 We are conducting a survey regarding your experience with medium and long-term maintenance of Scala projects to pinpoint the most common problems. This knowledge will help us to tune our priorities and better understand what problems projects face when they grow and mature. It will impact both our FOSS efforts and commercial offerings. I would like to ask you to fill this survey and share it with your colleagues.
 We will compile a report when the survey is finished with our thoughts, ideas, suggestions and plans for the problems discovered by the survey. You can provide an email and we&#x27;ll send the report to you once it&#x27;s available.

                              <span>Instead of making a lot of playlists with many repeated songs, like &quot;Rock&quot;, &quot;Best Rocks&quot;, &quot;Rocks from 80s&quot;, &quot;Rocks for workout&quot;, I would like to be able to tag songs similar to org tags:
 Song 1 - :80s:rock:best:workout:
 Song 2 - :anime:rock:best:workout:
 Song 3 - :funk:game:mario:cover:
 Song 4 - :rock:workout:
 And be able to build playlists based on combination of tags, for example :best: should give me songs 1 and 2, :rock:workout:, should give me songs 1, 2, 4, and so on.
 Is there some package for that today, or some similar feature in EMMS?
 I have a org file for a list of favorite games and some tags to filter games based on wether its for pc or some console, if it supports single player mode, 2P, 4P, offline party, online, coop and/or versus, and I can filter the list to find the best games to play with my friends or by myself, and it works pretty well.

                              <span>i&#x27;ve been looking for good repl for javascript.
 Something like Slime or Cider or m-x run-python.
 it needs to support:
  
auto completions in repl
 
auto completions in buffers that are connected / associated to js repl process
 
multiple repls
 
code navigation (optional, i know its hard to implement)
 
 I&#x27;ve been only able to find abandoned and/or non-working projects
  
https://github.com/NicolasPetton/Indium (didn&#x27;t work)
 
https://github.com/Gozala/slime-js (abandoned)
 
https://github.com/skeeto/skewer-mode (no auto-completion)
 
https://js-comint-el.sourceforge.net/ (no auto-completion, no associated buffer auto completion)
 
https://github.com/abicky/nodejs-repl.el (no associated buffer auto completion) 
 
 note: lsp is not what i&#x27;m looking for.

                              <span>On my Mac, when I open Emacs via an &quot;emacs xxxx &amp;&quot; command on the command line, it adds an Emacs icon to the middle of the dock (the part between the left part with icons for launching apps and the right part with icons for minimized windows).
 However, when I exit Emacs, that icon remains in the dock (middle section), so if I open Emacs (the same way) again, I get yet another Emacs icon.
 Why is Emacs and/or MacOS doing that, especially the multiple icons? 
 (But also, why is it not &quot;activating&quot; the Emacs icons that&#x27;s already in the left part of my Dock (that is, displaying the little black &quot;app is running&quot; dot below the icon)?)
 Thanks.

I heard that the emacs keybindings are quite useful aswell but also heard that they are quite hard with a soft pinky finger. I do not know the emacs keybindings and it would be easier to use it in the emacs environment as it was designed to be used there but is it really worth all the trouble?

                              <span>Hey everyone, I&#x27;ve wanted to use the &#x60;compile&#x60; command for a while but I found it annoying that it doesn&#x27;t give you auto complete based on previous commands you have run. I tried to search how to get this effect since I assumed other would have wanted it too but to my surprise my google-foo failed me. 
 I ended up reading some emacs docs and to my surprise it wasn&#x27;t that hard to do, so I want to share my solution here, potentially to help others who care about this and maybe to get feedback on my solution since over all I&#x27;m relatively new to &#x27;hacking&#x27; emacs.
 My solution involves overwritting the &#x60;compilation-read-command&#x60; function to hook it up with &#x60;completing-read&#x60;, and since I use vertico I get a nice completion ui around it in the minibuffer.
 ;; compilation-read-command uses &#x60;read-shell-command&#x60; by default, which doesn&#x27;t use ;; completion at all. So I overwrite it to use &#x60;completing-read&#x60; instead, which seems to work great. (defun compilation-read-command (command) (completing-read &quot;Compile command: &quot; compile-history nil nil command (if (equal (car compile-history) command) &#x27;(compile-history . 1) &#x27;compile-history)))

                              <span>I did a little bit of research in this, and apparently docker-tramp https://github.com/emacs-pe/docker-tramp.el can allow someone to access docker from within emacs and but now this feature is built-in in emacs &gt;&#x3D; 29. The reason I brought up even docker tramp is the website says that someone can do the same things with podman for these emacs version.
 I know there is a docker package in emacs that allows it to manage docker containers witihin emacs. But I don&#x27;t need that level of control for podman. What do I need, as the title says, is to access the podman containers. To clarify futher, what I want to do is: say when I am working on a project and I want to evaluate a snippet of code using C-c C-c inside a org src code block, I don&#x27;t want emacs to use my system&#x27;s environment but the environment of the specific container I would like to use.
 If it were a whole file, eg, I would simply enter the podman container using eshell/vterm and evaluate the document, but, when I am writing in prog-mode instead of org-mode, the formatters and linters for that program would work if they are installed in the main system. But how do I use podman containters stuff? I mean there is good document, I think, for docker but not so much for podman.
 I tried researching on this but I could not find any example code since I don&#x27;t know lisp to write my own. But I really could use someone&#x27;s help in writing one. Maybe, since docker and tramp are related, going through tramp manual I might find some help. But has anyone here tried setting up emacs the way I want and used podman? And would it be easy to set up like that?
 EDIT: Sorry for not just paragraphing it properly. But the post did not even make any sense. My dyslexia kicked in and made such brutal mistakes. Appreciate the patience, and hope the post makes sense now.
 EDIT: Just to further clarify, emacs is not installed inside the container but installed in the system.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve recently followed the getting started guide to install Doom Emacs on Windows 10 but ran into an odd issue that I&#x27;m wondering if others have seen/know the answer to.
 So within Emacs itself, attempting to reload with either &quot;doom/reload&quot; or &quot;SPC h r r&quot; opens up Notepad with &quot;doom.ps1&quot;, the Powershell file. Closing the Notepad window prompts the &quot;config successfully reloaded!&quot; message in Emacs, but fails to load any changes.
 Does anyone know what the deal is with that?

                              <span>The color and width of the window divider set by Prot&#x27;s theme is too narrow for my liking and for some reason the function I use to set it cannot change the colour and widen to my preferences.
 I believe his themes use a different method for that.
 Here is the code I use to set mine. I don&#x27;t know of there are some additional settings used for the borders my code doesn&#x27;t account for.
 (defun set-window-borders-config() (setq window-divider-default-places t) (setq window-divider-default-right-width 4) (setq window-divider-default-bottom-width 4) (set-face-foreground &#x27;vertical-border &quot;green&quot;) (window-divider-mode) )

                              <span>hi everybody
 I am trying to create a custom section to the agenda (at the end, using org-agenda-finalize-hook)
 My goal is to add some hyperlinks to files in this agenda. I am able to create the section and add text with properties, but I have discovered that org-mode style links do not work (they are simply rendered as text).
 Does anybody have any recommendation on where to look for information on how to do this? Ideally I would like to insert links similar to those already supported in org (eg. [[uri][description]]).
 Edit: surprisingly, both the URL and description are links and work! but they are not properly rendered (the braces and the uri are not hidden)
 thank you

 It was my first time creating color scheme and as templates I used other themes which were under my hand.
 What you think about it?

                              <span>This is a continuation of the thread Developers Have Jobs to Do.
 I took the time to document my experience installing emacs and bedrock, and configuring it for python development. The immediate goal is great Emacs support for python developers accessible via Github.
 https://github.com/gregfelice/emacs-dx/blob/main/emacs-dx-profile-python-developer.md
 A summary analysis: 
  
bedrock can be an accelerant leading to a good experience for python.
 work needs to be done to get to a good python development ux out of the box.
 external dependency guidance (and hopefully more automated setup) is critical.
  
Next steps: 
  
get in touch with bedrock authors. see if they could help answer some of the questions raised by the research. 
 get feedback from community: emacs-dx issues is open on github. feel free to create an issue if 1) you have some guidance (or code) that solves a problem raised by the research 2) you have something you&#x27;d like to see offered in the python developer profile.
  
Thanks.

                              <span>Hey all. When using emacs in a terminal (with -nw option), are you meant to see the autocompletion drop down suggestion list as you type? Similar to neovim? I only see this behavior when running in the emacs client but not the terminal. Am I missing something or is the maybe a problem with doom emacs?

 I&#x27;ve been trying to use Magit more and wean myself off og github desktop recently, but there&#x27;s one thing that has been bugging me. Magit seems to only accept password credentials for github pushes, but password credentials to push to github have been deprecieated. Is there any way around this? Thanks in advance.

                              <span>Hi, I like reading pdfs while them being set up to occupy the whole width of my screen so text is really large, however as I&#x27;m working in continous mode I sometimes get lost when going from one page to the next one. I want to know if there&#x27;s a way of putting an indicator or marker to the right of the pdf buffer to visually represent what the modeline already shows: top - % - bottom. Much like in the fashion of gsap markers used during development

                              <span>I just discover org-margin. I think it would be nice if I can use org margin just like org indent mode with startup options.
 I tried to look at how startup options works, but I found out that it was not designed to be easily customized. Have anyone done the customization of startup options before?
 edit: what I mean is that I want to add a startup option to enable org-margin-mode locally just like how I can do with org-indent-mode. Like #+startup: margin to enable org-margin-mode.

 By the way, hs-minor-mode is a good built-in code folding package. If you don&#x27;t want a minimal setup, try this one!

 When I open the file, Emacs automatically changes the file-endings to &#x27;Mac&#x27; conventions: Mode line:
  &#x60;U(Mac)...&#x60; 
 This is the wrong file ending convention and the script will fail when I try to run it which results in a head-scratching debugging session. Clicking the &#x27;M&#x27; and U(Mac)... changes the file ending standard to utf-8-unix and saves the file but then Tramp immediately changes the convention back to the wrong file ending conventions. This sets me up for another WTF debugging session. I&#x27;ve tried setting the file conventions with a local buffer variable but that doesn&#x27;t help as the file immediately reverts to Mac line endings after each save. I have two questions:
 Q: First, I&#x27;m just looking for a work around here. Can I put something into my: 
 &#x60;# -*- mode: shellscript; ... -*-&#x60; 
 mode line that will force my desired file ending convention? Emacs and Tramp seem to be convinced that in this environment is should be utf-8-hfs-mac when I want utf-8-unix. I&#x27;m looking for a file-local temporary fix here but google seems to be convinced that I&#x27;m better off chasing the setting of these variable each time I have a problem like this and I do actually use TRAMP to edit files on foreign filesystems irregularly. So, most of the time TRAMP gets this right, it&#x27;s just that this time, TRAMP is getting it wrong which is adding 3 items to my debugging stack making a simple problem hard to debug.
 Q: Second, I&#x27;ve searched for about 1.5 hours along the subjects of &quot;emacs line endings&quot;, &quot;emacs normal mode&quot;, &quot;emacs mode-line&quot; and none of them have answered my question. What subject should I be searching for to fix this?

                              <span>Hi everyone,I am interested in the note box system and would like to know which fonts are particularly suitable for the design of the notes.
Are there any recommendations for fonts that are both aesthetically pleasing and functional? 
I studied art and wonder if, for example, a tree in Helvetica creates a different mental stimulus than the same tree in Roboto.
Are there any studies or personal experiences on this?
I look forward to your answers!

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to create a major mode for syntax highlighting a query language that I use. However, the language has highlighting of variables in very different contexts. Where regular expressions might work, it feels far too complicated to use.
 The way forward, it seems, would be to use something that is syntax-aware. This realistically seems like the only way to do what I want.
 I asked ChatGPT and it suggested tree sitter. I know that tree sitter support is now natively in Emacs as of 29.1. I&#x27;ve never used it before.
 Is tree sitter the best thing to use for creating a syntax highlighting mode that is grammar-aware? Or would there be another way?

 Hi community. I&#x27;ve used Emacs for over 30 years. I&#x27;ve recently started using it again for python and react development. While I love some of what Emacs has to offer, it&#x27;s continued to be a frustrating and problematic ramp. It&#x27;s hard to get it where I need it as a professional developer.
 Even after all these years, I still feel Emacs has so much untapped potential, but there&#x27;s problems holding it back.
 Rather than just walk away, I decided to write up and share my ideas. I want to give back to Emacs by collaborating on a solution that gets it used and driving real value for more people.
 The document shares ideas on how to help developers quickly get productive with Emacs on the tasks that matter to them. I deeply believe we can increase the number of developers who try Emacs, get value quickly enough to use it more, and promote its virtues to friends.

 i have mapped caps key to be escape systemwide 
 but i want the caps key(now escape) to be control key while using emacs
 so wanted to know if there was in emacs to make escape key to be control key

                              <span>Recently, I&#x27;ve been trying to bind TAB to tempel-next for jumping between placeholders in snippets, but it fails in the GUI version.
 However, when I tried it in TUI, it worked successfully, which confuses me.
 &#x60;&#x60;lisp (after! tempel (use-package! tempel :bind ((&quot;M-y&quot; . tempel-complete) :map tempel-map (&quot;M-j&quot; . tempel-next) (&quot;M-k&quot; . tempel-previous) (&quot;TAB&quot; . tempel-next) (&quot;S-TAB&quot; . tempel-previous)) :init ;; Setup completion at point (defun tempel-setup-capf () ;; Add the Tempel Capf tocompletion-at-point-functions&#x27;. ;; tempel-expand&#x27; only triggers on exact matches. Alternatively use ;;tempel-complete&#x27; if you want to see all matches, but then you ;; should also configure tempel-trigger-prefix&#x27;, such that Tempel ;; does not trigger too often when you don&#x27;t expect it. NOTE: We add ;;tempel-expand&#x27; before the main programming mode Capf, such ;; that it will be tried first. (setq-local completion-at-point-functions (cons #&#x27;tempel-complete completion-at-point-functions)))
 (add-hook &#x27;conf-mode-hook &#x27;tempel-setup-capf) (add-hook &#x27;prog-mode-hook &#x27;tempel-setup-capf) (add-hook &#x27;text-mode-hook &#x27;tempel-setup-capf))) 
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; In the GUI version, TAB always triggers indent-for-tab-command. I&#x27;m using Doom Emacs with Evil mode enabled. Any insights from the experts?

                              <span>Context: Novelist/filmmaker who primarily uses NeoVim for all my prose and screenwriting, and for note-taking via Zettlekasten system since 2020. I also put together a an Integrated Writing Environment (IWE) for NeoVim for other users like me. I even spoke at a couple of NeoVim confs since then. Suffice to say I love NeoVim. 
 I also love tinkering with my computers endlessly when I am not working, naturally my brain has always been interested in seeing what emacs can do. 
 Tried Emacs for the last 3 years, but kept hitting a wall. Or just plain frustration. 
 Until I tried this Emacs kickstarter for NeoVim users.  
 And everything clicked. 
 I had a few _oh shit_ moments the last few days. Can&#x27;t say I am a convert yet - I still think Vim motions is subjectively better for pure text manipulation - but for pure hackable joy, emacs all the way. 
 So far: 
  
Moved from using Org mode in NeoVim to Emacs.
 
I give myself an hour everyday where I turn off evil mode and just use pure emacs bindings. I still feel like I am playing jazz piano but it is now almost intuitive. 
 
Started browsing some documentation sites purely through eww
 
I can control spotify?!
 
 Things that aren&#x27;t working yet: 
  
LaTeX live previewing. Can&#x27;t figure out why because my Tex installation works perfectly on NeoVim using vimtex. I&#x27;ll figure it out in a couple of days
  
Carry on. 
 TLDR: I (almost) see the light.

                              <span>I was reading a lot about the multithreading is not necessary or maybe it is implemented with (heavy) threads in emacs. If I red well we can use the async package and reach the &quot;async&quot; functionality with it ...
 So my question is that how I can preload the org mode in the background ?
 use case:
 I open the emacs every morning and I start to read a file or do something ...
 I used to open my daily.org file but I have to wait a lot because to load the org package is very slow (~5-10 sec)...
 I&#x27;m using win10 or win11 and I know it is because the windows os but I thought that maybe we can preload the org mode in the background :)
 do you know any solution for this ?
 If I think well the witheditor is working like I open a file with emacsclientw.exe ... so maybe I can use this one to preload the daily.org in the background ...
 I don&#x27;t know what is the trick in the async package so maybe any guidance is needed if I can solve this issue with this package ...
 I know we should load a package in the ui thread but what is if I open an org file with an emacsclient, will it freeze my every emacs frames for this short (5-10sec) period ?

                              <span>I&#x27;m mostly doing python programming with Python using emacs and LSP. Sometimes I switch to Code to prototype some notebooks. Now I thought the last step can also be done in org-mode which suits me better ( No switching to Code). However, I seem to be loosing all LSP functionalities and basically I&#x27;m on my own.
 Any idea how I can deal with this inconvenience?

                              <span>Been using Emacs in various terminals for the past six years with the following setup:
 Powershell: Windows terminal emulator, running wsl
 iTerm2: macOS terminal emulator
 Terminal: whatever is default installed in Ubuntu/Crostini
 Termux: terminal emulator on Android, with Unexpected Keyboard (available on F-Droid) for full keyboard
 Zsh: cross platform shell with a bunch of plugins for auto completion
 Mosh: ssh client that auto-reconnects without losing session information
 GNU Screen: Outer layer of multiplexing terminal sessions, allows switching between multiple tmux sessions in a single terminal window
 Tmux: Inner layer of multiplexing, hosts various emacs instances for whatever I&#x27;m working on
 Emacs: default keybindings, MELPA package repo, magit, various lsps (python, typescript, elixir), flycheck, company
 On system startup my launch procedure is:
 mosh , screen, tmux, emacs -nw
 Haven&#x27;t had to change any key bindings and can easily switch through panes/sessions without ever touching my mouse on laptop. 
 What is your emacs terminal setup? 
 I haven&#x27;t changed mine in years, so I&#x27;d like to hear about others&#x27; setups and try some new things!

 after compiling a binary and running it, it almost always crashes with a couple of errors:
  
bus error 
 gets stuck and then my Apple M3 Pro (36GB RAM) complains that I&#x27;ve run out of memory
 extremely rarely, I get a malloc error where it says there was some error in re-alloc.

                              <span>I mean both &#x27;deriving&#x27; and &#x27;deriving via&#x27; -- these are absolutely amazing features of Haskell. I think a lot of haskellers just use them without giving it much thought.
 But my question: what other languages offer such features? I know OCaml has its ppx mechanism that lets you do this (viz: ppx_deriving with more information on such things at the Ocaml metaprogramming page). I can&#x27;t actually think of other languages that do it in quite this way.
 Of course a lot of very dynamic languages (in the SmallTalk family) let you do this. So I&#x27;m mainly interested in 1) typed languages (sorry Racket, doing &#x27;TypedRacket&#x27; with macros is very cool, but quite different; a &#x27;deriving&#x27; mechanism *for* TypedRacket would be in scope, if it exists) and 2) where this is done in a wholly separate phase, i.e. not at run-time.

                              <span>I am an low / intermediate Java and Fortran programmer, and I am interested in broadening my knowledge beyond object-oriented programming, and since I have liking for &quot;Vintage&quot; stuff, and for high skill curves, I figured why not try Haskell. The issue is that I have been pulling my hair out trying to get VSC to run my Haskell code, and was wondering one of the following:
 Is there an equivalent to Java&#x27;s BlueJ in the respect that it is an easy all-in-one editor, compiler, and terminal that does not need any dependencies preinstalled,
 or if there is just a simple way to get Haskell running in VSC that I&#x27;m not familiar with. 
 Honestly, considering how much time I have dumped into trying to get VSC to work I would prefer an equivalent to BlueJ at this point. Considering how refined VSC is, it&#x27;s definitely just a skill issue that I&#x27;ve failed to get this to work lol.

                              <span>Hi all,
 I am wondering if one can use an org-file for cron jobs. 
 Benefits would be all the structure/folding/navigation benefit and everything (logging + code) would be in one place.
 On a theoretical level: Is this smart or dumb? Curios what your opinions are!
 And on a practical level: How can I let &quot;org-babel-load-file&quot; update the #+RESULTS section?
 I have this MWE:
 #+title: Cronjobs #+begin_src emacs-lisp :results output prepend (princ (concat &quot;I&#x27;m here because someone run the code block at &quot; (current-time-string) &quot;.&quot;)) #+end_src #+RESULTS: : I&#x27;m here because someone run the code block at Fri Oct 18 08:39:30 2024. : I&#x27;m here because someone run the code block at Fri Oct 18 08:39:27 2024. 
 But the printed results came from C-c C-c-ing the code block. Running org-babel-load-file does print the message but doesn&#x27;t modify the file...
 Best
 Jonas

                              <span>Hello lovely Emacs community,
 I&#x27;ve been coding with emacs since 1984. That&#x27;s a long time. Over the years I&#x27;ve been forced by work circumstances to use various IDE&#x27;s, including more recently vscode (like everybody) but despite adding &quot;emacs modes&quot; to these IDE&#x27;s they just were never really just... emacs.
 My young coworker asked me this week why in fact do I use emacs. He&#x27;s a thirty-something and had never even heard of it. I didn&#x27;t have a great answer... muscle memory? learned in college? macros? it works the same everywhere? highly portable? All these answers are somewhat... outdated these days. That said, whenever I&#x27;m forced to use vscode, and even think about a mouse when coding, I loathe it. That hatred of the IDE slows me down. Vscode is so visually busy with so many flyovers and &quot;he…</span>

 I have TODO items that can be there for years (ie, awaiting court ruling) and the date &amp; content of the last note is the most useful thing during a review of entries.

                              <span>Hi all. Some months ago I switched to Emacs, and right now I&#x27;m using as WM with EXWM and as clojure editor. I must say my config file is totally based in other config file I followed from System Crafter videos. I&#x27;m so happy and want to get more and more from Emacs. I use Intelij IDEA to develop on a Java project with Cuba framework, and I would like to use emacs instead. Mostly I only need autocompletion, Fast Class switching, Go to definition and so on...and launch gradle tasks like build, deploy. The things is I don&#x27;t have idea how. I followed the config from the video &quot;From Vanilla Emacs to Java&quot; but I don&#x27;t get autocompletion at all. Thanks

 The built-in latex-mode provides the latex-complete-data function for completion-at-point-functions, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to work, and it contains ;; TODO: Complete commands. in it&#x27;s source...
 How can I get latex completions? I know there are LaTeX LSPs, is that my only option?

 I am preparing a meetup for my colleagues titled &quot;Why Emacs is the Best&quot;. My goal is to increase the number of people using Emacs for development at my workplace.
 So, I’d like to ask:
 Why did you switch to Emacs from another IDE? Why do you think Emacs is the best?
 Can you share your opinion and experience

 when &#x60;C-n&#x60; on the line before &#x60;Git branches&#x60;, should focus the line &#x60;* master 48730a4 up&#x60;.
 Can you help me with that?

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I use Org-mode for task management and note-taking, and I’m wondering if there’s a voice-powered workflow to capture entries hands-free via voice commands or speech-to-text. Tools like OpenAI Whisper exist, but I haven’t seen anything that integrates them directly with Org-mode for capturing tasks or notes.
 Has anyone seen or built a solution for this? I’m on Emacs with arch and android (termux).
 Thanks!

                              <span>I haven&#x27;t figured out how to get the built-in JSON mode to handle a buffer containing multiple objects well. The needs comes up when I look at the structured logs of systems that output JSONL. And also when I use ob-http code blocks and its support for piping the response through jq (:select ).
 Is there another JSON mode that handles this better?

                              <span>So I was writing my Scheme interpreter (like everyone does) but found a problem when implementing closures. Since I use the State monad to manage the symbol environment containing the variables etc. I have to copy it to the closure. This snapshot of the environment is then used any time the function is evaluated. But that means that any changes to the env after the definition are ignored. In scheme later changes can however still affect the closures env:
 (define n 2) (define foo (lambda (a) (define m 10) (+ a n (- m 3)))) ;; everything after here doesnt belong to the lambda env currently (define n 10) (write (foo 4)) ;; should use n &#x3D; 10, but still uses n &#x3D; 2 
 I know other people have used the IORef to solve this with actual mutability, but I wanted to know if there is another way of still using the state monad, before having to rewrite my entire program.
 The lambda environment should also affect the actual environment if it mutates an outer variable using set!.

                              <span>What do you think about open source software bounties? I keep seeing them, for instance SoftwareMill offering them in the ScalaTimes letter today, or com-lihaoyi a while ago, or John DeGoes in his new Golem venture.
 They seem to offer developers a chance to contribute to open source code, hone their coding skills, get experience, and they might also be getting paid for that work.
 I considered contributing to one of com-lihaoyi bounties, specifically, implementing support for ms sql. However, I noticed someone else got the torch. And that gets to my point. You have N developers working on the same thing. Sure it works to the advantage of the entity that issued the bounties. But 1 out of the N developers will be successful. What if a developer starts working on it, then drops the ball because it turns out it is too much work and she/he doesn&#x27;t have enough time? As a matter of fact, com-lihaoyi increased the bounty for ms sql support because there is more work than it was originally anticipated (see the pull request here: https://github.com/com-lihaoyi/scalasql/pull/29 ). Right now, I am not sure where that work is at.
 I feel that these bounties might drag (some) developers in a rat race. You might argue that a monetary retribution is better than nothing, and in the end nobody forces you to do anything if you don&#x27;t want to, and I agree 🤷‍♂️ . Maybe I am missing something about how the oss bounties work.
 I think the ideal process would be to hire a developer to commit and to do the work in a time frame agreed upon by both parties, and to pay her/him properly. But I understand that might not be always feasible due to lack of funds and time, hence the bounties. I would be interesting to see the real-life experience of a someone that issued bounties and how that turned out.

                              <span>Hy!
 I worked with scala 2.12-2.13 for years, but in the last 2 years I&#x27;m out of the loop. One of my &quot;ongoing&quot; projects has a scala 2.13 codebase, and the owners of the product asked me to start a new product mostly based on the prev codebase. So I need to start a totally fresh project, but I need the ability to fastly convert &quot;old&quot; code to this new codebase.
 The old toolstack heavily used cats (ET and OT, and SemiGroups), tapir with circe, slick, and akka (mostly streams and http, but some typed actors too). It used a lot of other smaller things like shapeless to help slick with tuples, pureconf for config parsing. Also I had a lot of extender methods and some implicit converters.
 The questions; - How mature and widely used scala3 is? - Can copilot or other tools convert scala2 code to scala3? - Starting a scala2 codebase in 2024 is a bad idea? - Do we have good learning materials for adoption? - Should I learn new libs if I change to scala3 or I can keep most of my &quot;well known&quot; ones?

A Dictionary of Single-Letter Variable Names by Jack Kelly
Haskell’s expressive type system means that type signatures can carry a lot of information. Haskell’s polymorphism means that you sometime write a function that works across an enormous range of types, and are often left wondering “what do I actually call my variables?”. It …</span>

                              <span>Hi guys,
 Let&#x27;s say I have a recurring task in Agenda like
 * TODO Water the flowers weekly SCHEDULED:  
 If I this week decide I instead should water the flowers on friday, I just press the S-RIGHT (org-agenda-do-date-later)
 But then it (as is described in manual) moves all instances of &quot;Water the flowers&quot; to Fridays.
 Is there an (easy / built in) way of pushing a single instance of a recurring event forward to Friday, while keeping the rest of the instances on Thursday? 
 My guess is not, as it would require somehow cloning the instance for this week as a new task and leaving the recurring task alone?

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I use Org-mode for task management and note-taking, and I’m wondering if there’s a voice-powered workflow to capture entries hands-free via voice commands or speech-to-text. Tools like OpenAI Whisper exist, but I haven’t seen anything that integrates them directly with Org-mode for capturing tasks or notes.
 Has anyone seen or built a solution for this? I’m on Emacs with Arch and android (termux).
 Thanks!

We recently completed a project with IMAX, where we learned that they had developed a way to simplify and optimize the process of integrating Google Cloud Storage (GCS) with Bazel. Seeing value in this tool for the broader community, we decided to publish it together under an open source license. In this blog post, we’ll dive into the features, installation, and usage of rules_gcs, and how it provides you with access to private resources.

What is rules_gcs?
rules_gcs is a Bazel ruleset that facilitates the downloading of files from Google Cloud Storage. It is designed to be a drop-in replacement for Bazel’s http_file and http_archive rules, with features …</span>

 for example “Old McDonald had a farm” would become [“Old” , “McDonald” , “had” , “a” , “farm”]

                              <span>Hi,
 i&#x27;m doing small interpreter of simple programming language (as mental exercise), and when i read some post about it i find out an advice to use Fix or Free monad, because in this case i can get advantage of using implicit recursion instead of explicit one. But i don&#x27;t get the point, because in the end of the day i have to write the same amount of code (probably because i&#x27;m stupid, that&#x27;s why i&#x27;m asking :-) )
 Here is code snipped of both cases, what am i doing wrong of do not understand?
 data Expr &#x3D; Const Int | Add Expr Expr eval :: Expr -&gt; Expr eval c@(Const _) &#x3D; c eval (Add l r) &#x3D; plus (eval l) (eval r) plus :: Expr -&gt; Expr -&gt; Expr plus (Const l) (Const r) &#x3D; Const $ l + r plus _ _ &#x3D; error &quot;Type error&quot; data ExprF a &#x3D; ConstF Int | AddF a a type Expr&#x27; &#x3D; Fix ExprF eval&#x27; :: Expr&#x27; -&gt; Expr&#x27; eval&#x27; &#x3D; \case Fix (ConstF n) -&gt; Fix (ConstF n) Fix (AddF l r) -&gt; plus&#x27; (eval&#x27; l) (eval&#x27; r) plus&#x27; :: Expr&#x27; -&gt; Expr&#x27; -&gt; Expr&#x27; plus&#x27; (Fix (ConstF l)) (Fix (ConstF r)) &#x3D; Fix (ConstF $ l + r) plus&#x27; _ _ &#x3D; error &quot;Wrong types&quot;

                              <span>In my org-mode file my content is mainly text in paragraph blocks with a hard return, i.e., blank line in between. I have been searching for a way to get org-mode html export to format this in the literary book style of indented first sentence, and soft returns/no gap lines.
 I was advised at Stackexchange Emacs to try this
 #+HTML_HEAD: p { margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; text-indent: 2em; }  
 And it worked. However, the fact that this references p is messing up other things in my ox-tufte like giving footnotes that 2em indent, as well as some images. So Plan B is just to use this without the text-indent: 2em; and tack @@html:      @@ in front of all text paragraphs. So now I need a replace-regexp that will do this for paragraphs. M-x replace-regexp RET ^ RET @@html:      @@t RET does it for every line in a buffer, but I need it for every paragraph. Any ideas?

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I wanted to share this both for the laughs and maybe some guidance.
 I am a relatively young programmer, who so far have been my own master, so to speak. I was given big projects to finish on a deadline, but pretty much left to my own devices. All this changed rapidly at this new company.
 Now, my team leader left the company and got replaced with another one who has never had a managerial position before and is trying to micromanage me, which I resent with a passion, not just because of my character (who if I am being honest, responds well to criticism under conditions) but also because I feel he is not quite on par with my own skill level (perceived or not). I mean, I would ideally like to have a superior who I admire (perceived or not) and can learn from, and then I would embrace and indeed welcome both the manager and the criticism.
 Anyway, Now how does this relates to Emacs?
 Well, this guy at work cannot understand the way I program. It seems extremely alien to him because I find myself using common Elisp and functional idioms.
 I have started naming thinks like (buffer-or-name) or what have you.
 The use of monoids, etc etc.
 So, Emacs has forever made me an alien to the standard workplace culture.
 I mean this guy wants me to take my nicely single purpose functions and put them
 all within a Class in one huge file.
 I do not know if I can take it.
 How is this funny?
 I do not know, I find it funny that a 50 year old program is causing such trouble for a person 50 years after its inception.
 Thank you for your time.
 With &lt;3 pnoul

                              <span>Hi! I&#x27;ve set up a compose key in macOS using compose2keybindings: https://github.com/cmloegcmluin/compose2keybindings?tab&#x3D;readme-ov-file
 What this does is turn the right option key into ctrl-shift-f13, which then invokes the compose key.
 It&#x27;s working fine it most apps, but it doesn&#x27;t work at all with Emacs. Pressing the option/compose key makes Emacs say: &quot;C- is undefined&quot;.
 Does anyone in here have any suggestions for how to fix this? I&#x27;m not much of a power user myself.
 I&#x27;m running a GUI Emacs 29.4, installed via https://emacsformacosx.com/, with Spacemacs.
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hi all. Wondering if anyone has successfully set up a functioning lsp for C#.
 Using Emacs 29.4 on Linux, with LSP mode and flycheck, I&#x27;ve tried:
  
Omnisharp: incredibly slow and unstable, autocomplete dies often, but mostly complete
 csharp-ls: fairly quick, but chokes on some references (partial classes?)
 csharp-roslyn: quick, very snappy, works well - except it doesn&#x27;t detect errors (!?)
  
Between the three of them there&#x27;s an incredible LSP for me.
 Any help appreciated.
 
 Other details:
 I have it working fine in VS Code and Sublime Text.
 Here&#x27;s my LSP doctor output:
  
Checking for Native JSON support: OK
 Check emacs supports &#x60;read-process-output-max&#x27;: OK
 Check &#x60;read-process-output-max&#x27; default has been changed from 4k: OK
 Byte compiled against Native JSON: OK
 &#x60;gc-cons-threshold&#x27; increased?: OK
 Using &#x60;plist&#x27; for deserialized objects?: OPTIONAL
 Using emacs 28+ with native compilation?: OK

 However, when opening a .go file (for example) opens in in Fundamental mode and i can&#x27;t find go-mode (or any other from the above) in the M-x menu. I have verified the install location and the packages seem to be installed properly.
 What am I doing wrong?

                              <span>Hey everyone, when fire up M-x: gdb inside Emacs (29.4) on Windows using gdb -i&#x3D;mi path-to-exe
 The debugger buffer opens up but can&#x27;t recognize the MI output of GDB as actual MI output.
 Error: Either -i&#x3D;mi wasn’t specified on the GDB command line, or the extra socket couldn’t be established. Consider using M-x gud-gdb instead.
 The output in the buffer looks like what I&#x27;d expect if I ran gdb -i&#x3D;mi in the terminal, but emacs just won&#x27;t recognize it as such. Does anybody know if there&#x27;s an issue with this mode on Windows? I have WinLibs on my path and I&#x27;m running emacs directly.
 If I use MSYS and run that Emacs from within an MSYS shell, things work as expected. I&#x27;d like to run Emacs directly and using WinLibs GCC/GDB etc (without going into an MSYS shell). Running gud-gdb works, but I&#x27;d really like to use MI instead of the simpler gud-gdb interface.
 WinLibs version details:
 g++ (MinGW-W64 x86_64-ucrt-posix-seh, built by Brecht Sanders, r2) 14.2.0
 GNU gdb (GDB for MinGW-W64 x86_64, built by Brecht Sanders, r2) 15.2

                              <span>I recently saw a post about what keyboard people use for emacs and a lot of people say they use QMK keyboard which allow for custom layout, additional layers. 
 So far the extend of customization I&#x27;ve done regarding keybinds in within emacs itself, I was wondering what emacs specific customization you guys have made to the keyboard itself?

                              <span>This time during Functional World event, we&#x27;re stepping a bit outside of functional programming while still keeping developers&#x27; needs front and center! The idea for this session actually came from our own team at Scalac, and we thought it was worth sharing with a wider audience :) We hope you&#x27;ll find it valuable too, especially since more and more projects these days don&#x27;t have enough dedicated DevOps support.

                              <span>Hey, I was wondering if Scala has a library or extension or something where I can use JSON as first-class like it does with XML; see the following example:
 val sunMass &#x3D; 1.99e30 val sunRadius &#x3D; 6.96e8 val star &#x3D;  Sun { sunMass } { sunRadius } { 4 * Math.PI * Math.pow(sunRadius, 2) } { 4/3 * Math.PI * Math.pow(sunRadius, 3) }  
 So exactly like this but with JSON where I can embed/evaluate expressions and store literal JSON as a first-class value in a variable? If not, any languages that do?

                              <span>Hey r/scala! If you&#x27;re looking to get hands-on with some cutting-edge tech, check out Ergo. This isn’t a shill for just another blockchain, but an open-source platform packed with advanced scripting and cryptographic tools.
 You can experiment on the testnet or even fork your own chain to explore its potential. 
 Ergo is built on Scala, and its scripting language, ErgoScript (which is also based on Scala), goes beyond Bitcoin’s scripting by using ErgoTree byte code. This allows for complex coin spending conditions, enabling things like ring signatures, multi-signatures, multiple currencies, atomic swaps, self-replicating scripts, and long-term computations. ErgoTree itself is a typed abstract syntax tree, essentially a smart signature that validates transactions based on custom rules. With Secret Data Predicates (digital signatures, secret keys) and Blockchain Context Predicates (transaction-specific conditions), ErgoTree supports a range of applications beyond crypto, such as (decentralised) CBDCs, new monetary systems, Local Exchange Trading Systems, and pretty much anything else you can think up, can be done on ergo!
 Many of Ergo’s solutions are grounded in formal research and have been presented at peer-reviewed conferences. While ErgoScript isn’t Turing complete on its own, Turing completeness can be achieved through transaction trees, as outlined in this peer-reviewed paper.
 For those looking to earn while they learn, there are various bounties up for grabs, with rewards in stablecoins like SigUSD and Gluon Gold. Check out open bounties on the reference client and interpreter/compiler, or join the upcoming ErgoHack.

                              <span>Is anyone here still using org-drill?
 In Emacs version 30.0.50 and Org version 9.7.5, it does a great job for my son learning Latin. But when I start a cram session with org-drill-cram, it seems to make use of the saved property :DRILL_LAST_REVIEWED: [Y-10-16 Mi 16:%] (this is the one for today), and it doesn&#x27;t run, giving me the error message:
 Not an Org time string: [Y-10-16 Mi 16:%].
 Has Org changed so much that this older package org-drill doesn&#x27;t work properly anymore? Has anyone found a work-around?

                              <span>I know almost nothing about orgmode aside from some videos here and there. In terms of programming and code I even know less. 
 I liked apps like Dynalist, Workflowy or Logseq for its infinite outlining capabilities and how fast and easy I could organize my ideas into infinite bullets.
 However, those apps have strong limitations: aside from Logseq they are cloud based(that makes me fear of losing my notes if the company disappears), they have monthly payment requirements for some features(again not Logseq) and they have clunky use or lack basic outlining things like numbered lists(on mobile at least) and so on. 
 Maybe those apps have workarounds to some of those problems but I ended up here since it seems orgmode solves all of the above problems, free, and it’s expected to last for as long as needed it. It sounds great to be honest.
 But…
 Is it too much? Is it too much effort to set up/learn? Will I be able to easily use it on multiple devices like pc, Mac, iOS with basic gdrive or iCloud sync without it being slow or having files rewriting themselves during those sync processes and losing information? 
 I fear I’ll need a masters degree in computer science to write my daily to do list or make a novel writing outline quickly(again I don’t know enough about the app)
 Any kind of advice would be welcomed.
 As a side note. I tried obsidian but I absolve need more advanced outline capabilities. Obsidian outlining plugins are way too basic and clunky.

                              <span>I wanted to announce my MuniHac project going live at https://pointfree-wasm.github.io/. The aim was to port the pointfree command-line utility to WASM running inside browser. Perhaps you might find it useful. 
 Personally it started as an exploration of the state of WASM support in Haskell and it turned out that it’s reasonably easy to get going. You might find the project’s sources useful to get started on your own WASM experiments since it a minimal working application with all the necessary stubs filled in.
 Please report any suggestions or issues you encounter in the repository. PRs are welcome as well!

                              <span>I am trying to create a Functor like typeclass where the elements may have any kind, specifically ones with different arity. Think of a class which encompasses Functor1, Functor2, ... and so on.
 I have started with a class like:
 haskell class KFunctor k (f :: k -&gt; Type) where kMap :: somethingLikeAFunction k a b -&gt; f a -&gt; f b 
 Now I need to model somethingLikeAFunction somehow. My idea was to use a GADT or a type family, however, that does not work even for the simple case where the elements are of kind Type.
 haskell data Function k (a :: k) (b :: k) where SimpleFunction :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; Function Type a b 
 haskell type family Function k (a :: k) (b :: k) where Function Type a b &#x3D; a -&gt; b 
 Both fail with &quot;Expected a type, but &#x27;a&#x27; has kind &#x27;k&#x27;&quot;. I am wondering why GHC is not able to unify k with Type?

 Autoreconf seems to want to a specific version of Perl published before the current stable release on Homebrew, which is confusing to me as I&#x27;ve been able to build the server just fine prior to today. I&#x27;ve tried updating Autoconf + it&#x27;s dependencies and it was no use. Was wondering if anyone else has had a similar issue, could I maybe force Autoconf to use my installed version of Perl (5.38.2)?

                              <span>Hello,
 I use eglot, corfu, and eglot-tempel (I also tried yasnippet, and still had a problem). The issue is with rust-analyzer, but I don’t think the exact LSP server should matter
 If I have a function foo_unique(bar), type f, and select foo_unique, I get a snippet completion, which is good. If, however, I type foo_uniq, it gets completed to foo_unique(…) (so my function is the only candidate), with an ellipsis symbol, cursor at the end, and no snippet interface.
 What could be the problem? This is clearly not something that should happen.

                              <span>Hi all. Longtime emacs user here. Something changed a few months ago and I can&#x27;t pin it down. I frequently use ctl-left/right but they don&#x27;t work anymore. ctl-h k doesn&#x27;t even show that I&#x27;m pressing a key. My Mac is a 2024 16&quot; M3 Pro running Sonoma 14.6.1. The version of emacs I&#x27;m trying to use is 29.4.1 from emascforosx.com and 29.4.2 on RHEL 8.9 via ETX. I also tried emacs -nw on the Linux box accessed via Terminal and ssh. Nada. ctl-up/down work fine. Also, ctl-left/right work in other Mac apps.
 I&#x27;ve been using alt-left/right but I have years of muscle memory so it&#x27;s a pain. And a mystery. Any ideas? Things to check?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Howdy, folks.
 So I kinda table-flipped a bit this week after getting fed up with having to keep moving org-agenda and gpt.el windows to a desired frame position. I went down the layout rabbit hole starting with activities.el and perspective.el being next in the queue.
 I like the UX of activities.el but I&#x27;m not a huge fan of having to create all of the frames I want, place them into desired position, and then save them as an activity. I would prefer to be able to define my layouts in elisp but I don&#x27;t see a great way to do that with activities.el.
 Perhaps I&#x27;ve over-looked a possibility? Perhaps there&#x27;s a way to programmatically define a bookmark that activities.el can then reference? Other ideas?

 Also any tips regarding meow-mode in general are welcome too! I feel like I&#x27;ve barely scratched the surface when I&#x27;ve recently learned about and copied an org-mode speed keys-like map for meow-mode.
 Thanks!

 But the moment I use a terminal e.g. Kitty / Alacritty etc.
 I get very thick vertical borders in my tables like this.

 I have tried with different fonts but I suspect the choice of character is differently rendered in terminal mode.
 I am using the org-modern package and Doom etc.
 Could this be the culprit, if so is there work around for this perhaps the font for tables and border??

I provide a function that returns the API key to the Gptel-api-key variable, but GPTEL still asks me for the OpenAI key. The expression evaluates correctly, the configuration is set to look for the function, yet I still have no luck. What am I overlooking? Is it simply sufficient to setq the gptel-apikey variable or do I need to create a separate make-openai block? Thanks!

                              <span>My Quest for a Beautiful Mode Line
 I recently wanted to try and make my own mode line configuration. I have seen plugins like powerline for emacs and lualine for neovim. I think the colorful &quot;pills&quot; they add to the mode line look nice. They look similar to the power level 10k theme in oh-my-zsh.
 Examples:
 Example image from emacs&#x27; telephone-line
 Example image from nvim&#x27;s lualine
 Example image from powerlevel10k zsh prompt theme
 Current Understanding
 I believe that these are made with essentially a Unicode nerd font at the beginning and/or end of a text region with a colorful background. However, I am unable to replicate this well and it looks rather silly.
 Difficulties
 I tried reading some codebases for powerline, telephone-line, lualine, and even powerlevel10k. I think the non-em…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m having trouble with org-tables. When I hit tab to auto-align table cells after an edit, sometimes a row won&#x27;t align. Looking into it, it turns out a character, often the pipe | but not always, somehow has a double width. Poking at it with describe-char shows the following:
 Character code properties: customize what to show name: VERTICAL LINE old-name: VERTICAL BAR general-category: Sm (Symbol, Math) decomposition: (124) (&#x27;|&#x27;) There is an overlay here: From 36582 to 36583 face region priority (nil . 100) window # There are text properties here: display ((min-width ((2 . width)))) face org-table fontified t line-prefix #(&quot; &quot; 0 4 (face org-indent)) org-category &quot;20210913T141637-aiotmlwtf&quot; wrap-prefix #(&quot; &quot; 0 4 (face org-indent)) 
 I turned off various minor modes like visual-wrap-prefix-mode, visual-line-mode, visual-line-column-mode, and aggressive-indent-mode to no avail. So have no idea what causes the insertion of that special character feature. (Running a recent Emacs30.)

                              <span>Hallo
 my use case although noble is quite difficult, here the A) Abstract and B) Specific formulation:
 Abstract 
 I read a lot and want an efficient way to use the information i read inside the books
 Specific
 As reader I want to benefit from the content of the books i annotated, and kind of run queries to have the annotations available as i prefer. For instance I could have assigned a tag about a topic to every annotation, or a rating of importance from 1 to 10, and so I could have the need to retrieve the title of the chapters and paragraphs of a book, or the chapters, paraghraphs and notes, or and here becomes interesting all the notes that have a specific rating with a sparse tree (chapters, paragraphs) and notes with importance &gt; 5 or even more interesting across the books with a specific tag as for instance statistics all the notes with a rating &gt;9
 IMPLEMENTATION
 I do not know what is the most convenient way, really I have not idea, but i confine that there are other avid readers that develop org mode that thought about a convenient workflow
 * annotating pdf of digital documents so that can see on the side the original pdf and another side the notes and assinging multiple tags and running researches across the org files
 * using org roam to make a kind of wiki using a lot of links,or a lot of org files in subfolders and run a research with a kind of specialized engine to retrieve what I need
 * see if can use SQL in org files so that for instance the headers of one level would be assigned to a table/column, and the nested ones will be automatically assigned with an id beloging to the table or something similar that will simplify to transform the org mode to SQL
 * org table files
 * Some SQL tables in Postgree sql via a star model or model vault key that will be queried in some way inside org mode
 CONCLUSION
 All I want is to capitalize the books i read in a way I can extract information, confront sources, highlights, adding notes etc

                              <span>Is there a keyboard shortcut in Emacs (or Evil, which I use) to close all Literals (#+begin_* sections) in the entire document? Or at least a command that I could bind to a shortcut?

                              <span>Dan Allosso’s (Obsidisan) Book Club will be reading Bob Doto‘s book A System for Writing (2024) as their next selection. Discussion meetings are via Zoom for 2 hours on Saturdays starting on 2024-10-19 to 11-02 from 8:00 AM – 10:00 AM Pacific.  New comers and veterans are all welcome to attend.
The book is broken up into 3 parts (approximately 50-75 pages each) and we’ll discuss each on succeeding weeks. The group has several inveterate note takers who are well-acquainted with Zettelkasten methods.
If you’d like access to the Obsidian vault, please email danallosso at icloud dot com with your preferred email address to connect to the Dropbox repository.
DM either Dan or myself for the Zoom link for the video meetings.</span>

                              <span>It has often been debated here whether we should use folgezettel in the digital context, often contrasted with the &quot;timestamp method&quot;. This post is not intended to rekindle that debate (and that false dichotomy, as I now see it), but merely to report my method and how it helps me, in case others find it useful.
I exclusively used the timestamp method until I read the Bob Doto book, which completely changed by Zk practice, and now I happily merge the two.
First, the benefits of the two methods, as I have seen them expressed here. The timestamp method is flexible, and does not force us to choose a pre-meditated structure; the ZK can grow organically. The folgezettel, on the other hand, helps maintain some coherence in a sequence of notes, keeping the historical context in which notes were ar…</span>

 As a result, hitting Tab after a snippet does not work naturally. I would like to ensure that yas-expand has priority over eglot-completion-at-point, what would be most elegant way to do that (I use spacemacs)?

                              <span>Hi there. I had an idea for a package, but it&#x27;s the sort of thing that feels like it must already exist, and I&#x27;d love to look at existing packages before reinventing the wheel. 
 The basic idea would be that you could schedule code to run using org agenda entries with timestamps. For example, you could write an entry like 
 * Update the package cache :exec: :PROPERTIES: :TaskName: update-package-cache :END:  
 Then you&#x27;d define a search like +exec and associate functions to various task names. The package would provide a function/mode to set up timers to watch the agenda and run scheduled tasks when emacs is idle within the scheduled window. Maybe if the entry is a TODO, update the timestamp with org-mark-done.
 But yeah, this feels like the sort of thing that would already exist in some form. I&#x27;ve seen a few packages to notify about tasks, but not to act on them more generally. If anyone has any leads/thoughts, I&#x27;d appreciate it. Thanks!

                              <span>I&#x27;ve started learning emacs recently, and after some experimentation I decided that I want to experience vanilla emacs navigation keybindings (moving the point around with C-f / C-n etc), without evil/meow/boon etc.
 I am a casual vim user, and otherwise used JetBrains IDEs for like 15 years now. I&#x27;m trying to switch to emacs to be more productive with editing code, because I feel like I use the mouse too much in JetBrains and it slows me down.
 Needless to say, I am suffering and it feels like torture. My question is that: are the vanilla emacs keybindings viable? Can you get used to it and be as fast as in vim, or as in other editors? Is anyone using the default keybindings, or are you all just rebinding those?
 If yes, how long it took for you to get used to it?

                              <span>I need to access multiple docker containers with the same name deployed on different servers. I connect to then using eshell with command like this:
 cd &quot;/ssh:username@host|docker:container_name:/&quot; 
 Emacs functions like dired, find-file, etc work fine. However actual shell commands involving binaries on remote do not pick correct host. Emacs somehow remembered the first host that I accessed container with this name first and always runs shell commands there. Even if I explicitly run 
 &quot;/ssh:username@host_that_I_need|docker:container_name:/bin/bash&quot; 
 it always runs
 &quot;/ssh:username@emacs_favorite_host|docker:container_name:/bin/bash&quot; 
 When I do &quot;C-x C-f&quot; and just type &quot;/docker:container_name:/&quot; it also goes to &quot;emacs_favorite_host&quot;. Do I need to configure something or this is how TRAMP normally works?

 I have the following line in my Emacs settings file:
 (setq elpy-project-root &quot;~/Development&quot;)
 However, it doesn&#x27;t seem to work as expected. I still have to manually call elpy-set-project-root from within Emacs. However, this isn&#x27;t persistent. As soon as I jump to a file and it resets to the directory of the currently opened file.
 How can I permanently set the project root in Elpy?
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I just merged a project branch I was working on back to [tt]master[/tt] and noticed that some of the pascal files I was working had acquired a [tt].work[/tt] extension, ie filename.pas.work and filename.lfm.work in addition tofilename.pas and [tt]filename.lfm[/tt].
 I remember that during the commit process I pressed the wrong key at some stage or clicked in the magit buffer and got prompted about running some kind of git command which I aborted.
 Could that process have left some temporary files created with the .work extension?

 im fairly new to NixOs so i might have made a mistake, especially when im using home-manager to configure neovim 
 (i will leave a part of home.nix in the comments) (if im able to i will also leave a link to a screenshot to show the almost lack of highlighting)
 i would really appreciate help in setting up the highlighting (every other plugin i enabled works fine)

                              <span>I have this function to get the handle of a port and maybe convert its exception into a locatable custom error:
 type EvalResult a &#x3D; StateT [Env] (ExceptT SchemeError IO) a makePort :: IOMode -&gt; [LispVal] -&gt; Loc -&gt; EvalResult LispVal makePort mode [String filename] loc &#x3D; do handle  throwError $ IOErr err loc Right h -&gt; return $ Port h 
 I can&#x27;t figure out how to properly lift the try value to match the transformer stack.
 Right now the error says: &quot;Expected: IO (Either IOError Handle), Actual: t0 IO (Either IOError Handle)&quot; when doing the lift operation. However I dont know how to remove the t0 type-var to properly match the type. Doing liftIO mismatches IO (Either ...) with StateT.

                              <span>Hi, I’m looking to contribute to some open source Scala projects, primarily to grasp my learnings in Scala, and also to get familiar with the programming design patterns Scala industry follows. What would be some good open source projects to contribute, and if you guys have any, can you let me know ? Thanks

 Another will suspend your computer.
 And so forth.
 I will be adding tools to this over time. And your suggestions are welcome.

                              <span>Being interested in Miso, I&#x27;ve noticed that it now supports the GHC WebAssembly backend, which is great. One concern I have is that HLS doesn&#x27;t support the GHC WebAssembly and JS backends. (edit: I have managed to make HLS work with Miso, see comment) I&#x27;m interested in using Haskell on the frontend and would like to ask the sub a few questions.
  
If you&#x27;ve used Haskell on the frontend recently, what was your stack and how was your experience?
 In your opinion, what are the Haskell frontend setups with the best developer experience at the moment?
 Is Haskell on the frontend with HLS support likely to ever happen? Are there specific problems an individual developer can contribute toward solving to make it possible?

                              <span>Reading the thread of remaking emacs in a modern environment, apart from the C-core fixes and improvements, as always there were a lot of comments about elisp.
 There are a lot of people that criticize elisp. Ones do because they don&#x27;t like or directly hate the lisp family, they hate the parentheses, believe that it&#x27;s &quot;unreadable&quot;, etc.; others do because they think it would be better if we had common lisp or scheme instead of elisp, a more general lisp instead of a &quot;specialized lisp&quot; (?).
 Just so you understand a bit better my point of view: I like programming, but I haven&#x27;t been to university yet, so I probably don&#x27;t understand a chunk of the most theoric part of programming languages. When I program (and I&#x27;m not fiddling with my config), I mainly do so In low level, imperative programming languages (Mostly C, but I&#x27;ve been studying cpp and java) and python.
 That said, what makes elisp a great language for emacs (for those who it is)?
  
Is it because of it being a functional language? Why? Then, do you feel other functional languages could accomplish the same? Why/why no?
 
Is it because of it being a &quot;meta-programming language&quot;? (whatever that means exactly) why? Then, do you feel other metaprogramming languages could accomplish the same? Why/why no?
 
Is it because of it being reflective? Why? Then do you feel other reflective languages could accomplish the same? Why/why no?
 
Is it because of it being a lisp? Why? Do you think other lisp dialects would be better?
 
Is it because it&#x27;s easier than other languages to implement the interpreter in C?
 
 Thanks

                              <span>Good morning everybody,
 I am glad to say that I&#x27;m getting used to elisp. This is my second attempt on making an emacs package. This is called entr-runner.el, it permits to run custom commands on file or directory change directly inside emacs. 
 Check it out on : https://github.com/SamuelVanie/entr-runner.el
 I&#x27;ll be happy to get feedbacks on the source code or any other things that will make a student like me a better programmer.

                              <span>After using Spacemacs for long time, I decided to give a try at setting up my vanilla config!
 I soon noticed that default themes like tango-dark come with highlight face that is too bright for my taste + it removes the coloring from the text it is highlighting, since it sets the whole highlighted text to the same foreground.
 I ended up setting the face attributes for highlight so that foreground is unspecified, and so that background is darker (I set it to default but darkened a bit further -&gt; I found this works great for any theme, in my opinion.
 I did a similar thing for region face.
 The part where I struggle now is consistently executing this on theme-load -&gt; I sometimes change themes and I would love if this get applied after any theme change.

 My solution was to hook server-after-make-frame to run some applescript which brings emacs to the front. It&#x27;s not perfect, since it brings all emacs frames to the front, but I rarely have more than one or two, and it solves my immediate problem of having to hunt down my new frame.
 (defun initd/bring-emacs-to-front () &quot;Using applescript, force the Emacs frame to be activated.&quot; (when (eq system-type &#x27;darwin) (start-process &quot;bring-emacs-to-front&quot; nil &quot;osascript&quot; &quot;-e&quot; &quot;tell application \&quot;Emacs\&quot; to activate&quot;))) (add-hook &#x27;server-after-make-frame-hook #&#x27;initd/bring-emacs-to-front)

                              <span>Basically the title. I think I remember reading somewhere it was officially recommended to switch the file extension to .txt and not use the unique .org extension as they are functionally the same. Both are plain text formats, you might just have different txt files, that are not formatted in orgdown there too. Is that all or have I missed something? Is there an actual downside like a dependency of org-roam that you end up in dependency hell if you decide to use txt or another file extension instead of .org. Bc otherwise everytime you don&#x27;t have an org parser around and are on a system like a tablet, it will straight up refuse to open the file, locking you out of your data complete. This can be avoided by using orgdown formatting, but utilizing the .txt extension. 
 Cheers and thanks for your insights

                              <span>Is it possible to specify that members of a PROPERTIES block should always come in a specific order?
 For example, when I create an entry, I set a CREATED property value with the current date. If I change the entry later, I use the org-set-property function to add a MODIFIED property with the date of the change. I would very much like the MODIFIED entry to be inserted immediately following the CREATED property. Is this possible?

                              <span>Hi! basically i am mostly trying to set up an IDE in which i could comfortably write haskell in nixos
 i should say that i am pretty new to nixos and i dont have much of a clue about what im doing...
 im trying to set up neovim, but if it happens so that VSC is simpler to set up, i will happily jump on that oportunity.
 i have tried to use home-manager to declare the haskell-tools plugin but i was not able to get it to work.
 any help is greatly appreciated! and im sorry if i should have asked in the nixos subreddit.

                              <span>Hello Haskellers,
 I&#x27;m writing a C compiler. In the assembly generation stage, an abstract syntax tree is converted into a List of x64 instructions.
 To model a C language expression as an AST node, I used this algebraic type:
 data Expression &#x3D; Value Int | Unary Uop Expression | Binary Bop Expression Expression
 The Expression type is used to represented nested unary and binary expressions such as -2, -(~2), 1+3, (6 *2) + (5* (9 -2)), etc... Uop and Bop are unary and binary operators, respectively.
 Parsing these expressions recursively looks like a classic fold operation, and I implemented my own folding function that works. But I can&#x27;t help but feel there&#x27;s a better approach to this, a better abstraction to traverse a recursive data structure and &quot;flatten&quot; it into a List.
 Obviously I can&#x27;t use Foldable since the datatype is not kind &#x60;* -&gt; *&#x60;. Would it make sense to use a phantom type so that Expression is of kind &#x60;* -&gt; *&#x60;?
 Any thoughts or suggestions would be helpful. Thanks

 Is this possible? I guess I need to add a hook but can&#x27;t seem to get it to work. Thank you!

 I have emacs server running and emacs-everywhere installed from MELPA.
 Anyone perhaps have a suggestion on how to fix this?

                              <span>Hello, reading the use-package docs, I found that it has support for both diminish and delight.
 At first sight, they seem pretty similar. Both can hide modes, or change how they are displayed on the mode line; although I believe delight has a couple extra features.
 The Emacs manual recommends going for diminish if you have doubts, but why is that so? 
 What are their most important differences?
 Thanks

Since people always wonder how to use many of Hyperbole&#x27;s features together, leaning towards the Videos rather than Hyperbole Use Cases, I asked it to explain how to use buttons and Hyperbole&#x27;s subsystems together on a work task. This is the result. (Install Hyperbole as an Emacs package from melpa or elpa-devel).
 The Hyperbole manual provides a wealth of information about Hyperbole&#x27;s individual features, but let&#x27;s explore how they can work together to achieve a specific work goal. Imagine you&#x27;re working on a research project that involves:
  
Gathering information from various sources (websites, files, research papers)

 I had nothing to do last weekend so I wrote a small package for a mode-line.
 Its not (a) very:
 ...customizable
 ...stable or bug free
 ...likely it work in terminal
 ...good name of mode line (sorry)
 ...to work with people that don&#x27;t use Evil/Project.
 It is though:
 ... very fun to do stuff so why not write a mode-line
 ... likely someone finds it useful
 Feel free to do PR or add bugs.
 Cocaine-line repo at GitHub
 Before anyone asks. The theme is mito-laser port from NVChad. It will has it own repo soon.

                              <span>Hi everybody, 
 I am trying to build a template with minad&#x27;s &#x27;tempel&#x27; package. I want to mimic the behaviour found in this excellent article that uses yasnippet, specifically the &quot;faster frac&quot; bit https://karthinks.com/software/latex-input-for-impatient-scholars/#faster-frac
 Basically, I want to write for instance &quot;3 fra&quot; then I hit my tempel-complete key and then it expands to &quot;\frac{3}{}&quot;. 
 I tried some variants and I tried to inspire myself of karthinks snippets, so I have the following template : 
 (fra (progn (backward-sexp) (kill-sexp)) &quot;\\frac{&quot; (current-kill 0) &quot;}{&quot; p &quot;} &quot; q)
 But, there is a problem. The placeholder p is not registered, the expansion is this &quot;\frac{3}{} &quot;. It quits directly I think. 
 Can someone help me ? I don&#x27;t really understand what&#x27;s happening. Why is the placeholder p skipped ?

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I&#x27;m facing an issue when trying to run a compiled Scala object. Here is the code from my Twofer.scala file:
 object Twofer {
 def twofer(name: String &#x3D; &quot;you&quot;): String &#x3D; {
 s&quot;One for $name, one for me.&quot;
 }
 def main(args: Array[String]): Unit &#x3D; {
 println(twofer())
 println(twofer(&quot;Leonardo&quot;))
 }
 }
 I compiled the file using the command: scalac Twofer.scala
 The .class files were generated correctly: &#x27;Twofer$.class&#x27; Twofer.class Twofer.scala Twofer.tasty
 However, when I try to run the compiled object using: scala Twofer
 I get the following error: [error] Twofer is not a scala sub-command and it is not a valid path to an input file or directory.
 Try viewing the relevant help to see the list of available sub-commands and options.
 scala --help
 I also tried with the classpath: scala -cp . Twofer
 But the error persists. Can anyone help me resolve this issue?

 If you had tried the integrations with other effect systems before, give it a try again and please report any issues!
 New Features
  
More flexible integration with ZIO and cats-effect: The integrations were previously implemented with custom effects, which had limitations with some Async operations. The new implementation is based directly on Async, allowing unrestricted use of ZIO and cats-effect computations with Kyo&#x27;s async primitives.
 Safe class tags: The kyo-data module provides an alternative to Scala&#x27;s ClassTag that can express union, intersection, and literal types. The SafeClassTag implementation ensures materialized tags always properly represent their types without falling back to java.lang.Object for special types like Any…</span>

                              <span>I am using Parsec to write a math parser. The code here is working fine for parsing a number, either an Int or a Float but always returning a Float in Haskell (I want to add support for different types of numbers in the calculator later but for now its all floats).
 pNumber :: Parser MathExpr pNumber &#x3D; N  (try pFloat try pInt  &quot;number&quot;)  many1 digit pFloat :: Parser Float pFloat &#x3D; try $ read  do whole  parse (pNumber  parse (pNumber  (try pInt  try pFloat  &quot;number&quot;) I get parse errors on the same input for decimal numbers:
 *Main Text.Parsec&gt; parse (pNumber  parse (pNumber &lt;* eof) &quot;&quot; &quot;0.5&quot; Left (line 1, column 2): unexpected &#x27;.&#x27; expecting digit or end of input 
 Anyone know why this is happening? I have thrown trys all over to avoid consuming input when I don&#x27;t want to.

                              <span>I have used conduit a bit (not extensively, but somewhat) but I&#x27;m poking around at other streaming libraries, and I&#x27;ve noticed most of them design their streams much like lists, for example, in streamly, SerialT m a analogous to [a], and has the same usual Functor, Applicative and Monad instances.
 conduit on the other hand, has it&#x27;s last parameter being a &quot;result&quot; type, which is NOT the output type of the stream, it&#x27;s just a completely different single value. And it also seems like the conduit code suggests you just compose things with await and yield, instead of using more standard combinators like fmap, mapM and fold (although their are Conduit specific versions of things like fmap and fold which one can use).
 I feel like the conduit interface is a bit more clunky and not as &quot;Haskell like&quot;. But I suspect there&#x27;s a benefit of this... there&#x27;s surely a reason why one would make the interface quite a bit different to what people are used to manipulating, namely lists?
 Could someone give some examples of things which work nicely in conduit but are clunky in more &quot;list like&quot; streaming libraries?
 Or are more recently developed streaming libraries just better than conduit in every way (which I find hard to believe)?

                              <span>I&#x27;m using evil mode and started using custom keybindings recently. General is great and all, but when I bind the space key as mod, it gets mixed up with evil keybindings and I have to press space a couple of times before which key pops up. So, is it possible to disable the space key(or any key really) in only the normal mode?

 Previously I used eglot + flymake for JVM but my new job has heavily leaned into Mac + VSCode&#x27;s devcontainers and in order to get a proper lsp environment and debugger I need to switch to lsp-mode + lsp-docker + dap-mode.
 The first step is getting lsp-mode connected to the webserver&#x27;s container which has pyright as a dev dependency.
 Note, I&#x27;m also new to Python coming from a JVM and Lisp on Linux background so I may be making Python or Mac errors. I am also completely new to developing inside containers, I have previously only used containers for deployments.

 Their blog used to have comment functionality, but that is gone. I also could not find any email address or link to another profile.
 Since it appears to be difficult to come by this information, it could be that they don&#x27;t want their identity known (though I was able to dig up a real name), so please send me this information privately. Thanks for your help!
 Of course it would be easiest if Irreal themselves saw this, which they probably will eventually.

                              <span>Hey there, have my configs setup in an org file babeled out automatically with location being set by :tangle header properties. Wondering if there might be some built in mechanism to create a variable for things like different color formats on various things or. If not a way to list files set to be babeled by or so I could do it myself, I guess with a really long var name.

                              <span>Hi,
 A bit of background: I come from more of a math/physics background, and got drawn into functional programming late in college, then took a compilers course in my last semester (in OCAML) and got really into it. Have a journeyman level understanding of other languages, have worked in SW for three years and counting.
 I have been making my way through the haskell MOOC (the university of Helsinki one). I stumbled on these two books which, by the accounts I have read previously, seem to go into more depth mathematically with respect to haskell. In the mean time tryng build up on C++, and learning small bits of CL here and there as well to get more perspective and be a better problem solver overrall.
 So, what I&#x27;m asking:
 From my understanding, Hutton (Programming in Haskell) is drier than Bird (Thinking Functionally With Haskell), though both are solid texts with a good backing in math (i.e. strong on the &quot;equational reasoning&quot; front EDIT: category theory is welcome too), and wanted to see if there was a consensus on either of them, or at least consolidate people&#x27;s different opinions and experience between the two, especially from people who have read both. There hasn&#x27;t the been most testimony comparing and contrasting the two as I&#x27;ve seen scouring this subreddit.
 I ask because I would rather not approach FP just as a programmer but in addition and moreso as a computer scientist instead (in the way SICP aims to teach CS book and is not simply a Scheme tutorial).
 Other books that have come on my radar (for this purpose) are: The Haskell Book (aka Haskell from First Principles) and Introduction to Computation: Haskell, Logic and Automata.
 That&#x27;s about all, cheers!

                              <span>Hello, beginner here. I understand that the $ function, for function application, essentially creates parentheses around the rest of the expression which follows it. Likewise, I understand that the (.) function, for function composition, composes two functions together. I am trying to better understand the behavior of these two functions in the context of them being combined in a single expression.
 Function 1 and its return value are below;
 ghci&gt; zipWith max [1..5] [4..8] [4,5,6,7,8] 
 Now, we&#x27;ll add the function print and the (.) function
 Function 2 doesn&#x27;t function;
 ghci&gt; print . zipWith max [1..5] [4..8] :53:9: error: • Couldn&#x27;t match expected type ‘a -&gt; ()’ with actual type ‘[Integer]’ • Possible cause: ‘zipWith’ is applied to too many arguments In the second argument of ‘(.)’, namely ‘zipWith max [1, 2, 3, 4, ....] [4, 5, 6, 7, ....]’ In the expression: print . zipWith max [1, 2, 3, 4, ....] [4, 5, 6, 7, ....] In an equation for ‘it’: it &#x3D; print . zipWith max [1, 2, 3, ....] [4, 5, 6, ....] • Relevant bindings include it :: a -&gt; IO () (bound at :53:1) 
 * Note: I read this error message multiple times and am struggling to make sense of it.
 Now, we add the $ function between the two lists, and the function returns successfully.
 Function 3 and its return value are below;
 ghci&gt; print . zipWith max [1..5] $ [4..8] [4,5,6,7,8] 
 I don&#x27;t understand how the $ function affects function composition. Why is Function 1 fine, Function 3 fine, yet Function 2 produces an error?
 Thank you in advance

Is there a general way to approach this so that as I switch themes the color matches the currently selected theme.

 I&#x27;ve tried converting them with Pandoc like I can for markdown but I always get an error. Not sure if I need to use more flags other than the basic input and output one.
 I&#x27;ve look around and mainly just seen stuff on exporting and not importing. If there&#x27;s any macros or tools either built-in or that I can install that would be great to know. Ideally if it can do more than just JSON that would be great.
 Any help is appreciated.

 Anyone else have the experience that when editing elisp, aggressive-indent will erroneously indent docstrings unrelated to the editing context like this: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; (defun function-i-am-writing () ;; copy paste edit incomplete fragments that cause indentation below point (let ((x &quot;x&quot;) ( )
 (defun foo () &quot;This is a function called foo. It accepts no parameters.&quot; )  ...edit code allowing aggressive-indent to do its thing...and BAM!...flymake complains about new issues such as indented docstrings...  (defun foo () &quot;This is a function called foo. It accepts no parameters.&quot; ; &lt;- this is erroneously indented ) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; In emacs-lisp-mode, I do have
  (setq-local aggressive-indent-comments-too nil) 
 not that I&#x27;m sure this does anything.

                              <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;m having an issue where I have to hold on to Ctrl for a moment, then g in order to quit. Namely, exiting out of a completion - and deactivating a mark.
 If I press C-g once, I see a Quit in the echo area, but it&#x27;s not quitting what I want it to. I have to hold Ctrl for a split-second, then g for it to work.
 Oddly this is only an issue if I&#x27;m focused on a buffer with display-line-numbers-mode on. If I turn it off, the problem goes away.
 This also only affects my Moonlander, a QMK keyboard. I tried using a standard keyboard and it was fine.
 I checked wevand the only difference is that the Moonlander registers the g input immediately (1 ms) after Ctrl, whereas the standard keyboard registered it around 100ms after.
 Is there a reason why keyboard-quit would not work if the interval between Ctrl and g is too short indisplay-line-numbers-mode? Is it because a keystroke will trigger some sort of background process or refresh - and that&#x27;s the process I&#x27;m quitting with C-g if I do it too quickly?
 Thanks in advance if anyone has any ideas.

 (I&#x27;m using emacs-plus@29 on macOS Sequoia.)
 Edit: Thanks to those who answered. The --debug-init flag helped. There were relative paths (I’m guessing) along with customisation lines set by emacs. But deleting that block helped. I’ve since learnt that I can move it to its own file.

                              <span>I wrote some custom code around a year ago seeing if the scrolling-by-pixel functionality from the built-in pixel-scroll could be generalized to all scrolling commands. I forgot I was &quot;testing&quot; the code out every since then... I only remember today that I had been using this code all this time.
 I&#x27;ve pasted the code below. Essentially what this does is override scroll-up, scroll-down, and recenter such that every command that scrolls and recenters does so as if the user were scrolling-by-pixel. I was motivated to write this as a potential solution for the visual confusion that comes with (at least for me) quick, repeated scrolls and recentering (i.e. recenter-top-bottom). &#x60;&#x60;emacs-lisp (defun kb/pixel-recenter (&amp;optional arg redisplay) &quot;Similar torecenter&#x27; but with pixel scrolling.

                              <span>tl;dr What changes when emacs is launched from a shortcut vs the command line?
 When using a package which needs curl I get the following error:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 ChatGPT(chatgpt-4o-latest/General)&gt; testcurl: (60) SSL certificate problem: unable to get local issuer certificateMore details here: https://curl.se/docs/sslcerts.html
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 In this case it is using chatgpt-shell, but it&#x27;s not exclusive to it.
 When I launch emacs with &#x27;emacs&#x27; from the terminal this issue is not present, when I launch it from a shortcut the issue is present. The .desktop file is using the exact same binary:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 !/usr/bin/env xdg-open
 [Desktop Entry]
 Name&#x3D;Emacs
 GenericName&#x3D;Text

 Terminal&#x3D;false
 Categories&#x3D;Development;TextEditor;
 StartupNotify&#x3D;true
 StartupWMClass&#x3D;Emacs &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 I also tried a more minimal .desktop file and full path to the binary, /usr/bin/emacs in this case, with the same results.
 I know this issue is likely not caused by emacs itself, but in order to find the answer I think I&#x27;ll need to know how/why emacs is different when launched with /usr/bin/emacs in the terminal vs /usr/bin/emacs from a .desktop file?
 Does anyone have any ideas?

 My user-init-file got changed to the customary ~/.emacs. For Aquamacs, the standard is ~/Library/Preferences/Aquamacs Emacs/Preferences.el. 
 I think I ran some faulty Python code in an org-mode code block (I wrote it!) that triggered my Aquamacs to hang up. I used my Mac OS to force quit Emacs and subordinate Python process. Upon restarting Aquamacs, I got an error about being unable to find emacsql file (error thrown from the initialization file .emacs). I used C-h v user-init-file to verify that the init file is in fact .emacs. How do I tell Aquamacs to use ~/Preferences/Aquamacs Emacs/Preferences.el instead of ~/.emacs?
 Thanks in advance for any help.

18 months of the Haskell Unfolder by Edsko de Vries, Andres Löh
Eighteen months ago we launched The Haskell Unfolder, a YouTube series where we discuss all things Haskell. From the beginning the goal was to cover as broad a spectrum of topics as possible, as well as show-case the work of many different people in the Haskell world. We’d like to think we succeeded at that; below you will find a summary of the topics covered in the first year and a half, organized roughly by category.

                              <span>hello everyone!
 was curious about how Logseq, my note-taking daily driver, and org-mode compare to each other. i&#x27;ll say i know next to nothing about org-mode and the usual text editors common in UNIX spaces apart from nano haha
 i like logseq mainly as it is a block-based outliner, and it has a workflow that heavily encourages using the journal / writing on daily notes, which thanks to its backlink features, tagging and very solid query system let you have a very efficient workflow where you just write stuff in the journal and then everything falls into place, given you configured stuff well.
 does org-mode let you have this same amount of &quot;mindlessness&quot; where you can just put notes, have them be organized by themselves and be done with it? i know you can add plugins in org-mode and other things but i wouldn&#x27;t know of how to go about it, so i thought it better to directly ask people who have experience with the software.
 cheers!

                              <span>I am considering switching to orgmode from Obsidian, so I am making the exact same post I made on Obsidian, since I would have a lot more incentive if orgmode or orgroam would have a way to do the things I mention in the following post, 
 Over the summer I changed my workflow by taking rigorous notes on the textbook I was working through, as a result I ended up with a beautifully distilled version of the chapters (pictured below).
 https://preview.redd.it/9pxpid8fvutd1.png?width&#x3D;1684&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;bf98f97a76d432b2530485811031a0fd6291e5b2
 Unfortunately even though these were great, this took too much time and I realized that I had spent a lot of time jotting down stuff that I could have just as easily highlighted. I needed to come up with a more efficient system, so after thinking about it for a while I came to the realization that the only new information in my notes would be of the following type:
  
Explaining a certain step of a derivation in more detail. (by adding more steps)
 Adding additional information that was relevant. (an alternate explanation or my own explanation)
 Connecting the given information with some other piece of information. (like how you link stuff in Obsidian)
  
That&#x27;s how I came to the realization that if I could have like the comment feature that you usually have in word, but with more obsidian features for pdfs then that would be a game changer. For example, being able to upload a textbook to obsidian, then highlight a word/sentence or para (or the space in the between them) and then be able to write comments on it (both in Latex and normal text) or to be able to link that with other notes.
 I would be extremely grateful if somebody could let me know if there is a way to implement these features.
 Thnx!

                              <span>Hello everyone, hope this message gets you well!
 I&#x27;m fairly new to emacs, but not to text editors. I use Neovim on day to day job and coding, but I do lack that feeling of IDEs where you can run the code without leaving the editor. And I think Emacs can help me with that (beside the OBVIOUS reason of org mode).
 I&#x27;ve seen some tutorials including the onde from DistroTube, System Crafters (if i&#x27;m not mistaken) and tried looking some documention (Of course all of it is nearly impossible in two weeks).
 But the feeling that prevails is overwhelmed by the possibilities. I know I can do ANYTHING in Emacs, but for now I want a good documentation resource with code (jupyter vibes).
 I know some things that I think I want, like magit, a fast LSP server, auto complete, syntax checking and efficient buffer management.
 Well, I know it is impossible to ask for this but what would you recommend to add to Emacs to make it look like an IDE but still keep room to grow any opinions are highly appreciated.
 P.S.: Is there a good resource to search for plugins based on user ratings or functions?

                              <span>I am using the urxvt terminal with i3wm on Arch Linux. I recently installed emacs to try it out, when i tried to run emacs it kept exiting without even showing the default emacs screen and logging Undefined color: &quot;[60]#141c21&quot;. I discovered this is the BG color i had set on ~/.Xresources ( the [60] stands for transparency out of 100 ). I should also point out I am using picom for the transparency.
 I tried changing the hex representation to an rgba one: rgba:0000/0000/0000/cccc. This also didn&#x27;t work, i searched if there was any way to make emacs ignore the terminal colors, or overwrite them, but i didn&#x27;t find a solution there. The only way emacs works now is if i supply -nw --color&#x3D;no.
 Is there any way to not change my .Xresources and have emacs work even with different colors?

                              <span>After receiving some great feedback from the Neovim community on a comparison I made between Emacs and Neovim, and later also a bunch of encouragement words talking about this idea on both r/neovim and r/emacs, I&#x27;ve been inspired to create something new*:
 Emacs-Kick — a lightweight, beginner-friendly Emacs configuration inspired by kickstart.nvim
  
Github: https://github.com/LionyxML/emacs-kick
  
https://preview.redd.it/kg1oei01artd1.png?width&#x3D;1239&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;1ad6022340c96739e2bb79a24dcb1979a4657a60
 What Makes Emacs-Kick Special?
 While there are many Emacs kickstarter configs out there, Emacs-Kick is focused on providing a simple and accessible setup for Neovim users who are curious about Emacs, without asking them to fully dive into the Emacs way of doing things.
 Key Features:
  
Terminal-first: No need for a GUI. Works seamlessly with tmux, zellij, lazygit, starship, and other terminal tools.
 Vim bindings by default: For a smooth transition from Neovim.
 Pre-configured Treesitter and LSP: Get up and running quickly with modern code features.
 Simple defaults inspired by kickstart.nvim: Familiar setup to help ease the learning curve.
  
The goal of Emacs-Kick is not to replace Neovim but to act as a secondary tool that you can experiment with. Whether you&#x27;re interested in trying out Emacs&#x27; unique features or just want to see what all the fuss is about, Emacs-Kick makes it easy to explore without being overwhelmed by complex setups like Doom or Spacemacs.
 I’m excited to share it with the community—feel free to try it out and reach out with any feedback or questions on GitHub. Let’s build something great together!

                              <span>So, I think this is kind of both a Git and Magit question, but I&#x27;m now lost in the middle of something and hoping like crazy I haven&#x27;t screwed anything up.
 It&#x27;s a common enough situation. I have a feature branch with many commits, and master has a few commits past the branch point. I desired to squash the commits and rebase my feature onto the current tip of master to stay updated.
 Here&#x27;s what I did:
  
I switched to master, and made sure to pull the local branch to the tip.
 
I switched to my working branch, and made sure the origin was pushed and up to date with the current commit level, and stashed the current modified files.
 I performed a rebase onto branch with r b and selected the local master branch.
 I rewrote the commit for the first commit of the series and squashed the rest.

                              <span>I love ido mode but I have one frustration with it. If I want to create a new file and the file name resembles an existing buffer I’m always switched to that buffer. I know why this happens, but as a web developer in svelte, this can be frustrating since many files are named for instance “+page.svelte” , and the only difference is the file path. So, I’ll dired my way to a path and try to create a new file right there, and instead jump over to an existing buffer elsewhere and totally not have created the new file I want.
 Anybody got suggestions on how I can force create a new file buffer right where I just navigated to with dired ,even if the buffer name matches some other buffer?
 My lame workaround is to create a weird name like xyzzyzzyzy.svelte , write or paste some code in it, save, c-x d to the dired, hit r to reload the directory list, and then rename the file to what I actually want. Pretty tedious.
 All ideas welcomed!

                              <span>I&#x27;ve started learning Haskell yesterday, going through the &quot;blog generator&quot; tutorial. This page instructs me to implement even and odd using mutual recursion and decrementing by one. I&#x27;ve came up with this and tried it inghci:
 even num &#x3D; case num of 0 -&gt; True; _ -&gt; odd (num - 1)
 odd num &#x3D; case num of 0 -&gt; False; _ -&gt; even (num - 1)
 This works as expected and e.g. odd 9 produces True.
 Then, just for the lulz, I triedodd (-9), expecting it to crash the interpreter. But, to my amazement, negative numbers also seem to work correctly and instantenously! What kind magic is this? Does it cause some kind of overflow that provides correct results by coincidence?

                              <span>Hi!
 I want to try Scotty web framework, but when i put it as build dependency in cabal file i get an error (below). Tried to build the same stuff on other machine, get the same result.
 In ghci session i can use scotty with command :set -package scotty.
 Any idea how to solve this? Or to try different framework (which one)?

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;m a beginner in using emacs (20++ years working in vim and recently nvim), for some time now I&#x27;ve been using org mode in emacs as a combination calendar/todo/notebook. I keep my files on a shared google drive, I&#x27;ve also connected it to org-mobile on my phone and generally it works ok, I&#x27;m quite happy with it.
 However, I recently read a book about building a second brain and decided to tidy up the system a bit. While writing or linking notes is not a problem, I probably don&#x27;t understand the idea of ​​tags/properties or I have something set up wrong with the search. No matter how I set tags in my notes, I can&#x27;t search for them. It looks a bit like the search only works in a few files that I have in my org-agenda-files(and even then not always) and nowhere else.
 I want to be able to search for topics, e.g. by tags in my entire &quot;second brain&quot; without adding them all to my agenda. I&#x27;m just afraid that soon I&#x27;ll have dozens (hundreds?) of files and emacs will take half an hour to start. What&#x27;s the best way to do it?
 P.S. I&#x27;ve been recently reading about org-roam , but I&#x27;m afraid it&#x27;s a bit too complicated, especially since it requires a working database, which will severely limit file portability between platforms...

                              <span>I have been reading about the fast tag selection interface in the manual, and I would like to use it, but only in some cases.
 When I set tags for some kind of topics grouping, I am fine using the completion mini buffer, I still have too many tags to make a letter selection paractical. It also depends a lot on the context; mostly, am I tagging tasks or general notes, the former having far fewer &#x27;topic&#x27; tags.
 I have however a few tags that I use for maintenance purposes, or status indication like &#x27;DRAFT&#x27;, &#x27;WIP&#x27;, &#x27;REFILE&#x27;, etc... In those cases, the fast selection interface combined for mutually exclusive group tags is exactly what I need.
 I would rather not set the &#x60;TAGS&#x60; keyword in all of my files (I also use &#x60;org-roam&#x60; so I have a lot !), and I am trying to simply keep my settings as is…</span>

                              <span>I received on LinkedIn a couple of inMails from consultancy recruiters. It seems Apple is contracting a company to setup a « new team » (i read, not « new project »), but not hiring directly.
 Here is the message:
  
Hi I’m partnering with a global consultancy to build Apple’s new Scala team in Malmö, and we’re on the hunt for top talent to join this incredible journey! with a potential 5 year contract. If you&#x27;re ready to work on ground breaking projects with one of the world&#x27;s most iconic tech giants, I’d love to tell you more. Drop me your phone number and availability, and let’s chat! This could be your next big move!
  
It feels a bit like a scam, or at least like a dishonest approach, for instance if they have a retention problem on their Scala team and are hiring people to support their legacy.
 What do you think?

                              <span>Recently someone asked about filling (aka wrapping) text within columns. It&#x27;s a useful feature, so I added it to the simple package speedrect, which implements a little modal interface that comes alive during rectangle-selection mode.
 Just highlight a rectangular region of text (C-M-mouse-1 works great, or C-x SPACE then move), and hit f to wrap. The wrap width defaults to the rectangle&#x27;s width (e.g. to expand an existing wrapped block). Otherwise, use a numeric prefix (e.g. M-20 f) or regular prefix (C-u f) to prompt for the width. The selected rectangle&#x27;s height sets the height of the safe fill region (usually extending down to the next distinct &quot;row&quot; of data). If the newly filled text exceeds this height, additional lines are added below.
 speedrect has lots of other useful features for moving rectangles around, operating on them, and sending them back and forth to calc. To use it, just select a rectangle...

                              <span>I use Emacs with Evil. I often search in Org Mode headings thusly:
 /* .*foo / Start the search * Asterisk literal, followed by a space literal (signifying the end of any heading level) .* Any number of any character foo The search query 
 Is there either:
  
A better way to search headings?
  
or
  
A way to configure e.g. / to fill in /* .* as that is cumbersome to type, especially now that I&#x27;m in a cast?

                              <span>I&#x27;m setting up a deno dev loop in Emacs and I&#x27;m working from the deno site&#x27;s recommendations on editor config for Emacs and eglot:
 https://docs.deno.com/runtime/getting_started/setup_your_environment/#eglot
 elpaca is complaining about not being able to find js-mode and, agreed, I don&#x27;t see it on MELPA etc. I suspect perhaps something, for my version of emacs, has replaced js-mode? Or maybe for all versions of Emacs since the deno docs were written?
 Thoughts?
 Emacs version: GNU Emacs 29.4
 ty
 EDIT: LLMs say js2-mode has replaced js-mode however I&#x27;m seeing conflicting reports on that in this sub and elsewhere.

                              <span>I have this org file:
 | | 1 | i | j | k | | / | &lt; | | | | |---+---+----+----+----| | 1 | 1 | i | j | k | | i | i | -1 | k | -j | | j | j | k | -1 | | | k | k | j | -i | -1 | \quad | | 1 | i | j | k | | / | &lt; | | | | |---+---+----+----+----| | 1 | 1 | i | j | k | | i | i | -1 | k | -j | | j | j | k | -1 | | | k | k | j | -i | -1 | 
 That produces this TeX file:
 \begin{center} \begin{tabular}{l|llll} &amp; 1 &amp; i &amp; j &amp; k\\[0pt] \hline 1 &amp; 1 &amp; i &amp; j &amp; k\\[0pt] i &amp; i &amp; -1 &amp; k &amp; -j\\[0pt] j &amp; j &amp; k &amp; -1 &amp; \\[0pt] k &amp; k &amp; j &amp; -i &amp; -1\\[0pt] \end{tabular} \end{center} \quad \begin{center} \begin{tabular}{l|llll} &amp; 1 &amp; i &amp; j &amp; k\\[0pt] \hline 1 &amp; 1 &amp; i &amp; j &amp; k\\[0pt] i &amp; i &amp; -1 &amp; k &amp; -j\\[0pt] j &amp; j &amp; k &amp; -1 &amp; \\[0pt] k &amp; k &amp; j &amp; -i &amp; -1\\[0pt] \end{tabular} \end{center} 
 How do I disable the auto-centering? The only options on the manual page are to enable it
  
  
The answer was to set org-latex-tables-centered to nil.

                              <span>Wonderful folks of this sub-reddit, 
 I have decided to rebuild my emacs config (switching from Doom) and I am using the emacs-frosted from Homebrew. I have installed emacs@plus-30 (with native-comp) and while trying to run my initial run a lot of the packages are failing to build - and the error I get is &#x27;error invoking gcc driver&#x27;. 
 I am not at all a technical person but from a bit of googling around I understand this mainly has to do with setting the path from where Emacs calls this library. Apart from fixing this problem I would like to learn about this as well, so I have two questions -
  
I have gcc installed from Homebrew. It is situated in a bin folder under the cellar directory. I have two versions (14.1.0_2, 14.2.0). I have added the snippet below in my early-init -  (setenv &quot;LIBRARY_PATH&quot; &quot;/opt/homebrew/Cellar/gcc/14.2.0/bin&quot;)  However this not solve my issue. 
 Do I need to do this in my earl-init, or can I just add this in my zhrsc profile? I do not understand whats the difference between both. 
  
PS - Yes, I have exec-from-shell package installed and I&#x27;ve added use-package in my init file.
 EDIT - Yes, I&#x27;m on Sequoia
 EDIT 2 - SOLVED - https://github.com/d12frosted/homebrew-emacs-plus/issues/733

                              <span>We are working on a project and need to both create SVGs and read our created SVGs (or also user supplied SVGs, but we can specify which SVG elemtns are allowed).
 When reading svgs we need to know which shapes are contained in the svgs (only circles and rectangles are relevant for us). If there are shapes using the svg , / in the file this would certainly make life easier for reading the svg.
 Mainly based on another post https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/tlvopj/looking_for_svg_library_recommendations/ I&#x27;ve found the following libraries that supports both reading and writing:
  
svg-tree: Features both reading and writing. But reading and writing seems to not be super easy but I was able to accomplish both things as a POC. Also the documentation is almost non existent. For an easier to use writing interface I imagine that we could also use lucid-svg.
 
diagrams with diagrams-svg and diagrams-input: Features both reading and writing. The writing api is amazing and really well documented! And I was able to read an svg file created by the library into a Diagrams type. But I was not able to find a way how I can find out what shapes are contained in this Diagram (what circles and rectangles are there in the file?). It doesn&#x27;t seem to be easily possible, as it just saves Paths in the types and also in the file? But maybe I&#x27;m wrong. Unfortunately combining the writing API of diagrams and using the svg-tree library to parse them also doesn&#x27;t seem to be easily possible, as again, only paths are saved in the file.
 
 Does someone know whether this is possible using diagrams? Or does someone have any suggestions on a different library we could use to read or write an svg? (e.g. a better writing interface that will work together with svg-tree)
 Any help is greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance!

 I&#x27;m seeking input regarding Yampa&#x27;s API, public definitions, and module hierarchy (other possible improvements, such as documentation, examples, code style, test coverage, performance, etc. are out of the question).
 You can navigate Yampa&#x27;s API here:

 If you have any thoughts, could you please help me by sharing them here: https://github.com/ivanperez-keera/Yampa/discussions/312
 Thanks!

 It would be nice if it started from basic first principles with lots of concrete examples and then expanded to larger, more complex problems and their solutions.
 Is there anything like Scala Koans where the learning is integrated into an immediate problem-solving loop to better understand, ground, and integrate the new concepts?

                              <span>I’m aware that Python is hugely popular in the data engineering space, but I believe that this might be more due to its popularity than its actual advantages over other languages. Scala, in my opinion, has features that, if leveraged properly, can outperform Python in certain areas.
 I’m curious if anyone in our community here is using Scala exclusively for data engineering without relying on Python at all. I’ve been a full-stack software engineer working in Scala for over five years, and I’m considering transitioning to data engineering. Should I invest time in learning Python, or is focusing solely on Scala a viable option in this field? Would it be better to spend that time deepening my Scala skills in more advanced areas instead?

                              <span>Today when I opened up Emacs and ran the LaTeX previews in my org-file, the LaTeX font is suddenly rendered as very tiny, to such an extent that you cannot read the math. It worked fine yesterday and I have not played around with anything since that in my config. Has anyone else encountered this problem? Running org-version gives me &quot;Org mode version 9.6.15 (release_9.6.15 @ /snap/emacs/current/usr/share/emacs/29.4/lisp/org/)&quot;

                              <span>There is &#x60;Logview&#x60;, but it does not support JSON structured logs out of the box.
 I found this nice article detailing some useful commands such as keep-lines and flush-lines which are built-in.
 However, I would like to pretty print the logs first using the json-pretty-print-buffer command, and then run keep-lines to say, keep only logs that have the level field set to error.
 This doesn&#x27;t really work because it only matches the line itself (of course); it is not aware that is inside a JSON object, thus the rest of the JSON object is hidden.
 Is there a better way of doing this?
 And also, how do you usually trek through logs in Emacs?
 I really like lnav and being able to easily enable filters. It seems that keep-lines stacks, but there doesn&#x27;t seem to be an easy way to toggle filters?
 Thanks

                              <span>I really like the way Doom emacs works and the features it has, especially how it automatically makes your schedule and lists your todo&#x27;s for you, and be able to run code in the same place. I haven&#x27;t used org roam yet, but I have not found a proper tutorial on how to even enable it or just use it. But I also wish to have access to my doom emacs notes from any device I want, but i figured its a pain to set it up on my android for example. So i want opinions of people for wether i should switch or not, and how i can use it easily or make it more accessible

                              <span>If this is relevant I am Org/Org Roam on Doom Emacs. 
 As a writer with a severe case of ADHD I sometimes need the temptation of distraction. I am perfectly aware that it is not really possible to completely lock up Linux or Emacs, but just making it a bit harder to lose focus is often enough. So a simple function that made it so that I can&#x27;t leave the file I&#x27;m working at for the time being would be quite helpful.
 ALSO...
 If you feel compelled to say &quot;just make an effort instead&quot;, please don&#x27;t. Looking for ways to make my environment and tools less distracting is effort. 
 I&#x27;m glad you have good self control. I don&#x27;t. So keep this to yourself.

There is no good reason to do it, but after having defined the actual alphabet in a python converter script, it was fast to implement.
  
The Emacs Lisp modes: https://pastebin.com/zfbH40Je
 The Python script: https://pastebin.com/PJ1KKMKF
  
I strongly recommend against actually coding like this. Preferable use is for being \&quot;that\&quot; guy in a chat.

                              <span>Hi!
 I just upgraded my emacs, now I am using this org-mode version:
 Org mode version 9.7.11 
 But I am getting this nasty error:
 {lisp} Debugger entered--Lisp error: (error &quot;Tab width in Org files must be 8, not 4. Please adjust your ‘tab-width’ settings for Org mode&quot;) error(&quot;Tab width in Org files must be 8, not %d. Please adjust your &#x60;tab-width&#x27; settings for Org mode&quot; 4) org-element--list-struct(8081) #(8081 element nil nil) org-element--parse-to(7594) org-element-at-point() org-at-item-p() org-indent-add-properties(# 10437 (0 2 0)) org-indent-initialize-buffer(# (0 2 0)) org-indent-initialize-agent() apply(org-indent-initialize-agent nil) timer-event-handler([t 0 0 200000 t org-indent-initialize-agent nil idle 0 nil]) 
 The Org release notes suggest to run this in existing org files:
 {lisp} (defun org-compat-adjust-tab-width-in-buffer (old-width) &quot;Adjust visual indentation from &#x60;tab-width&#x27; equal OLD-WIDTH to 8.&quot; (interactive &quot;nOld &#x60;tab-width&#x27;: &quot;) (cl-assert (derived-mode-p &#x27;org-mode)) (unless (&#x3D; old-width 8) (org-with-wide-buffer (goto-char (point-min)) (let (bound (repl (if (&lt; old-width 8) (make-string old-width ?\s) (concat &quot;\t&quot; (make-string (- old-width 8) ?\s))))) (while (re-search-forward &quot;^ *\t&quot; nil t) (skip-chars-forward &quot; \t&quot;) (setq bound (point-marker)) (forward-line 0) (while (search-forward &quot;\t&quot; bound t) (replace-match repl))))))) 
 But I am doing it, and (1) nothing changes when I run that code, (2) the error persists.
 What should I do?
 Thanks in advance

 What is it I&#x27;m missing? Have I found some bug in org-mode or is there some bug in my configuration?
 I thought it was something in the formula references, but after replacing them with column numbers the error still persists.
 Is there some other thing in the org configuration that can cause this?

                              <span>Hello fellow Emacsers. 
 Id like some tips on how to write a function that lists titles of all my open Tabs in a specific browser (Eg: Brave). Any clue on how to go about this? Do i need a specific browser plugin for this. Any browser doesnt matter. If I have a working example that simply assigns to a list variable, I can start off from there to add more functionality. (of course, needs a function that auto updates on a key combination).
 Edit: It&#x27;s on a Windows

                              <span>So I randomly decided to start learning Haskell (and FP) a few days ago and actually really enjoyed it. Some concepts were definitely a bit hard to grasp at first, but after figuring them out, I was almost instantly able to see how using said concept could be more beneficial than an imperative approach. That being said, I was somewhat disappointed when I learned that Haskell is considered to be &quot;niche&quot; in the software industry and that there aren&#x27;t as many jobs for it as there are for other FP langs like Scala (and of course Java), but there are certainly still a few. 
 For the minority of Haskell programmers who do it for a living, what exactly do you program? Do you prefer doing your work in Haskell as opposed to another FP language (e.g. Scala, Elixir, OCaml, Clojure...) as well as imperative languages (e.g. Python, Java, C#...)?

                              <span>Hi All,
 The Cask micro-framework is my go-to building block for REST services. It hits the productive, approachable sweet-spot for what scala could and should be IMHO.
 I’m also a fan of contract-first development for REST services, and noticed cask was missing as an option, so I took the liberty of providing one and wrote about it here.
 Beyond cask, I took the liberty of addressing a number of other issues I’ve found lacking in the other offerings: 
  
being able to just jar-up my generated code
 offer an easy example for bootstrapping my project
 have the generated code target both JVM and ScalaJS
 correctly implement validation, ‘additionalProperties’, and other open-api features
  
Anyway, it’s currently available, though perhaps alpha-quality (so comments / bug reports / contributors welcome)
 A big thank-you too to William Cheng and the wonderful maintainers of the openapi templates, and of course Li Haoyi for his excellent “Singapore stack” :-)

The promise of the Zettelkasten method is that it will allow you to create an artificial writing partner that will surprise you with new ideas and help you write high-quality texts.
However, the typical situation for inexperienced spectators is to be disappointed when they visit someone else&#x27;s Zettelkasten; they cannot see how a Zettelkasten lives up to its promise, and they cannot see the ghost in the box.
The underlying problem is that if you don&#x27;t understand the true nature of a Zettelkasten, you won&#x27;t be able to see the ghost in the box.
So, what is the true nature of a Zettelkasten? A Zettelkasten is a thinking environment. The ghost does not hide inside the box; it hides in the private mental process of a user interacting with his Zettelkasten.
How do you find the ghost in…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m finding that I frequently need to glimpse at or copy over code from one branch to another. For example, it would be amazing if I could view a function on one branch and modify it on another without needing to have two clones of the repo.
 How do you guys deal with this? Is there a nice Magit feature or Emacs package to handle this? I know that you can view diffs between branches with magit, but the diff menu can get a bit convoluted when you&#x27;ve made a ton of changes.

                              <span>Hi folks. I&#x27;ve been using emacs for 20+ years for C[++], Python, and a specialty language called SPIN, written by Parallax Inc for its Propeller and Propeller2 multicore microcontrollers. I have been living without TAGS for SPIN since the language was introduced in 2009 or so, but I&#x27;m wondering if this group can help me figure out how to make it work.
 SPIN syntax is similar to Pascal, but it uses indentation instead of BEGIN/END blocks. Single line comments start with a single quote (&quot;&#x27;&quot;) and are not ended. Multiline comments are bracketed with double curly braces (&quot;{{&quot; and &quot;}}&quot;). Global variables are typed by &quot;LONG,&quot; &quot;WORD&quot; or &quot;BYTE.&quot; Functions (&quot;methods&quot;) are untyped, always returning int32, and declared with &quot;PUB&quot; or &quot;PRI&quot;. The local variables are also untyped (all int32) and follow th…</span>

 I get this in my minibuffer on invoking eglot-format-buffer
  eglot--error: [eglot] Unsupported or ignored LSP capability :documentFormattingProvider&#x27; 
 I found a (possibly) related neovim issue here
 Can someone help me fix this? Thanks!

                              <span>Hello, I am an Emacs newbie. I am trying to setup eglot with use-package. According to eglot doc I need add eglot-ensure to c-mode-hook. But it cannot work. This is my configuration:
 (use-package eglot
 :after (cc-mode)
 :hook (c-mode-hook . eglot-ensure))
 When I press C-x C-e to eval it, I get (eglot-ensure) in minibuffer, it seems successful, but I get nil when I press C-h v to check value of c-mode-hook.
 And it will be work when I use following configuration:
 (use-package eglot
 :after (cc-mode)
 ;; :hook (c-mode-hook . eglot-ensure)
 :config
 (add-hook &#x27;c-mode-hook &#x27;eglot-ensure))
 I have readed use-package doc, and searched relevant posts in here. I really don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s wrong there. 
 Thanks for everyone!

                              <span>https://www.twitch.tv/ultrono. The idea is to give a way for others to see and participate in a lecture when they cannot attend it and it is not being streamed or recorded. A quick look at the available videos, such as https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2267245752, should give some flavor. 
 A side effect may be to advertise some lesser known features available today in Emacs/AUCTeX/ELPA/…, such as automatic and live previews with correct numbering, folding for everything, etc. Any feedback welcome!

                              <span>i am trying to code a terminal snake game and when i run the the file with runghc it works as intended bur when i do with &quot;cabal run&quot; multithreading doesnt work so it only shows the board borders and it blocks,
 i set the -threaded option in the .cabal file and did a &quot;cabal clean&quot; to run it again and nothing changes, again it works as intended with runghc so what am i missing?
 [EDIT] i tryed compiling instead of runghc abd it also doesnt work, is there some ceremony needed to run concurrent programs? what am i missing?

                              <span>I&#x27;m at a company which has a cult like behaviour towards Haskell. I&#x27;m fairly decent in Haskell but don&#x27;t really mind using other languages. I understand that Haskell is a great language but the way my colleagues talk about Java or Python seems to be slightly fanatical. They keep harping on about how amazing Haskell is and how crap oop is. These are senior engineers and the way they are so opinionated makes me wary. From my POV, I think OOP or imperative languages are used in like 95% of all software which means they surely have something going for them because at the end of the day only the ones that make money matters.
 I think both have their usecases in different places but it&#x27;s just uncomfortable to be in an office that craps on OOP all the time with no effort on being at least slightly objective. How do I keep my sanity while working here or are they correct with their views?

                              <span>I&#x27;m spending many hours trying to make org-mode export to PDF look decent for business purposes and failing miserably. I&#x27;m aware how much more popular latex is in academic community, so it&#x27;s no surprise that out of the box export looks like an academic paper. However, my attempts to make it look more like an office document failed. A lot of basic features of org mode like tables or indentation are just not there out of the box.
 Does anyone have any ready made templates that I could just include and they would &quot;just work&quot;?
 Here is my current setup:
 headers.tex included at the top of the document: https://pastebin.com/9nYe45bP
 headers in org-mode documents:
 #+LATEX_HEADER: \input{/home//latex/headers.tex} #+OPTIONS: \n:t #+OPTIONS: H:6 #+OPTIONS: toc:nil #+LATEX_COMPILER: xelatex 
 export command: emacsclient --eval &#x27;(progn (find-file &quot;.org&quot;) (org-latex-export-to-pdf))&#x27;

 It is for sure my most used key combination in Emacs, I use it way too much, so much so that I also accidentally press it when I am using other programs and it just quits because C-x is sometimes a shortcut for exit like in nano :(

                              <span>I recently started emacs for programming purpose. But it&#x27;s so rich i was thinking to myself if i can use it as my notepad. The thing is my main notepad program is CherryTree since it has hierarchial noting i use it for storing pdf files, texts, etc. it&#x27;s my personal archive. Do you think configuring emacs for this is worth the learning and time or stick to cherrytree for this? (In the long term i&#x27;ll probably use emacs for a lot of things besides programming in my linux distros, i currently use it in my win system.)

                              <span>What is Aider
 Aider is an AI pair programming tool in the terminal. It allows you to pair program with large language models (LLMs) to edit code in your local Git repository. You can start a new project or work with an existing Git repo. Aider works best with GPT-4 or Claude 3.5 Sonnet and can connect to almost any LLM. The GitHub page for Aider is GitHub - Aider-AI/aider: aider is AI pair programming in your terminal, and the project currently has nearly 20k stars.
 Aider has performed well in solving real coding problems on SWE-bench.
 Introducing Aider.el
 Recently, the Cursor editor has been gaining popularity. As a long-time Emacs user, I don&#x27;t want to switch to Cursor just because of AI. Currently, Aider only has plugins for Vim and VSCode, but Emacs has a tradition of integrating command-line tools. So I decided to write my own, as a humble attempt: GitHub - tninja/aider.el: aider emacs plugin forhttps://github.com/paul-gauthier/aider.
 This plugin offers the following advantages over using Aider directly from the command line:
  
Pop-up menu: No need to remember commands. (aider-transient-menu)
 Git repository-specific Aider sessions in Emacs: It automatically identifies the Git repository of the current file and creates a new Aider session for it. Multiple Aider sessions can exist for different Git repositories, allowing you to work on several repositories simultaneously without interference.
 Region-based refactor support: You can select a region (e.g., a code block) in a file and ask Aider to refactor it.
  
In fact, most of this plugin itself was generated using Aider / aider.el.
 If you&#x27;re interested in AI-assisted programming and, like me, prefer not to leave the Emacs environment, perhaps you could give Aider and aider.el a try. I would appreciate any feedback or suggestions you have about aider.el. Thank you!

                              <span>Hi, Been using for vim for more than a decade, and wanted to change to emacs or say try it, I&#x27;m on MAC (M-series)primarily, so got a question. i want to try this from DT &quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;d1fgypEiQkE&amp;list&#x3D;PL5--8gKSku15e8lXf7aLICFmAHQVo0KXX&quot; but before putting the time and effort, would like to know, is it easier to setup, cause when i read some comments under the first video, lots of people complaining about package manager not able to install, something like that. And i didn&#x27;t see any responses to their comments. I researched about DOOM EMACS as well, and you guys suggest me to jump to that, or try this? I want to configure this as a hobby, and it wont disturb my work in any way, I used to use plain VI for a long time now, and don&#x27;t want to try vscode.

                              <span>Let me paint a picture for you all: I do some technical writing using org-mode (mostly papers on computer science), but I must confess I got a terrible spelling, both in my mother tongue and English, so spell checking is a must to everything I do. 
 I used to use flyspell + enchant, but it would cause severe lag (I tend to write hole documents in one file), so I have changed to jinx, and it&#x27;s amazing in terms of performance. One thing I think I could upgrade in my workflow, is that the suggestions are too far off the real word I mean, even thought the error is somewhat minor, most of the words I don&#x27;t even know existed! 
 On the other hand, I also have ltex installed, and its suggestions are 99% of the time on point, but it comes at the cost of only updating when I save the buffer and being somewhat slow. So to do a final pass is great, but to spell check while writing is impossible.
 One other thing I have seen in the past but never got my head around doing was using dabbrev to fix recurring mistakes, but I don&#x27;t think this would solve the problem. Another (crazy) idea is to use some small LLM to better predict the word based on context, but if LanguageTool can do it without it (I think), is there any other way?
 So, anyone have tackled those difficulties? I am accepting any tips or tricks you all have!

                              <span>I recently made this post describing a weird issue I have where Emacs frames are being automatically deleted.
  
 I followed u/mocam6o suggestion of using the following hook
 (add-hook &#x27;delete-frame-functions (lambda (_) (backtrace))) 
 and after a while I managed to catch Emacs in the act of killing frames. Here is an example backtrace:
 backtrace() (lambda (_) (backtrace))(#) run-hook-with-args((lambda (_) (backtrace)) #) delete-frame() funcall-interactively(delete-frame) repeat(nil) funcall-interactively(repeat nil) call-interactively(repeat) #f(compiled-function () (interactive nil) #)() funcall-interactively(#f(compiled-function () (interactive nil) #)) command-execute(#f(compiled-function () (interactive nil) #)) 
  
 By contrast, when I manually kill a frame (containing just a window with the *scratch* buffer), the backtrace is:
 backtrace() (lambda (_) (backtrace))(#) run-hook-with-args((lambda (_) (backtrace)) #) delete-frame() funcall-interactively(delete-frame) 
  
 The cause of the automatic deletion seems to be a compiled-function, and looking at other backtraces, the function seems to be associated with #.
  
 How do I find out the name or source of this compiled function, or work out how it&#x27;s being called? (I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s possible to find the source name of compiled code ...)

I would like to use exwm as my desktop manager, but I am not sure how to get it up and running, I was going to use systemcrafters tutorial on yt, but it looks like one of his pre requisites is downloading his emacs config, I&#x27;ve only been using emacs for half the year now and have just been learning slowly, I think I would like to keep my config as it is for the time being. His tutorial also differs in some details, compared to others, so there must be more than one way. I&#x27;m a little uncertain which one to follow. What would you suggest in my case? I can provide any relevant details if it would be helpful. 
 Thanks!!

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to pick up emacs for the first time. I have been playing around with some basic customizations via elisp in my intit.el file after watching systemcrafters videos.
 I guess whats happening after reading around is that the customize GUI is injecting some settings into my init.el file?
 It was my understanding that the init.el isn&#x27;t &#x27;connected&#x27; to the GUI customize interface.
 I&#x27;ve added the following to the top of my init.el file for now to keep the settings that I can&#x27;t seem to control in another file. But I can&#x27;t help but think I don&#x27;t understand something or am doing something wrong....
 (setq custom-file &quot;~/.config/emacs/custom.el&quot;)
 (load custom-file)
 My question(s):
 When making your own configuration is it the Customize GUI, init.el, or both being used in conjunction with one another? Does it matter or should I be disabling the GUI interface?

                              <span>I know many people who use Emacs map CapsLock to Ctrl to avoid “Emacs pinky” and many vim/nvim users map it to esc since esc, the most used key in Vim, is far away from home row.
 So it seems the best solution would be to do a system-wide remapping to let CapsLock trigger esc when tapped and Ctrl when hold down (this can be achieved by keyd program on Linux and karabina elements on macOS). While this works, I found it to accidentally trigger esc frequently when I try to do movement or C-g in Emacs, which is annoying.
 I’m wondering if there is a better solution. I was thinking of disabling esc completely in Emacs (not sure if it’s achievable via .emacs file) as I’ve never used it but it seems like the esc key has its own use in Emacs.
 I’d love to know if anyone had a different workflow. I’d like to stop using keyd program as it seems to have issues with key repeat on my machine. By the way I use vanilla Emacs and have no intention to use evil mode. Thanks for the help.

                              <span>Did my Bachelors in CS in India, and currently doing my Masters in Belgium. We never had Scala in our Bachelors, so I&#x27;ve never learnt it. Currently, I have a subject called Software Architectures, and we use Scala in this. They took just 2 hours of class time to cover the basics of Scala. Brother what is this language? Where do I even begin with this? Any youtube tutorial or Udemy tutorial to learn the language?
 Thankyou!

                              <span>Hi, I am just learning play framework and trying a toy application with slick DB!
 But I am having a hard time using metals with methods suggestions or definitions support.
 For more info
 I am using scala 3.3.3, Play 2 +, Java 11, SBT 1.10
 Metals is updated as well 
 When I try to look at metals logs I don&#x27;t see any issue whatsoever which I can understand. From Doctor it gives yellow icon at semantic DB, also I am not able to find semantic db files through command (metals: semantic db file in vs code) 
 Mostly I am having those issues with any file that is doing anything with slick DB, for slick I am using play-slick 6.1
 which uses slick 3.5._ which is compatible with scala 3
 Please help, am I making any mistake or is it a metals problem!
 Also, in IntelliJ things are working well! But I can&#x27;t use IntelliJ in WSL (IntelliJ takes 10 gigs of ram alone in WSL) 
 https://reddit.com/link/1fwlnfc/video/lzx7pbkocwsd1/player
 I am attaching a video to demonstrate what I am facing !
 I want to have methods definition at least after typing &#x27;.&#x27; . 
 Another thing I want to point is that Compilation is working perfectly, see the red underlines that comes and go! But it is the definitions and autosuggestions that metals is not picking up !
 HELP !!

Link at the random &quot;note-to-note&quot; level, and add context about why I&#x27;m linking between the two notes


Link at the &quot;train of thoughts&quot; level: I have to spread out the related notes, read through them, and finally write down an idea from the book that matches the cluster of notes.</span>

                              <span>Hey, folks, new to Haskell. I find that I learn best by mucking up code - get some code to work, then try to refactor it to see it in a new light. Stuck on this gem and hope to get some insight from you all:
 Context: I&#x27;m working towards a text adventure app where you put the name of the adventure in as a command line argument: &#x60;LaunchAdventure --adventure myAdventure:&#x60;.
 This works:
 -- #1 greet :: AdventureOptions -&gt; IO () greet (AdventureOptions a ) &#x3D; putStrLn $ &quot;You chose: &#x27;&quot; ++ a ++ &quot;&#x27;.&quot; main :: IO () main &#x3D; (greet &#x3D;&gt; putStrLn &quot;And just for testing&quot; 
 Where parse is of type parse :: IO AdventureOptions (I&#x27;m using the optparse-applicative package as part of this experiment).
 What I want to do is to see if I can get rid of thegreet function completely. I&#x27;ve cobbled a few attempts together like these:
 -- #2 main &#x3D; \a -&gt; putStrLn $ &quot;You chose: &#x27;&quot; ++ a ++ &quot;&#x27;.&quot; &#x3D; parse &gt;&gt;&#x3D; putStrLn $ &quot;You chose: &#x27;&quot; ++ (a :: AdventureOptions) ++ &quot;&#x27;.&quot; 
 But I keep running into errors like &quot;Couldn&#x27;t match expected type ‘[Char]’ with actual type ‘AdventureOptions’&quot; (with regards to a) or worse. I get what the error is saying; what I can&#x27;t figure out is how to solve it inline.
 The working greet example (#1) has the function declaration of greet :: AdventureOptions -&gt; IO () so I gather that that is how the compiler is inferring things there. How does one indicate that type in an inline fashion?
 Is &quot;casting&quot; a to AdventureOptions a possibility in some way? I know I&#x27;ve seen documentation regarding in-line type syntax, but can&#x27;t find a solid example that is applicable here. And is a lambda even the right thing to attempt here at all?

                              <span>Hello there! 👋
 After receiving some encouraging feedback from the Neovim community on a recent comparison I made between Emacs and Neovim (here), I’ve been inspired to create something new (new for me):
 Emacs-Kicks — a lightweight Emacs configuration inspired by kickstart.nvim.
 What sets this project apart from the many existing kickstart packages for Emacs? The main focus is to offer a simple, Neovim-user friendly setup for those who are curious about Emacs, without asking them to fully transition or embrace the entire &quot;Emacs way&quot; of doing things.
 Some key features:
  
No need for GUI, making it tmux, zellij, lazygit, starship, and terminal tool friendly
 Vim bindings as default
 Treesitter and LSP pre-configured
 Simple defaults based on kickstart.nvim for familiarity
  
The idea is for Emacs to act as a secondary tool, not as a replacement for Neovim, so users can experiment and explore Emacs without feeling overwhelmed by setups like Doom or Spacemacs.
 The project is almost ready, and I’d love to get feedback from the Emacs community. This could also be a helpful entry point for Neovim users who want to dip their toes into Emacs without too much complexity.
 If anyone would be interested in testing it or offering feedback, I’d love to hear your thoughts!
 Wish me luck over at r/neovim 😊

                              <span>Hi All,
 I&#x27;ve had a disappointing day... I restarted my MacBook Pro this morning as an update required it. There&#x27;s me thinking &quot;what could go wrong, all MY stuff is in Emacs&quot; (side note, it&#x27;s not, I&#x27;m working towards it). Once the machine came back up, I have this weird issue where Emacs works, sort of. I can&#x27;t seem to open any org documents running Emacs in GUI mode, I just get the spinning beach ball and the machine locks up. I have to wait to force close Emacs before I regain control. I don&#x27;t use Emacs in the terminal (because I have the GUI and love it), however I have no issues with opening/editing/reading org files through emacs in terminal.
 I am wondering, has any one come across this issue today/in the past? Am I missing something (is there some manual I didn&#x27;t read - if you point it out and it&#x27;s obvious I&#x27;m happy to look stupid for a little while, but please show me the answer)? Also, if there&#x27;s a load of &quot;I have no idea what you did&quot; then are there others out there to simply share in this misery (I had such a lovely set up, still got it, but this blemish (I hope it&#x27;s a blemish) is busting ma danglies.
 And if you just stopped by to read this guy crying in to the inter webs: Hi, I use Emacs (almost badly?) btw, nice to meet you - and you should really use Emacs hopefully it won&#x27;t slap you in the fan-dangles like it has me today.

 And the repo: https://github.com/szymonkaliski/cartographist
 I&#x27;m interested in replicating a couple of features and was wondering if anyone else had a similar project I could build from.
 I&#x27;d like to replicate the code browse in columns depicted here: https://szymonkaliski.com/newsletter/2022-01-03-q4-2021/vim-panes.jpg
 What might be more difficult would be replicating this history view: https://szymonkaliski.com/projects/cartographist/history.jpg
 Does anyone know of a similar Emacs project?

                              <span>Doing academic research, I often have cases where I want to reference, for example, a specific chapter from a book (like collective works, or collected essays from one author). I create these as individual items in my library (exported as bibtex by Zotero/better bibtex but I don&#x27;t think that is important). I would like to be able to keep the notes for these chapters connected to the source book, but I can&#x27;t figure out how to get citar-open-notes to recognise this. Calling citar-open-notes for a new library item creates a new org file with the appropirate metadata (including roam-refs) and the citekey as the filename; this is fine default behaviour, but I&#x27;d like it to first check if the citekey already exists as a roam_refs property in another file before creating a new one.
 Can I get it to do this somehow? Thanks!

 When i&#x27;m visiting cargo project&#x27;s Cargo.toml file, when I put cursor on a cargo dependency, I wanto to jump to the dependency&#x27;s source file, so I developed cargo-jump-xref.el. It will add a cargo-jump-xref to xref-backend-functions, then when you M-x xref-find-definitions on a Cargo dependency in Cargo.toml. It will jump to the dependency&#x27;s source file.

                              <span>Hello scala expert.
 I&#x27;m new in the scala world and i try to expose my swagger config from a scala api.
 Everything is working fine with finatra swagger.
 But one of my endpoint response is a case class with a property of type trait.
 With this response i will have my response correctly exported in definition but the CodedErrorContract trait will not be exported so i cannot generate client because of a missing object.
 Do you have an idea how to solve that with keeping my trait in the response.
 I know i could refactor my model to use class instead of a trait but i would try to avoid that solution.
 Thanks for your help
 case class Response( isError: Boolean, error: Option[CodedErrorContract] } @JsonDeserialize(as &#x3D; classOf[CodedErrorImpl]) trait CodedErrorContract { def message: String def errorCode: Int @transient def httpCode: Int &#x3D; 400 } object CodedErrorContract { type Ensured[+T] &#x3D; Either[Seq[CodedErrorContract], T] } case class CodedErrorImpl(message: String, errorCode: Int) extends CodedErrorContract

                              <span>Hey, we have just finished another live stream of a Scala Space Podcast episode! If you missed it, link to yt video is below. Our guest today was Billy Autrey, engineer working at Engflow on customer success with Bazel build tool and Engflow&#x27;s remote caching. We&#x27;ve talked about Bazel, its internals and ecosystem and massive Scala builds. We&#x27;ve also learned that sbt 2 will incorporate some of the lessons learned with Bazel. That in turn means some nice speedups are coming to your sbt build quite soon! View the podcast here:

                              <span>Hi,
 I am needing some assistance with a Haskell task. It is medium difficulty and will need knowledge of functional programming. Open to quotes.
 It involves creating a parser to convert special text to HTML.
 Thanks

                              <span>I’ve released library that helps to build web applications. It is situated between scotty and servant, avoiding complex types (where possible), while at the same time providing a typed interface and introspection capabilities.
 Here is “hello, world” using Minion. More can be found at Hackage (Web.Minion.Examples.*) and Github
 {-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-} {-# LANGUAGE OverloadedLists #-} module Main where import Web.Minion import Network.Wai.Handler.Warp qualified as Warp main :: IO () main &#x3D; Warp.run 9001 app app :: ApplicationM IO app &#x3D; serve api api :: Router Void IO api &#x3D; &quot;api&quot; /&gt; [ &quot;about&quot; /&gt; handlePlainText u/String GET about , &quot;hello&quot; /&gt; capture u/String &quot;name&quot; .&gt; handlePlainText u/String GET hello ] where about &#x3D; pure &quot;Hello-World Minion server&quot; hello name &#x3D; pure $ &quot;Hello, &quot;  name  &quot;!&quot; 
 I assume that the library currently has some bugs and may have an inconvenient interface and not very detailed documentation. But I hope to solve these problems with the help of the community. Try it out in your projects, send bug reports, thank you.

                              <span>... and I see some older references to conf-mode and being able to tangle to a &quot;conf&quot; language. However, when I require conf-mode and then add &quot;(conf . t)&quot; to org-babel&#x27;s load languages it says it cannot find ob-conf.
 Anybody have advice as to the happy path on how to tangle up some plain-text / configuration files (for Literate DevOps)?
 I&#x27;d like to avoid a HEREDOC in a sh|shell|bash language block because that doesn&#x27;t lend itself to great syntax coloring. These tangles are as often InSpec code as they are plain-text. (No, the org-babel Ruby language support doesn&#x27;t like InSpec.)
 thx
 EDIT:
 - GNU Emacs 29.4 (build 1, x86_64-pc-linux-gnu, GTK+ Version 3.24.41, cairo version 1.18.0)

 EDIT: 
 It&#x27;s not a perfect solution but since neither &#x27;conf&#x27; nor &#x27;text&#x27; seems to work, I am able to use &#x27;org&#x27; to get what I want via an oddly indirect route:

 Hi everyone. I decided to give emacs a go and coming from vim, doom sounded like a good idea. I&#x27;m encountering a strange issue though. I&#x27;m getting two different lists of completions and the one in the background is focused. The only package I have turned on appears to be company. Has anyone else experienced and resolved this issue?

                              <span>Hi
 I have some simple org-babel code which I have reduced to a test case as follows
 # -*- mode:org ; eval:(visual-line-mode t) -*- #+name ruby-double #+begin_src ruby :var x&#x3D;2 puts x*2 #+end_src #+RESULTS: : 4 #+name: double #+begin_src emacs-lisp :var x&#x3D;2 (* 2 x) #+end_src #+RESULTS: double : 4 #+CALL: double(x&#x3D;4) #+RESULTS: : 8 #+CALL: ruby-double(x&#x3D;4) 
 Starting at the top I can run ruby-double on its own, double on its own, and the call to double with x&#x3D;4 by executing C-c C-c in the right place. 
 However when I try this on the call to ruby-double this line is not being recognized as code (because I get no code execution prompt) and I get no output and no error message in the minibuffer or in the *messages* buffer.
 The sequence gives the following in *messages*
 Evaluate this ruby code block on your system? (y or n) y Executing Ruby code block at position 68... Wrote /var/folders/50/9y75bf_x77q9fpz7rr32ykx40000gn/T/babel-ESjvl7/ob-input-LVBC7N Code block evaluation complete (took 0.1s). Evaluate this emacs-lisp code block (double) on your system?

Code block evaluation complete. 
 I seem to be missing a setting to allow ruby to be used in the #+CALL construct but I have been unable to find it anywhere.
 Does someone have a pointer to the cause of this, or possible, how to debug it.

I came up with a simple naive one and I know it wont be as performant as the optimal solution to this but I didnt expect it to be so bad that it failed over &quot;Memory exceeded&quot;. 
 Leetcode 102:
 Given the root of a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes&#x27; values. (i.e., from left to right, level by level).
 object Solution { def levelOrder(root: TreeNode): List[List[Int]] &#x3D; { def lazyOrder(root: TreeNode): LazyList[LazyList[TreeNode]] &#x3D; { if (root &#x3D;&#x3D; null) return LazyList() lazy val levels: LazyList[LazyList[TreeNode]] &#x3D; LazyList(root) #:: (for { level  LazyList(node.left, node.right)).filter(_ !&#x3D; null) } yield nextlevel) levels } lazyOrder(root).map(_.toList.map(_.value)).toList } } Expected: Example 1: Input: root &#x3D; [3,9,20,null,null,15,7] Output: [[3],[9,20],[15,7]] Example 2:Input: root &#x3D; [1] Output: [[1]] Example 3:Input: root &#x3D; [] Output: []

                              <span>After spending a while coding in Scala.
 Now that I get back to develop in Python. My Python code is very functional.
 The latest versions of Python allow structural pattern matching which is quite good.
 There are also some minimalist FP libraries. Some are more evolved. 
 I think Python isn&#x27;t such a bad candidate for some kind of FP lite.
 Obviously the lack tailrec recursion is problematic for FP.
 But not such a bad language to implement basic FP.
 Obviously it will depend on your definition of FP. 
 Do you implement some kind of FP in Python? Do you use any FP libraries?

                              <span>I think most of you have seen the article Fifteen ways to use Embark, and one of my favorites is 
 &#x60;&#x60; (eval-when-compile (defmacro my/embark-ace-action (fn) (defun ,(intern (concat &quot;my/embark-ace-&quot; (symbol-name fn))) () (interactive) (with-demoted-errors &quot;%s&quot; (require &#x27;ace-window) (let ((aw-dispatch-always t)) (aw-switch-to-window (aw-select nil)) (call-interactively (symbol-function &#x27;,fn)))))))
 (define-key embark-file-map (kbd &quot;o&quot;) (my/embark-ace-action find-file)) (define-key embark-buffer-map (kbd &quot;o&quot;) (my/embark-ace-action switch-to-buffer)) (define-key embark-bookmark-map (kbd &quot;o&quot;) (my/embark-ace-action bookmark-jump)) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 which allows me to:
  
Run consult-buffer and select the buffer I want spawned
 Run embark-act, press o
 Have ace-window show up, where I can select where I want the buffer to be spawned
  
However, I am puzzled by how I can do the same with consult-grep. 
 I&#x27;ve tried:
  (use-package embark-consult :ensure t :hook (embark-collect-mode . consult-preview-at-point-mode) :config (define-key embark-consult-search-map (kbd &quot;w&quot;) (my/embark-ace-action embark-export))) 
 but 
  
This wouldn&#x27;t work anyway, as embark-export spawns its own buffer; the way that my/embark-ace-action is set up is that it spawns ace-window to switch to the buffer we want (e.g. by creating a split), and then running the command (in this case this would be embark-export)
 For some reason I get dired opened instead of the grep results?
  
Any pointers on how I can accomplish this?
 I see there&#x27;s a variable embark-targets or something like that, which stores the results. Is there a way to render the grep results in the same buffer instead of spawning a new one?
 Thanks

 I&#x27;m trying to get code folding to play nice with treesit auto. The closest package I could find was ts-fold: https://github.com/emacs-tree-sitter/ts-fold
 But it seems to expect the external tresitter package instead? When I try to enable it in a python-ts-mode buffer I get: tree-sitter--setup: No language registered for major mode ‘python-ts-mode’
 Any advice?

 ...into this:

 In other words, a kind of (fill-paragraph) that operates only within two columns (in this case columns 40-75), or alternatively, within a rectangular region. But in any case leaving the rest of the text unchanged. I would be happy to do this on a line-by-line basis, and it feels like this wants to be some incantation of (fill-paragraph), but I haven&#x27;t been able to crack it.
 Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.

                              <span>I love monads and LC, so the Haskell logo feels like the perfect combo of both, It’s been 5 years since I started using FP languages, and I even work with them now. I’m seriously thinking about getting the logo as a tattoo, but I’m a little bit ignorant about trademark stuff. Can I just go for it, or do I need to check the rules in different parts of the world first?
 I&#x27;m kinda ignorant when it comes to laws and stuff, lol.

                              <span>I am looking for an Emacs theme that distinguishes different types of texts well. For example, I would like the following types of the texts all in different colors, including the main-text, bullet points/lists, quotes, headers (and different levels of headers), italics, bolded texts, etc. 
 The result might be too colorful, but I guess I would like to go toward that direction. Any suggestions?

                              <span>Hello, Emacs newbie here...
 I&#x27;m trying to add a refile target where title is not a URL. So I added the following line to my configuration:
 (setq org-refile-targets &#x60;((&quot;some-refile.org&quot; :regexp . ,(rx bol (+ &quot;*&quot;) &quot; &quot; (not &quot;[&quot;))))) 
 Everything is good so far, but when I do a org-refile I expect file names to be in the following format: header (file-name.org) and that is the case for other targets where I use :maxlevel but for the target that I use :regexp file name is missing, and it is displayed in following format heading...
 I don&#x27;t know if this is the expected behavior or not, so I thought I might just ask...

 I wanted to learn more about effect systems cats, cats-effects, zio.
 I know there&#x27;s no right answers. But which one would you suggest?
 cats and cats-effect?
 zio?

                              <span>I have been wondering about the proportion of people who use effect systems (cats-effect, zio, etc...) compared to those who use standard Scala (the Martin Odersky way). 
 I was surprised when I saw this post:
 https://www.reddit.com/r/scala/comments/lfbjcf/does_anyone_here_intentionally_use_scala_without/
 A lot of people are not using effect system in their jobs it seems.
 For sure the trend in the Scala community is pure FP, hence effect systems.
 I understand it can be the differentiation point over Kotlin to have true FP, I mean in a more Haskell way.
 Don&#x27;t get me wrong I think standard Scala is 100% true FP. 
 That said, when I look for Scala job offers (for instance from https://scalajobs.com), almost all job posts ask for cats, cats-effect or zio.
 I&#x27;m not sure how common are effect systems in the real world.
 What do you guys think?

                              <span>Hi,
 I have configured re-builder to use &#x27;string mode.
  (require &#x27;re-builder) (setq reb-re-syntax &#x27;string) 
 In re-builder, after I finished with my regex, e.g. \(lambda\) (), I use C-c C-w to copy the regexp. But I noticed a message saying the copied regex is \\(lambda\\) (). The \ is escaped, which makes the regex useless in other places in emacs.
 According to https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/re-builder-interactive-regexp-builder, in &#x27;string mode, the output of the re-builder is supposed to be used for other regex search input.
 I wonder what I missed or messed up in my emacs configuration, or I just missed some key stroke.

                              <span>There has been big lag in my python eglot buffer. The behaviour is kind of like the one where emacs takes seconds to do GC - emacs freezes and you input appears after the freeze(or if you are moving around, cursor jumped to the direction), only that emacs is not doing GC. (I turned on gcmh-verbose, which prints gc message if you have gcmh-mode enabled, to check)
 I run profiler just now and out of 3 runs one of them have 80% CPU time on eldoc. Other 2 0%. I disabled eldoc-mode and suddenly it is as smooth as fundamental-mode.
 It is wierd that it didn&#x27;t appear on other 2 profiler runs. So if you have eglot lag issue you can try this. I have the following doomemacs keymap to help quickly toggle eldoc-mode
  (map! :map doom-leader-map &quot;t e&quot; #&#x27;eldoc-mode )

Keys defined with keymap-local-set upon entering a buffer aren&#x27;t available if you switch modes. Did something replace this functionality or was it removed? I doubt local-key-set will ever get removed, but if there is a non-legacy function that does this I would like to use it.

                              <span>Hi folks, I need sone advice on best practices related to DB calls. I’ve a project, where I run MySQL queries with simple JDBC, writing every statement manually, and using the java PreparedStatement and ResultSet Now, each statement can have 3 possibilities. One, it returns one or more rows, Two, it returns 0 rows Three, it crashes due to a database error
 In FP world, we ideally wrap SQL statements with Try, but how to handle 3 possibilities ? Should I create a monad with 3 possible states, or use Try[Option] to wrap the ResultSet, or just follow plain java and throw the exception in the DAO layer itself ?

                              <span>Disclaimer, I have only been writing Scala for a few months.
 I&#x27;m still learning my way figuring out what breaks syntax. If you look at the snippet below, &#x60;Try&#x60; has to be on its line. &#x60;: db &#x3D;&gt;&#x60; has to end the line. &#x60;toEither&#x60; is inline with &#x60;result&#x60;.
 I saw a recent Odersky quote where he says we should all move to braceless syntax, but I can&#x27;t help but feel it&#x27;s not quite there yet. I have to adjust my whitespace and newlines more often than expected such that it breaks my flow.
 Typically, in Go or Typescript, I can write super messy code, then a fmt command aligns every for me.
 val result &#x3D; Try: dbClient.transaction: db &#x3D;&gt; db.run(query) .toEither

                              <span>Hello All,
As someone with ADHD, the idea of a system that can organize a maelstrom of ideas into something retrievable is irresistible. (I imagine many can relate.) But every attempt, over decades, from pen and paper to Obsidian to Notion, has ended in a mess that becomes unusable. Once the system gets bloated, I start over with the best intentions, trying to keep things simple. I&#x27;ve lost countless hours in this cycle and hope to figure out where I&#x27;m going wrong before I start again.
I have thousands of ideas, thoughts, journal entries, research, etc.
I have various ways to jot things down quickly, but if I don&#x27;t categorize them, I know I’ll never look at them again, especially long journal entries. I used to record notes, which are automatically transcribed, but now I have hundreds or even thousands of transcriptions that are effectively meaningless. I don’t know what I’ll do with them, so they just pile up, collecting, not connecting.
If I try to organize them, that creates friction, and after a valiant effort, things get out of hand. There are too many notes and too many ways to link them, and many are just the same idea phrased differently.
Even with proper linkages, at some point, 200 notes on a topic become clutter, and there’s no way to distill it when I need it.
Sometimes I feel like all this effort to manually do what my brain cannot is futile. If I’m writing something and want to reference a topic, I get overwhelmed by too much information.
Should I stop trying, or is there a method that can help someone like me?
I was excited about AI in Obsidian or Notion, but the results were inaccurate or incomplete (e.g., “show me all my notes on a topic” or “how many notes do I have?” give partial results). Maybe I didn’t set it up correctly, but figuring it out was too overwhelming.
Best,
R</span>

 So I come here to seek guidance from scala experts who are more in touch with the current happenings than I am:)

                              <span>UPDATE:
 [reddit comment](Some searching indicates it may have arrived in Emacs 29 - https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/122hw51/how_to_make_customthemesetfaces_work_i_used_it_to/jfzqi75/.)
 I am still on 28
 Mastering Emacs
  
New hooks &#x27;enable-theme-functions&#x27; and &#x27;disable-theme-functions&#x27;. These are run after enabling and disabling a theme, respectively.
  
 I want to try out some new themes but need to ensure that some of my org-todo-keyword-faces settings and a whole load of other faces are compatible with them?
 Questions like suggest there is a _pent-up_demand for such a feature:
 Does emacs have a hook for when the theme changes?
 Is there a universal &#x27;after-theme-load&#x27; hook?
 This manual page A theme-agnostic hook for theme loading suggests something like that may be in the offing and it seems Modus themes come with such a function.
 It is Prot&#x27;s EF themes I want to try out so they might include such a hook.
 PS. Isn&#x27;t the hook example there the kind being deprecated?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve switched on MacOS x86 from
 https://emacsformacosx.com/ https://github.com/caldwell/build-emacs
 to
 https://github.com/jimeh/emacs-builds/releases/tag/Emacs-29.4 https://github.com/jimeh/emacs-builds
 The performance of the latter has been excellent and it&#x27;s not just Andrea Corallo&#x27;s magic native jit (unsupported in the caldwell builds). The misbehaviors I was experiencing/suffering from of the former do not seem apparent. This is despite ostensibly sharing the same GNU Emacs code base (independent of patches Jim applies which seem unrelated to my issues).
 For anyone suffering from Emacs performance issues or issues that appear to be bugs, I recommend giving Jim Myhrberg&#x27;s aka u/jimehgeek builds a try. Up next: Emacs 30 testing and ARM.
 Many thanks to both David and Jim for supporting the Emacs community with their Mac builds.

                              <span>I often have to insert special characters into a buffer and I find the default emacs bindings unconvenient and hard to remeber. Thus, I created this function in my init.el which offers an easier way to select a accented character to insert:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; emacs-lisp (defun accented () (interactive) (let ((char-option (completing-read &quot;-&gt; &quot; &#x27;(&quot;A&quot; &quot;E&quot; &quot;I&quot; &quot;O&quot; &quot;U&quot; &quot;C&quot; &quot;N&quot; &quot;S&quot;))))
 (let ((my-char-list (cond ((string&#x3D; char-option &quot;A&quot;) &#x27;(&quot;á&quot; &quot;Á&quot; &quot;à&quot; &quot;À&quot; &quot;â&quot; &quot;Â&quot; &quot;ä&quot; &quot;Ä&quot; &quot;ã&quot; &quot;Ã&quot; &quot;å&quot; &quot;Å&quot; &quot;æ&quot; &quot;Æ&quot;)) ((string&#x3D; char-option &quot;E&quot;) &#x27;(&quot;é&quot; &quot;É&quot; &quot;è&quot; &quot;È&quot; &quot;ê&quot; &quot;Ê&quot; &quot;ë&quot; &quot;Ë&quot;)) ((string&#x3D; char-option &quot;I&quot;) &#x27;(&quot;í&quot; &quot;Í&quot; &quot;ì&quot; &quot;Ì&quot; &quot;î&quot; &quot;Î&quot; &quot;ï&quot; &quot;Ï&quot;)) ((string&#x3D; char-option &quot;O&quot;) &#x27;(&quot;ó&quot; &quot;Ó&quot; &quot;ò&quot; &quot;Ò&quot; &quot;ô&quot; &quot;Ô&quot; &quot;ö&quot; &quot;Ö&quot; &quot;õ&quot; &quot;Õ&quot; &quot;ø&quot; &quot;Ø&quot; &quot;œ&quot; &quot;Œ&quot;)) ((string&#x3D; char-option &quot;U&quot;) &#x27;(&quot;ü&quot; &quot;Ü&quot; &quot;ù&quot; &quot;Ù&quot; &quot;ú&quot; &quot;Ú&quot; &quot;û&quot; &quot;Û&quot;)) ((string&#x3D; char-option &quot;C&quot;) &#x27;(&quot;ç&quot; &quot;Ç&quot;)) ((string&#x3D; char-option &quot;N&quot;) &#x27;(&quot;ñ&quot; &quot;Ñ&quot;)) ((string&#x3D; char-option &quot;S&quot;) &#x27;(&quot;ß&quot;))))) (insert (completing-read &quot;-&gt; &quot; my-char-list))))) 
 (global-set-key (kbd &quot;C-&quot;) #&#x27;accented) &#x60;&#x60;
 This function works and does what i need to do but it feels quite clunky to me; so, as the title says, I&#x27;m asking to the elisp veterans out there: is there a smarter way to do this in elisp?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been using Neovim, and someone recommended emacs to me. I&#x27;m interested in trying it out, but they mentioned it might not play super nice with windows. How well does it work? Is it stable, do the functions work properly, do packages have compatibility issues, etc.?

                              <span>I&#x27;m contemplating a migration from Visual Studio Code to Emacs, and I wanted to replicate one of my favorite VSCode features: instant preview for lightweight markup languages. As part of this transition, I&#x27;m exploring Org mode as a powerful alternative to Markdown and AsciiDoc.
 To make this transition smoother, I&#x27;ve created a template that provides a portable Emacs Org Mode setup with instant HTML preview and auto-refresh functionality. Here are the key features:
  
Automatic HTML export on save
 Instant preview using Emacs&#x27; built-in eww browser
 Auto-refresh preview on each save
 Automatic package installation (org, htmlize, magit)
 Maximized Emacs window on startup
  
The entire setup is contained in a .dir-locals.el file, making it easy to use in any Org Mode project. Just clone the repo, copy the .dir-locals.el file to your project directory, and you&#x27;re good to go!
 I&#x27;m new to the Emacs ecosystem, so I&#x27;d love to hear your thoughts, suggestions, or any tips for improvement. Has anyone else created similar setups for transitioning from other editors? What other Emacs features should I explore to enhance my Org Mode experience?

When i need to run some basic C code into my org file( with an src block),windows simply tells me that i can&#x27;t do it,i tried msys as well because i thought i missed some packages about the gcc compiler. Someone had a similar experience?what should i do?(tried wsl2 with emacs but it&#x27;s slow,it&#x27;s still faster to start up my config but using it was a Nightmare)

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to create a portable Emacs Org Mode setup that I can store on GitHub and clone to any machine with a fresh Emacs installation. My goal is to replicate a workflow similar to what I used in Visual Studio Code with Markdown files. Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;m aiming for:
  
Open an .org file on the left and have an &quot;instant view&quot; of the corresponding .html file on the right, automatically updated when I save.
 Use Emacs&#x27; built-in HTML viewer eww in GUI mode for the preview.
 Automatically install any required packages (e.g., impatient-mode) if they&#x27;re not already installed.
 Set up the layout so that only the source .org file (on the left) and the .html preview (on the right) are visible—nothing else.
 Automatically maximize the Emacs window on startup.
 Accomplish all of this using .dir-locals…</span>

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I have read multiple times that a good way to learn is by reading code.
 Do you have any favorite code to recommend - for any reason? 
 (e.g. good example of some concept, bad examples, or just beautiful code that caught your attention, or possibly helped you learn a concept or a technique)

 for example here is a what I would like to have:
 GET /test HTTP/1.1 custom-header: {{&quot;this is a python generated code&quot;.upper()}} 
 I want to highlight every aspect of the request using my custom font-lock-keywords, which I can do easily, but I want the text inside the {{ }} to be highlighted with python font-lock, which I cannot figure out how to do.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve only just gotten started with Emacs this week though I do have experience using Vim. I&#x27;m using Doom Emacs.
 I&#x27;ve been trying to set my fonts to what I would like but it doesn&#x27;t seem to work. I&#x27;ve done my best to follow the examples provided by the Doom Emacs setup guide as well as examples from users but I seem to still be getting the syntax wrong.
 Here&#x27;s what I have in my config.el:
 (setq doom-font (font-spec :family &quot;FiraCode Nerd Font Mono&quot; :size 16 :weight &#x27;semibold) doom-variable-pitch-font (font-spec :family &quot;FiraCode Nerd Font&quot; :size 16 :weight &#x27;regular) doom-big-font (font-spec :family &quot;FiraCode Nerd Font Mono&quot; :size 20 :weight &#x27;semibold) ) 
 I don&#x27;t get any errors thrown when I reload but the font doesn&#x27;t seem to change. I&#x27;m not sure what I&#x27;m doing wrong since set-frame-font works so Emacs is detecting system fonts.
 I&#x27;ve tried only doing it without variable pitch font and big font and that didn&#x27;t work. Trying it with the whole thing like &quot;FiraCode Nerd Font Mono-semibold-normal-normal&quot; or changing the weight to :weight semibold-normal-normal hasn&#x27;t worked either.
 I&#x27;m at a loss at this point. Any help would be appreciated.

 I keep having to evaluate my init.el manually every time I start Emacs so my keybindings work. I have no idea what the issue is.
 Relevant part of my config, I hope:

 Also, I didn&#x27;t found something similar for that, so you if you do, share it!
 And one more thing, I am really noob in elisp&#x27;ing)

                              <span>Hello,
 I&#x27;ve been working with setting up Eglot for development use, and I&#x27;ve gotten it to connect with pylsp. However, there seems to be a problem when trying to get the full documentation of a function. Suppose we have a functions like so:
 foo(bar): &quot;&quot;&quot;Function that does stuff&quot;&quot;&quot; return x 
 When hovering over a use of this function with the point, the minibuffer would say foo(bar) and leave out the documentation in the docstring. I&#x27;ve had one case where the documentation is displayed, but only the first line of a multi-line dosctring. Is this a problem with Eglot, Pylsp, or something else?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been trying out Nix / Home Manager on Ubuntu and used it to install Emacs. It worked pretty easily, which was great, but I noticed that some weird stuff is happening with my config. E.g. I set the frame position inside of a (when window-system) but that now has no effect on startup. If I eval-buffer it then loads. All the other settings from the config file load, though, and Messages doesn&#x27;t show any errors.
 I also am seeing some weird stuff like if I change the theme in my config and close and open Emacs again, it hasn&#x27;t taken affect. But then after I message around with home-manager switch a but the theme loads, but still no frame position change.
 Anyone know what the issue could be?
 The other weird thing is why I open emacs from the terminal, everything works as expected. This is only when opening using the GNOME desktop icon.
 I also just noticed that GNOME has two icons - Emacs (Client) and Emacs. When I open Emacs it works, but Emacs (Client) still has this issue. But it also looks like Emacs just triggers Emacs (Client) to open...

                              <span>Edit2: solvedsolvedsolvedsolvedsolved
 In every monad tutorial they&#x27;re called clean and elegant, but I am currently dealing with an IO (maybe Hashmap) and every time I want to perform a lookup I have to do it using
 fmap (fmap (lookup &quot;key&quot;)) hashmap
 Im writing a little program that imports a hashmap from JSON and that hashmap then has to constantly be called in my code to check configurations, and I think having to nest fmaps like that is quickly going to make my program completely unreadable, could you imagine having to calculate something using
 5 * (fmap (fmap (lookup &quot;key&quot;)) hashmap) ? My first instinct would be to write a function to perform a double fmap with a given function and value, but that just sounds wrong
 how are you supposed to structure your code to prevent something like this? Is this normal?
 Edit: the solution was a refactor and binding the hashmaps in my main function! Thanks a lot!

 Coming from Neovim, reading documentation went from being a reference to reading a full book to read to understand the package (might be just orgmode).
 How would you recommend getting into the feature-rich packages?

Backend optimizations to further enhance code robustness, modularity, and improve plugin stability.
 
Fixed an issue in version 0.3.2 where rapid updates to the overview file caused synchronization errors with quick notes and marked text.
 
Fixed an issue in version 0.3.2 where the file naming strategy led to frequent re-creation of overview files in Denote mode.
 
Fixed an issue in version 0.3.2 where the overview file failed to synchronize correctly due to improper index file retrieval.
 
 After this period of development, the code for org-zettel-ref-mode has finally become modular and robust. No new features will be introduced before version 0.4. Instead, the focus will be on further componentization of the code and providing more customization options.

Is emacs so usefull to write code in another languages as is to lisp dialects? Thanks for any perception

                              <span>Now that use-package is bundled with Emacs 29.1, I&#x27;d like to know how many of you have converted all your config to use use-package? And how many of you still remain with with-eval-after-load?
 To make the survey interesting and insightful for the community, I&#x27;ve got a few questions for you to answer.
  
Which year did you first use Emacs?
 How many lines of Emacs configuration (init.el, other .el called by init.el, etc.) do you have today?
 Approximately, how many external packages do you install from ELPA/MELPA?
 Do you use with-eval-after-load or use-package or something else like straight.el?
 If you switched from with-eval-after-load to use-package or something else, in which year did you make that switch?
 If you switched from with-eval-after-load to use-package or something else, why did you make the switch?
 If you still use with-eval-after-load, why do you still use it?
 What are the pros and cons of with-eval-after-load in your experience?
 What are the pros and cons of use-package (or another solution) in your experience?

                              <span>I wrote a coupe of short advices to change the behavior of ace-window in the following way: calling ace-window repeatedly cycles through the first aw-dispatch-when-more-than most recently used windows, and then ace-window key jumping behaviour is enabled, when there are more than aw-dispatch-when-more-than window available.
 The code is largely untested with other ace-window features which I rarely use, but I am sharing it below in case somebody wants the same behaviour for window switching.

                              <span>So in Obsidian, I had this &quot;productivity view&quot; where I can view a set of files in a layout. For example, on the left were my to-dos and on the right were upcoming events. I had 6 different files arranged in a layout. Another thing, when I open this workspace, it abandoned other files currently open. Whatever I saved as the workspace is what will appear, so I&#x27;m not looking for something similar to desktop workspaces. Is there a package for that does this for buffers?

                              <span>Hi everyone,
I’m excited to share a project that could be useful for those of you using Raspberry Pi devices in your Zettelkasten workflow. I’ve developed an Ansible playbook that automates the setup of Raspberry Pis, including tools that could enhance your note-taking and text-processing environments.
What’s Included:
Network Configuration: Easily set up Wi-Fi networks, access points, and even USB gadget mode for Raspberry Pi.
Text Processing Tools: Install tools like Pandoc and TexLive, essential for converting notes. There&#x27;s also a role for my Zettel Composer tool.
Emacs Environment: If you work with Emacs, the playbook can build it from source and set up Spacemacs with integrated tmux.
Ancient Greek Texts: For anyone working with classical languages, there’s a setup for Diogenes with Thesaurus Linguae Graecae (TLG) data.
Seafile Client and Sync Notifications: You can configure Seafile for seamless syncing of notes across devices and set up sync notifications to stay updated on changes.
If you’ve got a Raspberry Pi or a whole fleet of them, this playbook should help you get everything up and running quickly. It’s especially handy if you like to experiment with different setups or need consistency across multiple devices.
You can find the playbook here.
Enjoy!</span>

 Any ideas as to how I could go about implementing this?

 When I used the C-h k command to check it out, the previous help page didn&#x27;t include the first two key codes with the g. The second paragraph read:
  It is bound to C-M-@, C-M-SPC. 
 rather than the current
  It is bound to g C-M-@, g C-M-SPC, C-M-@, C-M-SPC. 
 The current output.
 Something I did must have triggered it
  
C-M-@ runs the command mark-sexp (found in global-map), which is an interactive byte-compiled Lisp function in ‘lisp.el’.
 It is bound to g C-M-@, g C-M-SPC, C-M-@, C-M-SPC.
 (mark-sexp &amp;optional ARG ALLOW-EXTEND)
  
What is the significance of the leading g?
 I also notice it in Doom, but generally not in regular Emacs.

                              <span>I am configuring vanilla Emacs for the first time (v29.4) and it seems as if parts of my init.el file is not being evaluated during startup. The entire init.el is provided below.
 The issue that I am having is that gcmh-modeis not being installed, despite use-package-always-ensure t. Additionally, load-path is not being modified to include my modules sub-directory. Both are confirmed at the bottom of the file.
 It is not obvious to me why that would be the case. Everything works fine when I manually open and evaluate the init.el buffer. Similarly, emacs --debug-init does not reveal any issues.
 Am I missing something obvious here?

                              <span>I am currently in the process of migrating from Notion to Org-Mode. So far, I have done a lot of manual copy and paste and the occasional conversion from CSV to org-tables, which works quite nicely. But now I want to migrate some databases to a list of headings, and have not found a suitable solution to this yet. I was thinking that perhaps a template-based solution might be convenient - I can for example create a template entry in Yasnippet like this:
 * $0 :PROPERTIES: :SOME_PROPERTY: $1 :END: $2 
 With the idea of applying this to the following CSV snippet:
 title,some_property,some_content My Heading,Important,Lorem Ipsum... 
 Now unfortunately yasnippet does not seem to be really suitable for this, since the fields need to be input manually (I don&#x27;t think you can easily pass in the $? parameters as a list?). I am wondering if other template libraries might be more suitable for this task, or if anyone has any other bright ideas.

                              <span>Is there a way to generate c++ function definition from a class function declaration? I wonder someone has already done that with the help of built-in treesit.
 I have look into an old post stating the same ability with semantic mode, which is not very helpful with modern lsp and treesit setup.
 https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/nglu7z/autogenerating_a_c_implementation_file_from_its/
 If there is not one out there, I may have to make one myself. I already have a half working version.
 Edit: Since no one is replying me, I made my own implementation in elisp.

                              <span>I use tab-bar in Emacs 30.0.91 (installed with brew on macos, emacs-plus@30). I&#x27;m trying to customize the face of the active tab, to make it stand out more:
 (use-package tab-bar :if (display-graphic-p) :config (set-face-attribute &#x27;tab-bar-tab nil :foreground (doom-color &#x27;yellow)) (tab-bar-mode)) This does not work, however, at least not when starting up Emacs. On startup, the face is not customized for the active tab. But if I eval the code above, the customization takes effect. I have tried placing the face customization code in an :init statement instead of :config, but that did not work. Any ideas how this could be done?

 I only know about evil-mode but today I discover another built-in package called Viper mode, it does have some basic vi movement.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve had the following C style definition as the default for many years:
 (defconst my-c-style &#x27;(&quot;linux&quot; (c-basic-offset . 4) (c-offsets-alist . ((inextern-lang . 0))) (indent-tabs-mode . nil)) &quot;My C style&quot;) (c-add-style &quot;my-c-style&quot; my-c-style) (setq c-default-style &quot;my-c-style&quot;) 
 After switching to Emacs 29.3, opening a new C file results in the style being applied, except for indent-tabs-mode, which is set to true. I used the Lisp debugger and put a watchpoint on the variable. It is set to nil first when the style is applied, and then immediately to true from the same Lisp function. If I remove the Linux base style then I get nil, as expected. Also, applying the style manually with c-set-style works (i.e., indent-tabs-mode is set to nil).
 Has anyone seen this?

                              <span>Typed lambda calculus extends the untyped lambda calculus by introducing a type system. It’s important to note that, unlike untyped lambda calculus, there are multiple typed lambda calculi, each differentiated by the specific features of the type system used. The exact features of the type system can be chosen with considerable flexibility. In this article, we explore some of the common choices.

                              <span>Hello, as the title suggests, I am a beginner and I am asking for clarification in order to understand more clearly how currying is being used in the following example;
 data Address &#x3D; Address { city :: String, street :: String } deriving Show -- without currying mkIncompleteAddress :: String -&gt; Address mkIncompleteAddress street &#x3D; Address &quot;NYC&quot; street -- with currying mkIncompleteAddress&#x27; :: String -&gt; Address mkIncompleteAddress&#x27; &#x3D; Address &quot;NYC&quot; 
 I would like to understand better what&#x27;s happening &#x27;under the hood&#x27; in the example *without currying*.
 As an aside to support the above point, I continued the depth of the example *without currying* from above by taking *both* the city and the street as input into the function, and using currying for both inputs, as so;
 mkIncompleteAddress2 :: String -&gt; String -&gt; Address mkIncompleteAddress2 &#x3D; Address Prelude&gt; mkIncompleteAddress2 &quot;NYC&quot; &quot;ABC Street&quot; Address {city &#x3D; &quot;NYC&quot;, street &#x3D; &quot;ABC Street&quot;} 
 The idea about what&#x27;s happening in the background still eludes me. I would appreciate clarification as to understand the functionality better.
 Thanks in advance

                              <span>Hello, as the title suggests, I am a beginner and I am asking for clarification about a specific detail concerning lambda expressions in Haskell.
 While GHCI allows me to do the following,
 Prelude&gt; (\x y -&gt; x + (\z -&gt; z) y) 100 1 111 
 I am unable to do the following;
 Prelude&gt; (\x -&gt; x + (\y -&gt; y)) 100 1 * Non type-variable argument in the constraint: Num (p -&gt; p) (Use FlexibleContexts to permit this) * When checking the inferred type it :: forall p. (Num p, Num (p -&gt; p)) &#x3D;&gt; p 
 As seen above, attempting to run this results in an error (which I can&#x27;t make sense of). I am trying to assign 100 to &#x27;x&#x27;, and 1 to &#x27;y&#x27;. What is preventing 1 from being assigned to &#x27;y&#x27;?
 I was under the impression that currying would allow for first filling in &#x27;x&#x27;, then afterwards, filling in &#x27;y&#x27;. Clearly, my assumption was wrong.
 Thanks in advance

 When moving the cursor over a flycheck error it should display a message and show the global-map keymap.
 When moving the cursor to a character with a flycheck overlay emacs freezes (the cursor doesn&#x27;t move):
 Frozen emacs (the cursore is just before the &#x60;f ;&#x60;
 The message appears briefly and is then replaced with the first line of (which-key-show-keymap &#x27;global-map) and if I press any key emacs unfreezes and displays the following error:
 Debugger entered--Lisp error: (wrong-type-argument stringp nil) redisplay--pre-redisplay-functions(t) redisplay_internal\ \(C\ function\)() read-key-sequence-vector(nil nil t nil nil t) read-key() which-key--show-keymap(&quot;global-map&quot; (keymap #^[nil nil keymap ...)) which-key-show-keymap(global-map) funcall-interactively(which-key-show-keymap global-map) test-overlay-cursor(# 46 entered) cursor-sensor--detect() 
 I tested with emacs -Q and I have the same behaviour. If I remove the (which-key ...) part, no bug/freeze appears. It looks like I&#x27;m not supposed to call a function that creates a new buffer.

 #+TODO: QUERY THOUGHT INSIGHT INTERESTING-QUOTE | QUERY-CLEARED THOUGHT-RESOLVED INSIGHT-INTERNALISED
 The keywords can be changed according to needs and they can filtered for view in org-agenda view (t view). You can shorten the keywords also according to your sensibilities. I use Q for queries and questions. Period (.) for thoughts and insights that are my own and double quotes(&quot;&quot;) for quotes of interest. This way, you may make systematic notes to your readings. You get a filtered view and the org file itself in which you take the notes acts as a linear document that takes notes as the readings goes forward. Multiple frames of view are retained. Feel free to ask for any clarifications or critique my post (I am new to reddit, I would like to learn the norms).

                              <span>Using Orgzly-revived, I have some agenda items which describe events that start at a certain time, like meetings or phone calls. I&#x27;d like the notification for the event to occur some time before the event is scheduled, e.g. 30 minutes or an hour beforehand, in the same way that Google Calendar allows me to set the notification time.
 Is this possible? I can&#x27;t find such a setting on the app. Or is there a property I have to set in the Org heading for the event to get this to work (like the SCHEDULED: or DEADLINE: properties)?

Disclaimer: I used Google Translator a lot. Expressions can be strange. I would appreciate your feedback 
This is to help Zettelkasten newbies easily understand how to do Zettelkasten.
How to do Zettelkasten is simple:
Let&#x27;s look at them one by one.
1. Take notes.
Just take a note. Easy, right? When taking notes, write only one piece of knowledge per note. Let&#x27;s take an example.
# 202409260746 Zettelkasten is a toolkit for thinking

Zettelkasten means slip-box in German
and is a note-taking method used by Niklas Luhmann.

He published 50 books and over 600 articles with Zettelkasten.
What makes Zettelkasten so powerful is its ability to link notes
together.

The benefits of using the Zettelkasten method are as follows…</span>

Curious to hear your thoughts about &quot;flashcards&quot;. I recently used them to get over a big hump.
I was trying to learn something specific in programming. It is a huge library, and although I am a fluent programmer (having programmed everyday for the last two decades), I was resisiting this.
What helped me over the hump was a combination of my Zk with Anki, a free flashcard system, which does spaced repetition. I think I now know the library I wanted to master really well: the size is what had been a hinderance and no longer seems to be. I made around 200 cards, and I know them inside out now.
Long term, of course, it is the zettelkasten that will help me with the big picture. But @Sascha or others: have you experimented with Anki and if so how has it worked out?</span>

 I need to prep a Presentation about Bucket Sort and my teacher expects to see an example in Haskell. I&#x27;ve already spent hours searching and just found one really long example on github. Maybe I&#x27;m looking at the wrong places?
 Can anyone tell me where I can find an example code for bucket sort in haskell?

                              <span>Hi...I haven&#x27;t programmed since I was 13, that is to say, I know nothing about programming. I want to learn Haskell as my first language, but it seems that a lot of the resources for it are aimed at people who already program imperatively. Does anyone have advice or resources for someone who knows nothing? Preferably resources that will show how different aspects of Haskell are used within programming...I enjoy thinking abstractly but programming seems so different to the type of thinking I&#x27;m used to. Also, could anyone help me install Haskell? I can&#x27;t seem to figure out how to get it to function. I&#x27;ve just been trying stuff in the Haskell playground.

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m using ligatures.el and I would like to enable all ligatures for every programming language except VHDL, for which &#x60;&lt;&#x3D;&#x60; should look like an arrow instead of &#x60;≤&#x60;.
 I tried the following:
 (ligature-set-ligatures &#x27;prog-mode &#x27;( ... &quot;&lt;&#x3D;&quot; ... ) ) (ligature-set-ligatures &#x27;vhdl-mode &#x27;( ... ... ) ) 
 But the more specific mode doesn&#x27;t override prog-mode, so all ligatures are enabled in any case. I also tried to defining a custom mode like this:
 (define-derived-mode prog-except-vhdl-mode) (add-hook &#x27;prog-mode-hook (lambda () (when (and (not (derived-mode-p &#x27;vhdl-mode)) (not (derived-mode-p &#x27;prog-except-vhdl-mode)) ;; otherwise I get an infinite loop ) (prog-except-vhdl-mode) ) ) ) (ligature-set-ligatures &#x27;prog-except-vhdl-mode &#x27;(... ...)) (ligature-set-ligatures &#x27;vhdl-mode &#x27;(... &quot;&lt;&#x3D;&quot; ...)) 
 This &quot;works&quot; (I get the ligature in prog mode but not in VHDL) but prog-except-vhdl-mode overrides the file type&#x27;s associated major mode so I lose syntax highlighting for everything except VHDL.
 Is there a way to create a non-exclusive major mode like prog-mode? (ligature-set-ligatures doesn&#x27;t take a minor mode)

                              <span>I have this project that I&#x27;m writing using Netbeans: https://github.com/danilomo/KleinLisp/
 I&#x27;m trying to work on this using Emacs, but I couldn&#x27;t make the LSP work with it. I used the configuration from this tutorial that is linked in the github page of java-lsp package:
 https://xpressrazor.wordpress.com/2020/11/04/java-programming-in-emacs/
  
Open emacs, wait for first time execution of init.el
 Open project folder, open some file, wait for lsp server be installed
 Emacs suggests adding project folder to workspace, I accept its suggestion and give the project root
 LSP is activated but gives me the following message: &quot;xxx.java is a non-project file, only syntax errors are reported&quot;
  
I spent a lot of time trying to figure out what to do:
  
Tried to open the project in VSCode (found this message in stackoverflow from VSCode users), LSP works with my project
 Created a new gradle project, copied source code to it, LSP works with this gradle project
  
What am I doing wrong? I&#x27;m so confused.
 Edit - found the problem:
 I&#x27;m really unlucky. I put a &quot;.project&quot; folder with some notes in todo org files to be like a &quot;personal mini jira&quot;... Eclipse server needs this path for its &quot;.project&quot; XML file. It&#x27;s so embarrassing lol

                              <span>I use Eglot and clangd. After changing branches in git (using magit) or doing other git operations that update files on disk, I get the following error message when I visit an updated file that has been opened in a buffer, and try to run some Eglot operation on it (like listing references for a member);
 jsonrpc-request: jsonrpc-error: &quot;request id&#x3D;2096 failed:&quot;, (jsonrpc-error-code . -32602), (jsonrpc-error-message . &quot;trying to get AST for non-added document&quot;), (jsonrpc-error-data) 
 The only way to recover from this is restarting Emacs and opening the project up again (using Projectile). Why is this happening, and can I do anything about it?

                              <span>Hello,
 I recently came across emacs, and wanted to give it a go. I installed the most recent version from the main GNU ftp server. However, I somehow managed to install directly onto my desktop folder rather than in program files like every other typical install I would do. Long story short, all my files have disappeared from that folder. Uninstalled emacs assuming I had downloaded a virus but after doing several system checks I can&#x27;t identify anything. I have looked through practically all my files on my pc and local disk storage hasn&#x27;t changed much which seems to tell me they&#x27;re still somewhere? Files are pretty important (don&#x27;t have a full back up) so any help would be appreciated.
 Details:
 I downloaded this file here: https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/windows/emacs-29/emacs-29.4-installer.exe
 PC is running windows 10 64 bit.
 Files are a large number of .docx files along with photos (jpg and png mostly) and a bunch of miscellaneous txt files etc.
 Folder/Path I&#x27;m talking about is: This PC &gt; Desktop.

                              <span>Aim : to filter assigned tasks by assignee to poll for updates.
 I was thinking to do the following: * List of tasks 1. Item 1. Person A. 2. Item 2. Person B. 3. Item 3. Person A. And so on, where person name is a tag. But, tags go to the * ie List of tasks. So that would not work. The other way is write as above and search with C-c s name. Wondering if this is the only way or is there some other mechanism or a smarter way to do it.
 Pointing to the appropriate documentation would be enough. Thanks for your time.
