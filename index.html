 I leave an awkward image here to illustrate it:

                              <span>I have been going in circles for I d not know how long. I am trying out a few ideas to buils new capture templates and this template just won&#x27;t work:
 (&quot;k&quot; &quot;Task&quot; entry (id &quot;58bb31db-d4cf-468b-9bf4-ae820157fbad&quot;) &quot;* TODO %?&quot;) (&quot;k&quot; &quot;Task&quot; entry (id &#x27;58bb31db-d4cf-468b-9bf4-ae820157fbad) &quot;* TODO %?&quot;) (&quot;k&quot; &quot;Task&quot; entry (id 58bb31db-d4cf-468b-9bf4-ae820157fbad) &quot;* TODO %?&quot;) 
 &#x60;debug-on-error&#x60; does not start thh debugger, and I always get a &#x27;wrong type argument stringp&#x27; message. This message is the reason why I experimented passing the ID in different ways. The three variations above have the same behavior:
  
The capture buffer does not pop up
 
The correct entry matching provided ID is found,
 
&quot;* TODO %?&quot; is litterally inserted under it.
 
 I would expect this template to behave like all other templates where I use &quot;%?&quot;, which is popping up the capture buffer with the cursor where &quot;%?&quot; is, let me edit the entry, then insert it after I hit &#x60;C-c C-c&#x60;.
 What am I missing here ?
 Thanks for your time.

                              <span>As the title says--
 Suppose I create a .org document and tag some sections as :noexport:. If I understand correctly, those sections will not show up in the exported file, .pdf or .html.
 Suppose I also want to export a file that includes those sections. Rather than deleting each tag one by one, is there a way to globally either delete all :noexport: tags or simply ask the program to ignore those tags? (the latter would be the best for me because I still want to keep those tags for later use)

                              <span>I am currently diving into Org-mode and using it to run more and more aspects of my life. In doing so, I am trying to use Org mode to run my weekly habits checklist.
 It currently looks something like this:
 ****** Self-Care
 Sleep (6+hrs) [x] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [0/0]
 Yoga [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]
 Exercise [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]
 Evening routine [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]
 Journaling [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]
 The squares and columns correpond to week days. At present I have to manually input the &quot;x&quot; into the square to make it look like a checked check-box. That is inconvenient. What&#x27;s more, I am also liking the statistics cookies functionality, but I also end up updating it manually.
 Is there a way to get something similar to this visual layout working, where the squares are actual working checkboxes and statistics cookies would update automatically, as they should?

Can you suggest, is there any rest client extensions for emacs, and what is your favourite tool to make http request, preferred in text style way.

author
 date
 time
 commit
  
So I extracted them and let the user choose how to display them.
 Provides global variables to let users choose how to display them:
  
emsg-blame–commit-author
 emsg-blame–commit-date
 emsg-blame–commit-summary
  
Users can use any display frame, such as message, posframe, overlay, popup.

                              <span>I know that the topic of multi-threaded emacs has come up a lot in the past, with the main objection being that emacs has a ton of global state that would be impossible to make safe.
 However, I have not seen a compelling argument as to why we can&#x27;t have multi-threaded garbage collection. I saw Julia has recently implemented this (relevant pr), and I struggle to see why something like this would be impossible for emacs.
 It seems that general emacs multi-threading is becoming less of an issue now, as emacs can offload a lot of workloads to asynchronous processes (LSPs, vterms, latemk, git, etc. all running asynchronously). This means that emacs is actually becoming more and more effectively multi-threaded. The downside of all this asynchronicity is that a lot of these programs communicate large amounts of data back to emacs (especially LSPs) creating a lot of garbage.
 Personally, I use gcmh-mode setting gcmh-high-cons-threshold to 10GB in order to avoid triggering the garbage collector often. Occasionally, I will get a 5-10 second freeze when GC is running on the full 10GB. I have CPU support for 20 threads, so I would imagine that multi-threaded GC would reduce the freezes to maybe 1 sec, which is a lot more reasonable.

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to get the tree-sitter-c-sharp (https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-c-sharp) grammar installed and working, but I&#x27;m having a lot of trouble.
 Firstly, I don&#x27;t understand why the repo&#x27;s releases don&#x27;t have an actual binary, but whatever, I&#x27;m sure they have some reason. 
 However, when I add c-sharp to treesit-language-source-alist and call treesit-install-language-grammar, I get messages that the repo is being cloned and built, but after it&#x27;s done and has put the binary in ~/.emacs.d/tree-sitter, I get an error about not being able to find the library when I try to enabled csharp-ts-mode. Specifically:
  Warning (treesit): Cannot activate tree-sitter, because language grammar for c-sharp is unavailable (not-found): (libtree-sitter-c-sharp.so libtree-sitter-c-sharp.so.0 libtree-sitter-c-sharp.so.0.0 libtree-sitter-c-sharp.dylib libtree-sitter-c-sharp.dylib.0 libtree-sitter-c-sharp.dylib.0.0) No such file or directory 
 This is really confusing. I can see the file right there.

 allergies :: Int -&gt; [Allergen]
 isAllergicTo :: Allergen -&gt; Int -&gt; Bool &#x60;&#x60; Given the above type definitions, my initial implementation ofisAllergicTo&#x60; was as follows:
  isAllergicTo allergen score &#x3D; allergen &#x60;elem&#x60; allergies score 
 However, pointfree.io tells me that this can be simplified to:  isAllergicTo &#x3D; (. allergies) . elem 
 I&#x27;ve inspected the types of . elem and (. allergies) in the REPL, but having a hard time seeing how the two fit. I&#x27;m on my phone, so, unable to post those types now, but will edit if required.
 Can someone explain it to me please?

                              <span>Several years ago I settled on using stack when having fun coding in Haskell on my Mac. I am now starting to use Replit.com online IDE for Haskell (and a few other languages).
 I have found it to be faster building and running code just using cabal to build and run (all my personal Haskell projects have stack.yml and *.cabal files). Does anyone have any idea why using stack is slowing things down for me? This doesn&#x27;t make sense to me.
 Given that I already have valid stack.yml and *.cabal files, it only took me a few minutes to get back to using cabal directly.
 It has been a long time since I reviewed using stack vs. not using stack.

 However at runtime, it is able to neither decode to ABC Identity or ABC Maybe type nor able to show the constructed type
 What is it that I am doing wrong here ?

                              <span>Hi, I am learning about Haskell exceptions. I read that when catching exceptions, there is no distinction between normal exceptions and asynchronous exceptions. I have written the following code, but it does not seem to work.
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;hs import Test.Hspec import Control.Exception import Control.Concurrent import Control.Monad
 data MySyncException &#x3D; MySyncException String
 deriving instance Eq MySyncException deriving instance Show MySyncException instance Exception MySyncException
 data MyAsyncException &#x3D; MyAsyncException String
 deriving instance Eq MyAsyncException deriving instance Show MyAsyncException instance Exception MyAsyncException
 forkThread :: IO () -&gt; IO ((ThreadId, MVar ())) forkThread action &#x3D; do var  putMVar var ()) pure (t, var)
 spec :: Spec spec &#x3D; do describe &quot;try&quot; $ do it &quot;catch a sync exception&quot; $ do e &lt;- try @MySyncException $ do void $ throwIO (MySyncException &quot;foo&quot;) pure &quot;bar&quot; e shouldBe (Left (MySyncException &quot;foo&quot;))
  it &quot;catch an async exception&quot; $ do (t, var) &lt;- forkThread $ do e &lt;- try @MyAsyncException $ do threadDelay 5_000_000 pure &quot;bar&quot; e &#x60;shouldBe&#x60; (Left (MyAsyncException &quot;bar&quot;)) -- let (Left ex) &#x3D; e -- void $ throwIO ex -- rethrow throwTo t (MyAsyncException &quot;foo&quot;) -- wait for the thread void $ takeMVar var 
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 The throwTo terminates my child thread and the false assertion e shouldBe (Left (MyAsyncException &quot;bar&quot;)) does not run.
 Thanks

                              <span>I&#x27;m happy to announce heftia-effects, a new extensible effects library for Haskell: https://github.com/sayo-hs/heftia.
 This library aims to provide users with predictable behavior when working with higher-order effects. It offers consistent continuation-based semantics similar to those found in the eff library. For reference, see &quot;The effect system semantics zoo.&quot;
 One of its notable features is the ability to combine higher-order effects with delimited continuations, which works on a standard GHC.
 Key Features:
  
Continuations &amp; Higher-Order Effects: Effects that require multi-shot delimited continuations, such as NonDet and coroutines, work seamlessly with higher-order effects.
 Purity: Built on a Freer-based system that does not rely on the IO monad, this library avoids the use of unsafePerformIO and similar functions. As a result, it can handle not only monadic but also applicative effectful programs.
  
For an in-depth explanation of how this library works, check out: Higher-Order Effects Done Right: How the Heftia Extensible Effects Library Works - Sayo-hs Blog.

                              <span>In this post, I looked for pointers on how to implement a function that can replace any case expression using GHC.Generics. This function will work the same as maybe and either but for any type.
 I managed to replicate either and maybe&#x27;s behavior, which is promising for the project, but I got stuck on the product type instance. Does anyone know how to properly write it? I&#x27;m pretty sure this should be the implementation:
 gCase (x :*: y) &#x3D; \f -&gt; f (gCase x) (gCase y)
 It makes sense that some function should be provided to combine the two types of the product type, but I couldn&#x27;t make it type check. I don&#x27;t know what the types in the instance declaration should be.
 Another problem is that I absolutely wrecked type inference so I have to declare the type of every expression I use. I imagine…</span>

Considering that you cna run elisp on mobile, there shouldnt be an issue for there to be mobile type packages right? For example, if we look at obsidian, they make plugins that add gui buttons which make commands easier to press since you dont have to open the command pallete, will this be something coming to emacs mobile?

 I&#x27;m an Emacs beginner, and I often hear about packages like Ivy, Vertico, and Helm that are &quot;completion frameworks&quot;. As I understand it, they help you seqrch for things like commands and buffer names in the minibuffer faster. But is that all they do? And if I&#x27;m a beginner with no bias, what is a framework that would work for me? Willing to learn if the documentation is easy to understand.

                              <span>Hello everyone, a while ago when I was an emacs noob I had a lot of trouble figuring out how to implement this. I made several reddit posts about it and the good people here eventually helped me come up with a solution. I am posting this so I can give back and help someone who may be in a similar position as me.
 I will summarize what I wanted to achieve, why simpler alternatives did not work, and how I solved it.

My setup:
 I have a leader keybinding setup. I press “SPC” and which key shows the next prefix keys. I can do “SPC b” to get to buffer-specific keybindings and “SPC c” for code-specific keybindings.
 This is achieved by having a my-leader-ke…</span>

                              <span>I’m running into a weird issue and could use some advice.
 When I call a function or alias using M-x shell-command,
 I get shell errors that don’t occur when I run the same commands directly in my terminal.
 Here’s what I’m encountering:
 /home/ychaouche/.bashrc_custom: line 267: syntax error near unexpected token &#x60;(&#x27; /home/ychaouche/.bashrc_custom: line 267: &#x60; +([0-9]))&#x27; /home/ychaouche/.bashrc_custom: line 267: syntax error near unexpected token &#x60;(&#x27; /home/ychaouche/.bashrc_custom: line 267: &#x60; +([0-9]))&#x27; Thu Aug 22 09:34 
 The strange part?
 The function or alias still executes correctly,
 and I get the expected output (e.g., the date).
 But these error messages only show up when running the command from Emacs.
 I suspect the culprit might be related to extended globbing (extglob) since I’m using +([0-9])) in my script.
 From what I gathered here[1],
 it looks like enabling extended globbing with shopt -s extglob could solve the problem.
 I tried and added it at the top of my .bashrc_custom file,
 but then emacs freezes entirely when I try to run anything via shell-command,
 until I cancel it with C-g.
 So my question is:
 Where should I set shopt -s extglob so that M-x shell-command picks it up properly?
 Any pointers or best practices would be greatly appreciated!
 Thanks in advance!

I don&#x27;t want it to close if there is another window open though. The ideal solution would be to allow C-x 4 0 to close the sole window/frame, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s possible. Has anyone done something like this?

                              <span>Hi all,
 I give presentations using handouts rather than slides. I wonder if there is any way to create &quot;notes&quot; in ordinary .pdf files similar to notes in Beamer. What I mean is that I can create one single .org file with notes, and I can export to two versions of .pdf files, one without my notes and one with them.
 Thank you for your help!

                              <span>I’ve been playing around with the cooperative threading implementation in Emacs, and noticed that on C-g non-main threads are getting killed (whether or not they’re active).
 This means that normal usage (which, at least for me, often involves invoking C-g to switch what I’m doing) will constantly be killing background threads, either in the middle of important work or while waiting for some event to occur.
 How can we use the Emacs threading implementation in a manner that doesn’t fall prey to this issue?

                              <span>TLDR: How to have C-h commands open both the default Help page and the Helpful page?
 I love the Helpful help pages from the &#x27;helpful&#x27; package.. However sometimes I just want the more simple default help page. After I have invoked a help/describe- page I would like to be able to easily switch between these two versions of the help page. Either by opening them both and then being able to switch buffers or maybe in some other ingenious way.
 Any suggestion? 😊
 This is the relevant config I have at the moment (some may recognize it from the &#x27;emacs from scratch&#x27; series)
 :
 (use-package helpful
 :custom
 (counsel-describe-function-function #&#x27;helpful-callable)
 (counsel-describe-variable-functionn #&#x27;helpful-variable)
 :bind
 ([remap describe-function] . counsel-describe-function)
 ([remap describe-command] . helpful-command)
 ([remap describe-variable] . counsel-describe-variable)
 ([remap describe-key] . helpful-key)
 )

                              <span>Hello guys,
 I&#x27;ve tried Googling and trying to find other Reddit posts but I&#x27;m completely baffled as to why Emacs is not loading my init.el file.
 I&#x27;ve tried making an &#x60;.emacs&#x60; folder and an &#x60;.emacs.d&#x60; folder, neither of which is loading my init.el file on startup. I&#x27;ve been creating the folders in &#x60;C:\Users\laneb\&#x60;
 I&#x27;ve also tried running &quot;(message &quot;%s&quot; (getenv &quot;HOME&quot;))&quot; in the minibuffer which outputs &quot;C:\\Users\\laneb\\AppData\\Roaming&quot; which I thought was its home directory, so I created a &#x60;.emacs.d/init.el&#x60; file and folder and that doesn&#x27;t work either.
 At this point I&#x27;m completely lost as to what I should try next. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

 blamer
 On Windows display commit frequent display failure.
 sideline-blame
 No maintenance for too long, too slow.
 So I made an &#x60;emsg-blame&#x60; that is as simple and fast as possible and uses asynchronous.
 I think git blame is most useful in four ways:
  
author
 date
 time
 commit
  
So I extracted them and let the user choose how to display them.
 Provides global variables to let users choose how to display them:
  
emsg-blame–commit-author
 emsg-blame–commit-date
 emsg-blame–commit-summary
  
Users can use any display frame, such as message, posframe, overlay, popup.

                              <span>We are in the process of using SMTP over SSL and are having issues when trying to send the email through a new relay server. I have two other spring apps where it was just property changes that spring mail handled flawlessly.
 I made the appropriate property changes and added the PasswordAuthentication() method in the scala app for java mail, but I keep getting errors when calling Transport.send().
 Im not plugged into the scala community, so I wanted to ask if there is some kind of compatibility issue between versions of scala and java mail?
 Error: Failure attempting to convert connection to TLS Received fatal alert protocol version SSLHandshakeException: Received fatal alert protocol_version

 Appreciate any help!

 My main concern is how can I use the IO monad (zio or cats effect) in java.
 Is this possible or am I just better off learning new libraries for the scala ecosystem?

 I&#x27;m working on a little turn-based game implementation in Haskell, primarily as a learning exercise, and I&#x27;m trying to focus as much as possible on leveraging the type system to make invalid states and values unrepresentable. Forgive me as I try to elide as much unnecessary detail as possible, to get at the core of my question.
 Here&#x27;s some types:

 The GameContext is a big blob of state that gets threaded through the entire game lo…</span>

 Can the case expression be replaced with a generic function? The function accepts an ADT value and a function for each of its possible variants, combining all the variants&#x27; values to some type.
 My motives are just fun and learning.
 The standard library already has maybe and either for this, but I want one function to work for any ADT.
 In the case of this datatype:
 data MyData &#x3D; NoArgs | MyInt Int | MyTwoStrings String String 
 It should have type: MyData -&gt; a -&gt; (Int -&gt; a) -&gt; (String -&gt; String -&gt; a) -&gt; a
 So overall, the function should behave like this:
 caseOf Nothing 0 (+3) &#x3D;&#x3D; 0 caseOf (Just 4) 0 (+3) &#x3D;&#x3D; 7 caseOf (MyInt 4) 0 (+3) ++ &#x3D;&#x3D; 7 caseOf (MyTwoStrings &quot;hello&quot; &quot;world&quot;) 0 (+3) (++) &#x3D;&#x3D; &quot;hello world&quot; 
 This stackoverflow answer mentions church encoding and implemented it in a library, but it wouldn&#x27;t compile for me
 Bonus: have the actual value be the last argument. For the above example, the type should be:
 a -&gt; (Int -&gt; a) -&gt; (String -&gt; String -&gt; a) -&gt; MyData -&gt; a

 ;; Initialize package sources
 (require &#x27;package)
 (setq package-archives &#x27;((&quot;melpa&quot; . &quot;https://melpa.org/packages/&quot;)
 (&quot;org&quot; . &quot;https://orgmode.org/elpa/&quot;)
 (&quot;elpa&quot; . &quot;https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/&quot;)))
 (package-initialize)
 (unless package-archive-contents
 (package-refresh-contents))
 which should let me download or update org but for some reason i cant update it, its so tedious, any help?

                              <span>Scala is still very complex for me. I don&#x27;t have a problem with the OO part of it, as I had many years working with mainstream languages. All the concepts of traits, the functions, pattern matching, etc.. this is all good. But I&#x27;m really STRUGGLING with anything related to for comprehensions, either, option, etc... Sometimes I need to do something really simple, like getting a value from the database, do some verifications, and then present to the user. But the code is full of &#x60;.eitherT().liftT().left()....&#x60;, it&#x27;s really really hard to understand what is happening.
 Most of the code base that I&#x27;m seeing is based on scalaz, but other parts of the stack is on akka/play, and there are a few cats as well.
 Any tips or suggestions on how to get better at this part? Books? Courses?

                              <span>Welcome back! 
 On next Monday, 9th of September at 2PM CEST, I will be hosting another Scala Space Podcast episode. This time I will be joined by Olivier Melois, principal engineer working at Disney+ and the author of Smithy4s tool. Our discussion will regard the general concept of IDLs, how Smithy compares to alternatives and how to use it to improve productivity in your organisation. 
 The podcast will be streamed live on YouTube and Twitch so you can join and comment or ask questions in the chat, as usual.

                              <span>I don&#x27;t have lots of experience on JVM tuning but scares me to death the fact that here at the company that I&#x27;m working on everyone is just copying and pasting the settings blindingly from service to service without ever thinking why it was there. For example, the most common thing I see is setting the min memory higher than the auto scaling threshold, so on the first deploy, the service scales to the max and stays there forever.

 In my Java days, I had a few newsletters (from JavaCodeGeek, Dzone, JacaCodeRanch, etc.) I got plenty of input, tutorials, and learning stuff.
 Is there anything available for Scala? I already subscribed to Scala Times.

 I don&#x27;t have and I don&#x27;t want to pay for a Medium subscription.

                              <span>I know, I know. I have an old Asus x200ca that I would like to boot up in console mode, pretty much as a pure emacs laptop. If I run &#x27;M-x list-colors&#x27;, I get eight colors listed. Is there by any chance a dark theme I can use that might look nice? 
 Another question: I have some commands I want to run on init but only in console mode. Is there a way to check for this in the .emacs file?

                              <span>Emacs newbie here. I&#x27;m using Vertico + Consult setup for my minibuffer completion system. I am confused on why doesn&#x27;t &#x60;project-remember-projects-under&#x60; doesn&#x27;t have TAB completion. So for example when I want to navigate the path and type in a prefix (e.g. &#x60;~/proj...&#x60;) and press TAB to complete it (e.g. &#x60;~/projects/&#x60;), it doesn&#x27;t happen. But this does happen for example in &#x60;C-x C-f&#x60; and I assume this should be the case everywhere when I setup Vertico and consult. Another case is the &#x60;project-switch-projects&#x60; when I want to find a dir to add a new project to the list. I am confused about this and would appreciate some help.

                              <span>I have a custom emacs setup that I’m quite fond. I run no code of my own, it’s all just configuring of existing packages. 
 I experience extreme lagginess in some buffers after working in them for some time. My primary major mode is cider (clojure). The buffers are all fairly snappy after a fresh start and then some of them slow down after some time to the point where it could take a second for a cursor move to reflect. If I open the same file in a second buffer then sometimes the cursor is snappy in the second buffer.
 What is the process I must follow to track down the package(s) or config that is causing this lag to build? I’m not really familiar with emacs-lisp beyond basic configuring of init.el. 
 What must I learn, what must I read and what debugging technique should I use?

                              <span>I have a recurring situation where I need to save a file in a location which I usually have as a bookmark. These can anything from a davs:, ssh:, nextcloud:, etc. I was wondering if there is a way or a package which would allow me to use the bookmark name as shortcut wjem specifying the file&#x27;s path. 
 Thanks in advance for the help.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve got a bit of a frustrating story to share, and I&#x27;m hoping maybe some of you can offer some advice.
 For the past months, I&#x27;ve been trying to find a developer to create an open-source multi-language transliteration mode for Emacs. The idea is to have a mode that can transliterate Latin characters into various scripts in real-time. I&#x27;m looking to start with Arabic since that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m most familiar with, but the goal is to make it extensible to other languages in the future.
 The project would use Google Input Tools for the transliteration functionality. I thought it would be a cool project that could benefit many Emacs users working with different languages. The initial requirements aren&#x27;t too complex (or are they? More on that later):
  
Integrate with Google Input Tools API
 Provide real-time transliteration suggestions (starting with Arabic)
 Store common translations for offline use (like a dictionary)
 Allow manual editing of stored translations
 Design the system to be extensible for other languages through config
 Share the project commented and documented
  
I&#x27;ve posted the job on (a major jobs website) and tried to make it sound as approachable as possible. I&#x27;ve even revised the posting a few times to make it clearer and simpler.
 But here&#x27;s the kicker: I&#x27;ve run into two major problems. First, the developers I&#x27;ve hired often don&#x27;t seem to properly assess the project before accepting it. I&#x27;ve had three instances where they&#x27;ve abandoned the project shortly after starting. Second, and this is on me, the budget I can offer is abysmal. I&#x27;m realizing now that Emacs Lisp is probably not a beginner-friendly language, which makes finding skilled developers even harder, especially given my budget constraints.
 I am no dev but is this project really hard? How much should it cost? And would it be interesting/worth it for the community?
 Thanks for letting me vent a bit.

                              <span>Hi. I have been creating Zettels off and on for last 3 years (currently having 450 notes). Requesting your advice and suggestions on a confusion I often experience
I have heard that each note should only be about one idea. However, many times I am creating notes that might have multiple sub ideas but I don&#x27;t feel each sub idea should be separately made a note. For instance, refer to the attached note.

I am discussing two components about the nature of growth - but I typically prefer to put them in a single note only. Would it be more beneficial for me to put the subpoints in separate notes? If so, why?
If you guys were creating the note that I just pasted, how would you create it? Would you make it single or multiple notes? If multiple, what all notes would you make from it?
Thanks!</span>

                              <span>So I came across a YouTube video earlier today, where the speaker shows a Leetcode problem that goes something like this:
  
Given a non-empty floating-point array of even length n, calculate the minimal value produced when iterating n / 2 times, removing both the minimum and maximum each time and combining them [in a way I don&#x27;t recall].
  
I think in a procedural language we&#x27;d all intuitively sort the values and then iterate from the edges to the middle simultaneously. So in C++ you would essentially end up with something like this:
 // pretend I added constexpr, noexcept, assertions, requires, etc. auto min_extreme_comb(auto &amp;&amp; range, auto combiner) { using namespace std; // forgive me pls using type &#x3D; ranges::range_value_t; sort(begin(range), end(range)); return transf…</span>

                              <span>As a clojure programmer with fairly minimal Haskell experience (read LYAH, implemented an algorithm from grad school), I&#x27;ve been going through the lean 4 intro, and it seems pretty cool. It has many (most?) of Haskell&#x27;s features, while improving on Haskell in its handling of records/structs and namespaces, imho. That&#x27;s setting aside the obvious new features like dependent types and theorem proving (I have no interest in theorem proving, personally). It also seems to have a lot of interest from corporate research groups, or at least that&#x27;s what its wikipedia article claims.
 At the same time, it seems to have very little presence online, outside of its zulip chat group. I see basically nothing on reddit, almost nothing on youtube. I get the impression that very few programmers have picked it up independently or converted to it from other languages like haskell. Searching on the haskell subreddit, I see a post from two years ago where people showed a lot of interest, but not much since.
 So I&#x27;m curious, is there a reason it isn&#x27;t getting traction in the developer/fp nerd communities? Does it simply have too small an ecosystem to garner attention, or is there something else?

 This is a very simple code snippet demonstrating the basic syntax of Haskell, which is considered as the most &#x27;pure&#x27; functional language, as well as the most diffucult to read and understand without deep knowledge of its idioms.

                              <span>I have to develope some LIbre Office Macros (in Basic) and I&#x27;m curious if anyone has seen Emacs packages which implement a decent dev loop. So, for example:
  
edit w/ syntax checking
 
reload the macro in Libre Office when saved
 
some sort of test framework or command runner
 
 thx

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been working on creating a major-mode for running tests. I was inspired by how rg.el uses the header-line to customize ripgrep parameters, and I wanted to similarly use the header-line to customize test parameters.
 rg.el achieves this by propertizing header-line elements with keymaps that call functions that customize the compilation query and recompile: see rg-header.el, specifically rg-header-mouse-action. This works with their major mode, rg-mode, which is defined via define-compilation-mode. This macro wraps define-derived-mode to derive from compilation-mode. I was able to mimic this process and achieve the desired behavior for my header-line.
 The problem comes when I try to add interactivity. If what I&#x27;m running requires interaction, I typically call compilation interactively. This makes the compilation buffer use comint-mode and compilation-shell-minor-mode. I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to get define-compilation-mode to be interactive, so I instead just derived directly from comint-mode and activated compilation-shell-minor-mode. With this I can get interactivity in my major mode.
 However, the left click in the header-line no longer works. The hover help text still works. I imagine what&#x27;s going on is that comint-mode or some minor mode is overriding the left mouse button. How can I get around this? It seems the recommended way of overriding major/minor mode keybindings is to define your own minor mode, or use bind-key*. But I&#x27;m not sure how to apply this to my situation, where I want to apply a keybinding only to some text (in the header-line). I&#x27;d appreciate any suggestions.

                              <span>Hi people, I have this waring since I upgraded my lsp-mode package to version 20240823.746:
 Warning (lsp-mode): Unknown request method: workspace/diagnostic/refresh
 I think that other modes are involved in this issue too, but by now I can confirm that with json-mode and web-mode the warning appears.
 I have updated my language serves from the global npm installation:

                              <span>I have started using org mode in Emacs after a long time using neovim. Almost everything I used in vim has an alternative or even a better option inside emacs... except snippets.
 I like the flexibility of regex snippets in UltiSnips and have tried to recreate this in yasnippet. Most of the things can be customized to emulate such as:
  
having snippet work without the leading space
 making some snippets auto expanding
  
However, I can not find anything about regex context snippets. There is an stack exchange topic about that from a few years back, but even using re-search--backward I cannot recreate the UltiSnips behavior. 
 So what I am trying to achieve?
 I have a snippet when I press the key ;, which:
  
if there are characters before the key it expands to x_{}
 if there are no characters before it (excluding space) it does nothing, so that another snippet, for example ;a can expand to \alpha
  
Most of the issues I have looked at are a few years old. A pull request that would bring that functionality has been abandoned a few years back. 
 I am fairly new to Emacs. Can this be achieved in yasnippet? Is there another plugin, that can achieve similar functionality?

 I use C-M-u to jump to left outer side and then C-M-f to jump to the right side.
 It there better way to achieve this?

 I have tried this in my config.el:
 (defun toggle-dired-hidden-files () &quot;Toggle hidden files in dired.&quot; (interactive) (if (string-match-p &quot; -A&quot; dired-listing-switches) (setq dired-listing-switches &quot;-Xlh --group-directories-first&quot;) (setq dired-listing-switches &quot;-AXlh --group-directories-first&quot;)) (revert-buffer)) 
 But it doesn&#x27;t work. New to Emacs, any help appreciated. Thank you.

 I installed emacs just to test it out on a computer that isn&#x27;t mine and I have to return (yeah I know). I removed emacs, but it left a bunch of files and directories.
 /etc/emacs
 /etc/emacs/site-start.d
 /etc/emacs/site-start.d/00debian.el
 /mnt/c/Users/pcste/AppData/Local/Yarn/Cache/v6/npm-node-gyp-3.8.0-540304261c330e80d0d5edce253a68cb3964218c-integrity/node_modules/node-gyp/gyp/tools/emacs

 And a bunch more. How do I remove it completely?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been thinking about a problem that&#x27;s been bugging me for a while, and I bet some of you can relate.
 We&#x27;re all drowning in a sea of different file formats. PDFs, EPUBs, HTML, plain text, you name it. Switching between apps for each format is a pain, and it makes building a cohesive knowledge base feel like herding cats.
 Imagine if we could:
  
Open ANY document format directly in Emacs
 Have a consistent interface for all reading materials
 Easily annotate and link between different sources
 Integrate seamlessly with org-mode or org-roam
  
Sounds nice, right?
 I&#x27;ve been working on a tool called &#x60;convert-to-org.py&#x60; as part of the org-zettel-ref-mode project. It&#x27;s not a complete solution (yet), but it&#x27;s a start:
  
Converts various formats to org-mode files
 Runs directly within Emacs
 Preserves document structure
 Plays nice with org-mode and org-roam
  
I Think This Matters:
  
Consistency: All your reading materials in org-mode format
 Annotation: Easy note-taking within converted documents
 Searchability: Emacs&#x27; powerful search across all materials
 Integration: Connect reading directly to your knowledge management system
  
And I have some questions:
  
What&#x27;s your current reading workflow in Emacs?
 What features would your ideal unified reading environment have?
 Any ideas on how to push this concept further?
  
If you&#x27;re interested in checking out the tool or contributing, star org-zettel-ref-mode on GitHub.
 Working on a tool to convert various document formats to org-mode, aiming for a unified reading environment in Emacs. What do you think?

                              <span>Hello, I&#x27;m a Haskell beginner, and this apparently minor issue is leaving me completely stumped.
 I used Haskell for a bit on a lubuntu VirtualBox, since it seemed by far the easiest way to setup BLAS and LAPACK needed for the hmatrix library (my PC&#x27;s operative system is Windows 10). On the virtual machine, I was able to setup my small project with no issues at all, using cabal init.
 Recently, I&#x27;ve managed to set up OpenBLAS and correctly install hmatrix on the host, but when I try to start a completely new project:
 C:\Users\User&gt; mkdir proj
 C:\Users\User&gt; cd proj
 C:\Users\User\proj&gt; cabal init
 after making me choose some set-up options, I&#x27;m inevitably hit by this message:
 git: readCreateProcessWithExitCode: does not exist (No such file or directory)
 I tried multiple combinations of options and the result is always the same.
 Every proposed solution to instances of this problem I&#x27;ve seen online doesn&#x27;t work, and I can&#x27;t figure out why. I&#x27;m definitely missing something very important here, could anybody help?

 I solve it with wrapping BuiltinV function into another data type with string key, which i use for Eq / Ord instances, but is it possible to use it in the way i wrote above?

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I’m trying to use Org Mode in a way that’s similar to how you’d use an R Notebook or Jupyter Notebook. Specifically, I want to export the results of my analysis (including both code and images generated by that code) into a standalone HTML file.
 I’m running into two issues:
 1. Image Embedding: By default, Org Babel’s HTML export functionality includes a link to any images rather than embedding the actual image itself as Base64. This means that if I share the HTML file, the images won’t be displayed unless the image files are also shared. 2. Pandoc Issues: I tried using a package that integrates Pandoc for exporting, but it won’t export the results of my code snippets—it only exports the code itself. This doesn’t just break image exports, it also fails to include things like text and table results from my analysis, which is a significant issue. 
 Neither of these approaches works for me, and I haven’t been able to find a solution that allows for a complete, self-contained HTML file with embedded images and code results.
 My question: Is there a way to export an Org Mode file to HTML with all results (including images) embedded in the file itself? Any tips, solutions, or packages I should check out?
 Thanks in advance for your help!

 Can you please point me to some open source projects in need of such a help you are aware of?
 Yes, I know some bounties has been published here but since I haven&#x27;t delved too much into these libraries ecosystems I think I am more suitable for the migration efforts some open source may have at this point of time.
 Thank you very much.

                              <span>In the past I tried out some Database Libs for one of our projects, but none really catched well. Most were so complicated, that it began to feel like fighting the library instead of fighting SQL. Others had really long compile times.
 In the end I ended up with a small toolset on top of JDBC for Scala 3, called usql: https://github.com/reactivecore/usql
 So what is in there?
  
Interpolation: sql&quot;SELECT INTO Person(id, name) VALUES(${1}, ${&quot;Alice&quot;})&quot;.execute()
 These SQL fragments can be freely combined
 Macro-based DAO-Generators for Case Classes
 Dynamic generated extractors for ResultSets / Fillers for PreparedStatements
 Extensible using a small set of Typeclasses (especially DataType)
 Some helpers for writing Joins (not documented yet and a bit unstable)
  
A lot of stuff is not in there:
  
DDL Generation
 ORM
 Dependencies
 Effect system: the main use is in Loom Applications. But it should be possible to wrap it into your own effect system if necessary.
  
The library looks very similar to Magnum, which I was not aware of until late in development.

Getting Started with Nix for Haskell by Abhinav Sarkar
Nix is notoriously hard to get started with. If you are familiar with Haskell, you may have an easier time learning the Nix language, but it is still difficult to figure out the various toolchains and libraries functions needed to put your knowledge of the Nix language to use. There are some frameworks for setting up Haskell projects with Nix, but again, they are hard to understand because of their large feature scopes. So, in this post, I’m going to show a really easy way for you to get started.

                              <span>Our Nickel language is a configuration language. It’s also a
functional programming language. Functional programming isn’t a well-defined
term: it can encompass anything from being vaguely able to pass functions as
arguments and to call them (in that respect, C and JavaScript are functional) to
being a statically typed, pure and immutable language based on the
lambda-calculus, like Haskell.
However, if you ask a random developer, I can guarantee that one aspect will be
mentioned every time: algebraic data types (ADTs) and pattern matching. They are
the bread and butter of typed functional languages. ADTs are relatively easy to
implement (for language maintainers) and easy to use. They’re part of the 20% of
the complexity that makes for 80% of the joy of functional programming.

But I have one question: how do I create identifiers? Can The Archive create them automatically for me when I make a new note or do I have to manually add one (perhaps via text expansion) at the start of each new note?
Thank you for your help.</span>

 Here when I did a quick cmd+f I find three results
  
GHC.Natural
 GHC.Num.Natural
 Numeric.Natural
  
Are they same ? or different ?

 As this was recommended on the haskell.org page their suggested way
 I am unclear about few topics still, also I want to learn some more in depth Haskell
 there are 3 books I am looking for now to give a read
  
concurrent and parallel programming haskell
 some intermediate book (can we read RED BOOK, is it good, is it for scala?)
 some resource for practical and industrial haskell
  
Thanks in advance fellow lambda enjoyeres

                              <span>I am having issues getting syntax highlighting in a .jl buffer using treesit in emacs. 
 For example if i create a test.jl file using C-x C-f the buffer automatically enters julia-ts-mode and julia-snail-mode which is great:
 if I define a function:
 function main() nothing end 
 and run the command treesit-explore-mode then I get a buffer that displays:
 (function_definition function (signature (call_expression (identifier) (argument_list ()))) \n (identifier) \n end) 
 so I know that the syntax tree is working and I am able to get indentation, but no syntax highlighting what so ever. 
 with the command font-lock-update I get the following error: 
 treesit-font-lock-fontify-region: Query pattern is malformed: &quot;Node type error at&quot;, 177, &quot;(assignment (identifier) u/font-lock-variable-name-face (_)) (assignment (field_expression (identifier) \&quot;.\&quot; (identifier) u/font-lock-variable-name-face) (operator)) (assignment (bare_tuple (identifier) u/font-lock-variable-name-face)) (assignment (bare_tuple (field_expression (identifier) \&quot;.\&quot; (identifier) u/font-lock-variable-name-face)) (operator)) (local_statement (identifier) u/font-lock-variable-name-face) (let_binding (identifier) u/font-lock-variable-name-face) (global_statement (identifier) u/font-lock-variable-name-face)&quot;, &quot;Debug the query with &#x60;treesit-query-validate&#x27;&quot; 
 any help would be greatly appreciated!

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;m experiencing an issue with expiring emails in Gnus, and I&#x27;m hoping for some guidance. Here’s the situation:
 I’ve configured Gnus with (nnmail-expiry-wait &#x27;immediate) and (nnmail-expiry-target &quot;nnimap+gmail:[Gmail]/Trash&quot;) for my Gmail account, expecting emails marked as expirable (E) to be moved to Trash immediately after running the expiration process. However, after marking messages and pressing C-c C-x in the Group buffer, I see &quot;Expiring articles...done&quot;, but the emails remain visible in both Gnus and the web interface of Gmail.
 Interestingly, manually expunging messages one by one with B E works perfectly, and the emails are deleted as expected. However, my ideal workflow is to mark certain emails with a single press of E and then batch delete them all at once. Ideally, I’d…</span>

                              <span>Is it possible to save changes to a string&#x27;s text properties so that when the buffer is closed and reopened it may be redisplayed? I&#x27;ve been using the Elisp manual&#x27;s section on examining and changing text properties and while it does provide many functions to do so, none of these changes seem to remain once the file is closed, even if it was saved. Is it possible to save these changes so that they become a permanent part of the buffer and will be redisplayed upon opening the respective file/buffer? I&#x27;ve heard &quot;enriched mode&quot; provides this functionality, but I just wondered if this could be done simply through elisp or some setting configuration?

 I&#x27;ve noticed that some frames are being automatically killed, which isn&#x27;t ideal. I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s some kind of garbage collection issue, but how do I figure out why the frames are being killed, and where can I see information about which frames were killed previously (there&#x27;s no indication in the *Messages* buffer)?

                              <span>Hello,
 I&#x27;m using tab-bar-mode, and I have tab-bar-format-global in tab-bar-format. This will display global-mode-string to tab-bar.
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;elisp
 (setq-default tab-bar-format tab-bar-format-menu-bar tab-bar-format-history tab-bar-format-tabs tab-bar-separator tab-bar-format-add-tab tab-bar-separator tab-bar-format-align-right tab-bar-format-global )) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 But, in global-mode-string, I have mu4e. the tab-bar erase global-mode-string&#x27;s menu hover and mouse click action.
 It seems that its related to the &quot;ignore&quot; word. elisp (defun tab-bar-format-global () &quot;Produce display of &#x60;global-mode-string&#x27; in the tab bar. When &#x60;tab-bar-format-global&#x27; is added to &#x60;tab-bar-format&#x27; \(possibly appended after &#x60;tab-bar-format-align-right&#x27;), then modes that display information on the mode line using &#x60;global-mode-string&#x27; will display the same text on the tab bar instead.&quot; (mapcar (lambda (string) &#x60;(global menu-item ,(format-mode-line string) ignore)) global-mode-string)) 
 If I remove tab-bar-format-global from tab-bar-format, the global-mode-string will display on mode-line, and the global-mode-string&#x27;s mu4e indicator can use mouse to hover and click. I think if put global-mode-string to tab-bar, items in tab-bar should also be mouse hover / mouse click too.
 What do you think? How to quickly hack tab-bar to let global-mode-string accept mouse hover and mouse click in tab-bar?
 Thank you.

                              <span>I&#x27;m facing an unusal problem here. Normally I do software in emacs but today it&#x27;s this:
 I have a list of ~ 2k-5k text chunks, that are each about one or two sentences natural language. I need to review, potentially correct them and then save the results back. I know this is crazy, but if there&#x27;s one tool that can help me, it must be emacs. I conceptually of need a way to quickly go to the next unreviewed chunk, potentially edit it, mark it as reviewed and go to the next until done. Has anyone ever done something like this? Is there a tool? How would you go about it?

 I don&#x27;t. I already burned my fingers with adding complexity to emacs that I couldn&#x27;t handle. That included (among others) package management and as a consequence I try to keep additional packages (as well as configurations) to a minimum.
 What reasons do you have for one or the other?

                              <span>I had some automation tests written in Java which used to ping my services on Scala Play 2.8 once it was deployed to a dev environment. But now after I upgrade it to 2.9, I am getting connection terminated at all the tests.
 Weirdly enough this happens only with the Java automation test suites and nothing else. Like if I invoke the same API from swagger, postman or any other service it just works. The Java Test Suite is using Java 17 and is also using self signed https certificates. Can anyone help me figure out what maybe going wrong here and what all should I try to fix this?

 Just a note in case you have the same issue. I feel that updating anything on Emacs these days should be planned in advance and done on the weekends :)

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to take lecture notes using &#x60;org-mode&#x60; and &#x60;cdlatex-mode&#x60;. The problem I meet is when I try to use &#x60;Tab&#x60; to expand &#x60;fr&#x60; it doesn&#x27;t expand correctly.
 &#x60;\(fr\)&#x60; will become &#x60;\(\begin{frame}[]\frametitle{}\end{frame}\)&#x60; instead of &#x60;\(\frac{}{}\)&#x60; and there is a warning saying that &#x60;Warning (org-element): ‘org-element-at-point’ cannot be used in non-Org buffer # (latex-mode)&#x60;. 
 I&#x27;m using &#x60;doom emacs&#x60; and only open &#x60;org-cdlatex-mode&#x60; as a minor mode. How can I fix this problem to make &#x60;\(fr\)&#x60; works properly? 
 By the way, I also want to know how can I make an abbreviation like &#x60;fr&#x60;, which I can expand it in a latex fragment. I have try &#x60;(setq cdlatex-env-alist&#x27;((&quot;limit&quot; &quot;\\lim_{?}&quot; nil)))&#x60; and &#x60;(setq cdlatex-command-alist
 &#x27;((&quot;lim&quot; &quot;Insert fraction env&quot; &quot;&quot; cdlatex-environment (&quot;limit&quot;) t nil)))&#x60; but this seems only works for the abbreviation at the beginning of a line.

                              <span>I&#x27;m happy to share with everyone that org-zettel-ref-mode has been updated to version 0.3. The main focus of this update has been to improve its compatibility with org-roam. Additionally, the previously provided &#x60;convert-to-org.py&#x60; script can now be executed directly within Emacs, allowing for document conversion without leaving this productive environment.
 Although these are just two minor main updates, their impact is significant. It reminds me of a saying: &quot;No matter how simple the functionality, the complexity behind it is immeasurable.&quot; To ensure compatibility with org-roam, I&#x27;ve changed the working logic of org-zettel-ref-mode from generating a new file and directly overwriting it each time to incremental updates. I&#x27;ve also studied the org-roam API and managed to maintain stable IDs…</span>

                              <span>The native compilation thing in newer versions of Emacs creates a eln-cache directory under your config dir (unless you move it with startup-redirect-eln-cache).
 For me the directory looks like this:  ~/.emacs.d/eln-cache/29.4-95d1479c/ace-window-a4363797-e4f210e9.eln /aggressive-indent-eaef7fd5-fb4a240b.eln ... /yaml-mode-3ab646e7-6cc0bf46.eln 
 Basically the form seems to be eln-cache/-/--.eln.
 I am assuming these hexadecimal values are hashes, but I suppose they can be anything.
 If they are hashes, what are they hashes of? Can I reproduce these hashes somehow?

 describe mode and function work fine. But describe-key requires input in the function.
 Is there a way to run describe-key in a way where it prompts for input keys?
 (defun jv/describe (choice) (interactive (list (completing-read &quot;Choose: &quot; &#x27;(&quot;function&quot; &quot;key&quot; &quot;mode&quot;) nil t))) (cond ((string-equal choice &quot;function&quot;) (counsel-describe-function)) ((string-equal choice &quot;key&quot;) (describe-key)) ;; &lt;-- this part ((string-equal choice &quot;mode&quot;) (describe-mode))))

                              <span>I&#x27;ve recently stumbled upon &#x60;magit-diff-visit-file&#x60;, which is bound to RET in a magit diff view. When on a removed line, it jumps back to the previous blob containing that line, which is handy, yet it also seems to revert the worktree file to that old blob, even if I have uncommitted changes to that file.
 This happened a couple of times (magit 4.0.0 and 4.1.0), and I could not find any way to revert back to my (uncommitted) worktree file except for copying back the ~ backup file.
 There is a &#x60;magit-diff-visit-worktree-file&#x60; command, but that one requires the magit status buffer to still show the uncommitted worktree changes, which is no longer the case if closing the status buffer after invoking &#x60;magit-diff-visit-file&#x60;.
 Does anyone know an option to either (1) revert to the worktree version after &#x60;magit-diff-visit-file&#x60;, or (2) somehow warn the user before &#x60;magit-diff-visit-file&#x60; is about to execute?

                              <span>Sadly the Scala market in my region (LATAM) is almost nonexistent, my current contract is almost end so i&#x27;m looking for another opportunity, all that i can find are plain Java + Spring jobs, i found a startup that is using Elixir heavily in the backend.
 What would you do in my position? I want to go back to Scala as fast as posible, is Java an advantage for a Scala position? Is Elixir an advantage for a Scala position?:
 Bonus question; I have no idea of Elixir, is Elixir actually a functional language?

 GHC Haskell&#x27;s RTS is written in a mixture of C and Haskell. I believe a worthy goal should be to rewrite all C code (and any other code that isn&#x27;t memory safe) in a memory-safe language (e.g., Rust).
 The Haskell Foundation should make this a high-priority project, and it should seek funding from national and international agencies to staff it.

                              <span>Greetings,
 I am new to Haskell and when I code Haskell on vscode, an error message says &quot;openTempFile: invalid argument (Invalid argument)compiler&quot;. Even though there is no syntax error and I can load the file into ghci and run the functions, it&#x27;s annoying and I was trying to figure out how to remove that message.
 The image of error message is attached

 This is the Haskell extension that I&#x27;m using:

 I download Haskell using ghcup:

 Thanks in advance for any help!
 Edit: I notice that the error message occurs when the file name is long

                              <span>I am very confused about Haskell tooling system I installed Haskell from ghcup which was very awesome as it installed all the necessary things with one command I learnt basic haskell, now I am trying to make projects, so I want to know about which build tool to use Cabal or Stack, what&#x27;s the difference between them ? Why we have 2 of them? Are both from Haskell community? Whats the standard and quick way to start project? Also, I tried cabal, and to add a dependencies, you have to manually edit the .cabal file, can&#x27;t you do something like npm i 
 and it changes the package.json for cabal ?

                              <span>N.b. I mostly write Lisp and Go these days; I&#x27;ve only written toys in Haskell.
  
Naively, &quot;making invalid states unrepresentable&quot; seems like it&#x27;d couple you to a single understanding of the problem space, causing issues when your past assumptions are challenged etc. How do you architect things for the long term?
 
What sort of warts appear in older Haskell code bases? How do you handle/prevent them?
 
What &quot;patterns&quot; are common? (Gang of 4 patterns, &quot;clean&quot; code etc. were of course mistakes/bandaids for missing features.) In Lisp, I theoretically believe any recurring pattern should be abstracted away as a macro so there&#x27;s no real architecture left. What&#x27;s the Platonic optimal in Haskell?
 
  
I found:
  
Next Level MTL on tools for growing monad transformer stacks: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;GZPup5Iuaqw
 https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/4srjcc/architecture_patterns_for_larger_haskell_programs/ discusses e.g. memoization (can&#x27;t) and instrumenting observability, which makes &quot;functional core&quot; imperative monadic shell&quot; tedious(?). I suspect a deeper understanding of monads (e.g. Van Laarhoven free helps (like dependency injection as the code base evolves)
 Granin&#x27;s Functional Design and Architecture looks interesting

 The message says error, but I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s not because bug-hunter skips over it.
 I could be triggering this via (debug-on-message &quot;Package cl&quot;).
 I&#x27;m not an expert, but I can step through files and use bug-hunter, etc. This has me stumped right now. I want to eliminate or at least identify this last use of CL in my setup. This message will only appear once, during a fresh cold startup. Obviously, the Lisp engine&#x27;s PC (program counter) knows where this happened, but it doesn&#x27;t tell me anything useful. Any suggestions from people who debug regularly?

 functions used
 embark-select, so embark can later insert the regions in a buffer using embark-collect
 embark-collect,
 mc-mark-all-in-region, to match the string &quot;ms&quot; (also has a regexp variation)
 rectangle-mark-mode, to select the region in the buffer created by embark-collect
 calc-grab-rectangle, to send the region to calc v R +, as I understand it flattens the list of lists of numbers and them sum the resulting list
 Video has 45s, highly recommend to mute the audio.
 **How would you solve the same problem?**

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to get org-columns to show a column without the amount of hours clocked in the current week.
 I saw that org-mode has a function (org-clock-sum-today) that it uses for the CLOCKSUM_T special property:
 https://github.com/bzg/org-mode/blob/9183e3c723b812360d1042196416d521db590e9f/lisp/org-colview.el#L894
 I also saw that there&#x27;s a (org-clock-sum-custom):
 https://github.com/bzg/org-mode/blob/9183e3c723b812360d1042196416d521db590e9f/lisp/org-clock.el#L1951
 So I tried to overwrite the org-columns function in my init.el, adding a new condition for that function like: 
  (when (assoc &quot;CLOCKSUM_W&quot; org-columns-current-fmt-compiled) (org-clock-sum-custom nil &#x27;thisweek)) 
 But it does not fill the CLOCKSUM_W column that I added. Any idea on what I could try?

                              <span>I updated emacs today and reinstalled all packages and magit seems to be broken. When installing normally from melpa I get this error when launching magit-status:
 &#x60;&#x60; The &quot;git-commit.el&quot; library is no longer distributed as a separate package. It is now distributed as part of themagit&#x27; package.
 The git-commit&#x27; package now does nothing but display this warning. If it is located earlier on theload-path&#x27; than magit&#x27; is, then that prevents the proper &quot;git-commit.el&quot; libraries frommagit&#x27; from being loaded.
 Please uninstalling git-commit&#x27; and then restart Emacs. &#x60;&#x60;
 So, I go ahead and remove git-commit package with package-delete and after restarting Emacs I get the following on the Messages buffer:
  Unable to activate package ‘magit’. Required package ‘git-commit-4.0.0’ is unavailable 
 Is this some kind of chicken and egg problem? anybody experiencing this?
  
Ok, found the issue!
 The version of magit on nongnu is old, the new version is only on melpa, so, if you have this configuration magit will fail:
  (setq package-archives &#x27;((&quot;melpa&quot; . &quot;https://melpa.org/packages/&quot;) (&quot;stable&quot; . &quot;https://stable.melpa.org/packages/&quot;) (&quot;gnu&quot; . &quot;https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/&quot;) (&quot;nongnu&quot; . &quot;https://elpa.nongnu.org/nongnu/&quot;))) (customize-set-variable &#x27;package-archive-priorities &#x27;((&quot;gnu&quot; . 99) (&quot;nongnu&quot; . 80) (&quot;stable&quot; . 70) (&quot;melpa&quot; . 0))) 
 If melpa is configured to have a higher priority than nongnu then everything works...

                              <span>I am editing some files where if there is a change in a particular region, I am happy to commit all the changes there without inspecting them easily.
 The files are GUI design text files where items are outlined and nested underneath their parent containers, so if there is change somewhere, all I need is to go the outermost applicable parent and commit all the hunks there automatically.
 Not collapsing could result in large unmodified regions appearing in the display, but I&#x27;m happy for them to be shown if it helped keep my bearings within the file.
 It would also help if the line numbers where also displayed instead of the diff line number markers.
 I could also open the original file on the side, possible with diff-hl-mode or some other such plugin to help.

 According to the manual, you can make a &quot;datetree&quot; capture template ((file+olp+datetree &quot;filename&quot; [ &quot;Level 1 heading&quot; ...])), which works great, but I&#x27;d like to customise it for my use - I&#x27;d like it to align with my university schedule.
 Ideally, I&#x27;d like to have one heading per university week (starting at ISO week ~40 for this semester - so I&#x27;d like ISO&#x27;s W40 to be my Week 1), then one sub-heading per day. How would I go about doing this? Is there a way to create my own datetree type, or do I have to write my own capture template function? If I need to do it all myself, are there any guides/examples I can follow?

                              <span>I&#x27;m using the official Android port of Emacs using the companion Termux application for several month now.
 In summary, this setup allows you to obtain the full Emacs experience, with deep Android integration (e.g., resizing or navigating using the touchscreen), and leveraging Termux application sharing (i.e., Emacs can access all Termux installed binaries, such as git).
 In my daily usage, I successfully use org-agenda (and org features in general, e.g., refilling), dired, magit, eshell. Even the image viewer is working! My dotfiles are synchronized leveraging Syncthing between my Android phone and my computer, so it&#x27;s a breeze to configure.
 Did you know it was possible? Does anyone tried it successfully or had troubles?
 Here are a few screenshots:

                              <span>I just made the switch from Neovim a few weeks ago and I started using u/Nicolas-Rougier&#x27;s nano-emacs distribution. (Love the distribution btw &quot;) &#x27;god-local-mode) (define-key god-local-mode-map (kbd &quot;i&quot;) &#x27;god-local-mode) (god-mode)) (define-key global-map (kbd &quot;C-x r f&quot;) &#x27;recentf) (define-key global-map (kbd &quot;C-c c&quot;) &#x27;org-capture) (define-key global-map (kbd &quot;C-c a&quot;) &#x27;nano-agenda) (define-minor-mode divine-mode nil :global t :group &#x27;nano :lighter &quot; DiVine&quot; :keymap (list (cons (kbd &quot;C-S-h&quot;) (kbd &quot;C-h&quot;)) (cons (kbd &quot;C-h&quot;) (kbd &quot;C-b&quot;)) (cons (kbd &quot;C-j&quot;) (kbd &quot;C-n&quot;)) (cons (kbd &quot;C-k&quot;) (kbd &quot;C-p&quot;)) (cons (kbd &quot;C-l&quot;) (kbd &quot;C-f&quot;)))) 
 The thing I&#x27;m looking for is the ability to do something like &quot;Make C-j perform whatever function C-n does in the currently active major+minor modes&quot;. Also, since C-h is being rebound, I would like to rebind the help prefix key to C-S-h and so on for all the keys that I&#x27;m rebinding.
 Is something like this possible?

 (add-hook &#x27;before-save-hook (lambda () (when (and (boundp &#x27;eglot--managed-mode) eglot--managed-mode) (eglot-format))))
 but it doesn&#x27;t seem to even trigger the hook unfortunately. Can anybody please share a working snippet of this actually functioning? (Even a plugin that does this would be fine, I&#x27;ve tried emacs-format-all-the-code, but it&#x27;s not to my liking. I want something that calls eglot-format)
 Thank you so much for the help!!

                              <span>Hello to all, my config having reached a non-trivial length, I&#x27;m wondering what you guys use to manage your complex config ?
 On my side, I currently use a single file with outline-mode sections /sub-sections, but I&#x27;m feeling frustrated and considering switching to multiples files. This is mainly because I spend more time programming than note taking/config editing, so I&#x27;m having trouble building muscle memory for outline / org navigation. 
 What do you use and why ?

                              <span>I was just curious how folks are feeling these days about Reddit alternatives. I&#x27;ve been enjoying Lemmy, personally, and I find that for technical stuff in particular the communities are definitely growing, feeling less ghost-town-ish little by little.
 Haskell-wise, it seems like https://programming.dev/c/haskell has the most subscribers (see, e.g. this search on lemmy explorer), but is definitely still a ghost town. (And https://programming.dev/c/functional_programming is slightly less than a ghost town.)
 Philosophically, I&#x27;m very much in favor of Lemmy, or basically any other more &quot;open&quot; alternative to Reddit. But I get the challenges of hoisting and moving an entire community who all is here for different reasons, have different ideas, etc.
 By the way, people discussed this at length in these two posts a little over a year ago, which makes for good reading:
  
https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/146d3jz/rhaskell_and_the_recent_news_regarding_reddit/
 https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/14dqllb/vote_on_the_future_of_rhaskell/
  
There were plenty of folks in favor of jumping ship (whether to Lemmy or Discourse), but it seems that inertia may have won out, as it often does.
 How are folks feeling these days? Has Discourse filled the gap? Was it simply easier to keep on with Reddit? Anyone out there still pine for a different platform for discussion?

                              <span>So, I ended up writing
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; -- Comma Separated Tuple newtype CST a &#x3D; CST (a,a)
 instance Show a &#x3D;&gt; Show (CST a) where show (CST (a,b)) &#x3D; show a ++ &quot;,&quot; ++ show b instance Read a &#x3D;&gt; Read (CST a) where readPrec &#x3D; parens $ do a &lt;- readPrec Punc &quot;,&quot; &lt;- lexP b &lt;- readPrec return $ CST (a, b) 
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 How does Punc &quot;,&quot; &lt;- lexP even work? How is it that, I am able to control the behaviour of lexP by mentioning a value on the left side &lt;-? It feels like pattern matching in the works here, but I can&#x27;t explain it completely.

 I&#x27;ve tried going to https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/ and entered the command &quot;curl --proto &#x27;&#x3D;https&#x27; --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://get-ghcup.haskell.org | sh&quot; in the terminal. 
 When I tried entering &quot;ghc -- version&quot; like the website instructed me to, it said &quot;zsh: command not found: ghc&quot;. Why is this not working for me?

                              <span>It would appear by looking at SimpleX Chat github repo, the haskell backend can be used for the SimpleX Android, iOS and desktop app. Is this the case with Haskell?
 I do not know Haskell but how does it compare to other multiplatform frameworks like Dart/Flutter for making and deploying mobile and desktop apps?
 Can Haskell be uses to make front ends on desktop or mobile, or only back ends?

                              <span>Hi all. I have what I hope is a simple issue but it&#x27;s been really annoying me. I use the arrow keys all the time and, until recently, it was fine. However, sometime in the last several months (maybe a year?) ctl-left and ctl-right don&#x27;t do anything in my Linux (Centos 7) emacs (29.1 build 2). They don&#x27;t even show a key has been pressed with ctl-h k. However, chords like shift-ctl-left/right work just fine!
 Note: I access Linux via ETX remote desktop from my Macbook.
 I checked xev and Linux is seeing the keys. I also tried 29.1 (emacsformacosx.com) on my Macbook Pro M1 and it works fine. Any ideas? I&#x27;m pretty fuzzy on stuff like xmodmap. Haven&#x27;t had to mess with that for many years.
 Thanks for any pointer!

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been using elfeed and elfeed+org for about 3 years. In that time my feed count has gone from 0 to ~130 but it has been at ~130 for about the last 2 years. Until very recently (last 2-3 weeks), refreshing the feeds was an operation that took maybe 1-2 minutes but it was fine because I continued to be able to use Emacs while the operation was in progress. In the last 2 weeks or so that changed: now when I refresh the feeds Emacs becomes unusable for maybe as long as 3-4 minutes. As in even receiving keyboard input for M-x commands is unreliable. 
 I&#x27;m curious if anyone else has seen this behavior? And perhaps has identified a root cause? And a fix?
 Relevant info:
 - I do and have always run emacs-next from guix which currently sits at 30.6.0.
 - I run the latest elfeed and elfeed-org updated approx weekly via straight.el and then, about year ago, via elpaca.
 - I have always run elfeed with the default value for elfeed-use-curl (t).
 - My workstation is fairly beefy: 24 x i5s with lots of RAM. 
 thx
 EDIT: I&#x27;ve recently started running the profiler during elfeed refreshes to see if it might point me in a useful direction. So far, nothing.

                              <span>Okay, I have been looking for an answer for this for a couple hours now and cannot seem to find a sensible answer. I would like to download some class packages such as &quot;turabian-researchpaper&quot; from CTAN and then use them in an org doc which I can then export to LaTeX. I am coming from Rmarkdown, in which this was trivial: just put the class where LaTeX can find it and then call out the class in arbitrary LaTeX code within the .rmd file. However, with Emacs, this does not work.
 I figured out that you have to use an instance of (add-to-list &#x27;org-latex-classes ...) followed by some specifications for that class so that ox-latex can parse it. But I have only found examples of how to add common classes like report or book, not custom classes and downloaded classes. Is there some way to general…</span>

                              <span>I have finally completed the Emacs Writing Studio (EWS) book. This book explains how to research, write and publish with Emacs and was completely written using the EWS configuration.
 The e-book version is available for most e-reader bookshops. The source files for the book (full text) and the configuration files are freely available on GitHub.
 It has been great working on this project with help of the community. I hope this project can attract some new Emacs users.
 Next step is an enhanced second edition and publish a paperback version.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve noticed that some Zettelkasten practitioners use special symbols like &quot;!&quot; or &quot;§&quot; at the start of their Zettel file names, placed before the Zettel ID (e.g., &quot;§ YYYYMMDDHHmm&quot;). While I understand that these symbols can affect the sorting order of digital files, I&#x27;m curious about their specific usage within the Zettelkasten method, particularly when using apps like The Archive.
My main questions are:
I’d love to hear how others use these symbols or why you might choose not to use them.</span>

                              <span>The year is 2022, and after a long journey I arrive in the country I have been longing for. It&#x27;s the 2nd of March and I&#x27;ve been on solid ground for a long time. It&#x27;s not far from the beach to the next big settlement. Forum Zettelkasten is written on a big sign at the entrance to the village.
The street is a hive of activity. The people here seem very friendly and open. Small groups have formed on many corners, chatting animatedly. I approached them to listen to some of their conversations. They noticed me and greeted me warmly.
Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t understand their language. Some words sound familiar, others are completely new to me. Now I&#x27;m standing right next to them. The word Zettel is repeated several times - the word I had already read on the big sign. I try to say it in my own language. They don&#x27;t seem to understand me either.
Luckily I always have a piece of paper and a pencil with me when I&#x27;m out and about. I draw a few lines and some symbols. The joy is great. The others also know this way of communicating with strangers.
What does your journey look like? Do you have a map [1]? Where are you travelling from?

                              <span>Hello,
 We&#x27;re proud to release Helenus for Scala 3!
 Helenus is collection of Scala utilities for Apache Cassandra. Its goal is to make interacting with Cassandra easier, in a type-safe manner, while trying to avoid introducing a complex API.
 Most of the API stays the same as its Scala 2 counterpart, the only notable difference is how typeclasses are derived. Whereas in Scala 2 for a case class we&#x27;d do RowMapper[Hotel] in Scala 3 we can do case class Hotel(...) derives RowMapper.
 In future releases we hope to get these APIs much closer by providing similar methods.

                              <span>In my company, we use a code versioning system that heavily uses symlinks. Specifically: say I am in directory foo, and I modify bar.c. I can access the original bar.c in foo/.c_path/bar.c
 I like eMacs diff, so I open the file in .c_path and do ediff-buffers so I can review my changes. This requires opening the file, positioning the original file on the left, updated file on the right and then m-x edify-buffers. I have set ediff-split-window-function to split-window-sensibly
 I do this often, so I would love to automate this workflow. I’m not sure how to begin though - any suggestions?

                              <span>I opened up my package manager, and I got this cryptic message:
  Failed to verify signature archive-contents.sig: No public key for 645357D2883A0966 created at 2024-08-30T14:05:05-0700 using EDDSA Command output: gpg: Signature made 08/30/24 14:05:05 Pacific Daylight Time gpg: using EDDSA key 0327BE68D64D9A1A66859F15645357D2883A0966 gpg: Can&#x27;t check signature: No public key 
 When I look at where I am fetching packages from:
  &#x27;(package-archives (quote ( (&quot;gnu&quot; . &quot;http://elpa.gnu.org/packages/&quot;) (&quot;melpa&quot; . &quot;http://melpa.org/packages/&quot;) (&quot;melpa-stable&quot; . &quot;http://stable.melpa.org/packages/&quot;) ) )) 
 Commenting out the &quot;gnu&quot; line seems to make the loading error go away, but then there are tons of packages I can&#x27;t install, I guess because their dependencies are in the gnu repository.
 This is on &quot;GNU Emacs 28.2 (build 2, x86_64-w64-mingw32) of 2022-09-13&quot;.
 Any ideas? Any pointers for where I might look for clues about this?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been using evil for a few years but it never really &quot;clicked&quot; and I only ever used the main keybindings. I&#x27;m trying out Meow, since hopefully it will be more configurable, and the object-verb structure might be easier for me, and I like that you don&#x27;t have to define your own separate keybindings for every new package.
 I&#x27;m wondering if there are any guides for setting up leader-key and local-leader stuff with meow? I know that keypad mode is great for entering normal keybindings without cords, but I&#x27;m wondering how to add special keybindings to keypad mode?
  
Is there a way to have a &quot;local-leader&quot; key, like &quot;,&quot; which is the equivalent of doing &quot;C-c&quot;, so I can have a separate way to input mode-specific commands?
 How can I bind specific commands to key sequences in keypad/leader mode? e.g. I want &quot;SPC SPC&quot; to be like M-x, &quot;SPC b b&quot; to bring up the buffer menu, &quot;SPC w d&quot; to delete a window, etc. How can I do this kind of specific bindings for local-leader commands? But for everything I haven&#x27;t defined, I want to default to the usual meow-keypad stuff.
 Are there any configs/packages that are like evil-surround? Or embrace configs for meow?
 Are there any meow configs for LaTeX mode, for e.g. surrounding in commands and such?

                              <span>I have something on the order of 120 RSS/atom feeds for blogs, podcasts, YouTube channels. Since I started using Elfeed a few years ago, I&#x27;ve use cURL (i.e. had elfeed-use-curl set to t) as the feed-fetching function, but despite various tweaks (including some suggested here) updating elfeed always took at least 2 minutes, on average something like 4 minutes. And it would be quite resource intensive: CPU usage would jump up and my laptop fans would immediately start whirring.
    
 Recently, I tried to debug an issue relating to a podcast feed that kept failing to update, no matter how long I set elfeed-curl-timeout. I&#x27;d get the error (56) Failure in receiving network data. Going to a terminal and manually downloading the feed with cURL worked fine.
    
 I decided to switch elfeed-use-curl to nil to see if something was an issue. And incredibly, I found that the troublesome feed almost instantly updated. Updating all my feeds took a lot longer with much less resource usage.
    
 So ... is there possibly something else going on here, or is cURL less performant than url-retrieve, at least for large numbers of feeds? Can anyone else verify this?

                              <span>A good while ago I implemented a splay tree in elisp. It&#x27;s been serving me well and I&#x27;m curious what people think of it and/or if anyone else may have a use for it. The code is currently part of a package with another purpose, but is package agnostic and doesn&#x27;t depend on anything else in the package (or on anything outside of standard elisp constructs for that matter).
 My use case for it has been to keep track of token positions in buffers and efficiently determine the context for which to provide code intelligence. I needed an efficient data-structure that accommodates for localized &quot;hot&quot; access zones and doesn&#x27;t use an insane amount of memory. 
 I&#x27;d like to tell a little bit about my rationale and how it came to be. Initially, I tried to use hash tables. But a requirement for determini…</span>

                              <span>I messed up when first installing it, so it wants ghc 9.6.4, but I quickly realized I wanted the latest version of the stack lts (22.33 with ghc 9.6.6). No matter how many times I clean or reinstall, the kernel on vs code still wants 9.6.4 but it finds 9.6.6. My ghc version on path is 9.6.6 and it works. Apparently hlint is not found, so I want to make it work as well. Thanks in advance.

                              <span>I tried to ask this question in a language-agnostic way here, and I&#x27;m actually using ReScript (a dialect of OCaml focused on the JavaScript ecosystem). But since the Haskell community probably has more experience with recursion schemes, I&#x27;m also asking here.
 In short, I&#x27;m writing a multi-stage compiler for a toy language, and I want to simplify folding and transforming my ASTs.
 Recursion schemes are perfect for this, but to use them I need to first &quot;functorialize&quot; my AST type, and then recover the concrete type by wrapping it into Fix. In ReScript syntax it looks like this:
 // &quot;Functorialized&quot; AST to allow recursion schemes inject custom data in place of nodes type exprF &#x3D; Id(string) | Int(int) | Call(exprF, exprF) // Concrete expression type of arbitrary depth. // We add an extra wrapper to avoid defining it like &#x27;type expr &#x3D; exprF&#x27;, // which would be self-referential and rejected by the compiler. type rec expr &#x3D; Fix(exprF) 
 The problem is, of course, that I now need to insert that Fix wrapper everywhere when constructing expressions or pattern-matching on them:
 let testData &#x3D; Fix(Call( Fix(Id(&quot;square&quot;)), Fix(Int(5)) ) 
 Is there a way to avoid doing this, or at least automate it? Does it require specific language features, like Haskell&#x27;s HKTs or OCaml&#x27;s [@@unboxed]?
 I&#x27;d appreciate any thoughts! There is a full example of defining a catamorphism recursion scheme in my linked post.

 I have created a new module as below to do some test, in function rdwr an Eff is created for both Reader and Writer requests, then function runServer will be run to interpret the Eff created by rdwr.
 The function runServer is a composition of run, runWriter and runReader -- each of them handles specific Eff request and run handles pure result.
 As you can see in function rdwr, first two expressions are Writer requests, then a Reader request, and then another Writer request. Since the first two requests are Writer request but runWriter is the second handler so this line of function handleRelay

 I’m reaching out because I’ve hit a wall after spending 7.5 hours debugging what seemed like a straightforward issue but turned out to be a rabbit hole. I’ve been working on customizing org-agenda export to PDF and initially thought my problem was related to ox-texinfo. I spent half the night tweaking my Emacs configuration, digging through documentation, and adjusting settings in hopes of resolving the issue. I went down a lot of wrong paths before realizing that org-store-agenda-views doesn’t actually call ox-texinfo. That was my first mistake—not diving into the source code earlier.
 Turns out, the function calls org-agenda-write, which in turn executes something entirely different:

                              <span>Near the end of the talk that introduces Shapeless 3, it&#x27;s mentioned that shapeless3.typeable.Typeable is probably going to be removed because there&#x27;s too much overlap with scala.reflect.Typeable. One feature that&#x27;s unique to the Shapeless variant is the ability to convert a type to a string. If that&#x27;s going to be removed, is there a more canonical way to do it in Scala 3? I haven&#x27;t seen a way to do it with mirrors, but maybe I haven&#x27;t looked hard enough. Rolling my own solution with macros is of course one somewhat cumbersome possibility.

                              <span>I asked this question in the Rust sub too.
 I needed to ask this question here too.
 Looking into the current and future job market is actually important. So what do you think about the job market for both languages in the next 2-3 or 5 years?

                              <span>Let&#x27;s say I have the following:
 trait Super { val a: Int val b: Boolean val c: Double } case class A extends Super case class B extends Super case class C extends Super case class D extends Super ... object Foo { def foo[T &lt;: Super](bar: T): T } 
 let&#x27;s assume T is an arbitrary case class with the attributes in Super and I want to be able to mutate those 3 fields in Foo.foo (by creating new instances with the mutated field). Assume I&#x27;m not in control of Super (it comes from a 3-rd party lib).
 Is there any way I can use the copy method available in case classes to mutate those 3 attributes? I have read copy is something the scala compiler creates on the fly and it is not really possible to override (doesn&#x27;t come from Product or anything else). Any reasonable alternative to copy (or any way I can use copy?
 I thought about an implicit class over Super and adding a method to mutate it via copy, but it being a trait it does not have a copy method. I could create a new instance of Super with one or more of the fields mutated (as in new Super {...}), but that would force me to down-cast to one of the child case classes right after.

                              <span>I’ve been using company mode with lsp for C++ and Rust for a while. It worked fine. I use this on both Windows and Linux. Last week suddenly the completions became unusably slow on Windows. It stutters after every character. Completely unusable. This is now an issue with both Rust and C++ projects. Seems to be independent of the project size, as small projects are just as bad. Everything is fine on Linux.
 I am guessing it is some update, or some silly change in the environment. Anyone have any ideas? I tried updating packages, I upgraded to Emacs 29.4, updating windows. Nothing helped. Any suggestions for fixing this are super appreciated!

 I&#x27;ve been using Emacs since 1983 and I spend most of my day in it; I think I qualify as an extreme power user. I just went through my init file carefully. It&#x27;s only a few screens long, and 95% of it consists of stuff like:
  (setq-default indent-tabs-mode nil) (setq-default major-mode &#x27;text-mode) (setq-default fill-column 70) (setq-default show-trailing-whitespace t) 
 or
  (global-hl-line-mode) 
 or
  (global-set-key &quot;\C-cz&quot; &#x27;compile) 
 Mostly I just use the defaults and things work fine. The file is not filled with complicated elisp code that requires deep understanding of the language, it&#x27;s j…</span>

 Here are the only Tramp settings i&#x27;m using: 
 (require &#x27;tramp)
 (setq tramp-ssh-controlmaster-options (format &quot;-i %s&quot; &quot;~/.ssh/privatekey.pem&quot;))
 (setq tramp-default-method &quot;ssh&quot;) 
 I&#x27;m able to enter the server with the private key set this way, but if i try to to use sudo, i get &#x27;permission denied (publickey)&#x27; error.
 I&#x27;ve tried different commands:
 (find-file &quot;/ssh:ubuntu@123.23.1.22|sudo::/&quot;)
 (find-file &quot;/ssh:ubuntu@123.23.1.22|sudo:ubuntu:/&quot;)
 (find-file &quot;/ssh:ubuntu@123.23.1.22|sudo:ubuntu@123.23.1.22:/&quot;)
 (find-file &quot;/sudo:ubuntu@123.23.1.22:/&quot;)
 Also tried to use &#x27;tramp-revert-buffer-with-sudo&#x27; with these parameters &#x27;(add-to-list &#x27;tramp-default-user-alist &#x27;(&quot;sudo&quot; &quot;123.23.1.22&quot; &quot;root&quot;))&#x27; and without them. Nothing helps.

                              <span>Title basically has it. I learned the hard way that Emacs has no regex lokkahead / lookbehind.
 I would like to replace every occurenc of &quot;typ&quot;, which is not followed by and [e] with &quot;Typ&quot;.
 I can do a regex-search for typ[^e] but when I use that, the fourth character is captured, thus a replace C-s M-r Typ[^e] M-% Typ will erroneouly replace typId as Typd (deleting the [I]) as it is captured.
 Without lookahead, behind, what is the Emacs way?

Enhanced connectivity with other tools; through custom configuration, notes generated by org-zettel-ref-mode can be saved in denote or org-roam format
 
Added quick markup functionality; after highlighting a paragraph in the source file, you can launch &#x3D;org-zettel-quick-markup&#x3D; to quickly add bold, italic, underline, and other markups to the highlighted text
 
 See the new version on Github.
 Are there anybody has questions?

 Question as stated in the title - does elisp allow creation of aliases for specual forms, e.g. &quot;my_let&quot; to be parsed as standard &quot;let&quot;?
 Basically I&#x27;m looking for possibility to swap any text, kind of &quot;define&quot; equivalent in #c.
 Many thanks in advance to comminity for any help!

I set up a new machine this week and noticed org mode now has a directory called org-persist, but I can&#x27;t find any docs telling me whether this should go under source control or not.
 So, does anyone know if I should be storing org-persist in source control?

                              <span>I have pushed the first commit of a small Scala library that I used for several projects, and may be useful to someone else.
 If you ever need to use geographical points (with latitude and longitude) directly as keys you need to start playing some games as coordinates are floats, besides you sometimes want to aggregate with a certain resolution but later you may need a different one.
 I want to use modern libraries, and all the benefits of Scala 3, ergonomic is important too. I love the fact that Latitudes and Longitudes can not be swapped accidentally and all those little things.
 My biggest concern right now is that there many pieces (neotype, squats, Scalaz, even Cats) and maybe this can be simplified using Zio Prelude.
 It can be found here https://github.com/sisamon/geodesy_scala_3
 And this is the beginning of it, if you do not mind taking a look and providing some feedback I will appreciate it!

                              <span>Yet another SQL library, for scala 3.
 https://sake92.github.io/squery/index.html
 How is it different from others?
  
raw SQL with a string interpolator, thin layer above JDBC, no DSLs
 synchronous only, no Future/IO/F[_] stuff
 context function used to propagate connection/transaction
 handling results is name-based unlike some other libraries. So you don&#x27;t have to do tuples and _1, _2.. easy to make mistakes 
 composition is used for JOINs, so it’s much easier to extract the values
 has some nice helper functions for mapping flat results to structured objects
 
 has a code generator for table rows and CRUD DAOs. Very quick to get started
  
Mostly inspired by https://index.scala-lang.org/jodersky/simplesql and Doobie of course.

                              <span>We have shown the benefits of using a shared build cache
as well as using remote build execution (RBE) to offload builds to a remote
build farm. Our customers are interested in leveraging RBE to improve developer
experience and reduce continuous integration (CI) run times, giving us an
opportunity to learn all aspects of deploying different RBE solutions. I would
like to share how one can deploy one of them, Buildbarn, and
secure all communications in it.

What is it and why do we care?
We want developers to be productive. Being productive requires spending as
little time as possible waiting for build/test feedback, not having to switch
to a different task while the build is running.

Remote caching
One part of achieving this is to never build the same thing twice. Tools like

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I&#x27;d like to share a new paper we just published that explains how we are bringing statically typed logic programming into Haskell. You can find the paper at: https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20240010266
 https://preview.redd.it/bqorqqc63hld1.png?width&#x3D;800&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;90e2c3d4c6f0d93efebdfcb42192ca70fb79a781
 This approach uses extensible types, a design pattern based on higher kinds, and makes it possible to replace any portion of a value of an algebraic datatype with a logic variable. Here&#x27;s the abstract:
  
ABSTRACT
 Logic programming allows structuring code in terms of predicates or relations, rather than functions. Although logic programming languages present advantages in terms of declarativeness and conciseness, the introduction of static types has not become …</span>

                              <span>pipes-safe is designed to bring resource management and exception handling to the pipes ecosystem, but I can&#x27;t get it to work in the simplest of cases. If I&#x27;m using the normal Control.Exception ecosystem and I throw an exception, I can both run a finalizer and catch the exception:
 controlException :: IO () controlException &#x3D; do ref  controlException Left MyEx GOOD: Finalizer ran 
 but if I try the same with pipes-safe the finalizer doesn&#x27;t run:
 pipesSafe :: IO () pipesSafe &#x3D; runSafeT $ runEffect $ do ref  pipesSafe Left MyEx BAD! Finalizer failed to run 
 Am I making a silly error here?

                              <span>Anduril Industries is once again hiring Haskell engineers to work on electromagnetic warfare products. This is a unique opportunity to use Haskell to implement high performance applications in an embedded setting. Anduril has adopted Nix at large and we use IOG&#x27;s generously maintained Haskell.nix project to build all of our Haskell code and ship it to thousands of customer assets across the globe. If you have Haskell experience and are interested in any of:
  
Software defined radios
 
Digital signal processing
 
Numerical computing
 
FPGAs
 
Linux drivers/systems programming
 
Nix/Nixpkgs/NixOS
 
Dhall
 
 please do drop me a line at [travis@anduril.com](mailto:travis@anduril.com), and please also submit your application to our online portal here: https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/andurilindustries/jobs/4460811007?gh_jid&#x3D;4460811007
 To tackle a few common questions:
  
Yes, Anduril is an American defense technology company. We build weapons systems for the United States and its allies.
 
This is a _Haskell_ role. It is not a bait and switch. We are writing applications in GHC Haskell, not some homegrown Haskell-like language or some other programming language. That said, knowledge of C, Rust, or Typescript would be a valuable differentiating factor, as we often rub elbows with codebases that use these languages as well.
 
This is an on-site role at Anduril headquarters in Costa Mesa, California. Our team is building software for hardware products, so physical presence in our RF lab is often required throughout the course of software development and testing. Remote work would only be considered for candidates with something extraordinary to offer to our team.
 
 I&#x27;d be happy to answer any other questions in the thread below.

 and 
 (use-package which-key

 I can set up key bindings for instances using 
 (leader-key &quot;dtm&quot; &#x27;(display-time-mode :which-key &quot;display-time-mode&quot;))
 and this works fine .
 But I am trying to define a function which takes two inputs such as the key-bind and the associated command, and set up the key-bind and assign it to which key. Here is my code 
 (defun my-keybind (kb command)
 (leader-key kb command :which-key (symbol-name command)))
 and want to use
 (my-keybind &quot;dtm&quot; &#x27;display-time-mode)
 But the function is not working, I am not quite sure how to fix it.

                              <span>This is probably only relevant to maybe 2 or 3 people, but I figured I&#x27;d post here in case it&#x27;s one of you.
 I recently rediscovered a small major mode that I had written a while back for dealing with PCGen LST files. This is the data format for PCGen, an open source project similar to HeroLab for building TTRPG characters. At the time, I had to input data for some content that wasn&#x27;t available yet, and I wrote a major mode to make it easier to deal with.
 If anyone is interested, I can pop it up on github to share. It&#x27;s pretty basic - a little bit of keyword highlighting, custom forward/backward -sexp functions, and setting up sane defaults to deal with essentially a TSV file with very long lines.It could almost certainly be expanded/improved, but it got the job done for me at the time.
 Anyhow, if you&#x27;re interested, let me know and I&#x27;ll make it available.

                              <span>Hello, 
 I am new to Emacs, and I frequently forget keybindings, so I often need to search for them by describing what they do. I use C-h d (apropos-documentation) for this purpose, but I find that searching on Google for specific tasks is usually faster. For example, when I was trying to find the mark-whole-buffer command using keywords like &quot;mark all region,&quot; I couldn&#x27;t find the information I needed. Instead I was getting a big chunk of irrelevant documentation. Am I using the approach incorrectly? 
 I would appreciate hearing about your experience.

 This is cute. Wonder if there&#x27;s anything like this for Emacs. Would be curious how fast some of you keyboard navigator wizards are. And compared to a VIM user.

                              <span>Hello there. Finale (music notation software) just died and I remembered how fast I was inputing notes with it. I thought it would be possible to have an input mode in emacs that emulate input mode in software like Finale, Sibelius, and so on, but writing LilyPond code. For instance, when in this mode, numbers select the duration, enter enters a note with this duration. Arrows up and down increase or decrease a half tone, etc. What do you think? Anybody interested?

                              <span>I swear this used to work and I&#x27;m baffled why it stopped.
 I&#x27;m using lsp-mode with company. The company completions do show function arguments, but when I pick a completion candidate, only the function name is inserted and the arguments are not. It used to be that the function name and arguments are inserted as a yasnippet-like snippet and I could fill out the arguments one by one using .
 I&#x27;m using: * lsp-mode 20240823.746, Emacs 29.4, gnu/linux * company version 0.10.2 * I&#x27;m also using company-posframe and company-prescient if that helps. * company-backends is buffer-local: ((company-capf company-dabbrev-code company-keywords company-yasnippet company-files :separate)) * lsp-enable-snippet is t * yasnippet version 20240406.1314 * lsp-clients-clangd-args: (&quot;--limit-results&#x3D;0&quot; &quot;--limit-references&#x3D;0&quot; &quot;--inlay-hints&quot; &quot;--function-arg-placeholders&quot; &quot;--background-index&quot; &quot;--pch-storage&#x3D;disk&quot; &quot;--malloc-trim&quot; &quot;-j&#x3D;8&quot; &quot;--header-insertion&#x3D;iwyu&quot; &quot;--completion-style&#x3D;detailed&quot; &quot;--clang-tidy&quot; &quot;--all-scopes-completion&quot; &quot;--header-insertion-decorators&quot; &quot;--header-insertion-decorators&#x3D;0&quot;)
 Any help would be appreciated, thank you.
 EDIT: I&#x27;m using clangd and this is where it&#x27;s broken. I tested with a Rust buffer using rust-analyzer and it works.
 SOLVED: I just replaced clangd with ccls and it works.

 i am trying to combine both the buffer local tabs and the predefined list but it seems its out of my expertise

 The default face uses a monospaced font which is the same returned by (frame-parameter nil &#x27;font), so minibuffer messages aren&#x27;t using either the default face or frame&#x27;s default one.
 Where is the face for minibuffer messages stored? Thank you.

                              <span>I use org-drill for spaced repetition drilling, and often when doing a review session, during a question I think of something I&#x27;d like to follow up on later. Maybe add a new question, or investigate something related, or...whatever. Just some note to do later.
 The drill mode is extremely agressive about capturing all keystrokes, so if it&#x27;s waiting for the user to hit a key and then ask me how well I did, I really can&#x27;t do anything else with emacs. And of course I want to make these notes in emacs, and not switch over to some other editor like some kind of barbarian. :)
 Is there any way I can escape or bypass or otherwise allow myself to make notes during a drill session? 
 Ideally, I&#x27;d like something where the drill session only &quot;takes over&quot; the relevant buffer, but still allows other windows and for the user to switch to/from the drill buffer/session.
 Then I could have two windows, one with my drill session running, and during the session if I think of a note, I switch to the other buffer, make my note, and switch back and do more drill stuff.
 EDIT: as /u/queyenth points out, just doing e from the drill prompt lets you escape out of the drill prompt. The idea is to edit the question, but you can do off and do whatever you like, and then just do org-drill-resume and it, well, resumes exactly where you left off.
 So, the solution is: when I&#x27;m looking at a drill question and my ADHD brain spews a bunch of related things and I need to get them out of my head or I&#x27;ll forget them:
  
Do e, which org-drill says means &quot;edit&quot; but to me means &quot;escape the very agressive drill prompt&quot;.
 
Make notes, play Tetris, deflect cosmic rays to flip bits on my hard drive, etc.
 
Do org-drill-resume.

                              <span>To my understanding and for my use case, vscode-json-languageserver seems to be the most promising language server.
 According to the link, the language server supports formatting, renaming, completion using JSON Schema. Eglot seems to follow a conservative approach concerning LS features and none seems to work out of the box.
 For example when I open the Eglot menu, Find definitions, find references, Find type definiton all is greyed out.
 If point is on a sympol and I call M-x eglot-rename I am prompted to rename the identifier but after RET I get the error eglot--error: [eglot] Unsupported or ignored LSP capability &#x60;:renameProvider&#x27;
 I didn&#x27;t configure Eglot at all. I am also using the gopls LS for Golang development, didn&#x27;t configure anything either and featuers &quot;just work&quot;. Not so for vscode-json-languageserver. Here is my init.el
 Does anyone have a working example how Eglot needs to be configured to use at least a subset of this LS features?

                              <span>Holy dromedary. I spent hours trying to figure out why the heck Emacs for some reason would get stuck while I try to go to the next line, forcing me to press the key again and again.
 Ran the profiler a bunch of times, tried disabling modes, opened larger and smaller files, went through the git log, installed different versions of Emacs, switched machines and tried some other things. After two days of frustration, I noticed the problem worsening. As it turns out, a minuscule speck of dust was lodged in my key-well. Blast it! With Emacs, there&#x27;s almost always some bizarre shit, and the immediate knee-jerk reaction to anything unusual is to assume that it&#x27;s broken. Emacs is good, and Emacs is never broken (unless when it is 😀).
 Talk about confirmation bias.

 What&#x27;s the right way for title and heading? Depending on what style I use, I may get a duplicate heading or seeing table of contents in the weird place, or so.
 Option1:
 #+TITLE: title some text * Heading 1 content ** Heading 2 some others 
 Option2:
 #+TITLE: title * title some text ** Heading 1 content *** Heading 2 some others 
 Option3:
 #+TITLE: title * Overview some text * Heading 1 content ** Heading 2 some others

                              <span>Hi everyone.  I&#x27;ve mentioned a few times how an important purpose of my ZK is to help me write a personal/family history.  This has been an ongoing project in my ZK for 3-4 years.  The process so far has been:
Simply writing zettels on random topics of interest to me or based on memories that pop into my head randomly (or prompted by a conversation with a friend).  That continued for about three years without me doing much to integrate the information.  I was content to build my database, which had grown to about 400 zettels.
This year, I got a kick in the pants from a daughter who knew what I was doing and gave me a Christmas present in the form of a service called Storyworth.  Since then, I have been writing longer, more coherent stories.  Every week, I get a question, and I respond with…</span>

How would you incorporate photos into your zk?
I&#x27;d like to take 4x6 prints and incorporate them.  Would you use a photo editing program to put in the reference number or would you use a sleeve?

                              <span>Hello everyone,
Am new to the method, so naturally am still exploring its intents and purposes. I&#x27;ve decided to start using it for my research on courses about machine learning applied to geology, machine learning itself or geology itself. I&#x27;m used to writing stuff down linearly in my paper notebook - not only am accostumed to it, but I also feel pretty good doing so. It makes more sense to me, I guess, to jolt down in a notebook something thorough and linear as a course, more sense than writing atomic notes at least. I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m &quot;stuck to the hold habits&quot; or that&#x27;s actually somewhat the way to go. I wanted to try Zettelkasten to be more dynamic in my note-writing, as well as faster - for as much as I like and absorb better on paper, I roughly take one hour per page. Insanity.
My &quot;notes&quot; in my notebook are more of a summary of the thing I am consuming than simplified notes per se; I like to make them so that when I need to check the subject in the future once it is forgotten, I will be able to quickly comprehend it again. Which is why I am feeling using the notebook, rather than Zettelkasten, makes more sense.
Or perhaps I can make atomic notes on the subject and link them on an &quot;index&quot; of some sort in my Zettelkasten? An index such as &quot;Course X/Y/Z&quot; with the individual atomic notes?
Thanks for any input.</span>

                              <span>Hello everyone. I developed a small library based on quill, which is written in scala. It allows you to create correct SQL queries during compilation and display them to the user. I originally started this project because there is essentially no runtime overhead compared to the database driver. Although this approach has its problems, such as increased compilation time and sometimes the need to move code to different modules due to stage restrictions. However, I think this is an interesting approach that is worth considering.

 I am writing a client library for NATS topic based messaging. I am trying to define the API implementation through which to interact with the library, along with the data structure of the client. The client will need to 
  
read from a socket to fetch messages (this can be a single sync thread)
 
accept async requests to write messages to the socket, along with updating the client&#x27;s topic router
 
 Question
 I initially started implementing this functionality using the state monad, however this will cause problems as soon as async requests occur (e.g. one thread will be updating the client&#x27;s read messages into a buffer, another will be updating the topic router, overwriting the former changes)
 There appears to be a library for concurrent state, this feels like it could be a solution for my problem, but I wanted to check with those more experienced in Haskell - does this approach make sense, or am I missing a more simple solution? I assume adding more granular concurrency control over each resource would be lead to a more efficient, but more complicated implementation, so I&#x27;d prefer simple for the time being.
 TL;DR
 If I want a data structure that has &#x27;mutable&#x27; state, that will be accessed across threads/async, does the concurrent state library make the most sense?
 Thanks in advance

                              <span>Hey folks! I wrote Scala for nearly 7 years in my full time job as well as side projects. Since then, I&#x27;ve been working on other things and using other languages like Rust/TypeScript/Go, etc.
 I kinda miss Scala a bit though so thinking of coming back after several nearly 4 years long break. It looks like a lot has changed.
 What libraries/ecosystems are y&#x27;all using these days? What&#x27;s popular for HTTP, Database, etc? Back in my day, Doobie and Cats with http4s were considered cool. I&#x27;m wondering what&#x27;s changed.
 I also completely missed out Scala 3 and the transition. Where are we with that now? Is it still true that a lot of people still use Scala 2?

                              <span>After 8 months using emacs as my daily driver I still consider myself an emacs newbie. I came from Vim world (yep, it was preinstalled in my Linux since forever…long story) and after a long research I decided give a try to emacs, with evil package of course… I cannot forget my roots. So why not Doom? recommended for ex-vimers, fast, mature and it ships pretty sane defaults. Ironically the problem is that it does its job just fine! everything is already done, all plugins I can need now or in the future are well configured. But I want more: I want to configure it by myself, to understand elisp code and own my emacs.d, I want minimalism…and I feel I’ve failed.
 Any recommendation? anyone has felt like me? Thank you, this is my first post

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently using doom emacs with WSL. I have been using the (java + lsp) lang package and it has been working well. However, I can&#x27;t seem to get the lsp to work with the javafx libraries (i.e no autocomplete or syntax highlighting). I am also using a the maven build tool. 
 It is my understanding that if you have the javafx dependencies declared in your pom.xml file then it should work? I am aware a thread on this was made a year ago but according to those users it was simply a matter of updating the pom file? I think I&#x27;ve added the javafx dependencies correctly because I can run javafx applications.
 I&#x27;ve ran 
 mvn eclipse:eclipse 
 and generated a .classpath file. I&#x27;ve restarted the lsp server but the issue persists, I&#x27;ve also added this to my config.el file.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been using Emacs for all my (rather limited) text editing and bash scripting needs for years, and am finally getting round to seriously learning c++, partly thanks to the excitement in recent years over things like lsp-mode, eglot and tree-sitter. 
 A quick search through this sub, however, shows frustrated posts every couple of years over emacs&#x27; performance as a c++ ide. My (perhaps optimistic) suspicion is that it&#x27;ll be more than sufficient for my purposes, given that I&#x27;m a long way off from million line codebases and so on, so I probably won&#x27;t need or want full ide functionality for a while. 
 So, assuming that my needs are fairly simplistic, is it reasonable as a beginner programmer learning c++ to be using emacs for (more-or-less) my entire learning environment, or am I missing out in ways I don&#x27;t yet understand? I currently have pdf-tools for reading a textbook in one fullscreen frame on one monitor, and then 2 windows side-by-side on another monitor - the cpp file (or header or makefile or whatever) I&#x27;m editing on one side, and the other side for the output of M-x compile (which I&#x27;ve bound to C-c c) or a M-x shell (bound to C-c s).
 I would love some recommendations for things that I don&#x27;t yet know I&#x27;ll want. For example, syntax highlighting in c++-mode seems good enough so far - do I want to be using c++-ts? If so, is the grammar on the tree-sitter github page the one to use? Do I want ide style features like symbol/definition navigation, corrections, reformatting, completion as you type? Any suggestions for configs focused on those sorts of features? I&#x27;m not a fan of big starter kits like doom, but would love to read other people&#x27;s configs for things that I can apply myself.
 I know this is all a bit vague, so apologies for that. I guess I don&#x27;t really know what I&#x27;m looking for, which is sort of the point. Many thanks for reading this!

                              <span>If you use Orgzly, the Android app for editing Org-style notebooks, take a look at Orgzly Revived.
 It occured to me that the Orgzly app hadn&#x27;t been updated for several years, so I went looking. It turns out that the original project is no-longer maintained, but development is continuing in a fork.

                              <span>My Zettelkasten has been around for about 2.5 years now. After about six months, I had the idea of tidying up the Zettelkasten for the first time. Somehow it bothered me that parts of the box looked very tidy, while others looked quite chaotic.
Initially, my activities to improve this situation were still very sporadic and unsystematic. I lacked a ‘method for tidying up’. But it wasn&#x27;t so easy to find. Even my favourite source ‘How to take smart notes’ by Sönke Ahrens didn&#x27;t help me.
Why don&#x27;t I use Marie Kondo&#x27;s method? She already helps me tidy up my socks. Why can&#x27;t she also improve the situation in my Zettelkasten ? Thought, done: Since 14 May 2023 (create date, Zettelkasten), I have been tidying up using the method.
But I can do even better. Today, while I was tidying up my Zettelkasten, I was offered the note ‘Simplicity’. And Google was kind enough to point me to ‘The Five Elements’ within Feng Shui via ‘The Principle of Clarity’.
And yes, Feng Shui has been identified by scientists and philosophers as both non-scientific and pseudoscientific, and has been described as a paradigmatic example of pseudoscience. But it has helped me to find a different way of looking at my Zettelkasten. Looking at WOOD, FIRE, EARTH, METAL and WATER makes new connections that were invisible without this framework.
I also added &quot;The Five Principles&quot; which helped me to find the right balance to tidy up my Zettelkasten.

  
What experiences have you had? What is the best way to tidy up a Zettelkasten?</span>

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I&#x27;m trying to configure a Literate DevOps workflow using Org Mode in Emacs. My goal is to dynamically insert a password, retrieved via password-store-get, into a shell script. However, when I use the noweb syntax &gt; in my shell block, it just inserts the Emacs Lisp code instead of the evaluated result.
 Here&#x27;s what I have so far:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 +name: get-passwd
 +begin_src emacs-lisp
 (password-store-get &quot;my-pass-store/postgres/pass&quot;)
 +end_src
 +begin_src shell :shebang &quot;#!/usr/bin/env bash&quot; :tangle /ssh:remote-host|sudo:deploy@remote-host:postgres/secret-secret.sh :noweb yes
 export DB_PASSWORD&#x3D;&gt; podman secret create --env POSTGRES_PASSWORD DB_PASSWORD
 +end_src
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 When I tangle this, the generated script still contains the function call instead of the actual password:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; bash
 !/usr/bin/env bash
 export DB_PASSWORD&#x3D;(password-store-get &quot;my-pass-store/postgres/pass&quot;) podman secret create --env POSTGRES_PASSWORD DB_PASSWORD &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 I’d like the script to include the actual password rather than the function. Does anyone know how I can achieve this? Any tips or simpler solutions would be greatly appreciated!

                              <span>Here is my situation: I have a production binary that enters a rogue infinite loop, and that I have compiled with the appropriate options for time profiling. I want to get a .prof out of a test run where I will inevitably have to kill the binary. 
 Pressing ^C once does not seem to do anything, and a second ^C kills the binary and produces an empty .prof file. What am I missing? 
 For context, here the relevant part of my cabal.project.local file:
 profiling: True profiling-detail: all-functions 
 And I use the following options for all components of my cabal package:
  ghc-prof-options: -fprof-auto 
 as well as the +RTS -p -RTS CLI option.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve never really been satisfied with most terminal emulators (Warp is really good, but it&#x27;s not open source, and it makes you sign in to an account). I thought creating one would be a good first large project to do in Haskell. I&#x27;m looking for some direction on which libraries would be good to use - for rendering the text, communicating with pty/tty etc. One feature that is a must-have is having a real GUI textfield for inputing commands that works well with a mouse, allows selecting text and so on.
 I was thinking of using the Haskell bindings to Dear IMGUI.

 I discovered the bound library for handling bound variables - and i&#x27;ts great...one problem though: It seems to break writing algebras.

 Why am I asking? I&#x27;m running both Eglot and Codeium and I&#x27;d like to keep completions by eglot-completion-at-point and codeium-completion-at-point separate. My current configuration is below. Thank you.
  
(setq-local completion-at-point-functions &#x27;(codeium-completion-at-point eglot-completion-at-point t)) (setq-local company-backends &#x27;(company-capf)) ;; I&#x27;d like to have &#x27;(company-eglot company-codeium) instead. (setq-local company-frontends &#x27;(company-pseudo-tooltip-unless-just-one-frontend-with-delay company-preview-if-just-one-frontend))

 I dont exaclty know what i may need to re-enable in future so is there a way to get do above and tackle this problem as well. I hope someone already have done this in their config

 lua is loading in org-babel-load-languages and org-src-fontify-natively is set to true but lua source blocks are not highlighted. 
 Other source blocks like python and c work as expected. Do I miss something in config file beside those two settings?

                              <span>When using emms with mpv, is there any way to get rid of duplicate music track notifications in gnome?
 I use emms with mpv as the player. It all works great. My only little issue is that in the gnome panel I always have two notifications of the current track. I run emacsclient and on startup that creates a notification automatically before running emms that just says &quot;unknown title.&quot; Then when I play emms, I get a notification that indicates the track and has a thumbnail, and a second duplicate notification, except without a thumbnail.
 I have tried turning off notifications in gnome settings for both emacs and for mpv and that has no effect.
 I am using Pop!_22.04 with gnome 42.9 and emacs 28. The relevant part of my emms config is the following:
  
(require &#x27;emms-setup)
 (require &#x27;emms-mpris)
 (emms-all)
 (emms-default-players)
 (emms-mpris-enable)
 (setq emms-player-list &#x27;(emms-player-mpv))
 (setq emms-source-file-default-directory &quot;~/Music/&quot;)
 (setq emms-info-functions &#x27;(emms-info-tinytag))
 (setq emms-browser-covers &#x27;emms-browser-cache-thumbnail-async)
 (setq emms-playing-time-display-mode nil)
  
I know this might really be a gnome issue. But I have searched and got no answers so I thought I&#x27;d try here. Rhythmbox also shows duplicate notifications, though both have thumbnails. The only music player I&#x27;ve tried that has just one notification with a nice thumbnail seems to be Lollypop.

                              <span>Title. Rather than executing the expected org-move-subtree-up, M-k does nothing. All the other directional keys work as expected with M. M-UP also works as expected. When looking at the Messages buffer, M-k produces no messages when operating on regular paragraphs, but when used on headings (and only headings) it produces this:
 Invalid face attribute :foreground nil [x times]
 The number of times increments anywhere from 20-40+ on each input of M-k. I am currently using DOOM Emacs, and have tried completely removing all Emacs files and then reinstalling multiple times with no luck. This has been a problem for several months now, and after looking on the internet and finding nothing of use, I decided I would finally post a question here.
 System: Ubuntu Studio 23.10 running on a Thinkpad P15 Gen 2i
 Please let me know any other information that would be useful to solving this. I am an Emacs newbie, so be kind.
 EDIT: Current troubleshooting data
  
Problem persists on both X and Wayland
 Problem persists when all packages except evil-org are removed
 C-h k M- returns expected information on org-metaup. Similar results for other directional keys 
 M-k is listed as an alternate keybinding
 
 C-h k M-k returns nothing. It seems that M-k never makes it to Emacs 
 This is strange, as M-k does produce text in the Messages buffer when used on headings
 M-k also causes the mode line to flash, if pressed repeatedly
 
 On my other system, running Artix and i3, this problem does not present

                              <span>Often times, I am reading pdfs which have introductions where page numbers are given as Roman numerals or other designations (i, C1 for cover etc.). Is there a way to display that as the page number? I am aware you can jump to the label using go-to-label, but I can&#x27;t seem to find a way to display the label as the page number

                              <span>Hi, everyone. I&#x27;ve been using a hybrid ZK system as my fleeting notes are on my notebook daily journals, reference notes on 4x6 cards, and main notes in Obsidian.
For the past few months, I&#x27;ve taken a lot of reference notes on 4x6 cards ranging from Coursera courses, academic journals to books and even my own daily journal.
After converting them into main notes for 3 weeks, I now have a question, which is hilarious but did bother me a lot. The question is how should I sequence my reference note cards for a course or a book because I might have notes on two cards for 2 chapters or for a combination of different lesson videos.
I watch some YouTube videos, but it looks like no one have talked about sequencing of reference note cards?</span>

                              <span>I know I&#x27;m late to the party but I wanted to share my experience for those who, like me, heard about it and thought it sounded nice but would be a lot of work to transition your existing configs.
 It integrates with use-package and straight so transitioning is surprisingly easy, for me at least. And now that I have transitioned, I can try packages quickly and easily, and best of all without stalling my session.
 Thanks very much u/nv-elisp, not only did he write elpaca, he&#x27;s also been really active on reddit, I came across many of his comments answering peoples questions when I was looking into switching to elpaca.

                              <span>Quick update on my Previous post, I am making progress - need to stabilize the api, make sure the svg drawing can work with any font/screen (currently it&#x27;s based on my 16pt font), and will test it for a while to see that it&#x27;s stable.
 I added a new design, with the title on the left. Let me know what you think and if you have any feedback/ideas on usability/features that you think would be important for the first release and I&#x27;ll try to incorporate it before releasing.
 Added a corfu (and corfu-popupinfo) mode, inspired by Manueljlin&#x27;s if emacs was made by zoomers post. Will try to move the icons on the title bar instead of &#x27;Corfu&#x27; before releasing.
 BTW any package name ideas?
 The new design + corfu:

 I do most of my development locally and test on a remote machine, where TRAMP is simply too slow for code intelligence and responsiveness. To improve this, I am sharing a mode for asynchronous file syncing using &#x60;unison&#x60;. I did so after trying several other similar approaches, including ones based on rsync (https://github.com/r-zip/rsync-mode).
 My solution is probably due to specifics of secure compute environments managed by coder, but it works well for me, and should be general purpose. Hope someone finds it useful, too!

 I implemented some of the solutions suggested in that post and I am getting new error message
 the code I am trying to run is this :
 val spark &#x3D; SparkSession. builder ().appName(&quot;MzMagic&quot;).master(&quot;local[*]&quot;).getOrCreate() import spark.implicits._ val lines &#x3D; spark.readStream.format(&quot;socket&quot;).option(&quot;host&quot;, &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;).option(&quot;port&quot;, 9999).load() val words &#x3D; lines.as[String].flatMap(_.split(&quot; &quot;)) val wordCounts &#x3D; words.groupBy(&quot;value&quot;).count() val query &#x3D; wordCounts.writeStream.outputMode(&quot;complete&quot;).format(&quot;console&quot;).start() query.awaitTermination() 
 but I am getting this error:
 ERROR MicroBatchExecution: Query [id &#x3D; f4201948-3441-41ce-9e15-d2dfdd4a9257, runId &#x3D; 9515fc7c-bfe8-411b-aaa9-abf3f0166c2b] terminated with error

and I am running it with java enviorment variable --add-exports java.base/sun.nio.ch&#x3D;ALL-UNNAMED in intellij idea
 keep in mind I have tried to setup spark on both debian and windows with spark 3.3 and 3.5 with java 11 and java 17 and I am still getting the same error message

Also was trying to practice some functional programming, I am more into Java. Could you help me with review of my vector search on lucene prototype with Advanced Vector Extensions support. I implemented index writer and reader with REST API wrapper on Akka, my main doubts is should I use for web server something Cat Effects related or Akka is good enough? Any scala best practices comeents on my code are very welcome:)

                              <span>Hello! I am new to this forum and Zettelkasten. Do I take literature notes on permanent notes in my case? If not, how to convert literature notes into permanent notes?
Today I was reading the book Atomic Habits on my iPad in the kindle app and there was an option to take notes on a specific line/word in the book. I read about 20-25 pages and marked a lot of information (there is an option - I can mark lines and words in blue, red, orange and yellow colors). So, as I was reading I took a lot of literature notes in the app (in total 15-20) and it was not one note that contained all the literature notes. I wrote all these notes with my own words and I noticed that I was describing some ideas very differently but the essence remained the same and I referred to what the author wanted to convey, but in different words. And sometimes I even supplemented these ideas with my own thoughts.
Now I am using Obsidian and wrote down these ideas from my iPad to my computer in Obsidian as literature notes. Some of them were similar, so I filtered them out. But I do not think these are literature notes. They seem like permanent notes. In my case, when I make such notes, are they permanent or literature notes? And sorry for my bad English. If I made any mistakes, please correct me. I will be very grateful for any answer!</span>

 I just wrote small interpretator in Haskell (from Thorsten Bell&#x27;s &#x27;Writing interpreter in Go&#x27; book), code is here GitHub
 So far i just evaluate set of statements which are provided with getLine (or read from file) and next input is evaluated with empty initital state (so no variables from last evaluated set of statements are not keeped in state). I want it to be like ghci - endless loop of evalution with state kept. But i not very good in all transformers shenannigans so far, any help would be appreciated!

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been writing some scripts using scala-cli, but it seems that there&#x27;s no easy way to have a script which starts instantly. So I wrote a small wrapper script over scala-cli/GraalVM which reuses the compiled binary it detects that the script content hasn&#x27;t changed.
 https://github.com/jatcwang/instant-scala
 The script quite bare-bones as I&#x27;m hoping that scala-cli will have first-class support for this in the future. But meanwhile hope this can help someone else too :)

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to learn spark, and I have loaded all the necessary libraries in the build.sbt file as below
 import scala.collection.Seq ThisBuild / version :&#x3D; &quot;0.1.0-SNAPSHOT&quot; ThisBuild / scalaVersion :&#x3D; &quot;2.13.14&quot; lazy val sparkVer &#x3D; &quot;3.5.1&quot; lazy val root &#x3D; (project in file(&quot;.&quot;)) .settings( name :&#x3D; &quot;sparkPlay&quot;, libraryDependencies :&#x3D; Seq( &quot;org.apache.spark&quot; %% &quot;spark-core&quot; % sparkVer, &quot;org.apache.spark&quot; %% &quot;spark-sql&quot; % sparkVer % &quot;provided&quot;, &quot;org.apache.spark&quot; %% &quot;spark-streaming&quot; % sparkVer % &quot;provided&quot;, &quot;org.apache.spark&quot; %% &quot;spark-mllib&quot; % sparkVer % &quot;provided&quot;) ) 
 and when I run the program with just a &quot;Hello world&quot; println it compiles and runs successfully and also when importing and referencing the spark libraries they are loaded without any problems
 the problem I am facing is in the begining when I try to create a SparkContext or SparkSession like this
 val spark &#x3D; SparkSession. builder ().appName(&quot;name-of-app&quot;).master(&quot;local[*]&quot;).getOrCreate() 
 and run the code an error is produced 
 Exception in thread &quot;main&quot; java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/apache/spark/sql/SparkSession$
 at Main$.main(Main.scala:8) at Main.main(Main.scala)

 what am I doing wrong?

 (setq vc-follow-symlinks nil) (setq js-indent-level 2) 
 Flycheck is fine with the first line. But it flags the second line like this:
 assignment to free variable ‘js-indent-level’ 
 Why is Flycheck fine with the first line but not with the second line?

                              <span>Fresh install of 24.04. Issue as presented in the title; hit Super to bring up overview, type &#x27;emacs&#x27;, hit enter (same issue with emacs (client) as with emacs): window opens but doesn&#x27;t receive focus. 
 If I pin emacs to the dash and open it by clicking there it does receive focus (emacs and emacs (client)). Double-clicking the binary directly in the file explorer and running emacs in the terminal both similarly give focus.
 I&#x27;ve searched for a bit online and the closest I&#x27;ve seen to this exact problem is this: (link) (although this: (link) suggests someone has the same problem).
 One thing to note: this problem only occurs under Wayland proper. When under X11 (Xwayland), emacs gets focus correctly (my machine switches if I enable/disable hybrid graphics and reboot). 
  
 Given what I&#x27;ve found, I think it&#x27;s clear the problem is something with Wayland and xdg-activation or whatever it is, meaning it&#x27;s probably something I can&#x27;t solve. But just in case, has anyone had this problem and figured out a workaround (other than just launching emacs any other way)?

                              <span>I&#x27;m know I&#x27;m asking this at a Scala channel but I&#x27;m counting on those who have experience/knowledge on both Scala and other FP languages. The intention is not to start a flamewar with things like x is definitively better than y, but just actual facts to understand where Scala sits compared to the other FP languages. I&#x27;m not a FP expert. I did a few things here and there, but for sure I don&#x27;t have solid foundations to take my own conclusions, yet.
 I would say that the reason I&#x27;m asking this is due to some comments I saw at the r/haskell. The main points were:
  
The mix between OO and FP. To some degree I find this odd as well and I still don&#x27;t see the value of it.
 How Scala had and still do lots of compromises because it&#x27;s so dependent on the JVM which has a totally different model. 
 Overall complexity of the language. I would say that this is better at Scala 3, but still, I find the language really, really hard.
 How easy it is to start mixing up functional and non functional code which defeats the whole purpose of writing the functional code. OCaml suffers from this as well, but I would say that is way harder to do the same on Haskell or Erlang.
  
Thanks!

Layers: The Layer effect provides managed Env values inspired by ZIO. It offers APIs for manual composition as well as a macro-based Layer.init method that automatically wires multiple layers. Layers use a new Memo effect to manage the lifecycle of components and support any other effects that may be required by their initialization. Developed by @hearnadam @kitlangton
 Caliban Integration: The Resolvers effect integrates with Caliban and kyo-tapir to serve GraphQL queries. The integration is designed so queries can contain arbitrary Kyo effects. Developed by @ghostdogpr

Recently, I&#x27;ve been looking for a solution to more fully integrate my ZK with my daily journaling, planning, and task management.  I came close to finding that in NotePlan, which I loved and have used for about three years.  It did a great job of integrating everything except my ZK, which I maintained in The Archive.  The hump there was that NotePlan used a somewhat different file format from The Archive (both used text files, but in different ways).  I was slowly trying to build up steam to write a Python script to convert from one format to the other, and due to other priorities, I didn&#x27;t get to it.

                              <span>The Hydrogen Framework for Emacs:
 https://codeberg.org/joe-adams/hydrogen
 Hydrogen is a very small framework that aims to make Emacs easier to use for people who are used to text editors other than Emacs or Vi. It gives you modern keybindings, improves the behavior of tabs and windows and a few other things.
 Some highlights:
  
Under 200k, including comments, the GPL, etc.
 The actual code is under 30k.
 No external packages, does not impose a package manager on you.
 Composed of several features that can individually be activated or deactivated.
 Modern keybindings 
 C-c for copy, C-a for select all, etc.
 
 Tab is just tab if no text is selected.
 Generally stops Emacs from opening new tabs when you open new buffers
 Closes windows when you close the last tab
 Dired doesn&#x27;t new buffers when you navigate to new directories.
 A splash screen
 Heavily commented code base
 Code says the default values of settings that are changed.
  
Please let me know what you think and if you have any suggestions. Please consider recommending Hydrogen to any new Emacs users you know.

                              <span>I have a project setup where all frontend development is fully dockerized: That means that node modules
 live inside a docker container so tide complaints for all imports that derive from installed packages,
 i.e Cannot find module &#x27;mobx&#x27; or its corresponding type declarations.
 Is there a way to setup tide to look for installed libraries inside a docker container?

 but the problem is I am using &#x60;q&#x60; too much for quitting, but for some reason it&#x27;s conflicting with macro recording, for that reason I would like to remap this functionality into another key. or maybe I am wrong and I should not use &#x60;q&#x60; for quitting?

 Is there any way I can configure emacs to do that?

 Yup. I have transparency set. Awesome feature that motivates me to use emacs more often
 But this looked kinda annoying in org mode (the gray asterisks behind the stars). I know that the non-leading stars are colored so that it would blend with the background, but now that the background is no longer a solid color, the asterisks look like this.
 either i&#x27;m gonna make it so that the headings are gonna indicate its level by its size instead of its position, or i&#x27;ll find a workaround to completely hide the stars with spaces or an invisible character. any advice?

 I was trying to use the appimage version, to get a newer version of emacs (29.4 instead of 27.something). I successfully added it to path, and doom recognized it and rebuilt my packages, but then I got this. Vanilla emacs works fine. The picture shows all errors.

                              <span>I have an org subtree * My task with states that I go back and forth, for example: from STARTED to WAITING. Each time a change between these states, an entry is added to the LOGBOOK drawer.
 Is there a way to visualize the added up amount of time spent in this subtree?
 I know about org-clock-in/out, but I&#x27;m using column-view and I need to record the inactive timestamp that are logged to the LOGBOOK drawer, so I can use the TIMESTAMP_IA special property.
 My goal is to record the amount of time studied between my study sessions, so other suggestions are welcome.

                              <span>What is the best practice for using warp with sqlite to get the best write performance?
 First try was
 main :: IO () main &#x3D; run 8080 app where app \_ res &#x3D; withConnection &quot;/tmp/test.db&quot; $ \\conn -&gt; do execute\_ conn &quot;insert into message (id, message) values (1, &#x27;Some message&#x27;)&quot; res $ responseLBS status200 \[\] &quot;&quot; 
 after callling
 httperf --server localhost --port 8080 --num-conns 200 --rate 100 --num-calls 10 --timeout 2 
 i&#x60;m getting db lock errors and some messages are getting lost
 Using a resource pool doesn&#x27;t make things better
 I decided to write in one thread
 Second try
 main :: IO () main &#x3D; do chan  execute\_ conn &quot;insert into message (id, message) values (1, &#x27;Some message&#x27;)&quot; run 8080 $ app chan where app chan \_ res &#x3D; do writeChan chan &quot;&quot; res $ responseLBS status200 \[\] &quot;&quot; 
 after callling httperf no message were lost.

                              <span>Second year uni student, don&#x27;t have much experience with programming. Using a Ubuntu (Linux) system, and was following GHCup&#x27;s install instruction for linux and vscode integration. 
 I had GHCup install every tool (including path editin, hls, and better stack integration) during it&#x27;s installation (and also tried reinstalling). I turned on system ghc in stack.yaml and let HLS know GHCup on $PATH. 
 I then followed first steps, and I can compile and run haskell code in terminal with ghc. However, when I created an .hs file and tried to run it in vscode, it&#x27;s telling me that hls 2.9.0.1 is needed to be installed. I went on GHCup tui and it said it already had hls 2.7.0.0 installed. I also tried letting vscode just install the hls 2.9.0.1 but it&#x27;s not working (likely it&#x27;s not linked to GHCup?)

                              <span>Warning: I&#x27;m terrible at wording lol. Please assume the best from me, I genuinely don&#x27;t know how people ask for things nicely (Probably my autism or something). Sorry for the wall of text, I don&#x27;t know how to phrase it better. How do I make it so doom emacs (no evil mode) starts exactly how I closed it without having to go through scattered config files? I don&#x27;t wanna mess it up. What I really want is to start with the last file used open and it&#x27;s folder on treemacs, and a little terminal open with my zsh config. Also, how do I open another buffer with a file I double-clicked on treemacs? I have no idea what to do then and I&#x27;m afraid of deleting it. I loved emacs so far and want to learn more about it after finishing this, as I&#x27;m pretty satisfied already. Please don&#x27;t send me a video or a giant tutorial link lol, my ADHD won&#x27;t let me sit through it without going insane. Thanks in advance.

                              <span>For anyone that does PHP development in emacs: what are you using? php-mode, phps-mode, web-mode? Are you using an LSP of sorts, or ctags or nothing at all? And do you mostly edit templates/wordpress sites or are you working with more software engineering oriented frameworks like Symfony or Laravel?
 Is there anything you wish to see improved when using emacs for development of PHP applications? A feature you&#x27;re missing?

                              <span>After I invoke org capture to create a journal entry, the cursor is position at the start of the entry, prior to the timestamp, instead of after it. In other words, as soon as the capture is done, I cannot start writing the entry, but have to move the cursor to the end of the line before I can start typing. Why does it happen?
 The following is what I have in my configuration for org-capture-templates.
  (&quot;j&quot; &quot;Journal entry&quot; plain (function org-journal-find-location) &quot;** %(format-time-string org-journal-time-format)\n%?&quot; :empty-lines 2 :jump-to-captured t :immediate-finish t) 
 where org-journal-find-location is defined as follows.
  (defun org-journal-find-location () ;; Open today&#x27;s journal, but specify a non-nil prefix argument in order to ;; inhibit inserting the heading; org-capture will insert the heading. (org-journal-new-entry t) (unless (eq org-journal-file-type &#x27;daily) (org-narrow-to-subtree)) (goto-char (point-max))) 
 These are based on the example snippets from org-journal repository.
 I thought the use of &quot;%?&quot; following the newline should force the cursor to be placed after the headline (containing the timestamp), but it does not. What am I overlooking?

                              <span>So there&#x27;s like 3-4 emacs based LLMs modes that are pretty good.
 But recently zed and cursor have gotten upgrades to their LLM integration.
 I don&#x27;t think LLMs will replace software engineers anytime sooner than like 30 years out.
 but they are clearly useful for
  
mocking out boilerplates for simple stuff
 
learning new areas / tools that previously you&#x27;d have to ask a frontend/UI or an infra specialist to really make a reasonable MVP, but now you can chain a few artifacts in claude and then pass it off to a specialist for them to productionize.
 
 Basically it makes easy stuff trivial, and medium stuff easy.
 But hard stuff is still hard.
 I think something like https://github.com/yetone/avante.nvim
 shows how LLMs have evolved since liek a year ago when they seemed novel and cool but …</span>

 Is it possible to rename a file in the buffer menu only?
 So instead of having default.rb and default.rb it would be like default.rb default.rb

 My eshell completion does not work when ivy-mode is enabled. It finds the good completion but removes prefixes like / or ~/
 Does something know why ?
 Here is how I configure ivy :
 (use-package ivy
  :straight t :init (ivy-mode t) :bind (&quot;C-x b&quot; . ivy-switch-buffer) (:map ivy-minibuffer-map (&quot;C-J&quot; . ivy-done) (&quot;RET&quot; . ivy-alt-done)) ;config (setq ivy-re-builders-alist &#x27;((t . ivy--regex-ignore-order)))) 
 Thanks.
 Here is demo without ivy-mode and then with ivy-mode enabled :

                              <span>I&#x27;ve now been trying for quite some time to make emacs work for me and use packages and the fact i can program it to my personal taste to it&#x27;s full extend. But, again and again, i feel like my Emacs configuration reaches a point where it starts to feel &quot;fragile&quot;. I&#x27;ve been working on mine on and off for some time now and, in general, i really like where i&#x27;m at.
 But the i try adding in Treemacs and it&#x27;s a hassle to make that change. Just adding it in with use-package results in &quot;treemacs loaded before elpaca&quot;. So, &#x60;:ensure (:wait t)&#x60; seems to solve that. Now treemacs works. As soon as i add a &#x60;:bind&#x60; to the setup, the treemacs buffer opens empty and i get &#x60;Error in post-command-hook (treemacs--post-command): (wrong-type-argument markerp nil)&#x60;. Without keybind it&#x27;s fine. This is just one example.
 I look around and see really elaborate configurations with major customizations that seem to work flawlessly for those people. But for me, it quickly reaches a point where things start behaving differently from what i would expect.
 I&#x27;m close to starting over (again) as i feel that i&#x27;ve lost control over that configuration. And i don&#x27;t even know why.

 I have global-auto-revert-mode enabled in &#x60;init.el&#x60;, evaluating M-: confirms that.
 When I M-: evaluating auto-revert-mode it is &#x27;nil&#x27;
 When I change outside of Emacs a file which is visted by an Emacs buffer, the file is not auto-reverted. When I try to edit that buffer, Emacs warns that the file has been changed outside of Emacs, so I don&#x27;t lose content. However the buffer is not visually updated.
 How can I check if reverting should actually work? Or do I missunderstand auto-reverting of buffers in Emacs?

                              <span>I have a program that monitors our CI/CD machines and will start and stop depending on activity, they are the bulkiest machines we have. I have a Cats IOApp that monitors this. With a run method very similar to below.
 It does need to evaluate each time, but this may be a very naieve way of approaching it. I&#x27;ve been learning a lot of this alone, so looking for opinions.
 Thanks

                              <span>As part of a project I am revisiting some old code. I intend to bring it up to current standards (ie Scala 3) and a small part of this project, geometry and geography related, may be useful to other people so I am thinking of publishing in GitHub.
 Would this be the right place to get feedback on the style of the code? I am kind of shy about showing my code to the world without feedback.

 case class Tagged[Tag, Value](value: Value) type ZipTagged[Tags  EmptyTuple case (tagType *: tagTailType, valueType *: valueTailType) &#x3D;&gt; Tagged[tagType, valueType] *: ZipTagged[tagTailType, valueTailType] trait ZipTag[Tags  Tagged[Tag, Value](value) *: zipTag.zipTagged(valueTail) def test &#x3D; summon[ZipTag[(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;), (Int, Boolean)]].zipTagged((1, true)) 
 If I don&#x27;t mark the methods in ZipTag inline, it works, but then I suppose the tuple is traversed at runtime. Is this a fundamental limitation, or can it be worked around? It seems like it should be possible in theory, since all the information is available compile-time.

                              <span>Dear all,
 I&#x27;m really excited to announce the release of Dunai 0.13.1 and Bearriver 0.14.10!
 Dunai is a reactive programming library structured around a notion of Monadic Stream Functions. Dunai can be used to implement other reactive and FRP frameworks on top, including Classic FRP and Arrowized FRP variants.
 Dunai comes with:
  
bearriver: API-compatible implementation of Yampa. (The Bear River is a tributary to the Yampa river.)
 
dunai-test: QuickCheck-based temporal testing library that can be connected with the testing system haskell-titan.

our interests and expertise have become significantly broader over the years, our love

 This is a freshly compiled Emacs, ran with -Q and rust-mode + eglot, nothing more. You can see on the screenshot that the minibuffer shows only the first line of eldoc (C-h .) - it cuts the rest off even though max-mini-window-height isn&#x27;t the problem. I want it to also include the second line with the type information (I want it because I hate inlay-hints and I turn them off). I spent some time doing research and I found this package https://github.com/emacsmirror/eglot-signature-eldoc-talkative that seems to be related but it didn&#x27;t do what I wanted. Based on it I tried to do some things but honestly I&#x27;m a pretty bad Emacs user and I have no idea what I&#x27;m doing.

 Is there a way to highlight the active window by coloring the border like in many tilling window managers (here i3 from a random video on yt)
 All the solutions I found are about changing the color of the background / modeline. I don&#x27;t want to change the background (auto-dim-other-buffers.el do the job) and I already have a dynamic modeline color but it&#x27;s not enough for me to quickly see where i am.
 (I use Doom emacs with default doom-theme if it can help)

                              <span>I used chatgpt to try to get me started with auctex and LMTX ConTeXT support and this is what it suggested that seemed to work
 1. Install Emacs and AUCTeX
  
Emacs: Download and install Emacs from [GNU Emacs]() or use your package manager if you&#x27;re on Linux.
 AUCTeX: Install AUCTeX through Emacs&#x27; package manager: 
 Open Emacs and type M-x package-refresh-contents RET.
 Then, install AUCTeX with M-x package-install RET auctex RET.
 
  
2. Install ConTeXt LMTX
  
Download ConTeXt LMTX from the [Pragma ADE website]().
 Extract the archive and place the folder in a location of your choice.
  
This is what I did and it seems that AUCTex is installed.
 however, I dont know where to go from here, do i need anything else? is there a way to get started with making ConTeXt work on emacs? I have the context-win64 folder in C:\ConTeXt\context-win64 as I was instructed in the directions to make a folder for win64

                              <span>First of all comint infrastructure is a thing that powers M-x shell and M-x run-python and probably other things that im not aware of.
 Its a nice thing because you can use it as a framework to make your shell or repl or interpreter more interactive in very standard emacsy way, by communicating with external processes.
 It gives you code completion (using *Completions* buffer), syntax highlighting (according to the article below), and it can pass those code completion candidates to normal emacs buffer.
 Run M-x run-python, create a new buffer with python-mode, AND you will have context aware code completion in your buffer (try it)
 BUT it does NOT give you code navigation, cause it doesn&#x27;t integrate with xref, and it&#x27;s not a full terminal emulator.
 I read the source code of comint.el, python.el, shell.el and found this brilliant article: https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/comint-writing-command-interpreter
 Main problem (besides xref), that i have with comint is that it is dumb terminal (as opposed to xterm-256color terminal), meaning it isn&#x27;t a full terminal emulator.
 It doesn&#x27;t interpret ANSI escape sequences, essentially only supporting raw input and output.
 So my question is: Why is that? And how do i fix that?
 To be clear emacs does have full terminal emulators like vterm or ansi-term.
 But i think it would be awesome to have those advantages that comint already has and also have a perfect development environment for creating tui programs.
 I hope this post doesn&#x27;t feel like a rant or is unclear. I&#x27;m interested in emacs architecture design, and want to learn from it.

                              <span>Edit: as u/mickeyp pointed out, inhibiting annotations for remote files is the solution. Luckily, this is the default in marginalia, so no manual advices are needed if I use that :)
 Sorry for bad formatting, I&#x27;m blaming the android app.
 I&#x27;ve recently had the pain of working with tramp over a slow connection and noticed that minibuffer completion during find-file on a remote path was painfully slow, constanly freezing, and sometimes triggered forbidden reentrant calls.
 I put my poor emacs debugging skills to the task and noticed a large number of test -e ... commands going through tramp, coming from a large number of calls to file-exists-p on remote paths triggered by the completion (was using fido at the time). This seems to hurt other completion packages that are based around completing-read from what I could tell (tested a bit with vertico).
 I tried ido instead and it was blazingly fast in comparison. I couldn&#x27;t find anything about this through basic googling so thought I&#x27;d ask here: I see vertico and friends being recommended here a lot, and while I generally prefer these alternatives over ido, not playing nice with tramp is a pretty big pain point. Anyone has any workaround or config tips to tackle this that don&#x27;t involve applying super deep advices?

                              <span>My understanding of lock files is that they are useful only when two Emacs processes try to modify the same file, and since I always run a single Emacs process, I can disable them without risks. Is that correct? Thanks.
 EDIT: I have asked because I thought that lock files were a legacy feature from a time when more than one user ran Emacs on a shared server, but according to an answer, that&#x27;s not the case.

                              <span>Hello! I&#x27;ve been recently trying to get more intentional about treating Emacs Lisp like &#x27;any other programming language&#x27; and so I have a question about package development.
 Let&#x27;s say that you are developing two packages that depend on different versions of the same package. You are using Eask/Cask/Eldev/Keg/etc and so you have two projects: foo and bar that both depend on some third package baz, but one of them is &#x27;stuck&#x27; at an earlier version. The packages are otherwise unrelated. For the argument&#x27;s sake, you cannot upgrade. How do you get completion, documentation, jump to definition etc pointing at the correct version of baz? Do you clear up your load path every time you switch between the projects?
 Or to put question differently, when you develop foo.el, how do you get elisp completion and documentation relevant only to what foo.el should be able to access and not to anything defined in your configuration? Right now if I open any .el file elisp-completion-at-point will happily suggest any function or variable that I ever defined in init.el. I can of course start a new session and load only foo.el . But then I lose all my customization to get accurate completions.
 This is a pretty common scenario within the larger programming ecosystem and most languages/tools handle it without the developer ever thinking about it, but I have not seen anything on the topic in Emacs Lisp specifically. Any pointers would be appreciated.
 Edit: Some clunky wording in 3rd paragraph.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been on a journey to improve my reading and note-taking process, and I wanted to share my experience and get your thoughts.
 As a long-time note-taking enthusiast and writer, I found myself drowning in a sea of information. My Emacs was filled with org files containing highlights, bookmarks, and copied passages, yet I often struggled to recall or effectively use this information when I needed it. I realized I wasn&#x27;t truly engaging with what I read.
 I stumbled upon Niklas Luhmann&#x27;s Zettelkasten method and was intrigued. The idea of summarizing in my own words and connecting ideas across different sources resonated with me. I started experimenting with this method manually and found that I was remembering more and understanding deeper.
 My Solution
 Being an Emacs user, I thought, &quot;Why not create a tool to streamline this process?&quot; That&#x27;s how I started working on org-zettel-ref-mode.
 Here&#x27;s what it does:
  
Automatically extracts comments and summaries from the text you&#x27;re reading.
 Creates an overview window for quick reference.
 Saves literature notes to custom folders.
 Enables quick commenting with a simple command.
 Allows easy navigation between notes and source material.
  
Here&#x27;s what it looks like:

 I&#x27;m curious:
  
Have you ever created tools to enhance your learning process? How did it go?
 How do you manage the balance between efficient reading and deep understanding?
 Do you think automating parts of the note-taking process could be counterproductive to learning?
  
I&#x27;d love to hear your thoughts, experiences, or critiques.

                              <span>It was research for a business-related blog that led me to recently discovering the ZK method, and I am very excited to watch this web grow.
But this journey also became one of very personal development as I continue to find additional productivity techniques, psychological insights, etc. that are helping me be a better me. And the ZK method seems well suited for also keeping track of those things.
Is there some wisdom in keeping the things separate? Or do you just let it all live together?
What about journaling? I ask that because my &quot;personal development&quot; stuff can veer closer to &quot;journaling&quot; than &quot;business research,&quot; but journaling (and dream journaling) feels like it shouldn&#x27;t be anywhere near my ZK.</span>

Exploring feminism as a man.
Working on the concept of creating thinking canvases.
I&#x27;m thinking a lot about automation.
I&#x27;m back in university for the semester and taking a journalism writing class with a bunch of young people.
Thinking about the &quot;Theory of Maximum Taste&quot; and how to apply it to note-taking.
My reading is very much related to reading and writing.

 Currently I just do sbt run.

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to zip a tuple of type-level tags with a tuple of values into a tuple of tagged values, but this code doesn&#x27;t compile:
 import scala.compiletime.erasedValue case class Tagged[Tag, Value](value: Value) type ZipTagged[Tags  EmptyTuple case (tagType *: tagTailType, valueType *: valueTailType) &#x3D;&gt; Tagged[tagType, valueType] *: ZipTagged[tagTailType, valueTailType] inline def zipTagged[Tags  // Found: EmptyTuple.type, Required: ZipTagged[Tags, Values] EmptyTuple case (_: (tagType *: tagTailType), value *: valueTail: (valueType *: valueTailType)) &#x3D;&gt; // Found: Tagged[tagType, valueType] *: ZipTagged[tagTailType, valueTailType], Required: ZipTagged[Tags, Values] Tagged[tagType, valueType](value) *: zipTagged[tagTailType, valueTailType](valueTail) 
 There&#x27;s also a warning about &quot;type ascriptions after pattern&quot;, so I&#x27;m clearly doing something wrong, but at the same time it seems close to working. What am I missing?

 Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of null, I will fear no throw: for Sync[F] art with me; thy delay and thy recover they comfort me.
 F preparest a table before me in the presence of mine complexities: F anointest my constructors with dependencies; my context parameters runneth over.
 Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of F[_] for ever.

 My company is organizing a Scala meetup together with Wolt on the 12th of September in Stockholm, Sweden. If you’re in the area we’d love if you could make it! There will be talks, food and mingle
 More details + RSVP is in the attached Meetup link. We will also try to record the talks and put them up on YouTube.
 Hope to see you there!

                              <span>Hello everyone, I&#x27;d like to invite you all to next episode of Scala Space Podcast on Friday 23rd at 2PM CEST. My guest this time will be the creator of Scala himself - Martin Odersky. We will try to discuss and explain all the whats and whys of Lean Scala, of Scala features and how things could look like in the future. The podcast will be streamed live on YouTube and Twitch so you can join and comment or ask questions in the chat, as usual.

 YouTube: https://youtube.com/live/IugW666w-M8
 Twitch: https://www.twitch.tv/averagefpenjoyer/schedule?segmentID&#x3D;fb6fafda-ad50-4f1b-b06d-37f44f722b25
 P.S.: I&#x27;m trying to figure out RSS (this is a bit simpler) and Apple podcasts + Spotify podcasts by popular demand, it&#x27;s just painfully slow due to everything being very legalese.
 P.S.2: I got rid of the boom arm and my microphone will be positioned centrally so there should be no more issues with my audio being skewed towards the left channel (I do read YouTube comments!).
 P.S.3: you can also write your questions about Lean Scala down here in comments and I&#x27;ll try to discuss them with Martin on the podcast!

                              <span>Hi, I sometimes I want to add a year to dates in emacs. For instance:
 replace-regexp \([[:digit:]][[:digit:]]\) \1/2024
 Then, sometimes I want to make that into a custom function defined in a dotfile.
 (defun complete-dates ()
 (interactive)
 (replace-regexp &quot;\([[:digit:]][[:digit:]]\)&quot; &quot;\1/2024&quot;)
 (replace-regexp &quot;YEAR&quot; &quot;2024&quot;)
 ) 
 What that does is replace YEAR with 2024 but not seem to execute the first replacement, or the first replacement fails. 
 What do you think? Do I need more backslashes?

                              <span>Hey, i&#x27;m a very newbie guy on elisp and emacs, and i was mixing up into the xml-print function from the emacs sgml-mode. 
 (xml-print &#x27;((ul ((class . &quot;bg-red-400&quot;)) &quot;Hello&quot;)) ) ;; Writes on the cursor: ;; 
Hello
 
 The thing is, i don&#x27;t want to insert/write those values, i just want to print(return as string) them. I was looking at the xml.el from the emacs source, and that thing is huge, so even if a replace all the inserts to quotes that might break something. What i did was the following function:
  (defun xml-print-string () (interactive) (let ( (dummy (generate-new-buffer &quot;Dummy Buffer&quot;) ) (formated-xml-string &quot;&quot;) ) (switch-to-buffer dummy) (xml-print &#x27;((ul ((class . &quot;bg-red-400&quot;)) &quot;Hello&quot;)) ) (setq formated-xml-string (buffer-string)) (kill-buffer dummy) formated-xml-string )) (xml-print-string) 
 Using C-X and C-E it evaluates to:
 
Hello
 
 It works...But i don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the best way to handle this problem. Can this function escale if i use it a lot? (As it&#x27;s creating and deleting a buffer)

                              <span>Hi I switched to doom emacs yesterday (from vs codium and nvim). I have almost customized it to meet my basic needs, but one things i am unable to do as now if to set it up for web development. Some things like when i do div*3 it creates 3 divs in codium and when i do div#main it creates a div with id main plus may other things like emmets and code completion and linting in css and js. Any help is highly appreciable. Also if possible please share your setup if you code in C++/C/web development (PS I will learn vanilla emacs later after a month or so as i currently dont have the time to do so)

I am using the breadcrumbs that are offered by dired+, so I really do not need the first line of the dired buffer, which shows the current folder path.

 Thanks in advance for all your help.

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I was playing around a bit with SVG in emacs, and changed the way posframes look like. I also have a semi-working version of the frames being animated (sliding from the side, popping from the middle, etc.) - not shown in the screen capture (wouldn&#x27;t look good in the gif).
 As you can see, I have it working with vertico (+ Marginilia, etc.), regular posframes (like the LLM summary examples), lsp-doc-ui (and eldoc-box), and for FZF.
 I am wondering if there is enough interest in packaging/cleaning up the code and releasing it as a package.
 Note: for some reason, the gif on reddit cuts off a little of the top of lsp-ui-doc, but in my emacs it works great. Had to degrade the size/quality a bit, it looks much better in real use

                              <span>Hello! I&#x27;d like to know if you use any package to show a directory tree listing on the left sidebar?
 I tried Treemacs but I see that it doesn&#x27;t work very well with project.el. Like when I start Treemacs for the first time I get a blank sidebar. Yes, I can add a project manually to it using C-c C-p a but it is rather inconvenient to do this for every project I work with. Ideally I&#x27;d like something that automatically uses the current Git project as the project tree automatically (like how project.el detects current project from .git folders).
 Is there any package that does something like this? If not, a plain tree-format directory tree browser would also be okay for me. Let me know if you have some recommendations.

                              <span>So I&#x27;ve been getting more use out of Org and Agenda now that I have some nice little capture templates setup and a file that it gets stuffed into. However I&#x27;ve now run across something kind of weird.
 I had two meetings yesterday that I had scheduled and they did show up in the Agenda day view, however now they&#x27;re showing up again today with the marker &quot;1x&quot;. However I did not mark them as repeating. 
 So for instance I have:
 * Appointments ** NAO Meeting at HQ Auditorium SCHEDULED: -- ** Appt w/ Optometrist SCHEDULED: -- ** 1-on-1 Meeting w/ Michael SCHEDULED:  
 Both the NAO and 1-on-1 meeting were yesterday. Today I&#x27;m seeing in agenda:
 Week-agenda (W34): Monday 19 August 2024 W34 notes: 8:30 ┄┄┄┄┄ Scheduled: NAO Meeting at HQ Auditorium notes: 8:30-13:00 NAO Meeting at HQ Auditorium notes: 14:00 ┄┄┄┄┄ Scheduled: 1-on-1 Meeting w/ Michael notes: 16:00 ┄┄┄┄┄ Scheduled: DONE Enroll in Benefits Tuesday 20 August 2024 notes: Sched. 1x: NAO Meeting at HQ Auditorium &lt;------ These two seem notes: Sched. 1x: 1-on-1 Meeting w/ Michael &lt;------ weird 
 Why is it showing up again? As far as I can tell from the Org docs and the Agenda docs, I created the timestamp correctly. In the first instance I put in a duration (it was a long block of time) and the second does repeat, but once a week. 
 If I start to accumulate a lot of old entries this is going to get really problematic after a week or two. Any ideas on what I did wrong?
 SOLVED: Took a bit to actually get the RIGHT search engine terms because most things were just pointing back to Org Agenda docs. However the FAQ at this location (https://orgmode.org/worg/org-faq.html#scheduled-vs-deadline-vs-timestamp) seems to have answered it. I just want a timestamp, not a scheduled for most things I think.

                              <span>I am trying to set up a system to get Emacs to profile the total time it takes to do a build. I have come up with the following:
 (global-set-key (kbd &quot;&quot;) (lambda () (interactive) (my/refresh-all-file-buffers) (let ((project-directory (locate-dominating-file default-directory my/buildfile))) (when project-directory (with-temp-buffer (cd project-directory) (let ((elapsed (benchmark-elapse (compile (concat &quot;python &quot; my/buildfile))))) (read-only-mode -1) (insert (format &quot;%.6f seconds&quot; elapsed)) (read-only-mode 1))))))) 
 However, the &quot;%.6f seconds&quot; text does not appear in the buffer. Instead, I get the following message:
 Compilation finished Refreshed open files. 
 I am not sure what the issue is or if the above approach is even correct. Any help in how to get that format text to appear at the end of the buffer?
 EDIT:
 Fixed thanks to /u/arthurno1. Following is the final code, for future reference. I had to save the start time in a variable because the compile function works asynchronously.
 (defvar *last-compile-start-time*) (global-set-key (kbd &quot;&quot;) (lambda () (interactive) (setq *last-compile-start-time* (float-time)) (my/refresh-all-file-buffers) (let ((project-directory (locate-dominating-file default-directory my/buildfile))) (when project-directory (with-temp-buffer (cd project-directory) (compile (concat &quot;python &quot; my/buildfile))))))) (defun my/compilation-finish-function (buffer desc) (with-current-buffer &quot;*compilation*&quot; (save-excursion (let ((inhibit-read-only t)) (goto-char (point-max)) (insert (format &quot;Compilation took %f seconds&quot; (- (float-time) *last-compile-start-time*))))))) (add-hook &#x27;compilation-finish-functions &#x27;my/compilation-finish-function)

 I&#x27;ve installed the language grammar for C++ with treesit-install-language-grammar and I can enable c++-ts-mode but syntax highlighting isn&#x27;t working, only #include gets highlighted rest is all plain.
 https://preview.redd.it/eoglirodjsjd1.jpg?width&#x3D;1153&amp;format&#x3D;pjpg&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;21c8be6b94e28f655e6f2f6faf08ad6be21acfc6
 I also installed treesit-auto just to be sure but it&#x27;s still the same. How can I get the proper syntax highlighting?
 Edit: More details about the issue:
 My emacs version is 29.4 and tree-sitter version is 0.22.6_1*, both are installed from official voidlinux repository.*
 Following is my \Messages* buffer when I open c++ file:*
 [yas] Prepared just-in-time loading of snippets (but no snippets found). Starting Emacs daemon. Error during redisplay: (jit-lock-function 1) signaled (treesit-query-error &quot;Node type error at&quot; 216 &quot;[\&quot;_Atomic\&quot; \&quot;break\&quot; \&quot;case\&quot; \&quot;const\&quot; \&quot;continue\&quot; \&quot;default\&quot; \&quot;do\&quot; \&quot;else\&quot; \&quot;enum\&quot; \&quot;extern\&quot; \&quot;for\&quot; \&quot;goto\&quot; \&quot;if\&quot; \&quot;inline\&quot; \&quot;register\&quot; \&quot;restrict\&quot; \&quot;return\&quot; \&quot;sizeof\&quot; \&quot;static\&quot; \&quot;struct\&quot; \&quot;switch\&quot; \&quot;typedef\&quot; \&quot;union\&quot; \&quot;volatile\&quot; \&quot;while\&quot; \&quot;and\&quot; \&quot;and_eq\&quot; \&quot;bitand\&quot; \&quot;bitor\&quot; \&quot;catch\&quot; \&quot;class\&quot; \&quot;co_await\&quot; \&quot;co_return\&quot; \&quot;co_yield\&quot; \&quot;compl\&quot; \&quot;concept\&quot; \&quot;consteval\&quot; \&quot;constexpr\&quot; \&quot;constinit\&quot; \&quot;decltype\&quot; \&quot;delete\&quot; \&quot;explicit\&quot; \&quot;final\&quot; \&quot;friend\&quot; \&quot;mutable\&quot; \&quot;namespace\&quot; \&quot;new\&quot; \&quot;noexcept\&quot; \&quot;not\&quot; \&quot;not_eq\&quot; \&quot;operator\&quot; \&quot;or\&quot; \&quot;or_eq\&quot; \&quot;override\&quot; \&quot;private\&quot; \&quot;protected\&quot; \&quot;public\&quot; \&quot;requires\&quot; \&quot;template\&quot; \&quot;throw\&quot; \&quot;try\&quot; \&quot;typename\&quot; \&quot;using\&quot; \&quot;virtual\&quot; \&quot;xor\&quot; \&quot;xor_eq\&quot;] ce (auto) ce (this) ce&quot; &quot;Debug the query with &#x60;treesit-query-validate&#x27;&quot;) 
 After making this post I tried several different older versions of the tree-sitter-cpp language but it didn&#x27;t work.
 
 Solution: I installed tree-sitter-cpp grammar version v0.21.0 after reading it in the comments and it worked. Seems I was using wrong versions so far.

                              <span>Is there any ascii movie player for Emacs? I&#x27;d like to replay some ascii movie frames (maybe 10 or 20) in loop so I can document workout exercises in plain text (thinking in org mode to be precise). 
 I expect Ascii movies to be AI generated in short, but meanwhile maybe I can paint the frames via artist mode, or transcode them from common video using libcaca/ffmpeg.

                              <span>Hi folks
 Basically, long story short, Im using Emacs at work and home (for some obscure language called Magik). At work, the laptop install checkpoint as per company policy. Recently, some recent changes, have me struggling with Emacs Python Mode. Im not interested in using Python in Emacs (in PyCharm is fine). But If I turn on python-mode, or insert a python code block into my org files. The software quits Emacs. I want it to enable it minimally, if thats possible, without triggering.

                              <span>I have plans to test using Emacs more, but as a Windows user, i can set Copy/Paste buttons as Windows, witch make it easy but, it&#x27;s not Emacs standard.
 So if you are working om Emacs under Windows how do you do/think about this?

                              <span>I&#x27;m working on a minor mode for Emacs, and I want to create a global version of this mode. However, I&#x27;m unsure about the naming conventions. Would it be appropriate to name the global mode:
 - packagename-mode,
 - Or global-packagename-mode?
 - Or packagename-global-mode? 
 I would appreciate any guidance or best practices for naming global modes in Emacs.

                              <span>I have an elisp package that:
  
starts a java binary + a python program
 
sends queries to that python program via POST to localhost
 
uses the outputs of the python program to update the editor&#x27;s behavior.
 
 the code relies heavily on the python program, and it&#x27;s the python program that does all the heavy lifting.
 I want to make it easy for people to install and use my package. How do I install all the python dependencies and make sure they&#x27;re available inside of a MELPA recipe?
 i.e. can i do something like:
 pip install numpy
 inside of my MELPA package definition? is there documentation for this? I wasn&#x27;t able to find instructions for it

 I love how things work well together, that everything is a buffer (best search and replace experience), the perfect balance between terminal look and GUI features.
 But... it is just too slow, I spent years hoping native compilation will help, hoping version 29+ will fix things, even tried emacs-lsp-booster. I&#x27;ve read countless blog posts, forums, chats where people with the same issues is always challenged with &quot;something in the config must be wrong&quot;, &quot;can you debug what happens when you do that&quot;, &quot;do you have native compilation on&quot;, etc. I tried many tricks and recommended settings, many different distros, use emacs …</span>

 This is a &quot;working&quot; but still highly experimental transient for ffmpeg I&#x27;ve begun work on. It&#x27;s currently capable of very basic conversion semantics on 1 infile and 1 outfile per interaction.
 Improvements I hope to complete:
  
Multiple infiles and outfiles per conversion; I won&#x27;t consider the project complete without this
 Stream selection options on the basic conversion options
 Dedicated transient prefix for A/V filter construction and other complex directives
 Support for most of the available infile/outfile commands
  
Many of these improvements (especially the first one) require more thought than went into the prototype, so I expect progress be slow. Transients are a deep but rewarding rabbit-hole to enter. In the meantime, I don&#x27;t consider the code fit for public consumption; I look forward to this changing in the future.

 I wanted to write about why I use Emacs and why I recommend it.
 There might be some factually wrong information, tried my best to fact check. Feel free to correct me or tell me what you are thinking.

                              <span>I am generating an org file with links to all the files in a directory, and using those links in the usual org manner... reorganizing them, categorizing them, inserting text in between, some might be headings, etc.
 Now, just checking before reinventing the wheel... I need a function that updates the content of the file/buffer with any changes that have occurred in the directory. It doesn&#x27;t need to be immediate, it&#x27;s fine if it does so when called, and it should just notify me which files have been renamed, deleted, or changed names (using the ID of each referenced file).
 Is there any package that already implements this kind of functions / commands?

                              <span>Whenever I have to use Windows, I&#x27;ve been using Emacs v27.2 on MSys2. That works fine but now I feel the need to upgrade it so I can use the latest features such as libgccjit&#x27;s.
 Then I encountered one little problem; it seems that with Emasc 29, I&#x27;m no longer able to run Emacs on MSys2 with:
 # not really working well $ emacs-29 -nw 
 whilst with v27.2, I can:
 # working okay $ /usr/bin/emacs -nw 
 The problem doesn&#x27;t disappear in either the one provided by the package manager or the fresh local Emacs that I built from scratch in MSys2.
 Yes, I know that a workaround would be to use something like:
 # possible workaround with poor user experience $ winpty emacs -nw 
 This is weird though. How does the older package (v27.2) not require winpty, but does the new one (v29 above) now?

                              <span>There is an API out of my control, so I&#x27;ve written a few tests for it in a ZIO test suite to make sure it works as intended.
 I want to ignore these tests if the API server is down, so I&#x27;ve also written a ZIO effect that checks for connectivity. It was like this:
 object ApiTests extends ZIOSpecDefault { override def spec &#x3D; suite(&quot;test api&quot;)( ... // tests ).whenZIO(checkConnectivity) .provideShared(ZLayer.fromZIO(ApiService.create)) private def checkConnectivity: ZIO[ApiService, Nothing, Boolean] &#x3D; ... } 
 But checkConnectivity takes time to run especially if the server is down, so I want to run it only once, whereas with whenZIO on the test suite it&#x27;s run once for every test in the suite. So at the moment the best I&#x27;ve got is this:
 import zio.test.TestAspect.beforeAll object ApiTests extends ZIOSpecDefault { override def spec &#x3D; { suite(&quot;test api&quot;)( ... // tests ).whenZIO(isAlive) @@ beforeAll(checkConnectivityV2) }.provideShared(ZLayer.fromZIO(ApiService.create)) private var isAlive &#x3D; true private def checkConnectivityV2: ZIO[ApiService, Nothing, Unit] &#x3D; { ... // overwrites &#x60;isAlive&#x60; accordingly } } 
 I can&#x27;t help but feel it&#x27;s not the best practice to use a loose var here. Is there a more idiomatic way to achieve this?

 I&#x27;ve a project that contains several subdirectories, one of which is shown as foo. The build.sc is as follows:
 import mill._, scalalib._, scalafmt._ trait MyModule extends SbtModule with ScalafmtModule { def scalaVersion &#x3D; &quot;3.4.2&quot; def scalacOptions: T[Seq[String]] &#x3D; Seq( &quot;-encoding&quot;, &quot;UTF-8&quot;, &quot;-feature&quot;, &quot;-Werror&quot;, &quot;-explain&quot;, &quot;-deprecation&quot;, &quot;-unchecked&quot;, &quot;-Wunused:all&quot;, &quot;-rewrite&quot;, &quot;-indent&quot;, &quot;-source&quot;, &quot;future&quot;, ) trait MyTestModule extends SbtTests with TestModule.ScalaTest { def scalatestVersion &#x3D; &quot;3.2.19&quot; def scalacOptions: T[Seq[String]] &#x3D; Seq(&quot;-encoding&quot;, &quot;UTF-8&quot;) def ivyDeps &#x3D; Agg( ivy&quot;org.scalactic::scalactic:$scalatestVersion&quot;, ivy&quot;org.scalatest::scalatest:$scalatestVersion&quot;, ) } } object foo extends MyModule { object test extends MyTestModule } 
 Questions:
  
I want to apply the scalacOptions to only the main source, not test. Currently I achieve this by overriding the scalacOptions in the MyTestModule, but it&#x27;d be nice to be able to specify the target specifically instead of declaring globally and then overriding.
 Instead of having to list each submodule foo, bar, ..., it&#x27;d be nice to be able to add them dynamically. For this project, all subdirectories that don&#x27;t start with a period can be considered as a submodule.

                              <span>Is there a book that teaches writing a compiler in Haskell? I looked around and couldn&#x27;t find any.
 Please note that I am not looking for books that teach writing interpreters or VMs, or books that use languages other than Haskell, or Github projects of compilers written in Haskell.

                              <span>I want to begin learning functional programming. I have no prior programming knowledge or experience. I am comfortable with spreadsheet formula though and to my understanding spreadsheets are a form of functional reactive programming. 
 Are there any courses or learning resources out there for beginner programmers coming from spreadsheets seeking to learn Haskell (or other functional first languages)?

                              <span>I got into functional programming a few years back and was then introduced to category theory, specifically Bartosz&#x27;s book and video series (link). I read it during my spare time for a span of around 2 years and just finished the last page. Despite having little math background other than the few math classes that are typical for a computer science major, and not being able to come up with many relevant examples, I enjoyed reading through the book and tried my best to follow along every part, except coends.
 However, I struggled with the challenges in the book. I had to look up for solutions, or just failed to understand them at all, for more than half of them. I also didn&#x27;t realize until the last few chapters that I kind of got natural transformations wrong. I thought it&#x27;s a morphism of F a -&gt; G a, but really it maps any object a to a morphism F a -&gt; G a. I noticed that my retention for the knowledge is low. In other words, I forget the details of concepts in the book pretty fast. I tried to explain to myself verbally the concepts I learned, but I can feel it&#x27;s wonky sometimes.
 I&#x27;d like to ask what are the next steps for me? Should I go through a different text, maybe &quot;Category Theory for the Working Mathematicians&quot;, or others like &quot;Category Theory in Contexts&quot;, hoping that maybe they&#x27;ll solidify and expand my learning from a different aspect? Or should I learn a few other branches of math that I&#x27;m interested, and come back to category theory and see how they relate? Or?

                              <span>Hello Org community,
 I&#x27;m looking to create a custom agenda command that filters all entries associated with the categories work and business. I already have separate files named ~/org/work.org and ~/org/business.org, and from what I understand from documentation, entries in these files automatically and implicitly receive the corresponding categories.
 However, while I don&#x27;t often do this, it&#x27;s possible that I might explicitly set a :CATEGORY: work property somewhere else in my org files. Given this, I need a command that will capture all entries either from the ~/org/work.org and ~/org/business.org files OR with :CATEGORY: work, OR :CATEGORY: business set explicitly.
 Below I will give examples of records that I would like to filter in this way:
 ~/org/misc.org (by property)

                              <span>Hi, everyone, here is my reference note on a 4x6 index card. I normally only do journal and reference notes on paper and main notes in Obsidian.  My question is do I need to give reference notes an alphanumeric ID? Because I did find it difficult to locate a single source card in the pile of cards from one book, but because my main notes are in Obsidian, I’m not sure how to deal with the IDs at two places without breaking continuity</span>

                              <span>I have an enterprise CRUD appliaction, consisting of multiple services such as equipment, tasks, clients, eployees etc. They&#x27;re not microservices at all, but rather modules within the mononlith Scala app.
 At first every service had its own algebra, e.g.:
  trait Employees[F[_]]: def addEmployee(person: Person): F[Unit] def vacation(employeeId: UUID): F[Unit] def findByDepartment(departmentId: UUID): F[Option[Employee]] 
 Basically a DAO. Sometimes it also does some authorization checks, but mostly its about communicating with the storage. It was cool at first:
  
Different implementations for different storage targets
 I see dependencies of every function e.g. def findEquipment[F[_]: Equipment: Employees]
 Additional type-safety - it&#x27;s nice to see that a particular function works with Employees only
 Testing
  
However, after some time:
  
We&#x27;ve picked a single storage target
 There&#x27;s no big difference in terms of dependencies with def findEquipment(equipment: Equipment[IO], employees: Employees[IO])
 Type-safety is a win in 10-20% of functions because many have 4+ algebras or even Async
 For testing I just use the same implementations with empty DB - DB is an important aspect of behavior that I need to carefully duplicate for each testing implementation
  
Tagless Final is advertised for DAO in almost every tutorial, but does it really make any sense? I switched to more concrete services and hardly going to regret. I still have TF, but for much lower-level things: Logging, Tracing, Queing etc. What is your experience? To me it looks like TF make sense in DAO only in educational materials.

                              <span>Hi there! 
 I&#x27;m a very inexperienced programmer, and I&#x27;m planning on buying a surface pro 11. I have haskell in my upcoming classes, but I&#x27;ve heard people saying it&#x27;s more complicated since its a windows arm based system. I&#x27;ve programmed a little haskell on my home pc (not ARM based) and the downloading process was fairly straightforward. So I&#x27;m wondering whether it&#x27;s possible to program haskell on a new surface pro without jumping through a lot of hoops, or if it&#x27;s close to the experience on a PC.

                              <span>A minimal example of what I&#x27;m trying to do would go something like this. Say I want to write a class for &quot;wrapper&quot; types, like so:
 class Wrapper t where wrap :: a -&gt; t a unwrap :: t a -&gt; a 
 Now, of course, I could write:
 newtype Box a &#x3D; Box a instance Wrapper Box where wrap &#x3D; Box unwrap (Box x) &#x3D; x 
 But I&#x27;m wondering if it&#x27;s possible to provide a way for Wrapper to become stock-derivable so that I can write the more concise newtype Box a &#x3D; Box a deriving Wrapper. 
 I&#x27;ve tried searching for info on this, but I&#x27;ve only been able to find information about, just, how to use deriving in general.

                              <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;ve two small snippets, where I&#x27;m trying to expand one snippet inside another. As the snippet that gets expanded is always the same one, and it&#x27;s always expanded I&#x27;ve been trying to use yas-expand-snippet and yas-lookup-snippet in a transform on the field...
 My first snippet is something like,
 # key: CMakeVersion # name: CMakeVersion # type: snippet # -- ${1:Major}.${2:Minor}${3:.${4:Patch}${5:.${6:Tweak}}}$0 
 While the second snippet, that I want to expand the first into is,
 # key: cmake_minimum_required # name: cmake_minimum_required # type: snippet # -- cmake_minimum_required(VERSION ${1:Minimum$(yas-expand-snippet (yas-lookup-snippet &#x27;CMakeVersion))}${2:...${3:PolicyMax}}${4: FATAL_ERROR})$0 
 The transform seems to replace the $1 field with just a t (maybe like this?) and I&#x27;m not sure I follow why this is happening? I&#x27;ve tried with and without yas-triggers-in-field in the snippets and my config, but I&#x27;m unable to get it to play...
 Am I going about this the wrong way? Is there a better approach? Or can someone spot my mistake?!?
 Thanks, IGS.

                              <span>I may have asked this before when it was hypothetical, but: I have a new M3 mac coming next week; my first non-linux laptop in over 20 years. I know there are a bunch of ways to install emacs on Mac. I&#x27;d like to choose something fairly simple if possible. I&#x27;d like to run stable releases rather than git dailies (mostly to avoid recompiling all packages on a daily basis). I&#x27;ll be using elpaca with a pretty extensive config. 
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Hey people, I thought it could be interesting to share my hack to get heading-local variables in org-mode. They are actually buffer-local variables, but since I spend most of my time in narrowed org buffers, I decided to hook the modification of the local variables to the narrowing and widening of the buffer. I&#x27;m sure it has a lot of room for improvement, but so far it has worked well for me.
 The function hack-local-variables-property-drawer is the one to run when an org buffer is interactively narrowed or widened. Why interactively: you don&#x27;t want it to run 50 times in a row when calling org-agenda, for example. If it&#x27;s not the first time it runs in a buffer, it first restores the original values of the variables it changed last time. Then it reads the new variables from the &quot;LOCAL_VARIA…</span>

                              <span>I tried to make Emacs use the “Monaspace” font for proportional text. I really love this font, but it does not get rendered properly (refer to the attached screenshot). If you look at the text against the highlight line, you can see that there is lot more space below the baseline than there is above the median. Should I tweak the &#x60;line-spacing&#x60; or some other size to get rid of this problem? Any pointers are grealy appreciated!

                              <span>I&#x27;m an evil user, and I often define local leader bindings with the following definer from general.el:
 lisp (general-create-definer local-leader :states &#x27;(normal visual motion) :prefix &quot;,&quot;) 
 Using this like (local-leader :keymaps &#x27;org-mode-map &quot;o&quot; &#x27;hydra-org/body) works just fine, as long as the keymap in question belongs to a major mode (at least I think that&#x27;s the issue here). I&#x27;ve created a custom minor mode (the major mode that&#x27;ll be active is always lisp-mode, if that matters) and defined something in its keymap like so:
 lisp (local-leader :keymaps &#x27;my-mode-map &quot;l&quot; &#x27;my-function) 
 I can see the bindings for the default evil modes in my-mode-map just fine, enabled my-mode, but they don&#x27;t work as , still seems to be bound to the default evil/vim motion.
 What can I do to make , work as a prefix in this situation?

                              <span>I posted about the crashing of Emacs by xwidget-webkit-browse-url here.
 Traversing through threads on Emacs bugs, I found this chain that describes how one can avoid a crash. Namely, run
 emacs -q --xrm &quot;emacs.synchronous: true&quot; 
 (it has to be -q rather than -Q, as the latter ignores all X resources).
 This is fine for one-off uses of the xwidget-webkit browser, but I use Emacs in daemon mode, and
 emacs --init-directory&#x3D;~/my-init-dir --daemon --xrm &quot;emacs.synchronous: true&quot; 
 continues to crash (I specify the init-directory as I have it in a different location, the problem arises even without it).
 Has anyone found a way around this yet? FWIW, I&#x27;m still using Emacs 29.1, will upgrade soon to 29.4.

 I have (setq-default delete-by-moving-to-trash t). When I delete a file in dired, it is afterwards shown in the system trash. But when I try to open it there, I get the error /run/user/1000/kio-fuse-edvbfm/trash/FILENAME doesn&#x27;t exist.
 How can a file be moved by emacs and correctly be shown by the system, but not exist afterwards? Do any of you experience the same problem?
 I use Kubuntu 24.04 and Emacs 30.0.50.

 i&#x27;m trying to make it so that upon opening an agenda view, it automatically runs the command org-agenda-day-view so i won&#x27;t have to execute the command manually. i tried using org-agenda-span but it didn&#x27;t work. any help appreciated

                              <span>My team is using notion for shared docs. I tried writing directly on notion but 1. the subpage system is driving me crazy (a page can be a link, or can be a whole line! and if you delete the whole line one, the page will be deleted, and sometimes you don&#x27;t need whole line one; let alone the subpage being attached to parent so moving things around is another hassle) 2. It looks ugly compared to my emacs theme or website theme. 
 The pain plus the bliss of writting in org-mode made me wonder if there&#x27;s a way to write in org-mode and export it to notion. I guess if I have the bulk of the doc done at some permanent form(don&#x27;t need to edit much) I don&#x27;t care where it is on anyway. So what I&#x27;m looking for is a solution to 1. write a lot of stuffs in org-mode(possibly from lots of files linked together with org-id or file link) 2. slide them into notion as a cluster of pages. 
 I&#x27;m currently trying notion&#x27;s builtin import function https://www.notion.so/help/import-data-into-notion So far html is not working(failed with no error message), and I&#x27;m trying others, but I wonder if there&#x27;s others have done this before?
 Currently my solution is to 1. write my stuff with org-mode and publish to my personal website (e.g. https://hermanhel.codeberg.page/braindump-ui/#f351ae9c-c280-4c71-9b12-1b8ba4a4200d this some doc I wrote about using huggingface) 2. make a page on notion and stick link to my website there. But this way other&#x27;s cannot edit it.

                              <span>When I run org-ql-search and have a nice overview of findings in an org-ql-view-buffer, and then jump from there using RET on a line, the buffer changes to the jumped-to-buffer. I would prefer it to stay as the org-ql-view-list and open the jumped-to-buffer side-by-side to it, so I can jump to the findings one after the other and view them.
 Now, this works well by running toggle-window-dedicated after the org-ql-view-buffer is made up.
 How can I make this the preferred behavior? Would be great if there were an org-ql-view-after-show-hook I could bind it to, but there seems to be none. Is there another way to program &quot;toggle-window-dedicated should be run every time after I called org-ql-search&quot;?

                              <span>I discovered that in a paper-based system, with the size limit in a 4x6in card, I can easily force myself to only write each piece in a literature note as a reminder to an idea captured. But in Obsidian, I could write as many words as I want or even worse directly copy and paste and thus never think more deeply before taking notes
I’d like to know how you guys avoid quoting or simply paraphrasing and put the idea into your own words as a reminder or your own thought on others idea</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m going through the book Writing a C Compiler. The book uses pseudo code and it only recommends using a language with pattern matching since the pseudo code relies heavily on it. The reference implementation by the author is in ocaml. 
 I want to do this in Haskell but have no knowledge of writing compilers. I&#x27;m looking for advice on some libraries that might be useful for this and any other tips that might be helpful. 
 I consider myself an intermediate haskeller. I&#x27;ve gone through most of &quot;Haskell from first principles&quot; and have written a few simple backend services in it.

 Hi there!
 I recently started learning Haskell to gain a better understanding of functional programming. One of the things that caught my attention was raytracing, which is both fun and interesting.
 Haskell is a truly delightful language. Every time I solve a problem or learn a new approach or concept, using monads in real-life scenarios brings me immense joy. One of the most challenging tasks at the beginning was generating random numbers. I had to do a lot of reading and learning before I could efficiently generate them. The difference between Haskell and other languages is significant, and it takes some time to get used to it.
 I would really appreciate some feedback from experienced Haskellers. Please let me know what I&#x27;m doing wrong or inefficiently.
 Current result

                              <span>Yesterday, inspired by the post A tutorial quantum interpreter in 150 lines of Lisp I decided to write something similar in Haskell. Is not the best implementation but for me was fun because I had the opportunity to write some Haskell after a long time. So, I decided to post the package (hqcsim) on hackage.
 The package dependencies are hmatrix and random and currently it contains a library and an executable. I plan to maintain the package and write tests.
 A difference between the implementation presented in the article and hqcsim is that in the my implementation the measurement is implicit. In the article, there is a &quot;Measurement&quot; operator, as seen in the syntax definition:
  program :&#x3D; ( instruction* ) instruction :&#x3D; ( GATE matrix qubit+ ) | ( MEASURE ) matrix :&#x3D; a complex matrix #2A( … ) qubit :&#x3D; a non-negative integer 
 In my implementation, there is not MEASURE instruction, that being implicit at the end of the program.

                              <span>In the context of Direct-style syntax (Ox/Gears), I am curious if people have found a way to make it visible for devs that a method/def is doing some effect. Should we use annotations that are checked by the compiler?
 In functions as values, there is a syntax coming for pure functions: https://dotty.epfl.ch/docs/reference/experimental/purefuns.html, is there anything for methods?

                              <span>I know this is one of those &quot;easier said than done&quot; sorts of questions, and I&#x27;m not sure if this was discussed before. But is there any reason why plugins like those found in SBT don&#x27;t have a &quot;standard&quot; by which other build systems can use to interoperate?
 I ask this mainly because it seems like there is a good chunk of the Scala community that isn&#x27;t satisfied with SBT, but the main hurdle to any other competition seems to be the ecosystem of plugins that would be lost, or would require separate maintenance by OSS maintainers. Given that there are now several build tools, SBT, Mill, Bleep, Scala-Cli (sorta), Bazel, Gradle, and Maven, that can be used to compile and build Scala code, maybe there is enough examples to figure out a portable standard?

                              <span>Does anyone know if there&#x27;s a way to make a table of contents in org-mode whose links work with the Github renderer?
 I&#x27;ve tried both toc-org and org-make-toc packages, which claim to support GitHub. But something must have changed. 
 Each anchor that GitHub generates for a section header is preceded by the number of that header. So instead of github.com/me/bla.org#introduction it&#x27;s github.com/me/bla.org#1-introduction. Likewise for a sub-header it would be #12-nameofsubheader instead of just nameofsubheader.
 Neither TOC libraries seem to support this format, and I can&#x27;t find an easy org-mode function that will give me the proper number for a given section, that can work with the TOC stuff.
 I&#x27;m wondering: * Could I be doing something weird in my org-mode file that is making GitHub add the numbers to the anchors? * If not, are there any TOC packages that will generate the proper GitHub links?

                              <span>I want to run some code after any arbitrary elispf function finishes.
 The question may seem odd, since elisp is synchronous, but it can call async processes. For instance, it may call a compilation process. The elisp function would then continue as normal without waiting for the compilation buffer to finish.
 I know compilation mode has hooks to handle this, but I need to generalize this, not only for compilation mode.
 What is the use case? I am the author of conner. With it, you can define arbitrary commands that can be ran with arbitrary &quot;runners&quot;, such as compilation mode, various built-in terminals, or have the command be interpreted as elisp code.
 I would like to have the option of running hooks after a command finishes, but since the runners are interchangeable, and can be defined by users, I would need a generalized way to achieve this.
 Is it possible to run the function that runs the commands in a separate process, and wait for all child processes to finish or something like that? Although that would most certainly open a separate emacs instance or something, and I would like it to run in the current one.
 Thanks.

So my org document would contain several instances of banana, and clicking on it would take me to the designated occurrence of banana. A few days ago I got something like that to work, but unable to find how to do it for the life of me. It’s like the [[banana]] linking, but that simply refers to a heading, and requires the brackets. I recall having it work without the brackets and all instances of banana turning into links.

                              <span>Hey all, 
 I&#x27;m seeing lots of errors with inline errors in Emacs. While I&#x27;m typing, they get on the way, block me from navigating in the code. 
 I did not experience this behavior until recently upgrading packages. 
 Any ideas what might be causing this and how I can fix it ?

                              <span>Per previous post about using Org and Agenda, I&#x27;ve gotten things setup pretty well so far. However I&#x27;ve run into a very weird issue that I cannot figure out what&#x27;s going on. 
 I have two machines that both have access to a home network drive. On that drive, I&#x27;ve got a folder called Notes and that&#x27;s got notes.org and a bunch of Denote files. So far so good. 
 On one machine (the laptop) I can launch Emacs and do org-agenda n and it&#x27;ll pull up the day&#x27;s schedule and current TODO list. On the desktop machine, if I do the same, it seems to just hang. There are no error messages, just silence. I&#x27;ve had to process kill Emacs a few times now to try different things.
 Any idea what org-agenda is doing that would cause it to hang?
 UPDATE: I went into .emacs.d and deleted everything pertaining to org-mode persistence, history, and things like that. That seems to have solved the issue for now. I guess between the two Emacs sessions, something got out of sync. Wish I knew what though, or how to avoid it in the future.

                              <span>Is there a way to ignore dollar-sign when using calc to grab a rectangle?
 The specific case is using emacs to edit ledger-cli entries, and I want to total the values in a split-transaction. Here&#x27;s an example:
 2001-01-04 * (797) City of Austin Assets:Checking:UFCU:Bjorg -$59.62 Expenses:Util/Austin:Electric $23.29 Expenses:Util/Austin:Water $4.23 Expenses:Util/Austin:Water $5.48 Expenses:Util/Austin:Solid Waste $17.91 Expenses:Util/Austin:Water $8.71 
 So if I want to total all the entries using rectangle command and copy into calc like: C-x * r and then execute calc-vector-sum (or &quot;u +&quot; inside calc), I can&#x27;t select a rectangle with &quot;$&quot; in it. Otherwise, I get an error like:
 calc-do-grab-rectangle: $’s not allowed in this context
 I understand I could reformat the text so the &quot;$&quot; won&#x27;t get selected, for example adding spaces between &quot;$&quot; and the amount like this:
 2001-01-04 * (797) City of Austin Assets:Checking:UFCU:Bjorg -$59.62 Expenses:Util/Austin:Electric $23.29 Expenses:Util/Austin:Water $ 4.23 Expenses:Util/Austin:Water $ 5.48 Expenses:Util/Austin:Solid Waste $17.91 Expenses:Util/Austin:Water $ 8.71 
 I can then make sure I select the rectangle without the &quot;$&quot; before using C-x * :
 It&#x27;d be nice if I can tell emacs calc to ignore &quot;$&quot;, but I&#x27;m not that conversant with elisp. As far as I can tell, the &quot;not allowed in this context&quot; error is throwing an exception in calc-aent.el when it&#x27;s checking something with a defvar &quot;calc-dollar-values&quot;? Is that something I can customize in .emacs or init.el?

                              <span>I see that Emacs has many superfluous key bindings, especially C-f, C-b, C-p, C-n, C-a, C-e, C-d, C-v, M-v, which are for functions with already dedicated keys on the keyboard. The dedicated keys are easily accessible on my custom keyboards, so these default bindings do not benefit me at all, and they occupy convenient places for some more useful functions.
 Is there a keymap for Emacs designed to override these bindings with some functions which are useful and by default less easily accessible?
 A naive idea would be to replace the bindings with whatever I want. But that would not be optimal because that would free some slightly less convenient key combinations which could be taken by some slightly less useful functions, &amp; c., so an optimal result would move many functions from less convenient key combinations to more convenient key combinations. So it would have generally simpler key bindings maybe very different from the default ones. That design requires some serious thought, so reinventing this would be difficult, so I would rather look if someone has already done something like that.

 Cancelling with C-g does nothing and I just have to wait for the force close popup from my OS. (kill doesn&#x27;t even work!)
 It&#x27;s been an issue since I started using Emacs, but it&#x27;s been happening more often recently, probably because of more config?
 How on Earth do I even start to debug this?

                              <span>I primarily am a Java developer, and at the same time I want to stick with some java ideas, I want to try something cleaner and more functional, but I don&#x27;t want to change completely the way I think, yeah I want to use Scala features in a deep way, and don&#x27;t get me wrong, Scala looks a pretty different and cool language, but I really don&#x27;t want to fully quit the Java mindset. Yes, I know there is probably a &quot;better&quot; option, like Kotlin, but I don&#x27;t want to use it. TL;DR, at the same time I want to use some of Java frameworks/libraries (including the standard one) and features (annotations, enums, good concurrency, static typing, etc...), I want some of Scala goodies, should I use Scala?
 EDIT (please read): I think i have to add some context here, because maybe some people have understood me wrong... maybe because i didn&#x27;t explained properly. NO, I do not want to use bad practices from Java, and of course I will use Scala good practices, like I said, I want to use the features, frameworks/libraries and some code ideas, not the entire mindset or bad things from the language. If I wanted to use Java code entirely, I would use Java.

                              <span>Does anybody have experience parsing JSON in a UDF in aws glue? I need a scala json parsing lib.. ideally one that&#x27;s easy to use in glue.
 I know how to load a json file into a dataframe, but I cannot do this. The file is jsonlines and each row has an entirely different schema.
 So I have this:
 sc.textFile(args(&quot;input_path&quot;)).flatMap(x &#x3D;&gt; x.split(&quot;\n&quot;)).map(do_stuff) 
 ..but then no idea what to do inside do_stuff.

                              <span>Hello everyone! We are hosting a Haskell meetup in Vienna on the 26th of September! The location will be at TU Vienna Treitlstraße 3, Seminarraum DE0110. The room will open at 18:00.
 We plan to have 1-2 short talks starting at 19:00 (topics to be announced). Depending on interest there might also be a short Show &amp; Tell session giving people the opportunity to show off or talk about something they work(ed) on for 5-10 Minutes each.
 There will be time to discuss the presentations with some snacks and non-alcoholic drinks being provided afterwards with an option to acquire beer for a reasonable price.
 The meetup is open ended but we might have to relocate to a nearby bar as a group if it goes very late.. There is no entrance fee or mandatory registration, but to help with planning we ask you to let us know in advance if you plan to attend here https://forms.gle/Paiw6D4QJzTKzcmM6 or per email at haskellvienna.meetup@gmail.com. 
 We especially encourage you to reach out if you would like to participate in the show&amp;tell or to give a full talk so that we can ensure there is enough time for you to present your topic.
 We hope to welcome everyone soon, your organizers: Andreas(Andreas PK), Benny, Chris, fendor, VeryMilkyJoe, Samuel

It is a pleasure for me to greet you. Let me introduce myself.
My name is Diego, from A Coruña (Spain). I am a cultural manager and I am currently pursuing a PhD in Art History. For many years, I have tried to implement Luhmann’s method in my research, but I have always fallen short.
Recently, I discovered the forum and your software, which I find excellent! It is exactly what I was looking for.
Congratulations and thank you very much for your work.</span>

                              <span>In the context of my final year internship at Tweag, I’ve had the opportunity to work on the Glasgow Haskell Compiler
(GHC), in an attempt to speed up compile times.
GHC is renowned for many things, but compilation speed isn’t one of them.
One specific problem exposed in issue #20264 is that in Core,
GHC’s intermediate representation, types are systematically inlined, resulting in large type trees having to be
traversed and transformed along the pipeline.
This blog post aims to explain why this is the case, in which situations it can result in slow compile times and large
memory usage, and what we can do about it.

The problem
Let’s take the example from the motivating issue #20264.

 I&#x27;ve tried to put the &quot;glut32.dll&quot; file everywhere (in the .exe dir, in the cabal dir, in the .hs dir etc etc) but I can&#x27;t get it to work
 What can I do?

 I have dira/some.txt open in one buffer. In the other of 2 buffers, I used dired to load dirb/some.txt. Emacs then replaces the other buffers so both have dirb/some.txt open. How can I prevent that, so I can compare the 2 different files?

                              <span>What the title says. I keep encountering every file being flagged as different, only to find they are reported identical by ediff once I compare the 2 (from edirs).
 Is there a way to get edirs to also ignore whitespace differences?

I&#x27;d like to write a major mode for that language so that I can get highlighting/indentation/etc, but I&#x27;d like to be able to hand-off to c++-mode for the C++ bits. Is that possible?

                              <span>My eww is slow with port 443 for all websites.
 I found a previous message here from 5 years ago stating this was a tls 1.3 issue.
  
I don&#x27;t know how to disable it and my searching hasn&#x27;t found any realistic ways
 
I don&#x27;t think it is smart to disable tls 1.3 as that sounds unsecure
 
 My eww settings are vanilla - nothing changed. I can get to https urls via firefox without any delay.
 Thoughts?

 any solution for this behavior?

 &quot;(set-face-italic &#x27;font-lock-comment-face nil)&quot; does not work.
 Neither does wrapping the specific text in code or verbatim.

                              <span>I am excited to finally announce the release of Forge version 0.4.0, consisting of 699 commits since the last release two years ago. It was actually released six days ago, at the same time as Magit and nine other packages, which all had to be released at the same time.
 To avoid getting myself into a similar situation again, I intend to release much more frequently going forward. So it is with delight, that I can report, that today I have already released version 0.4.1.
 More information can be found in the release announcement.

                              <span>Hello folks,
 So I find output of &#x60;xref&#x60; a bit unreadable, esp if a symbol is being referred in multiple files. So, I wanted to specify different color/font attributes for lines that contain name of the file where symbols are defined. 
 I noticed that - file name line although doesn&#x27;t have a different face, it does have a text-property called &#x60;xref-group&#x60;. Is there a way to colorize and specify some font attributes(such as bold) based on text-property.

                              <span>So I&#x27;m trying to learn elisp (bit by bit), and solving some problems on online website. I&#x27;m encountered following syntax couple of times.
 lisp (equal :sublist (list-classify &#x27;() &#x27;(1 2 3))) (equal :equal (list-classify &#x27;() &#x27;())) (equal :superlist (list-classify &#x27;(1 2 3) &#x27;())) 
 The task is to implement function list-classify that checks whether 2 list are equal or unequal or superlist or sublist (of one other). 
 I&#x27;m not asking how to implement it (please don&#x27;t tell me the solution). Just asking what does : represents. I don&#x27;t know what it&#x27;s called, (and more importantly what to search about on internet) where to read only about this part. 
 Currently I&#x27;m just lost directionless in the sea of elisp-manual. Don&#x27;t even know what to search in it.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been using Scala for many years. When I first started, Scala IDE (on Eclipse) was the only real IDE available, and it was terrible. Things have gotten a lot better since then with IntelliJ. However, in the past year or two, IntelliJ has become extremely unreliable for Scala. What do you all use for Scala editing these days?

                              <span>Is it possible to translate this contrived Haskell code to Scala 3?
 class Capture a where name :: Text instance Capture Int where name &#x3D; &quot;int&quot; instance Capture Bool where name &#x3D; &quot;bool&quot; data Captured &#x3D; forall a. Capture a &#x3D;&gt; Captured nameOf :: Captured -&gt; Text nameOf &#x3D; \case Captured @a -&gt; name @a 
 I assume &quot;Captured&quot; has to be a case class, but I struggle with the forall part. I&#x27;ve tried various permutations that contain &quot;using&quot; and/or &quot;[A]&quot;, but so far they&#x27;ve all resulted in &quot;polymorphic function types must have a value parameter&quot; errors.

                              <span>I have a org-mode file that is tangled to create various userconfigs. Given that the emacs-android package is pretty stable (and works great with e.g. texlive from termux), i want to tangle sourceblocks from the file. I am thinking of maybe adding tags like &quot;android&quot;, &quot;notebook&quot;, &quot;server&quot; and the like. I then want to call e.g. org-tangle-mobile to create files from all blocks with this respective tag. My brain is telling me i saw something like this before but i cant find the reference again or figure out how to so just by reading the Manual. Any experience?

It has been two years since I started Zettelkasten. Thanks @Sascha and @ctietze 
But I ran into one problem.
GIGO; I think that if you do Zettelkasten with bias, your wrong beliefs will become stronger.
How can I solve this?

 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;elisp (use-package org :bind ((&quot;C-c t&quot; . org-capture-goto-target)))
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; But I got the following error: Autoloading file /usr/local/share/emacs/29.2/lisp/cus-start.elc failed to define function org-capture-goto-target.
 Why is this the case?

                              <span>I tried the built-in one. Wasn&#x27;t very impressed. It doesn&#x27;t show all files in the same tab bar by default? (I can get having tab groups, but I don&#x27;t really want it to assume that.)
 And the tab bar is... bad. Small, hard-to use, and very ugly.
 Is there something better I should try?

                              <span>Hey guys, I have been wanting some emacs-like mindmap app for a very long time, and all the while I&#x27;m thinking of implementing a lisp myself in a similar way. 
 It just downed on me that as complete emacs is already as a lisp machine it probably just lacks builtin API for a canvas, so I can probably fork the C part, keep only the language core and runtime(and keybinding system, I don&#x27;t know where it is yet), ditch the text-editor part, add canvas support with qt or something, then build a mindmap API in elisp.
 How doable do you think this is? Will emacs source be too tangled with the text-editor part for such thing, or is there some obviously better way to build a lisp mindmap app?
 ps: for reference, the mindmap app I&#x27;m thinking about is one with emacs-like lisp runtime and keybinidng system. That along I think will be enough for most things to be built on top off.

                              <span>I have ~/.config/emacs, with the usual init.el and early-init.el. I just learned about the no-littering package which looks great. I use elpaca for my package loader/manager. I&#x27;ve run through the migration process, all works OK when I do (use-package no-littering :ensure t) near the top of my init.el. But to really clean up, I want it to handle my eln cache, which I think means I need to load it in my early-init.el so I can call startup-redirect-eln-cache on it. But of course elpaca isn&#x27;t set up there. If you have a similar config to mine, how do you handle this case?
 Same question for &#x60;elpa&#x60; and &#x60;elpaca&#x60;: I&#x27;d like those to go into &#x60;var/&#x60; but there&#x27;s a chicken-and-egg problem. What do you do?

                              <span>In a new job I have vowed to take better notes and I like the general Denote philosophy. So it&#x27;s installed, I&#x27;ve created a note, and so forth. 
 Does anyone have suggestions on the best way to set these things up? If I put a TODO in a note, it would be nice to be able to see an agenda view of uncompleted notes and links to where it was generated. I&#x27;ve read through the Agenda section in the Org manual but I&#x27;ll be honest, it was kind of long on detail and short on practicalities. I think I managed to get it work if I had a single agenda file in the ~/.emacs.d directory but what I&#x27;d like is something more comprehensive.
 I know it&#x27;s sort of a personal thing how people set it up, but I&#x27;m kind of starting from scratch on this and some models would be good. Thanks!

                              <span>Hey folks,
 I feel quite frustrated with the instability of counsel-projectile. I trigger &#x60;counsel-projectile-find-file&#x60; and it randomly opens switch-project instead. The repository looks like not maintained anymore.
 I&#x27;m looking for a package that;
  
Allows me to switch projects easily
 
find files within project
 
Switching to other buffers in project
 
Search for code within the project.
  
And I&#x27;m looking for a fast UX. Any suggestions? 
 Here&#x27;s my current keybindings:
 (define-key projectile-mode-map (kbd &quot;M-p f&quot;) &#x27;counsel-projectile-find-file)
 (define-key projectile-mode-map (kbd &quot;M-p p&quot;) &#x27;counsel-projectile-switch-project)
 (define-key projectile-mode-map (kbd &quot;M-p b&quot;) &#x27;counsel-projectile-switch-to-buffer)
 (define-key projectile-mode-map (kbd &quot;M-p s&quot;) &#x27;counsel-projectile-rg)
 (define-key projectile-mode-map (kbd &quot;M-p r&quot;) &#x27;projectile-replace-regexp)

                              <span>A few days ago I found out about Open RSS. So far I only use it to get beautifully crafted feeds of YouTube channels and playlists with video descriptions and thumbnails. 
 I could have just used the feeds provided by YouTube instead, only if entries would have thumbnails and video descriptions.
 I could have just used an “intelligent” reader like Feedly. But I don’t like proprietary garbage with integrated AI that just ends up making my life harder. And also it’s not Emacs. 
 I could have just an alternative frontend like Invidious. But playlist feeds don’t have thumbnails and videos, entries obviously link to invidious instances and not to YouTube directly and these public instances are slow. I didn’t have the resources to selfhost my own instance and just wanted a convenient, performant solution. 
 I could have just used Elfeed in conjunction with Elfeed-tube. These packages are actually great, but I’m a Gnus user. 
 For anyone with similar opinions and experiences Open RSS might be very well worth a try. For me it hits a perfect sweet spot. It’s also privacy-friendly and is developed in a transparent fashion. Although the source code is not publicly available, at least as far as I know. But that’s understandable as they’re kept alive by their user’s donations.
 Mark, the developer of Open RSS, is quick to reply if one encounters any issues and already helped me out once.

                              <span>Hi every, I am reading the book &quot;Thinking with types&quot; and I get confused about implicitly universally quantified. Sorry if this question is silly because English is not my first language.
 In the book, the author says that
 broken :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; a -&gt; b broken f a &#x3D; apply where apply :: b apply &#x3D; f a 
  
This code fails to compile because type variables have no notion of scope. The Haskell Report provides us with no means of referencing type variables outside of the contexts in which they’re declared.
  
Question: Do type variables have no scope or they are scoped within &quot;the contexts in which they’re declared&quot; (type signatures if I am not mistaken).
 My understanding is that type variables in type signature are automatically universally quantified, so
 broken :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; a -&gt; b 
 is equivalent to
 broken :: forall a b. (a -&gt; b) -&gt; a -&gt; b 
 forall a b. introduces a type scope. However, without the ScopedTypeVariables extension, the scope of a and b is the type signature where they are declared, but not the whole definition of broken.
 This quantification is to ensure that a and b in the type signature are consistent, that is, both occurrences of a refer to the same a, and both occurrences of b refer to the same b.
 Question: Is my understanding correct?
 Thanks.

 Safe resource management is impossible, every transitive mechanism is exposed, tracing dependency graph is impossible, async initialization of certain components is convoluted as fuck.
 So let&#x27;s move it.
 Where do I start? How do I trace components without dependencies? How can I make PRs that are as little disruptive as possible?

                              <span>I see a lot of different systems for numbering cards.
It seems to me that using a three- letter alphabetical code at the beginning would help organize better.
For instance LOG is Logic PHI is Philosophy.
Instead of having arbitrary numbers that have to be remembered, a three-letter code could kind of be like an airport code where it makes it really easy to remember, and of course they would be filed alphabetically and then numerically.
Why not?</span>

 1) One
 2) Two
 3) Three
 So there cannot be any space in between because if so inserting a new element will restart the count
 1) One
 2) Two
 1) One
 Is there a way to avoid so?

First it was /u/danielciocirlan with /u/odersky and this video https://old.reddit.com/r/scala/comments/1eksdo2/automatic_dependency_injection_in_pure_scala/
 Then /u/jivesishungry (and then /u/dgolubets ) with this post https://old.reddit.com/r/scala/comments/1eo3lc3/automatic_dependency_injection_using_implicits/
  
I think we can do it even simpler. Relying just on Scala&#x27;s implicit mechanism:
  
for components that are to be wired together, use case classes, so that Scala generates apply method to construct it
 use a helper method, which will call this apply, but fetch the arguments from the implicit context; we can call this method fromContext, more on it later
 have all the components …</span>

                              <span>Hello, I&#x27;d like to experiment with Scala.js but I found it quite cumbersome to install a specific npm package: tonejs. My &#x60;Main.scala&#x60; file looks as follows:
 @JSExportTopLevel(&quot;Main&quot;) object Main { def main(args: Array[String]): Unit &#x3D; { println(&quot;Hello, Scala.js!&quot;) val Tone &#x3D; global.require(&quot;tone&quot;).asInstanceOf[js.Dynamic] val synth &#x3D; Tone.Synth().toDestination() synth.triggerAttackRelease(&quot;C4&quot;, &quot;8n&quot;) } } 
 And my build.sc:
 import mill._ import mill.api.Result import mill.scalajslib._ import mill.scalajslib.api._ import mill.scalalib._ import mill.scalalib.scalafmt.ScalafmtModule import mill.scalanativelib._ import mill.scalanativelib.api._ object tone extends ScalaJSModule { val platform &#x3D; &quot;js&quot; def moduleKind &#x3D; T { ModuleKind.ESModule } def scalaVersion &#x3D; &quot;3.3.1&quot; def scalaJSVersion &#x3D; &quot;1.16.0&quot; def ivyDeps &#x3D; Agg( ivy&quot;org.scala-js::scalajs-dom::2.8.0&quot; ) def npmDeps &#x3D; T{ Seq( &quot;tone&quot; -&gt; &quot;latest&quot; ) } } 
 However, when runnin &#x60;node out/tone/fastOpt.dest/out.js&#x60;, the compiler complains with:
 export { $e_Main as Main }; ^^^^^^ SyntaxError: Unexpected token &#x27;export&#x27; 
 Am I missing any extra configuration? I kindly appreciate any suggestion.

                              <span>[solved]
 the issue was rustic getting uninstalled but its unneeded dependencies not having been cleaned, so rust-mode was viewed as an orphaned dependency and not listed 
 im currently trying to install Rust-Mode but it i keep getting the message that it cant be found and looking at the package list there is no rust mode to be found https://imgur.com/a/tnbLKCl, i tried package refresh but it hasnt fxed the issue either

                              <span>Looking into the git repo of eglot the project seems a bit inactive. Last commit is 8 months ago.
 There are some old PRs just fixing typos in the README.md that never got merged. I am concerned.
 The README itself doesn&#x27;t give any news about the status or plans. Does anyone knows more?

                              <span>I&#x27;m getting some awkward behavior with multi-select checkboxes in the customize interface (i.e. custom variables with :type &#x27;(set...)). I originally was experimenting with erc-modules, but it&#x27;s demonstrated equally well with this defcustom:
 (defcustom my-test-customization &#x27;(one) &quot;Let&#x27;s test customization!&quot; :type &#x27;(set (const one) (const two) (const three) (const four))) 
 If you evaluate this and try to change it through customize-option, there are a few bits of surprising behavior:
  
When you first open the customize interface, one is checked by default, but the &quot;state&quot; widget says that the variable is edited, and the shown value isn&#x27;t in effect. If you C-c C-c nothing seems to change--one is still checked--but a describe-variable on my-test-customization says the value is now nil! Wit…</span>

 But when I&#x27;m on *eat* or *vterm* buffer, it prompts me for a Git repository to open, like it doesn&#x27;t know the current directory is already a Git repository.
 How to make the behavior of M-x magit-status on *eat* and *vterm* buffers the same as the one on *ansi-term* buffer?

 I am currently editing legacy code base that suffers from non-consistent code formatting rules. 
 Instead of having Emacs automatically format all source code automatically, which I normally do, I&#x27;d like to know if you guys found a way to format only the lines you have changed in your daily work? Maybe even in a automatic on-save -way?

 i wanna open two side by side windows and start two different modes on them on startup. i&#x27;m familiar with hooks and opening two windows next to each other, but not sure how to write a function that I can run via cli -f flag that&#x27;ll open a specific mode in each window. any chance somebody can give me an example function def that I can build on?

                              <span>Hey Haskell enthusiasts!
 I just published a new blog post that dives deep into the Maybe Monad, exploring not just its theoretical underpinnings, but also its real-world applications. If you’ve ever wondered how this seemingly abstract concept can solve real-world problems, from handling uncertainty in finance to ensuring data integrity in cybersecurity, this post is for you!
 Check it out here: Unlocking Real-World Power of Monads: A Deep Dive into the Maybe Monad
 I’d love to hear your thoughts and any insights you have on applying monads to practical problems. Let’s discuss!

                              <span>Hello,
 I have dabbled with org-mode a bit in the past and then kind of stopped using it. In the meantime I switched to Colemak-DHm and an ortho split Miryoku keyboard so I feel like I will be starting from scratch again essentially.
 I am interested in using both org-roam and org-mode and I would like some guidance on how to get started. Besides the general advice, I have some specific questions.
  
Is there a recommended order in which to learn them?
 
Is org-roam just some extra commands on top of org-mode?
 
Do I need to adapt something (i.e. change location of keys) because of Colemak?
 
My use cases include notes for work and learning and I would also like to start keeping a personal diary. Shall these go to separate knowledge bases or in the same?
  
Thanks for all the answers in advance and have a nice day/night (wherever you are in the world :p)

                              <span>Minimal Emacs
 An Emacs modular template for early-init.el &amp; init.el as a kick starter to a custom Vanilla Emacs configuration that is optimized for performance and sensible settings.
 Author: James Cherti
 Github: https://github.com/jamescherti/minimal-emacs.d
 This is a base starter kit for vanilla Emacs. It&#x27;s really just an optimized early-init.el and an init.el that strives for fast startup times and sensible default settings. All the magic that is necessary is included. This is really nice because there&#x27;s a lot of conflicting information online about the best way to optimize GC, etc. in early-init.el and this project does it for you. I&#x27;ve seen similar settings but I also saw some new stuff I didn&#x27;t know about. 
 It is designed to keep those two files in git so you can update Minimal-Emacs. Setup additional modules for user customization in pre-early-init.el, post-early-init.el and pre/post for init.el as well. 
 It&#x27;s up to the user to add to the base. If you start with this kit then proceed to watch System Crafters Emacs from Scratch series, it will get you up and running very quickly. 
 James put a lot of effort into this base starter kit and I am digging it, no cap FR as the whippersnappers are accustomed to proclaiming. ;-)

                              <span>I recently switched to swaywm from gnome. I configured the org-download as follows
 #+begin_src emacs-lisp (use-package org-download :config (add-hook &#x27;dired-mode-hook &#x27;org-download-enable) (setq-default org-download-heading-lvl nil) (setq-default org-download-image-dir &quot;~/ko-pa-ni/images&quot;) (setq org-download-screenshot-method &quot;~/.scripts/sway-contrib/grimshot savecopy area&quot;) :bind ((&quot;C-c d s&quot; . org-download-screenshot) (&quot;C-c d y&quot; . org-download-yank))) #+end_src 
 Whenever I use org-download-screenshot, the grimshot kicks in and I can draw a rectangle to capture the area I want on the screen, but then emacs freezes and there is no image found under the org-download-image-dir. I think it has to do with grimshot and org-download not communicating. Having no image in the directory tells me that org-download takes care of pushing the image to the configured directory but grimshot usually saves to ~/Pictures/screenshots but even there I cannot find the screenshots.

                              <span>I do get this error (Emacs 29 from Debian 12 backports) after updating all my packages after a long while:
 File mode specification error: (void-variable ) 
 I am not sure but I think I identified the error causing lines (see :hook) in the init.el.
  (use-package python :ensure nil ; in-build! :hook (python-mode . (lambda () (if (not (string-equal (system-name) &quot;quark&quot;)) (eglot-ensure))) ) (python-mode . ws-butler-mode) (python-mode . hs-minor-mode) :custom (python-shell-interpreter &quot;python3&quot;) ) 
 The intention of that hook is to start &quot;eglot&quot; only if the current systems name is not &quot;quark&quot;. I do share this init.el between several machines and &quot;quark&quot; is a RaspberryPi4 not able to run eglot and its backend in a performant way. This worked well a long time until I upgrade my emacs packages…</span>

                              <span>I have used obsidian for long time for taking math notes with inline latex parts, which depends on plugins latex environment, latex suite, quick latex for obsidian. I&#x27;m trying to migrate from obsidian to org-roam, because of keybindings. But I have one problem: latex parts renders in org-file very bad (image). How to solve this problem and how you think: take math notes in separate pdf-files which linked with org-roam or to take all notes in org-files?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been following along Real World Haskell, and getting the indentation right while following their style is infuriating.
 E.g,
 -- file: ch03/Lending.hs lend amount balance &#x3D; let reserve &#x3D; 100 newBalance &#x3D; balance - amount in if balance &lt; reserve then Nothing else Just newBalance 
 I find myself Pressing &quot;tab&quot; to overshoot the appropriate column, then hitting &quot;backspace&quot; in my editor to delete 4 spaces at a time (too many), then repeatedly smacking &quot;space&quot;, overshooting again, deleting 4 spaces again, etc....
 Since the appropriate number of spaces to indent changes expression to expression, are there any editor/plugins/etc. that would allow for &quot;contextual&quot; tab stops, so that &quot;tab&quot; and &quot;backspace&quot; simply add and remove the right amount of spaces relevant to the expression I&#x27;m currently editing? I&#x27;m currently using vscode with haskell-language-server.
 Or would it be better to simply adopt a style that ignores this problem entirely? I.e., Google leads me to https://kowainik.github.io/posts/2019-02-06-style-guide
  
The indentation of a line should not depend on the length of any identifier in preceding lines.

                              <span>So it&#x27;s assumed by default in projects and simple .hs files. I&#x27;m new to haskell, and I&#x27;ve already set up vs codium with the official package, which installs a lot of stuff for you. I would love recommendations for vs codium extensions too, as I haven&#x27;t programmed since college (CS) and I&#x27;m very rusty. I&#x27;m learning it strictly for fun, btw, to solve challenges, for example.
