                    <span>Here is how this all got started.
I was struck by an idea, &quot;What if...?&quot; not fully formed but enough to continue to bounce back and forth between my ears. The idea originally was, &quot;Wouldn&#x27;t be interesting to know how many times a person was mentioned in my archive?&quot; Then it quickly morphed with, &quot;What if there was more than one person I&#x27;d like to know how many times they were mentioned? What if I wanted this list to be keep up to date, tracking progress over time?&quot; And it has spread like head lice ever since.
You poor souls get to be the ones exposed to my attempts at learning to code. This is an experiment and my humble attempt at coding.
This all started with a personal itch. No! Not the kind of itch soothed with an ointment. It was the kind of itch that metaphorically is the spark that …</span>

                    <span>Hey all,
I recently created a theme for The Archive to suit my personal needs and I thought I&#x27;d publish it, in case somebody else finds it handy too:

I&#x27;d describe it as minimalist, high-contrast and equally suited for writing and coding (I store many code snippets in my Zettelkasten).
You can find it on Github: https://github.com/stephanbogner/the-coding-writer-theme
I also stumbled upon the &quot;The Archive Userland Themes&quot;-repository, so if there is any interest to add my theme to that, that would be cool too 
Let me know what you think!</span>

                    <span>Over the past year or so since discovering the Zettelkasten method, I have been doing my best to read more and to try and capture ideas that interest me. I&#x27;ve explored different mediums trying to find one that fit and for the most part have enjoyed the journey.
But, there continues to be one lingering concern... that I am just collecting and not making any real use of my notes.
I do my best to take quick notes while reading, putting them into my own words before adding these ideas to my slip box and expanding on them... but even after that, it still feels like I am just creating collection of other people ideas.
This leads me to ask two questions. First, what are some strategies that you use to combat this? And, second is this sort of feeling fairly common as your system grows?</span>

                    <span>In my job I edit a lot of text files. Gvim has a lot of options that make editing text really fast. Like yyp to copy a line and paste it or * to automatically search for the word under the cursor. 
 I often end up with a lot of vim windows open that create a clutter. I also have a lot of projects to work on and I need some place to keep my notes for these and organize my tasks. I hear that managing such things with emacs should be easy with orgmode and that it should be able to match the text editing provided by vim.
 However most of the things I find are related to installing packages from the internet. At work I don&#x27;t have the ability to install anything. For vim pluging i am able to copy the plugin and create the files manually. Is this possible to do in emacs? 
 Also any tips for switching to emacs? I feel a lot slower with emacs to switch and edit file even though I find things like file browsing directly from emacs is much nicer than what is in gvim.
 So can the vanilla emacs match gvim in terms of text editing, and are there any features which are possible in gvim but not in emacs?

                    <span>I am on a computer I just recently started using more but pulled my init file from a different setup I&#x27;ve used a couple of times and somehow I think my Swiper install got erased and after installing it again it isn&#x27;t working. I don&#x27;t remember having this issue with the other two instances of Emacs I&#x27;ve set up, anyone have any idea? This is the error I am getting but I also feel like I didn&#x27;t edit my init file and I have used swiper on this computer earlier this week command-execute: Wrong type argument: commandp, swiper. The only thing I did recently was follow this setup because my keyring was wrong, which still isn&#x27;t working. Should I just get rid of this install and try again from scratch?

                    <span>In my init.el I need to define several functions that will return cons cells and the returned CDR depends on an argument to the function, like this:
 (defun foo1 (x) &#x60;(symbol1 . ,(+ 1 x))) (defun foo2 (x) &#x60;(symbol2 . ,(+ 1 x))) 
 (Context: I am defining several similar &quot;style dispatchers&quot; for orderless. My actual functions are a bit more complicated than this, but have a common structure.)
 I would like define a macro to build these functions for me. The naive thing to try is this:
 (defmacro build-it-1 (name symbol) &#x60;(defun ,name (x) &#x60;(,symbol . ,(+ 1 x)))) 
 But this gives
 (macroexpand &#x27;(build-it-1 foo1 sym1)) (defalias &#x27;foo1 #&#x27;(lambda (x) &#x60;(,symbol \, (+ 1 x)))) 
 Oh, so the &quot;inner&quot; backquote control ,symbol and there is nothing to expand there.
 (But the \, is weird. What happened to my cons cell?)
 So, let&#x27;s try this for the sake of the symbol:
 (defmacro build-it-2 (name symbol) &#x60;(defun ,name (x) ,&#x60;(symbol . ,(+ 1 x)))) (macroexpand &#x27;(build-it-2 foo1 sym1)) *** Debugger entered--Lisp error: (void-variable x) 
 OK. Now the symbol x is unquoted by the comma we just moved, so, uh, maybe this?
 (defmacro build-it-3 (name symbol) &#x60;(defun ,name (x) ,&#x60;(symbol . ,(+ 1 &#x27;x)))) (macroexpand &#x27;(build-it-3 foo1 sym1)) *** Debugger entered--Lisp error: (wrong-type-argument number-or-marker-p x) 
 Hmm. Elisp didn&#x27;t like that.
 I suspect that it is possible to do what I want with some combination of comma, backquote, and quote. I&#x27;ve tried (more or less at random) various strings like ,&#x60;(+ 1 x) and &#x27;,&#x60;(+ 1 x) but I can&#x27;t get what I want.
 What am I doing wrong?

                    <span>Sometimes I&#x27;d like to open a file in some chosen external application.
 For that I created Mediator, a very simple package which provides a simple open-with menu for Emacs.
 It can be used with Embark or with Ivy (including &#x60;all-the-icons-ivy-rich&#x60; support) actions.

                    <span>I use evil-mode virtually all the time and I use the key combination v$ to select the text to the end of line, but the $ key includes the line feeds so when I paste the text a new line is forced.
 My work around is to use the left arrow v$← to work around that but that feels like one key too many.
 Is there some other built-in for that, or is it Elisp time or macro time? I haven&#x27;t got into macros yet.

                    <span>desktop-save-mode had caused me issues before because of different ways of starting Emacs :- command line &quot;emacs&quot;, as a service (&quot;systemctl --user enable Emacs&quot;) with the system starting it, as emacsclient (emacsclient -c ) or even from your own startup with something like &quot;emacs --daemon&quot;. Anyway, this little snippet &quot;works for me&quot; and might be of interest to others. All self-contained in a use-package form. If starting as a daemon do the desktop read after the first frame is created, else do it immediately after emacs-startup-hook is triggered. The only thing that scuppered me a little was not checking the supplied emacs.service systemd config - it hardcodes the Emacs path, starting the wrong Emacs version and causing straight.el to recompile everything on startup : solution to that is copying /usr/lib/systemd/user/emacs.service to ~/.config/systemd/user and altering the paths to your own Emacs version (Debian paths there).
 The settings of desktop-save and desktop-path in combination with needing a desktop-read call are, on observation, what caused much confusion out there in google land. 
 Maybe not news to many, but I thought I&#x27;d share the snippet as googling showed it&#x27;s still an issue for some.
 ​
  (use-package emacs :custom (desktop-path &#x27;(&quot;~/.emacs.d/var/desktop&quot;)) (desktop-save t) :init (defun rgr/restore-desktop() (when (fboundp &#x27;alert) (alert (message (format &quot;loading desktop from %s&quot; desktop-path)))) ;;I include the run-with-timer despite being able to get this to work without as it&#x27;s a timing ;;issue and a little delay does no one any harm (run-at-time &quot;1&quot; nil (lambda() (desktop-read) (desktop-save-mode 1)))) (add-hook &#x27;emacs-startup-hook (lambda() (if (daemonp) (add-hook &#x27;server-after-make-frame-hook &#x27;rgr/restore-desktop) (rgr/restore-desktop)))))

                    <span>When you pick up a toad or a grasshopper they pee or vomit resp. It&#x27;s their defense mechanism to make themselves less appealing. Likewise Haskell, when you pick it up starts oozing mathematics. Most put it right back down. Here&#x27;s a quote from a brilliant blogger here who is describing &#x60;head&#x60; and how it must accommodate the empty list:
  
If we have a list, we might very well want to get the first element in it. And indeed, the operation of “getting the first element of a list” isn’t impossible in Haskell, it just requires a little extra ceremony.
  
&quot;Extra ceremony,&quot; indeed. So between Bird and de Moor&#x27;s Algebra of Programming and these one-off blog posts is a scavenger hunt for the math behind Haskell. Certainly a beginner doesn&#x27;t need any math to bust through one of the many starter tuto…</span>

                    <span>This year I installed haskell for college in the only session I had on the computer. When I went to create another user for me to have everything more organized and at hand, the computer did not recognize the ghci command to run haskell as it did in the other session, but it also did not let me install cholatey or haskell since it said that the program is was currently installed. How can I do?

                    <span>I went through some litterature and there they talk about overloading. 
 From what I understand Haskell does not support this in the most general sense, I can&#x27;t declare two functions of the same name. I can only do such a thing if I declare a typeclass, correct? Then I can in that class declare a function that can take a multitude of different parameters, depending on what I&#x27;d want? 
 Some clarity on this would be greatly appreciated! :)

                    <span>Hey everyone. I&#x27;m assembling a new team of engineers for working on a new long-term project in the payments area. We believe that Haskell may give us an edge in terms of maintainability and developer efficiency so I&#x27;m keen to meet anyone who is wanting to take a new position to work with Haskell in their day job.
 The project is almost entirely greenfield, so new hires will have a great deal of agency in steering how the tech stack will be shaped.
 We&#x27;re open to having remote employees. We sponsor visas and help with relocation too.
 I&#x27;m happy to answer any questions about the role here, but if you want to apply for the position, please use our page.
 About the company
 We are a leading, fast-growing Nordic fashion and beauty e-commerce company. You can find our headquarters in Malmö, Sweden, but we also have a few physical retail stores in the Copenhagen area. We also have development teams in Aarhus, Copenhagen, Vilnius, and Poznan. We are also running a fully automated warehouse in Ängelholm, Sweden.

                    <span>Total noob here but very dissatisfied with python as a language, dipped toe in clojure and Common Lisp waters but not doing it for me. Then I saw haskells partial application: let a &#x3D; (1 +) and my mind was blown. Watched a few presentations and I’m convinced this is the language to learn. I gotta learn this language. It appears it’s not really a ‘step 1 &#x3D; toy example first’ kinda language instead i need to study up and grasp a lot before using Haskell in real life problems. So any advice ahead of my journey to learn Haskell? I just realise there are so many expert haskellers here would love any advice that makes the journey as useful as possible. Do you think I should start with some basic tutorials then project Euler (or something similar)? Or better getter some great big book and reading all the theory first?

                    <span>Dear Orgers... :)
 In the org manual, &quot;7.5.3 Capturing column view&quot;, in https://orgmode.org/manual/Capturing-column-view.html#Capturing-column-view says:
  
Since column view is just an overlay over a buffer, it cannot be exported or printed directly. If you want to capture a column view, use a ‘columnview’ dynamic block (see Dynamic Blocks). The frame of this block looks like this: 
 #+BEGIN: columnview :hlines 1 :id &quot;label&quot; 
 #+END: 
 This dynamic block has the following parameters: 
 ‘:id’ - This is the most important parameter. Column view is a feature that is often localized to a certain (sub)tree, and the capture block might be at a different location in the file. To identify the tree whose view to capture, you can use four values: 
 -- ‘local’ - Use the tree in which the capture block is located. 
 -- ‘global’ - Make a global view, including all headings in the file. 
 -- ‘file:FILENAME’ Run column view at the top of the FILENAME file. 
 -- ‘LABEL’ - Call column view in the tree that has an ‘ID’ property with the value LABEL. You can use M-x org-id-copy to create a globally unique ID for the current entry and copy it to the kill-ring.
  
Since the option for ‘LABEL’ says, &quot;Call column view in the tree that has an ‘ID’ property...&quot;, my question is: how do you capture a column view that is in the same file, but another tree?
 For example
  
chapter 
 subtitle
 another subtitle that tries to capture the tree with logs
 
 another chapter 
 tree with logs (that can be seen as column-view)
 
  
As always, thank you very much for your generous help, time and attention... :)
 Best regards...

Declaration groups: where order of declarations suddenly matters in Haskell by Artyom Kazak
Let’s say you have a few types that reference each other. Now you want to generate lenses. And suddenly you are hit with this seemingly unrelated error. What gives?
Final tagless encodings have little to do with typeclasses by Ben Levy
I would like to argue that what people are referring to as final tagless is in fact just coding against an interface and that the novelty of final tagless really has very little to do with abstract interfaces.

                    <span>This is what i&#x27;ve done so far:
 (eval-after-load &quot;evil-mode&quot; &#x27;(progn (define-key evil-mode-map (kbd &quot;C-f&quot;) nil))) 
 And set the C-f:
 (global-set-key (kbd &quot;C-f&quot;) &#x27;isearch-forward) 
 But C-f still bound to emacs setting:(the output of C-h,k)

                    <span>Sorry for a weird title, I couldn&#x27;t think of a way to word it neatly. 
 Anyways, I have been using company-mode for a while now, and it has worked perfectly for me. I recently switched to using evil mode and now when I type, the company mode box pops up, but it doesn&#x27;t automatically put the cursor there. Instead I have to manually scroll down with C-n to get the a selection to the company mode box.
 I of course thought that it was an issue with evil mode, but nothing looks wrong to me. 
 Any suggestions of what could be the issue or any possible solution?

                    <span>Is there a hook for dired-do-shell-command so that the dired buffer can be refreshed automatically? I think this is a very common use case. 
 If there is no hook for this, is there another way to do this?

                    <span>I have set &quot;down-mouse&quot; to enable god mode and &quot;mouse&quot; to disable when I release the mouse key. This allow me to conviently toggle control using my laptop mouse. Its is a bit of a hack. I want to do the same for meta but with another mouse button but cannot understand how god mode works to do this on my own. An overview would understand what is going on and how it is able to do what it does.

                    <span>I write files to SSH shares and I automatically create the destination directories if they don&#x27;t exist. 
 The problem is if the share is not connected the files are created on the local hard disk instead of the network.
 Does Emacs have an option to check if a directory points to network share or a local directory?
 On Linux checking /etc/mtab is a possibility but I prefer something higher level that will work on Windows too.

                    <span>I&#x27;m trying to see if org-ref might work for me when writing in emacs. In a current project, I want to be able to write long-form citations of the type that one frequently sees in humanities texts. What I mean are footnotes that may include multiple citations, and some additional analysis. Here&#x27;s a random example:
 ​

 So what you have is a footnote with a citation in it, but also some text. Can you do this with org-ref?

 Guys, 
 What are your others bindings which you loved it while editing texts/programming?,
 may be not mentioned in emacs docs but actually highly productive (not evil).
 Thanks for getting me know . :)

                    <span>I put Emacs and Visual Studio side by side on my 4k Monitor and for some reason Visual Studio Code looks better from a color perspective. 
 Why is this so? and can I do anything to fix this? or is this just my imagination but some colors on visual studio code just look sharper and darker.

                    <span>Greetings,
 ​
 I installed google-translate library (https://hackage.haskell.org/package/google-translate)and i need help using it.
  
When i compile it i get these errors
  
​
 https://preview.redd.it/ka7psbf0f3371.png?width&#x3D;659&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;9b18bb562c9a5fb75bcb6aa0137b850c70f00b29
 Also, i should mention that in link that i provided it shows one more import
 import Network.HTTP.Client.TLS 
 that i had to remove cause it was throwing this error
 ​
 https://preview.redd.it/e8a28vtdf3371.png?width&#x3D;556&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;9eae177e7942bd119773b1f8cdc1c69e0c7b2f69
 My question is how do i get this API-key that is required?
 (Im using cabal to run this, if it means anything)
 ​
 EDIT:

 I forgot to include code, i also fixed some of the errors but i currently have &quot;pattern match failure..&quot; in line 13 (columns 11-57, which would be the whole line before &quot;&lt;-&quot; part) and still nost sure about this api thing in line 15

                    <span>I have GHC 8.10.4 through ghcup
 ghcup list -c installed : Tool Version Tags 
 ✔✔ ghc 8.10.4 recommended,base-4.14.1.0 
 ✔✔ cabal 3.2.0.0 
 ✔✔ hls 0.9.0
 I&#x27;d like to test haste-lang.org but
  
The recommended way is through haskell-platform
 With a ghc 7.X (7.6+)
  
I&#x27;d like to keep an isolated environment without VMs or heavy-volume tricks.
 Has anyone installed haste on a recent environment ? (of course cabal update &amp;&amp; cabal install haste-compiler fails on ghc 8.10+) Any advice to use haste while keeping ghcup ?

                    <span>I am happy to announce the 1.0 release of TTC (Textual Type Classes).
 The library provides the following functionality:
  
The Textual type class is used to convert between common textual data types. It can be used to write functions that accept or return values of any of these textual data types.
 
The Render type class is used to render a value as text. Avoid bugs by only using Show for debugging/development purposes.
 
The Parse type class is used to parse a value from text. Unlike Read, it has support for error messages.
 
Validate constants at compile-time using Parse instances.

                    <span>First some context:
As I understand Luhmann workflow...
He put every interesting thoughts he have as a permanent note without worrying too much. (Like a skeptic tank)
His notes are really short (generally 1 to 3 sentences).
I see nobody else using the Zettelkasten in this way. Lot of people create longer notes and try to synthesize before putting the ideas into the system.
Last but not least: the system is created for academic research in mind.
My frictions:
1) When I think and want to create new notes... having to search existing notes in the Zettelkasten stops my thinking flow.
I am wondering if it’s not better to just create note without connection when I think... and only then look at the possible connections. But that will create a lot of duplicates.
Or thinking more deeply before putting the note and find the connections. (But I feel I don’t leverage the Zettelkasten fully by this way)
2) When I want to create a new content... going to the Zettelkasten kills my creative flow. As I am not creating academic content (but marketing content)... The most important in the content isn’t the information, but the emotion (you can only put emotion in a content with your first brain in a specific mood)
Because of this 2 things... I am wondering if a Zettelkasten is the best tool for me.
And if it is... I am wondering why only luhmann work in a very atomic way without bothering of the quality of the note. And why mainy people create longer note with digital zettelkasten.
My question:
I deliberately don’t ask a specific question because at this point, I don’t really know what is the good question to ask myself.
Maybe: How to determine the best way of organizing the process and scope of permanent notes ?
Thanks for reading.

                    <span>I keep finding myself in the situation of wanting to put a citation to a statement but I can&#x27;t never remember where I read this piece of information. In some places, this is unacceptable so I have to improve. I&#x27;m an mainly interested in improving links to help me find a reference statements I want to make.
I was initially in awe of the concept of ZK but now I&#x27;m not so sure. I tend to think in pictures but this is all about text. I find that in order to link then you need to know the destination of whatever you want to link to. Yet, if I know the reference then I already have the link in my mind.</span>

                    <span>Hi, I’m very new to emacs and have been using org-mode to keep up with tasks at work. I have some pretty lengthy task descriptions and was wondering if I have something like
 * Task ** TODO This is the first line and this is the second line. 
 if it is possible to change both lines to green when I change the TODO to DONE. The syntax highlighting does not seem to carry over. If I add ** to the second line and change the TODO to DONE, it also does not seem to change it. I have searched online, but cannot find an answer. 
 Thanks in advance!

                    <span>I need something like Treemacs or Neotree (sticky buffer on the side) that shows recently visited buffers. Basically, (projectile-recentf) content in a fixed buffer.
 Anyone knows if something like that exists already?

                    <span>While I actively use SAMPA / Greek / TeX and even played with rfc1345 input method I cannot find input method for emoji.
 That stops me from becoming fluent nodejs software developer.
 Probably I&#x27;m mistaken in idea that emoji are represented by UTF-8 codepoints. Correct me if I&#x27;m wrong, because some environments (like GitHub .md or hipsters&#x27; web-chats) could render :smile: or ;) instead of UTF-8 symbol... In that case I don&#x27;t need -input-method but emoji trainer program ))

                    <span>I am using deft with my org-mode, and it has this annoying feature to kill whitespaces at the end of title lines.
 The problem is it constantly saves and remove the wihtespaces while I am typing, is there a way to disable it?

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been looking around for a bit and the closest I found was skewer, but I can&#x27;t seem to get it to work and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be quite what I want either. All I need is to be able to serve a directory as an HTTP server and have it auto-reload in my browser when I save any of the js, html, css, etc files in the directory.
 I would try to make sense of this myself, but I&#x27;m not quite proficient enough in Emacs yet.

                    <span>Is there a trick to store a gnus org-link when I C-c C-c in a message-mode buffer? The gnus links seem to look like gnus:$METHOD:$GROUP#$MESSAGEID, but I suppose message id doesn&#x27;t exist before the message is sent? (I&#x27;m doing Gcc: &quot;nnimap+fm:Sent Items&quot; which I guess means a copy is saved locally as I send it.)

                    <span>Hi, 
 I am wondering if some mu4e-users here might have suggestions about doing attachments. I have been looking at https://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/mu4e/Dired.html, but I&#x27;m wondering if there are better ways (e.g., pre-existing packages) to do this which I might be overlooking. 
 Cheers

                    <span>I am an emacs beginner, and trying to do some C++ programming in emacs. I am having a lot of trouble to get tabs to work in emacs like I would expect them to work like in Sublime Text.
 This is how my code looks in emacs:
 std::cout &quot;; std::getline(std::cin, source); Object* expr &#x3D; read(source); Object* evaluated_expr &#x3D; eval(expr, global_environment); std::cout  &quot;; std::getline(std::cin, source); Object* expr &#x3D; read(source); Object* evaluated_expr &#x3D; eval(expr, global_environment); std::cout &lt;&lt; print(evaluated_expr) &lt;&lt; std::endl; } return 0; 
 emacs seems to be inserting only one tab for even indentation that goes more than a level deep, and that is pretty frustrating to work with. I would rather emacs insert n tabs for n levels of indentation. How am I supposed to change this behavior?

                    <span>I&#x27;m trying to create a Mac installer for a project that uses the SDL2 library and a couple of extension libs.
 Currently when I build, things are linking against the libraries installed on my system via homebrew in /usr/local/opt/. However, when I package these libraries with my program they are not recognized as safe to run on others&#x27; systems, so in order to run my program a user has to go through a launch, crash, allow library to be run cycle for each of the libs I link against until everything is allowed. This is obviously a no-go from a user friendliness perspective.
 I figured if I could link against the Mac frameworks for the libs that they should be signed (as they&#x27;ve been released as frameworks) and the user would only have to go through this allow process for just my app executable (until I get it signed). However, I&#x27;m not sure how to link against the frameworks.
 I tried repointing the executable to the framework dylibs using the install_name_tool, but the versions differ between the homebrew and framework versions of the libs, which made my app not run -- I&#x27;ve since thought better of trying to use this method in case there were incompatibilities between the entry points of the lib versions.
 My next thought was that I would have to link to the frameworks at build-time, but adding the -framework ghc option when I run stack build doesn&#x27;t seem to have any effect -- it still points to the homebrew versions. Maybe the Haskell bindings are set to point at the homebrew versions only?
 This is the first user-facing application I&#x27;ve developed on Mac, so I&#x27;m in a bit over my head. I&#x27;d like to have the standard DMG/drag-the-app-into-Applications installer for the app, as I don&#x27;t know that homebrew would be the friendliest install method for my target audience.
 Any help or suggestions are appreciated!

                    <span>Hi all,
 I just released a new chapter focusing on IO in my online course Foundations of FP in Scala https://www.fp-tower.com/courses/foundations
  
Includes 16 videos, around 4.5 hours in total.
 Lots of exercises, including a very realistic one where we implement a search flight aggregator similar to skyscanner
 We’ll cover features such as by-name parameters, lazy evaluation, dependency injection, and concurrency.
 We’ll study the differences between IO and Future extensively. 
 This chapter is a perfect introduction to cats-effect, Monix and ZIO.
  
Let me know if you have any questions!

                    <span>If I have a generic type that could only be one of two types: Apples and Pears, how can I use a unique method from each of those traits generically?
 trait Apples { def aaa: Int } trait Pears { def ppp: Int } def foo[T](x: T): Int &#x3D; { // x.aaa OR x.ppp } 
 I know there must be a nice way of doing this in Scala. Also, is this called a polymorphic method?

                    <span>I&#x27;m a very keyboard-centric person, however sometimes I still like to use the mouse to scroll down certain files in emacs (usually docs and the like). Plus, I don&#x27;t really like scrolling line by line, so I&#x27;ve been trying to have emacs scroll smoothly.
 Sadly, I&#x27;ve found the emacs smooth scrolling experience to be janky at best: no matter what workarounds I use (I&#x27;ve tried several, including all of those listed on the emacswiki page as well as good-scroll.el), smooth scrolling feels sluggish, not fluid, and often unresponsive.
 I wonder what the root cause for this is. Most of the explanations I&#x27;ve read revolve around emacs&#x27; lack of animation support. For example, the github page of smooth-scroll.el states the following:
  
Scrolling sometimes pauses or stutters. It&#x27;s unclear exactly why, but one factor is that Emacs lacks animation support. Emacs has timers for updating the screen contents, which is enough for playing simple animated GIF files, but not enough for video playback or frame-perfect smooth scrolling.
  
My question is the following: what would it take to fix it? I know that emacs is very old, and some features might just be outside of its capabilities (at least for now). Is smooth scrolling support one such feature?
 I understand that emacs wasn&#x27;t made with smooth scrolling in mind, and I don&#x27;t mean to criticize and/or diminish the amazing work that went into it. I&#x27;m extremely happy with my emacs experience--smooth scrolling would just be the icing on the cake.
 Thank you in advance!

                    <span>I&#x27;ve recently started using vertico, marginalia and embark together, and it&#x27;s been great. I like that they&#x27;re relatively light weight.
 I&#x27;ve used helm for a long time, and it&#x27;s honestly very good, but I&#x27;m mostly only using it for its locate functionality now. I use everything search on windows, which in combination with the .dir-locals.el lets me set a search instance depending on the directory I start the search from. I know about projectile, of course, but it&#x27;s slower and more finicky than everything. (With everything, I can set up a search that spans many directories on many drives and make it a named instance, and then just query the named instance in the arguments.)
 Helm&#x27;s locate is the only decent and maintained way to do this that I&#x27;ve found. Scrounging up random .el files from EmacsWiki doesn&#x27;t really work for me.
 If there isn&#x27;t, no big deal. I&#x27;ll keep helm updated.

                    <span>Hi, I&#x27;m still fairly new to Emacs, I use Doom Emacs and I wanted to rebind some evil keybindings. I tend not to use t very often so I wanted to rebind it to evil-snipe-s/S so I can have evil-substitute. I did something like this in my config.el:
 (evil-global-set-key &#x27;normal &quot;t&quot; &#x27;evil-snipe-s)
 (evil-global-set-key &#x27;normal &quot;s&quot; &#x27;evil-substitute)
 (evil-global-set-key &#x27;normal &quot;T&quot; &#x27;evil-snipe-S)
 evil-snipe-s/S seems to work, but evil-substitute does not, pressing s still invokes evil-snipe-s, I imagine I might need to remove the old key binding in order to do that, but I don&#x27;t know how

                    <span>I wrote a blog article on migrating from Thunderbird to GNOME Evolutuion for email and calendar management. While this is not particular on-topic for here, I also took the chance and documented my method to link to emails from Org mode and generate those links in the first place. You might be interested in this use-case.

                    <span>This may well be obvious to those of you conversant with lisp, but...
 How do I get ibuffer to show me both sets of groups (the &quot;saved filter groups&quot; and also those from projectile via ibuffer-projectile). Both ibuffer-projectile:
 (add-hook &#x27;ibuffer-hook (lambda () (ibuffer-projectile-set-filter-groups))) 
 and what I previously had:
 (setq ibuffer-saved-filter-groups (quote ((&quot;default&quot; (&quot;org&quot; (or (name . &quot;^\\*Org Agenda\\*$&quot;) (mode . org-mode))) (&quot;emacs&quot; (or (name . &quot;^\\*Compile-Log\\*$&quot;) (name . &quot;^\\*scratch\\*$&quot;) (name . &quot;^\\*Messages\\*$&quot;))) )))) (add-hook &#x27;ibuffer-mode-hook (lambda () (message &quot;.emacs hook&quot;) (ibuffer-auto-mode 1) (ibuffer-switch-to-saved-filter-groups &quot;default&quot;))) 
 work fine, but I can&#x27;t get the results to combine. It seems I can have one or the other. The ibuffer-projectile documentation suggests that using ibuffer-projectile-generate-filter-groups is key, but I don&#x27;t get the projectile groups when I use that.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve finally gotten around to work on some updates for this package. The new version is on melpa, but I won&#x27;t put it on melpa-stable yet until it has been tested by more people. Noteworthy new features are:
  
the package now filters remote content from html emails to address issues with tracking in emails. This is currently quite naive, but users can customize filters. Any feedback / help from somebody who understands email tracking better than I do is appreciated.
 the new dispatcher view method determines how to show emails based on a set of customizable rules (e.g., you could use this to show remote content for trusted email addresses)
 you can now temporarily redisplay the current email using a different viewing method. For instance, to switch from filtering remote content for an email to showing remote content.

 I also check bin,spam and all the other folders on gmail but I simply do not have any unread mails. This is not a major issue but it is kinda annoying.

                    <span>A friend of mine complained about the un-pythonesque syntax of c++, so I&#x27;ve made a small minor mode that replaces braces with :. The indentation is provided by clang-format/aggressive-indent-mode. Braces are automatically shown upon editing nearby the :. It is pretty unpractical to work this way :P. The code is pretty abysmal ^^.

                    <span>Hi all, I&#x27;ve been working on bespoke-themes, which started out as a fork of Nicolas Rougier’s amazing work on elegant-emacs and nano-emacs. It sports a similar vibe, though some of the base colors are different and it is slightly less minimal and &quot;opinionated&quot; than nano-emacs. It also has the benefit of being (I hope) easily incorporated into one&#x27;s existing emacs as a theme, rather than the more &quot;distro&quot; style of nano-emacs (which is a great project, but maybe not for everyone). I&#x27;m hoping to submit it to MELPA before too long. Long story short though, I&#x27;m looking for advice on the following:
  
Organization of the theme files
 Elisp (I&#x27;m not any sort of programmer) 
 Whether I should break the mode line out into its own repo
 Any useful tips on colors (that you hate/like it is one thing -- I&#x27;m more curious about tips concerning visibility or contrast, etc.)
 Stuff to do before I submit it to MELPA (especially anything not covered by the README)
  
Thanks!

                    <span>Haskell beginner here: Is it good practice to mix both let and where bindings in a function definition?
 For example (with short being a short function and reallyLongFunc being a really long function):
 foo x &#x3D; let short y &#x3D; y * 2 in if odd x then short x else reallyLongFunc x where reallyLongFunc z &#x3D; z + 2 
 Using let at the top and where at the bottom allows me to arrange the function definitions next to where they are used, and allows large function definitions to not interrupt the logical flow of the program. However, I could also understand that it might be bad practice to use both let and where, because I have not seen this done anywhere, and it might be mixing expression and declaration styles.
 What do you think?

                    <span>Hello. I’m a professional Golang developer. I previous worked with Java for 10 years and Python for a few years as well.
 I tried to learn Haskell back in 2016 with the book “Real World Haskell. But I found the book to be really dry and frankly boring. It was a struggle to get through. And after about 8 chapters I saw very little “real world”.
 I find that most education material seems to run all examples in the repl. And that is just off putting to me. Especially when I see “real world” apps and I can’t understand what’s going on.
 Also I find that too many tutorials focus way too much on math problems. And that’s cool. But how do I get from math problems to building entire apps. To me there doesn’t seem to be any real progression.
 I know plenty of languages and I found I learn better by trying to build real things. Yet I find most Haskell tutorials and education shy away from showing real world applications. And reading source code is confusing since it’s hard to distinguish between built in functions and user defined functions.
 Anyway is there a middle ground between these heavily mathematical examples. And actual real world application. There seems to be a lot of ceremony in real world Haskell apps.
 I do enjoy the Haskell type system. And I like it’s expressiveness. I wish I could enjoy it like others do. I just have never got that “aha” moment because it’s hard to just jump in and get dirty with the language.
 Any suggestions?

                    <span>I&#x27;m writing a small wrapper package for the MLIR C API -- I&#x27;d like the bindings to be similar to the ones exported by [llvm-hs](https://github.com/llvm-hs/llvm-hs). However, I&#x27;m relatively new to the FFI (and Haskell in general), so I&#x27;m running into various build issues.
 I&#x27;m looking for someone with a bit of experience to chat with about the package: https://github.com/femtomc/mlir-hs
 In particular, I&#x27;m getting linking failures when I build now -- so I&#x27;m trying to communicate the correct information to &#x60;stack&#x60; so that it can find the C headers, etc. 
 Other random questions: is it possible to bundle this up so that Nix can manage the LLVM/MLIR dependency/versioning? If yes -- and someone is aware of reading material, I&#x27;d love to take a look and learn how to do this.

                    <span>I&#x27;m embedding images in org-mode using org-download, which saves the captured image that is in the clipboard, inserts the path as text in the org file, and then display the image inline. This works fine. [[file:.images/morepathstuff:/2021-04-12_04-44-34_screenshot.png]]
 But I can&#x27;t copy the image out, without drawing a rectangle around the image with a screen capture tool like flameshot. I can only copy the emacs image file path as shown above.
 How can I copy the image itself into the clipboard, and not just the emacs image file path? 
  
I&#x27;m do not want to use a file manager, find the image, and copy it, as file names are often long and un-intelligble, and I can have many images in one directory.
 I guess the preferred method would be some elisp function where I highlight an inline image (to select/highlight the path), and then it copies that path, interprets that path, finds the image, and copies the image itself into my clipboard. But I don&#x27;t think that exists yet.

For example, my first level headers are set to a height of 1.25 but when I type &#x27;TODO&#x27; in, it uses the standard size for that word. I&#x27;m not sure what I need to inherit.
 I&#x27;m using Doom Emacs and have only just switched from (neo)vim so don&#x27;t really know what I&#x27;m doing yet
 Edit: I noticed that if I do not add any custom formatting to todo&#x27;s with org-todo-keyword-faces this is default behaviour, but I can&#x27;t get it to work for customized faces.

 Example:
 * foo ** bar *** baz| 
 Where | is point, then the minibuffer shows &quot;foo/bar/baz&quot;.
 That gets annoying for long paths because the minibuffer resizes to fit multiple lines and such.

                    <span>Hi, any nvim users arround here? I was wondering if any of you tried using treesitter with scala. 
 Looks like a lot of other languages are getting awesome functionality with it, but scala doesn&#x27;t seem to be supported out of the box.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve written a book using org-mode and I&#x27;m trying to export as an HTML/website, similar to this example. That was written using R and Bookdown, but since it all ends up as CSS/HTML, I don&#x27;t see why the same thing can&#x27;t be replicated with org-mode. 
 I&#x27;ve been trying to use org-publish to do this, but I&#x27;m running into a couple of issues. 
  
I can&#x27;t seem to replicate the book structure of the above example -- it all comes out as one single long HTML file. I&#x27;m using separate files for each chapter, and then a main.org file where each chapter is included via #+INCLUDE statements. What is the best way to achieve this? In other words, I want a front page with a TOC, and then each chapter to be a separate page and to have previous and next links for navigation.
 
I&#x27;ve been using the org-ref package to cross-reference figures/tables/sections in the book, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to work across multiple files. E.g. if I am in chapter 4 and I want to reference something in chapter 2 (using the label: and ref: keywords respectively), org-ref doesn&#x27;t seem to recognize it. Any way around this?
 
Lastly, I&#x27;d very much appreciate any examples of books like this being made in org-mode and exported as HMTL/websites, for inspiration. Or &quot;book-themed&quot; CSS templates that can be implemented painlessly. The only one I&#x27;m aware of is the org-mode manual itself, but aesthetically it is very far from what I&#x27;m looking for.

                    <span>I have been testing Doom Emacs for last couple of days to maybe make the move to it. I am not a Vim user so my preferred method will be regular emacs bindings.
 What I am doing now is switching to emacs keybindings with C-z and then edit normally but when I am in an org file if I press TAB the headline gets moved to the right instead of folding or unfolding. 
 Anybody experiencing this?

                    <span>I&#x27;ve recently moved from Straight to package.el for package management (long story), and have been reading-up on how package.el actually works, I took some notes and figured I&#x27;d share. I&#x27;m surprised that so few configs I see on GitHub take into account the subtleties of how package.el works, particularly in how it interacts with Use Package.
 I think all of the below is correct, but if I&#x27;m missing or am wrong about anything please tell me in the comments and I&#x27;ll correct the text.
 Unsurprisingly, all of this is well documented in (info &quot;(elisp) Startup Summary&quot;) and (info &quot;(emacs) Packages&quot;) so I&#x27;m not writing anything groundbreaking here, just summarizing available information.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been using straight.el for a while now and am very happy with it. However, emacs being emacs I thought I&#x27;d try an alternative in borg. 
 There are three installation routes documented :- 
 1) as a secondary package manager
 2) using a seeded bootstrap
 3) using your own &quot;from scratch&quot; bootstrap
 ​
 I followed 3) since 2) meant cloning into my .emacs.d which is already a git repo and I didn&#x27;t want to potentially screw that over. Anyway, some trial and error I have emacs starting up with borg and I have 5 or 6 things assimiliated in to .emacs.d/lib.
 But is it correct that things not in there are loaded from ~/.emacs.d/elpa? I ask this because I&#x27;m not sure how this is then different from &quot;using borg as a secondary package manager&quot;. package-install still works installing to the elpa directory. This seems to make sense as there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a way to auto magically auto assimilate (but being very new to this, there might be one I overlooked).

                    <span>I think it would be great if the Emacs documentation was more accessible on mobile devices, either for those long journeys when you need something interesting to read, or at night in bed when you want to do some light reading (heh).
 Idea 1: Treat each manual like an Ebook
 The easiest way to do this would be to convert the source Tex files used to generate the online documentation into an indexed EPUB format, using pandoc or other.
 We could then rely on existing Ebook readers to handle the formatting issues, bookmarking, and search queries.
 Edit -- /u/alraban points out that there exists already an epub resource:
 http://epub-manuals.ourproject.org/blog/gnu-emacs-lisp-reference-manual/
 Idea 2: Treat it like a Bible App
 Bible apps are awesome, they come with the all advantages of Ebook readers (formatting, bookmarking, annotation) with the added bonus that they bundle all related material under a single app.
 Given the diversity of Emacs-specific material in GNU this could be a great way to contain several different manuals, over several different versions of documentation (with optional &#x27;diff&#x27; highlights), all in one place.
 There are a few FOSS bible app templates on github, but I&#x27;m not that versed in android development anymore so this is likely something I cannot do without a lot of effort. 
 Is there anyone in this sub who is versed in Android development and would be willing to evangelize the Emacs documentation on mobile? I&#x27;d be happy to chip in a few dozen coffee funds

                    <span>I usually keep
  
one emacs instance for general notetaking and capturing, agenda and etc.
 one emacs instance for every project that I work (usually limited to 2, I am trying out projectile, but still prefer separate projects hacked away in separate emacs instances)
 one for org-noter for reading pdfs - one instance per pdf
  
I love the integrated computing environment idea, making everything seamlessly work together, I am still honing my config to achieve that, but for the moment separate instances workflow helps me get things done.
 I am thinking of exploiting chemacs in combination with .desktop files to launch emacs to specific tasks, but is there a better way to do this?
 EDIT:
 as u/sjchy pointed out,
 Visually differentiating workspace is vital for me. I didn&#x27;t mention this in the OP. but I use leuven theme for general notetaking and solarized for projects and tango-dark for org-noter at the moment.

                    <span>i wanted to make ansi-term appear at the bottom of the frame so i tried doing
  (display-buffer-alist &#x27;((&quot;\\*ansi-term\\*&quot; (display-buffer-in-side-window) (side . bottom) (slot . -1) (window-height . 0.3))) )) 
 but it doesn&#x27;t work.
 the same works well with eshell or shell
  (display-buffer-alist &#x27;((&quot;\\*e?shell\\*&quot; (display-buffer-in-side-window) (side . bottom) (slot . -1) (window-height . 0.3))) )) 
 what i am doing wrong here ?
 your help is appreciated.
 EDIT: solved
 apparently ansi-term and term uses pop-to-buffer instead of switch-to-buffer so to make them obey display-buffer-alist need to set
  (setq switch-to-buffer-obey-display-actions t)

                    <span>I will try to illustrate my buffer and cursor (point) as follows: 
 [T]he letter with the brackets around it is where the cursor is at 
 I start with this line, in a very narrow Emacs window. Note, it is a single line in the file, but two lines visually, because my editor is very narrow (for testing purposes).
 [T]his is a long line, it wraps. 
 Run evil-end-of-line ($):
 This is a long line, it wraps[.] 
 Run evil-previous-visual-line (gk):
 [] This is a long line, it wraps. 
 The problem here is that it didn&#x27;t go to the previous visual line.
 However, evil-previous-visual-line (gk) does sometimes work. Consider:
 [T]his is a long line, it wraps. 
 Run evil-end-of-line ($):
 This is a long line, it wraps[.] 
 Run evil-backward-char (h), then run evil-forward-char (l):
 This is a long line, it wraps[.] 
 Now run evil-previous-visual-line (gk):
 This is[ ]a long line, it wraps. 
 Now evil-previous-line works as expected.
 This problem seems to come from mixing regular commands and visual line mode aware commands. Going directly from a non visual line aware command to a visual line aware command causes problems. But if I do evil-forward-char in between, everything works.
 Any suggestions on how I can fix this?

                    <span>So i have this assignment where i have to code a game called &quot;Nim&quot; where two players take turns removing objects from distinct heaps or piles, and the player that gets to remove the last object wins. I&#x27;ve already coded a function for doing a specific move, i.e : play [1,2,3,4] (3,2) &#x3D; [1,2,1,4]. [1,2,3,4] would be the number of objects on each tile, and (3,2) would be removing 2 objects from the third tile. I also coded a function that gives a list of all the posible plays on a specific board position, i.e: possiblePlays [1,2,3] &#x3D; [(1,1), (2,2),(2,1),(3,3), (3,2), (3,1)] The problem i&#x27;m having is that now i have to code a function that tells me if a board position (like [1,2,3,4]) is &quot;winnable&quot;: a board position is winnable if a play exists that can lead to the other player getting a not winnable board position. i.e: isItWinnable [] &#x3D; False (because you can&#x27;t make another move, so you lose) isItWinnable [1] &#x3D; True (because you get to remove the last object). I think these could be the base cases, but i&#x27;m having a lot of trouble thinking the recursion. I&#x27;m sorry for the long post and the messy english, it&#x27;s not my native language and i had to translate everything from spanish. If anyone has any ideas or tips it would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.

 I basically have this code, the purpose of it is to find out if the structure I created is Correct. Basically the &quot;Stein&quot; has inside it all the other elements that are supposed to be above it. The &quot;Dach&quot; is the Roof and so it cannot take anything else above it. The correctness of the Structure is determined by the length of all the elements above a &quot;Stein&quot;. So if it were that the total length of all elements above the &quot;Stein&quot; is smaller or equal to the Length of that &quot;Stein&quot; the Structure is considered Correct and true is given out. But I have no clue how I should continue from this point onwards. I have no clue how to verify the Length of all the structures above a &quot;Stein&quot; in such a way that still only Boolean comes out in the end.
 Edit: I did manage to come up with somewhat of a hacky solution to it which I am not really a fan of.
 correct :: Legu -&gt; Bool correct x &#x3D; 0  if le &gt;&#x3D; sum l &amp;&amp; sum l &gt;&#x3D; 0 then le else -le) const x 
 Is there a more elegant way with which to do this, I am particularly not a fan of the fact I am simply giving out a negative number if the structure is not correct.

 How can i tell Obelisk that i am inside a project folder? I am new to Haskell/Obelisk, i was always used to the comfort of an IDE which can specificially open a project instead of a folder.

 Does anyone study old Haskell projects on Github and try to build executables?
 ​
 I am looking into an old project which was abandoned seven years ago. The current version of the Stack tool fails. Someone gave me a hint I should try Stack v1.9.3 . But how do I get a Windows executable?
 Has anyone blogged about the problem?
 Thanks, Hubert.

                    <span>Hey! I’ve been around the cs subreddits for a bit, and as a high schooler, I often find that I have a difficultly connecting with the others in the various cs subreddits. This is mainly to due the fact that most of the people in those subreddits such as r/programming or r/compsci are adults. Because of this, I created r/cshighschoolers: a place where highschoolers can come together and ask questions, show accomplishments, and discuss classes regarding computer science, programming, and coding! If this seems interesting to you, and you would like to help out a brand new subreddit grow, then come check us out and subscribe! We are also looking for MODS to further help the subreddit. Thanks!

                    <span>I&#x27;m trying to use #+FILETAGS to tag the top-level entries of a file, without having the tag be inherited by every headline in the file.
 Using org-tags-exclude-from-inheritance appears to not be working for #+FILETAGS. Could that be considered a bug?

                    <span>Is anyone using org-babel to write some C++?
 I&#x27;m doing some series on C++ literate programming for numerical analysis and would like to create a session like workflow to avoid big code blocks.
 I tried to use :tangle and :includes header arguments but run in some inconveniences:
  
:tangle does not work if I try to save the file in a sub directory. OK, I can live with having all my files in a single directory.
 :includes when I try to include a file it only recognizes if I provide the absolute path. Which is also annoying.
  
Does anyone has experience with any of that?

                    <span>Hello! I am wanting to switch away from using VS Code as my primary text editor, to using emacs. I know that there are Vim keybindings for Emacs, but was curious if I should learn one before the other. Ultimately I want to know and use both, but was wondering if there would be a benefit from learning one before the other.
 And, so I can be the first one to say it: 
 &quot;Just learn both&quot;
 - Yes, that&#x27;s the plan. I want to know if it would be beneficial to learn one before the other.
 &quot;That&#x27;s comparing le apples to le oranges&quot;
 - Yes, I am referring specifically to the text editor part of Emacs, and Vim, not Emacs as a whole to Vim
 &quot;Emacs isn&#x27;t a text editor dummy&quot;
 - Yes, I know. I&#x27;m talking specifically about the text editor of Emacs, not Emacs as a whole.

                    <span>Hello there,
 Surprisingly, using the nix build instructions from this snippet:
 https://gist.github.com/mjlbach/179cf58e1b6f5afcb9a99d4aaf54f549#gistcomment-3664894
 , I&#x27;m finally able to get emacsGcc working in my nixos machine running on a raspberry pi 4,
 when I open emacs, everything seems to load up fine, and emacs feels much more snappier, but the issue that I&#x27;m having now is with modes, for example: when I open an html file setup with (direnv+nix-direnv+emacs-direnv), the isolated environment does not load, and whenever I manually execute: M-x html-mode, emacs throws these 2 errors in emacs&#x27;s messages buffer?
 Note: I enabled debugger, and on emacsGcc startup initialization, the debugger is not triggered, which is good, but these 2 errors still show up at the beginning of the messages buffer:
 Eager macro-expansion failure: (wrong-number-of-arguments (3 . 4) 2) [2 times]
 Error loading autoloads: (wrong-number-of-arguments (3 . 4) 2)
 This 3rd error shows up whenever I try to manually activate a specific mode:
 Error running timer: (wrong-number-of-arguments (3 . 4) 2)
 Also, in the async-native-compile-log buffer, I can see the different modes for my project being compiled, but even after the compilation of one of the modes that I need is completed, whenever I try to activate that mode, the same 2 errors from above are thrown?
 Any tips on how to fix this?
 I&#x27;m pretty sure that there&#x27;s an easy fix, but I&#x27;m new to emacsGcc, so there&#x27;s probably some things that I&#x27;m missing to get emacsGcc up and running.
 Thanks in advance for the help!

                    <span>Consult is a collection of useful navigation and search commands based on completing-read, compatible with various completion UIs. Marginalia enhances completion commands with informative annotations in the minibuffer.
 Both packages have been submitted to GNU ELPA recently and became available there today. Hopefully some of the enhancements of these packages can be imported into Emacs proper, for example improved annotation functions, some of the completion commands or API improvements. 
 A while ago, the completing-read API has been enhanced with the group-function metadata, which allows completion UIs to group the set of candidates. This feature started as a Consult extension, which is used by the multi source consult-buffer command. Support for the group-function has been added to the default completion UI and merged into Emacs master.

                    <span>If I run a service over the web with software developed with Emacs am I required to make the source code to the whole service available under the GPL or is it the customizations to the software downloaded?
 As I understand it changes to packages downloaded under the GPL are supposed to be made available, but does that apply to the software written from scratch for the service itself?

                    <span>Hi all!
 Just a little question to see if anyone can help me.
 Imagine I have an item with a classic TODO state
 * TODO Buy the milk
 Now, I have another TODO state called TODAY, and I change the state of this item to
 * TODAY Buy the milk
 How can I do to schedule or reschedule (if there exists already a date) to today&#x27;s date automatically after changing to the TODAY state?
 Is there a built-in function for that?
 Thanks for the help.

                    <span>I use emacs to read a lot of PDFs, using the excellent pdf-tools package.
 But (like emacs users everywhere), I was not happy with a couple aspects of the default behavior.
 In particular, I use pdf-occur a lot, but the default behavior of display-buffer is to split my PDF frame vertically into two windows with the top window showing a too-small-to-read view of the PDF and the bottom window showing the list of occurrences.
 Maybe there is a better way, but this is what I did (which I share in case it helps someone else).
  (add-to-list display-buffer-alist &#x27;(&quot;^\\*PDF-Occur\\*$&quot; (display-buffer-pop-up-frame) (pop-up-frame-parameters . (auto-hide-function . delete-frame)))) 
 This causes the *PDF-Occur* buffer to be displayed in a newly-created (&quot;pop-up&quot;) frame instead of splitting the frame with the PDF document into two windows. (The auto-hide-function causes that frame to be deleted when one &quot;quits&quot; the window in that new frame. That is, when you press q in that buffer, the newly-created frame is deleted.)
 However, there is a secondary problem. When you select the occurence you care about in the *PDF-Occur* buffer and press RETURN, it splits that frame vertically and displays the PDF in the lower-half of that frame (again, in a too-small-to-read format).
 I fixed that by adding a function to the hook for the *PDF-Occur* buffer&#x27;s mode like this:
 &#x60;&#x60; (defun my-pdf-occur-buffer-mode-hook () &quot;CauseRETURN&#x27; in this buffer to use the window already displaying the PDF and return focus there.&quot; (make-local-variable &#x27;display-buffer-alist) (setq display-buffer-alist (cons &#x27;(&quot;.*\.pdf$&quot; (display-buffer-reuse-window) (reusable-frames . t)) (default-value &#x27;display-buffer-alist))))
 (add-hook &#x27;pdf-occur-buffer-mode-hook #&#x27;my-pdf-occur-buffer-mode-hook) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Of course, I&#x27;m happy to learn if you have critiques of how I did this—or about any of this.

                    <span>Hi everyone, I&#x27;ve wanted to play around with emacs 28 without putting my current stable (emacs 27) install in jeopardy. This is possible with chemacs2. 
 I followed the README but I&#x27;ll add that one should also delete their package-quickstart.el and other similar files that use hard-coded paths, before moving everything around. 
 Once you have your usual emacs in .emacs.default, you can for example create an empty .emacs.future (or any other name), and set it as a profile in .emacs-profiles.el. 
 Next, you can download emacs and build from source with native compilation if you&#x27;d like. Do not make install, rather we&#x27;ll use the path to the newly built executable. 
 Since chemacs2 keeps everything emacs as calls to the default directory, you won&#x27;t have to change much. 
 What you can do now, is alias to the more recent emacs executable with the future profile. For example, I put the emacs repo in ~/emacs. Meaning that I can do :
 alias ef&#x3D;&quot;/my/home/emacs/src/emacs --with-profile future&quot; 
 To use a different profile with the built from source executable. 
 Thanks to that I have two different versions of emacs with different init files, living together.

 But I failed, so I decided to split just theme from nano-emacs.
 Still wip, I am not good at elisp and any feedbacks or pr are welcome!

 I&#x27;m currently writing a parser using megaparsec which produces the following output:
 data FileElement &#x3D; SyntaxStmt SyntaxStatement | PackageSpec PackageSpecification | ImportStmt ImportStatement | OptionDef OptionDefinition | MsgDef MessageDefinition | EnumDef EnumDefinition | ServiceDef ServiceDefinition deriving (Show, Eq) type File &#x3D; [FileElement] 
 it goes on with more nested substructures.
 Now I realized that I need to record the location in the document for every entity.
 What would be the best way of integrating this into the AST? I would like to avoid changing the AST itself, but have the location information as some sort of &quot;annotation&quot; to the nodes, or just general ideas for that matter.
 I really appreciate your help and happy haskelling.

 I am mainly looking to get rid of rookie mistakes, not looking for some amazing heuristic to make my sudoku solver 200x faster. 
 It feels to me like there should be improvements I could make to the solve function, but I don&#x27;t really know how or what to improve.

                    <span>I want to export my agenda as html and/or text but I want the uid(property entry) per entry in the agenda. Any idea on how to set that up?

                    <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;m an absolute noob when it comes to emacs and org-mode. I&#x27;ve been watching a tonne of videos and reading through the manual.
 One thing that I&#x27;m wondering about is whether to use tags or custom properties for adding people to a task? The idea would be that if a task has a status of WAITING that I&#x27;d want to add the associated person to that task. Then when having a meeting with that person I&#x27;d be able to pull up a list of all the tasks that are associated with that person.
 In my current system (in Notion) I actually have a page per person, so that I can write some notes about them, such as favorite food etc. In that setup the tagging of a person to a task and the person&#x27;s info page is one in the same (2 tables that are linked). I&#x27;m wondering what the best way to setup this kind of functionality in org-mode would be?
 TL;DR: Tag or properties for adding people to tasks?
 Thanks in advance!

                    <span>Does anyone know how to include the email address when exported to pdf using LaTeX?
 I tried this from the org site.
 Org Export Settings
 but didn&#x27;t work. Also, I tried Org Export Backend Reference which has an option :with-email which I don&#x27;t know how to set up. I tried adding it in org-export-options-alist but it is throwing an error while exporting.
 UPDATE:
 I am trying to define my own latex class. Below is the snippet of the code.
 (add-to-list &#x27;org-latex-classes
 &#x27;(&quot;ethz&quot;
 ...
 \\makeatletter
 \\renewcommand{\\maketitle}{%
 \\begingroup\\parindent0pt
 \\Small{Aum Tat Sat!}\\par\\bigskip
 \\Huge{\\bfseries\\@title}\\par
 \\LARGE{\\@subtitle}\\par\\bigskip
 \\small{\\@author} \\vspace{1ex}
 \\small{\\@email} \\par
 \\normalsize\\@date\\par\\bigskip
 \\endgroup\\@afterindentfalse\\@afterheading}
 \\makeatother
 ... ))
 I want the email to appear along with the author (if possible, including affiliation). It is exporting everything but email. Sorry for the space, because copy and paste are assuming every line is a new paragraph. 
 NOTE: I asked this question in Stack Overflow, and one person told me to use macro {{{email}}. It is accepting the email but not displaying it properly.

                    <span>The initial state constructor of a Halogen component has the type initialState :: forall input. input -&gt; State. However, I would like the initial state to depend on some browser state (namely the fragment of the URL). Is it possible to construct the initial state in the Effect Monad somehow?

                    <span>hello, i am a java programmer learning elisp, and i heard the best way to learn is to study the source code, so here we go, i learned enough elisp to understand docker-mode package, which is maintained by spotify and i use for work sometimes.
 the purpose of this post is two folds: 
  
help others who is learning elisp. It&#x27;s easy to get started, but confusing at times just b/c there are so many unfamiliar concepts, both from emacs and from lisp. I surely wish someone else had written some deep-dive to help me ramp up faster. Thanks to everyone who helped me during my elisp learning. 
 I am planning to read in depth at least one small and common package per week. If you found this helpful, please recommend me with other small packages (&lt;1000 lines) that&#x27;s fun to use, fun to read. Thanks!

                    <span>Emacs offers CUA-mode out of the box to address users expectations for normal C-c (copy), C-v (paste), C-z (undo) commands. Indeed, this is often an issue that comes up when I am teaching newcomers Emacs. So, why don&#x27;t I hear about this being used more? Why don&#x27;t I use it? Why was one of my joys in adopting EXWM the ability to use emacs shortcuts INSTEAD of CUA in other progams? Essentially I went the opposite direction.
 Even for those years when I was learning emacs, no part of me ever longed to regain the key bindings that were used everywhere else, and that is strange in retrospect. Was it because learning new keybindings was part of the emacs experience? Or because CUA bindings are already only relevant to Windows users and not Mac keybords? Was it because there is something qualitatively different about killing, yanking, and emacs&#x27; undo style than the copy-paste-undo of everything else? I admit, whenever I am forced into non-emacs programs, I do long for the kill ring.
 What do you think? Why is CUA-Mode so rarely brought up as a first step (and therefore rarely brought up at all)?

                    <span>Hey guys, I&#x27;m new to emacs and scheme. I just installed geiser, the chicken-repl starts up well in emacs (M-x run-chicken or M-x run-geiser RET chicken) and code entered directly in the repl executes properly, but when I try to execute code in from a buffer, I get this error:
 retort-syntax
 Error: unbound variable: geiser#geiser-eval
 https://preview.redd.it/z8s7kq63z3271.png?width&#x3D;745&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;047d35c68a73566daddfc47e531a6920e23d4ce5
 I noticed that the code sent to chicken is this: (geiser#geiser-eval (quote #f) (quote (print &quot;Chicken Test&quot;)) which is like a wrapper around my original code and might be what produces the error, but i&#x27;m not sure if thats the case or how to fix it.
 ​
 Here is my init.el file, I haven&#x27;t installed much except MELPA, geiser and a material theme
 https://preview.redd.it/3ygtnxvfz3271.png?width&#x3D;784&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;023070e11c696ac34a38a94f19144a2a56ced393
 Would really appreciate it if someone could help me out or point me in the right direction... thanks.

                    <span>I had the hard time to teach emacsclient (emacs terminal frame) to change the working directory, to make it possible to open a new terminal tab at the changed directory path.
 Steps:
 * open emacsclient at the home user&#x27;s folder
 * navigate to a new folder using dired and open a random file
 * set a path to the file&#x27;s directory path (not clear how to do this)
 * open a new terminal tab (I use tilix)
 * the new tab should be opened at the directory from step 3 not the home directory from the step 1
 Any suggestions?

                    <span>Hello r/emacs.
 ​
 I have recently set up a neat feature for Emacs that I wanted to share with you. I am going to give you a short description of what this is supposed to be here, but for more details, and the required code snippets you can check my github repository where I also host my dotfiles.
 ​
 So, if you are tiling window manager user, you have probably heard of scratchpads. If you haven&#x27;t, they are floating windows with predefined dimensions which are automatically hidden when they lose focus. Why is this useful you may ask? Well, I personally dislike leaving Emacs, especially when I want to write a large piece of text. But there are some things (mostly when I am doing something on the web, such as creating this reddit post) which I can&#x27;t directly do in Emacs. This project tries to solve this project.
 ​
 I have basically set up my window manager of choice (qtile, but I do plan to try and make this for other window managers such as i3) to create a scratchpad of Emacs which opens in a placeholder file and an emacs command which when ran, copies the whole buffer to the clipboard and then deletes it from the file so it can be used again. This allows me to write everything in Emacs, in a small floating window which is visible whenever I need it and then hides itself when unneeded, using a placeholder file which is always empty and waiting for text to fill it. The setup is honestly very handy and I really like it, as the alternatives are somewhat annoying to use imo. 
 ​
 For more details, check the aforementioned git repo. I hope you will enjoy it. I personally really like the idea and as I couldn&#x27;t find anyone who has done something similar, I thought I should share this here so you guys can see the idea and adopt it if you like. I will gladly answer any of your questions about this and try to persuade you that its got a reasonable use-case.

                    <span>Hey guys,
 I&#x27;m new to Emacs and I&#x27;m a copywriter - I write 3-5k words per day. I&#x27;m thinking about quitting libreoffice writer and switching to a keyboard-centric writing experience. I really like Emacs so far!
 The only concern I have is: Can I do these things with Emacs... And how easy is it to do these things:
 -bold a word or a sentence
 -italics
 -align a paragraph to center
 -export to .docx (most of my clients need that format, not a personal preference)
 ​
 Can emacs help me write text and accomplish these 4 things (just as easily or easier than with L.O. Writer)? 
 ​
 I admit, I&#x27;m a complete novice when it comes to this. When I tried searching online about these features I found some advanced tutorials on something called latex or pandoc or some other advanced programs. I&#x27;m really not a programmer, all I need is these 4 features in order to ditch LibreOffice writer. Can emacs help me with these things?
 Thank you

                    <span>Hi everyone, 
 I built from source today and installed emacs, I also tried to clean my emacs install and re-install it but it doesn&#x27;t fix my issue. I didn&#x27;t have that issue previously when I built from source a month ago. 
 Basically, emacs freezes completely only in some cases. I&#x27;d say that most of my usage does not provoke the freeze but for two cases (that I found). 
  
deft, anytime I open it it completely freezes emacs.
 
stan-mode when I try to edit a file. Opening the file works fine but if I try to edit anything, it freezes and I have to kill emacs.
 
 I tried package-reinstall, to no avail. 
 Other modes like org-mode or any other language I&#x27;m using or could think of, does work (Racket, Java, Python, Julia, SQL), etc. 
 I can&#x27;t seem to get an error anywhere and when emacs freezes I have to kill it. If anyone has an idea I&#x27;d be grateful.

 Is there a way to build emacs-mac with emacs28, and use it with native comp, so I can get the best of both worlds? If not, would anyone know when emacs-mac is going to move to emacs28?

                    <span>I would like to model software APIs in a best-practice-functional-programming manner. I am wondering how professionals typically go about this problem. What are existing best practices, and so forth.
 More specifically, for my current project, I want to model several geometric primitives (e.g., circle, sphere, triangle) such that I can effectively reason about them and use effective type-checking. I will render them with different backends, and will handle that elsewhere (e.g., JavaScript), but I want to be sure I am effectively modeling the geometric types.
 I&#x27;d like to use Haskell.
 The obvious way to go about this would be to begin writing data types in Haskell and potentially use that to generate other code via Template Haskell. Is there a flaw with this approach? I&#x27;ve considered using XML, or using Haskell to generate XML as an intermediate, but I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s necessary or flawed in some way.
 In general, I&#x27;d also like to use whatever approach I develop to model systems in the future. I&#x27;m not sure what the best way of going about it is. I&#x27;m wondering if anyone has any experience with this, or can point me to some references, so that I don&#x27;t begin coding something that is doomed to be suboptimal for reasons known to those who know. Thank you.

                    <span>I would love to collect some reaources on how to build software with Haskell. I would say at a level where I have a solid understanding of the language, but I need practical work and methodologies to understand how to apply the language.
 Thank you 🙇‍♂️

 wanted to share with you an article that the compilers team in Imagine.ai wrote about the inner workings of the Imagine compiler and why we chose Haskell for the code generation.
 Hope you like it, if you have questions feel free to reach out.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been trying to see what solutions are out there but couldn&#x27;t really find any that I liked. What I want to do is to use the task management part of org mode remote (internet). There are solutions to sync files and then use different re-implementations of org mode on different devices but I want emacs to be the heart of it and not use re-implementations.
 What I&#x27;m thinking is something where I can send a command to the server where I have emacs and get a response with a subset of commands like :
  
List tasks (agenda)
 Mark task as done (maybe based on uid)
 Add things to inbox (to be processed when I&#x27;m at a computer)
  
I&#x27;m considering something like using email (could be similar to how http://www.gamerz.net/pbmserv/ works) or having an xmpp bot or something similar. Anyone who has done anything similar or seen any projects like this?

                    <span>As a beginner, I am getting comfortable with scala &#x27;s core api. As I expand into application development, there are requirements for making http request, db queries and stuff like that. Now, when I look at libraries providing such functionalities - there are references to cats, monix, zio. Are cats, zio equivalence of each other ? are these required for application development? Or is it for purists only? How should a beginner look expanding understanding of scala ?

 Are there any resources/ or anyone can eli5 ?

 I haven&#x27;t been able to move ahead because of this, any help is appreciated

                    <span>I&#x27;ve only begun incorporating zettelkasten into my daily life recently, but I&#x27;m a long-time user of spaced repetition and credit it with much of the success I had reaching fluency in Japanese a few years back. At least in my experience thus far, zettelkasten works well alongside the practice of spaced repetition, but I was recently struck by a possibly fruitful way to integrate the core spaced repetition concept into zettelkasten itself.

                    <span>Lately I&#x27;ve found Bloom&#x27;s Taxonomy interesting — Bloom apparently did it to save time in making annual examinations (according to my source, at least) and consequently, it led to a &quot;common language&quot; for education.
When asked what&#x27;s &quot;the most important thing they want students to gain after each class,&quot; teachers will always say that they want students to &quot;really understand&quot; the lecture. But as Krathwohl (2002) put it, this is an ambiguous term; they haven&#x27;t articulated what it means when a student &quot;really understands.&quot;
And without a common definition of how well students understand the material, making exams that test understanding would produce large variability.
How do you even know when students &quot;really understand&quot; something?
So what Bloom&#x27;s Taxonomy did was give a comprehensive set of c…</span>

                    <span>Hi. So, I made this thing awhile back originally in the context of developing a programming language which used a lot of Unicode math symbols (basically forcing variable-width fonts) and significant whitespace. Now I use it for all of my personal note files, and it seems like other people might find it useful so I&#x27;m releasing it.
 https://github.com/tenbillionwords/spaceship-mode
 ​
 spaceship-mode
 What this basically does is:
  
spaceship-mode makes spaces at the start of a line have their width automatically adjusted to align with previous text as they would in a fixed-width font. Example pictured.
 tabble-mode is an implementation of elastic tabstops.
  
Together these make it possible in principle to do every kind of alignment I have ever seen being useful in an actual programming or plaintext-note-taking situation.
 Using spaceship-mode absolutely requires adhering to the convention of using tabs for indentation and spaces for alignment. Unfortunately, that means these modes work very badly with stock Emacs, yet I am not providing any kind of user-interface features such as commands to help use and maintain the indentation conventions, or any keybindings at all. It wouldn&#x27;t do to just quickly slap something together, because Emacs&#x27; assumption of fixed-width fonts is fairly deeply entrenched in its design, and peeps have very different preferences and methods for dealing with indentation in general. (And I&#x27;m not providing my own full setup because...reasons.) So if you want to get this working well, you&#x27;ll have to do some work to integrate it into your own system. The “Example Setup” in the readme may give some indication of how to start doing this.
 P.S. Thanks to the r/emacs folks who originally helped me figure out how to do this!

                    <span>All,
 I&#x27;m now using emacs and mu4e for quite few months and I have one remaining concern which is formatting when replying to emails.
 Let&#x27;s take the following example as my original email:
  
This is the emails chain. This paragraph runs on several lines and is recognized as is on the original email. All of that matches line 1. But when replying to this email, there&#x27;s now (random?) line breaks inserted here and there. 
 empty line #1 
 The next paragraph starts here.
  
​
 When I reply to this email, the cited text will have (random?) line breaks insertion and all empty lines will be doubled (i.e. one additional empty line will be created for each original empty line). So I end up with something like this:
  
My response to you. 
 Best, 
 RedGuilou 
 --citation follows this line (read-only)-- 
 This is the emails chain. This paragraph runs on several lines and is recognized as is on the original email. All of that matches line 1. But when replying to this email, 
 there&#x27;s now (random?) line breaks inserted here and there. 
 empty line #1 
 empty line #2 
 The next paragraph starts here.
  
​
 This does not look very professional when replying to my clients and it&#x27;s boring to correct the formatting on every single email (especially when the emails chain is quite long).
 I&#x27;m using org mode to write my emails in case that matters. Any clues on what to investigate to solve this issue would be greatly appreciated.
 Thanks !

                    <span>Hi, everyone. I&#x27;m curious if anyone has managed to cook up an Org Agenda view which allows for easy viewing and interaction with TODO items and subitems from the agenda view?
 Ex:
 * TODO top-level thing [0/1] ** This is a sub-item / requirement for top-level 
 output Ex:
 ...: [time].... TODO top-level thing [0/1] ...: [time] .... TODO This is a sub-item / ... 
 I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s probably a way to do this sort of thing with org-super-agenda or some fancy org-ql thing but before I run down that trail perhaps someone has a workable partial or full solution?
 Thx!
 Unrelated note: If you haven&#x27;t tried &quot;Edit with Emacs&quot; browser extension you really should. Fantastic!

                    <span>if i am running Emacs daemon, company mode automatically complete the selected candidate in completion menu so i don&#x27;t have to hit tab again.
 with emacsclient 
 ​
 if i am running Emacs without a daemon it doesn&#x27;t automatically fill the selected candidate. i have to hit tab or C-l to complete the selected candidate.
 without Emacs daemon
 ​
 generally this isn&#x27;t a problem for me because i always start a daemon but i just want to know what causing this does this have something to do with capf ? or is there anything wrong with my config ?.
 i am fairly new to emacs
 here is my company config

                    <span>Hello,
 I need some help.
 I am looking for a better way of working in a node.js / typescript environment. I want to start with creating a dirty repl. This is a huge project and it has a large amount of dependencies, with many many layers.
 One idea I had is to create a REST endpoint within the app on my computer only, that will eval all code sent with the GET request and respond either with {success: result} or {error: message}.
 Now I created a custom keybind, that sends the code that I selected in emacs with a GET request to that endpoint and that works beautifully.
 Here is where I am stuck though, if there was an error (because I am evaluating js code of thisGreatFunction(unsetVariable) {doSomethingWith(usetVarbable)} because unsetVariable and the function doSomethingWith are obviously not defined). This is also where it gets dirty.
 My next thought was to push back on the user in emacs with the error message and let him open a new buffer where he can change the js code sent, ideally also caching the previous responses so he can build a reportoire of code that loads needed sets of dependencies quickly.
 Any ideas on how to make this sort of interactivity happen?

                    <span>Something that I think there should be a shortcut for, but I am not even sure what to google for (at least above question goes towards a visual line, which I am not interested in).
 Assume that I have the following line:
 This is an overview about something 
 Now I&#x27;ve written that line of arbitrary length and want to put a line of dashes below it, like this:
 This is an overview about something ----------------------------------- 
 I obviously can type a lot of minuses/dashes, but that feels wrong. I was thinking about C-u  dash and getting the point, but that also feels like doing it wrong.
 Does anyone have a good hint on how to create a line full of dashes of the same length of the previous line?

My team sits in front office and has about 20 Haskell devs (well, technically Mu, our in-house variant). There are many other Haskell teams at Standard Chartered and you may have seen other hiring announcements recently, but these are distinct positions. Do reach out to me directly if you&#x27;re interested and have any questions, but applications should go via our website: https://scb.taleo.net/careersection/ex/jobdetail.ftl?job&#x3D;2100012204&amp;lang&#x3D;en&amp;HRS_SUBSOURCE_ID&#x3D;1804

 Standard Chartered supports (practically fully) remote working, but only from the country of payroll -- UK in this case.

                    <span>I&#x27;m a Haskell newbie. I&#x27;ve tried to get into Haskell development several times, since I love the language, but I&#x27;ve always had issues with tooling.
 My preferred editor is VS Code on Windows, and the Haskell extension seems to provide most features I need.
 Unfortunately, I also have a small hard drive (256 GB) which is mostly occupied. When I used Stack or Haskell Platform in the past, the size of my user directory often reached 20-30 GB due to installed versions of compilers and dependencies, which is too much. I&#x27;ve never had this issue with other languages (rustup or npm only ever take a couple GBs on my PC despite heavy usage).
 Since this is probably unavoidable, I need a way to install GHC, Cabal, Haskell Language Server and all other tools in a completely isolated and portable directory, so that I can just delete or move them away from my PC until needed, while leaving global user directories intact.
 The most obvious solution would probably be Docker, but I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s supported on Windows 10 Home.
 Is there a way to configure both Cabal and Haskell Language Server in a completely portable/non-intrusive manner?
 Thanks!

                    <span>Does Scala 3 have configurable derivation? By configurable derivation I mean passing configuration for the typeclass derivation in the derives clause, eg:
 case class Person(name: String, age: Int) derives Decoder(_.toLowerCase) 
 In this scenario the hypothetical Decoder typeclass would apply the toLowerCase function to the json fields. Other examples could be cutoff limits, nestness limits, etc.
 Or in other words can the derived method receive arguments that are not using clauses?

                    <span>Hey, good people of Scala! 👋
 I have the following challenge. I would like to open vim from my Scala CLI application... 
 I would like to achieve similar functionality as can be seen when you use git - it opens your editor of choice when committing stuff; allows you to do the editions there and let the user exit vim; then the git picks up and proceeds with its things.
 However, that has proven to be way more tricky than I initially thought. 😅
 How should I approach this; can u please point me in the right direction,... Are there any libs that I could use to handle this; if so which? Can this thing be also &quot;ported&quot; to things like GraalVM if want to package this as native-image at some point?
 A silly example that I&#x27;ve made that uses scala.sys.process; where I thought I should start...
  def editor &#x3D; sys.env.getOrElse(&quot;EDITOR&quot;, &quot;vim&quot;) def spawnEditor(editor: String) &#x3D; { val r &#x3D; Seq(editor, &quot;/tmp/test.md&quot;).!! r } 
 Thanks for your help and have a nice day!

                    <span>Hi everyone.
I began using ZK several months ago and encountered a following conundrum.
I divide notes into two generic classes: core notes and inbox. Inbox consists of notes I might need to work upon in the future.  My inbox keeps growing much faster in volume than my core notes. There&#x27;re three main sources of its growth.
Firstly, I regularly read professional feeds with a wide range of information that I have no time to integrate right now. Mostly this is a specific momentarily info that might be unavailable in the future (or simply hard to find) so saving it seems pretty important to me.
On the one hand, this inbox propagation seems natural to me - I find that diving into that knowledge dump from time to time turns out pretty useful. And the power of weak connections works with notes as much as with people.
Maybe somebody wants to comment on this? Have you been in a similar situation?</span>

                    <span>Hi Zettelkasten friends,
How do you process research that&#x27;s based on shaky assumptions? By &quot;shaky&quot; I mean that in the middle of reading, you figured that the authors were either assuming that a specific concept is true, or are implying that the specific concept applies to their study&#x27;s context.
So for example, a lot of other studies are based on Zeigarnik Effect, but other studies on the same concept have failed to replicate the phenomenon. Or implying that the &quot;need for cognitive closure&quot; applies to the &quot;task&quot; context, even when the cited paper refers to closure in the context of beliefs.
Their results would fit nicely into their assumptions and hypotheses, but the assumptions themselves don&#x27;t hold up based on the other papers.
So if you were in my place, do you think the experiments woul…</span>

                    <span>It looks like Yaml mode isn&#x27;t supported any longer. I saw a mention of an lsp mode.
 Does anyone have any recommendations for working with yaml (I wish the answer could be &quot;don&#x27;t&quot; because I hate it...)?
 Yaml mode is providing some features but it doesn&#x27;t have the syntax highlighting I&#x27;d like, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be indentation aware, which makes reformatting files a pain.
 For example, it&#x27;d be nice if mark-sexp worked to mark by indentation level.

                    <span>Given that I use Lisp often, I want to swap square brackets with parentheses. I tried this with:
 (define-key key-translation-map (kbd &quot;[&quot;) (kbd &quot;(&quot;)) (define-key key-translation-map (kbd &quot;]&quot;) (kbd &quot;)&quot;)) (define-key key-translation-map (kbd &quot;(&quot;) (kbd &quot;[&quot;)) (define-key key-translation-map (kbd &quot;)&quot;) (kbd &quot;]&quot;)) 
 But the swap doesn&#x27;t work in key chords e.g. M-(. How do I translate keys at the lowest level?

                    <span>I had a line using diredfl, to give me the permission line visual I wanted. However, I had to go back to my code and re-evaluate the use-package line every session or else I just had font coloring instead. A character inspection revealed that it was indeed applying diredfl faces, but apparently just the default ones, not the ones I was defining. Here was my not-working-until-reeval line:
 Not working invocation (custom)
 (use-package diredfl :demand t :config (add-hook &#x27;dired-mode-hook &#x27;diredfl-mode) :custom (diredfl-dir-name &#x27;((t (:foreground &quot;#3679D8&quot; :box (:line-width 2 :color &quot;grey75&quot; :style released-button))))) (diredfl-dir-priv &#x27;((t (:foreground &quot;#3679D8&quot; :underline t)))) (diredfl-exec-priv &#x27;((t (:background &quot;#79D836&quot; :foreground &quot;black&quot;)))) (diredfl-read-priv &#x27;((t (:background &quot;#D8B941&quot; :foreground &quot;black&quot;)))) (diredfl-write-priv &#x27;((t (:background &quot;#D83441&quot; :foreground &quot;black&quot;))))) 
 Working invocation (custom-face)
 Notice the only difference is that I&#x27;m using custom-face, which enables removing the quote from the face definitions. So the question is, why does this fix the problem? What is :custom failing to do (timing wise) that :custom-face is managing?
 (use-package diredfl :demand t :config (add-hook &#x27;dired-mode-hook &#x27;diredfl-mode) :custom-face (diredfl-dir-name ((t (:foreground &quot;#3679D8&quot; :box (:line-width 2 :color &quot;grey75&quot; :style released-button))))) (diredfl-dir-priv ((t (:foreground &quot;#3679D8&quot; :underline t)))) (diredfl-exec-priv ((t (:background &quot;#79D836&quot; :foreground &quot;black&quot;)))) (diredfl-read-priv ((t (:background &quot;#D8B941&quot; :foreground &quot;black&quot;)))) (diredfl-write-priv ((t (:background &quot;#D83441&quot; :foreground &quot;black&quot;)))))

                    <span>I&#x27;m working on a game development project using literate programming in org-babel. The problem I&#x27;m having is the following.
 Say I have a table called &quot;sprites&quot; that defines positional indexes into a sprite sheet:
 #+NAME: sprites | Name | Row | Col | |--------+-----------| | Bob | 2 | 3 | | Joe | 5 | 6 | 
 That gets passed into a block of C++ code as a variable and used for rendering. So far so good. But now I want to use that data to show the sprites in the org document itself. I have a macro that takes an integer index and links to the sprite image (presliced from the sprite sheet for simplicity):
 #+MACRO: sprite [[ ./path/to/sprite-$1.png ]] 
 This gets called like:
 {{{sprite(123)}}} 
 Which works fine. But can I make a macro that takes two arguments and multiplies them (row * width + col) together, like so:
 {{{sprite(2,3)}}} 
 ... and links the sprite for Bob? Or am I limited to simple text replacement? If macros aren&#x27;t the right tool for this, what is?
 And one step further, can I somehow just do:
 {{{sprite(Bob)}}} 
 ?

                    <span>Hi, I use xah-fly-keys&#x27;s modal editing package.
 and I have these key bindings over this package:
 &quot;{&quot; &quot;}&quot; &quot;V&quot; &quot;N&quot; &quot;O&quot; &quot;E&quot; &quot;S&quot; &quot;C-s&quot; &quot;C-a&quot; &quot;C-f&quot; &quot;C-y&quot; &quot;C-;&quot; &quot;C-e&quot; &quot;C-r&quot; &quot;C-o&quot; 
 does any of these keybindings conflict with any mode or do they override anything ?I&#x27;m worried because I don&#x27;t know if I should use &#x60;C-xyz&#x60; for my keybindings...Cause some packages like multiple cursor use &#x60;C-&#x27;&#x60;, does that mean I can&#x27;t use &#x60;C-punctuations&#x60; at all?Are we even allowed to use &#x60;C-xyz&#x60; as our keybindings? or &#x60;C-,./()&#x27;{};\&#x60;? or even &#x60;Upper case letters...&#x60;?

                    <span>So, I was using emacs with evil-mode and the qwertz keyboard layout. Stock keybinds, all good. Until now. I learnt the keyboard layout k.o,y and now need to rebind everything. Everything. I took a look at gereral.el, but am sill unsure on how I would go about this rather large operation. Does anyone here have any tips on how I would go on about this?

                    <span>There are numerous libs/hacks for showing the Elisp docstring for the symbol at point, but none really worked for me : if you know of one that really does it then please let me know. Anyway, I had to debug something yesterday and so was using my own solution that I knocked up a few weeks ago in order to learn some Elisp. It&#x27;s a bit &quot;overkill&quot; in that it supports 3 different &quot;display the docstring&quot; front ends, but it defaults to posframe (which works now BTW) and I find it really, really useful. Just enable el-docstring-sap-mode and you&#x27;re away. I even documented it.... I did one years ago, but this is a refresh. it doesnt do anything clever - the &quot;links&quot; in the pop are non operational...
 ​
 Note: you need to clone it, add it to path etc or just use straight.el. I wont rehash how to do all that, GIYF.

                    <span>I have a large Hydra for smartparens navigation/actions, and because I want to restrict the height of the Hydra window to preserve space for the main window, the Hydra hints get cut off at the right edge of the screen. So I created a second Hydra and linked Hydra #1 and Hydra #2 together via designated keys (as explained here). 
 The problem is that I’ve memorized many of the bindings associated with both Hydra #1 and Hydra #2, and I want to use all bindings at any time, regardless of whether Hydra #1 or Hydra #2 is showing. This means I have to add every binding relevant to smartparens to BOTH defhydra definitions. This takes up a lot of space in my init.el, and it’s not as simple as copy-pasting because I don’t want hints that show up in Hydra #1 to show up in Hydra #2 (and vice versa), so I have to change the string hints to nil or change nil to string hints as appropriate. 
 I’ve partially solved this last problem by having Hydra #2 inherit the bindings of Hydra #1 with the following:
 (set-keymap-parent hydra-smartparens2/keymap hydra-smartparens1/keymap) 
 However, I can’t simultaneously have Hydra #1 inherit Hydra #2&#x27;s bindings, as this creates the error cyclic keymap inheritance. Thus, unless I’m missing something (and I hope I am), some copy-pasting from Hydra #2 to Hydra #1 is still necessary.
 It would be great if I could have a single Hydra for smartparens that possessed a height limit and could be scrolled to see the hints that get cut off, like which-key allows. Different displays vary greatly in the horizontal screen real estate they allow. Should I check out hercules.el, or is there an obvious solution I’m missing? 
 P.S. I’m not complaining about Hydra, it is a genius package!

                    <span>![Shpadoinkle UI](https://shpadoinkle.org/assets/landing_logo.svg?_&#x3D;d90ee964e70ae792d7a4)
 Writing to announce a new functional UI programming paradigm and implementation for Haskell. Features a declarative programming model, rendering polymorphism, no FRP constructs, single source of truth, and convenient composition of components via lenses.
 She sure is a Shpadoinkle website (written as statically generated Shpadoinkle)
 Full support for
  
single-page applications (routing with Servant!)
 static site generation
 server-side rendering
 time travel debugging (maturing)
 live reloads with GHCID
 growing widgets library with common types for UI baked in. 
  
Actively maintained by Platonic Systems.
 This work was originally motivated by a desire to capture the lessons I have learned from a decade of working with different UI technologies. As well as a desire to have the benefits of The Elm Architecture without compromising on compositionally, or being forced to use a nerfed language (Elm). Shpadoinkle drops through the abstract floor to uncover the simplicity in the substructure of UI programming. While systems like Reflex offer a recursively Monadic structure, and Elm offers merely Functorial structure, Shpadoinkle is not even a Covariant Functor.

                    <span>Hello there,
 Is there anyway I can create a generator in Scalacheck that allows me to get not only distinct values but also the list with the exact size I send generate and not less
 Gen.listOfN allows duplicates, and although Gen.containerOfN[Set, String] allows me to get only distinct values, it can then generate less values that the N I pass to the method.
 I writed this method, but it&#x27;s a little &quot;hack&quot;, since it would be great if this worked with returning a Generator and not the List already
 ​
  def createDistinctList[A](i: Int, gen: Gen[A]): List[A] &#x3D; def createDistinctListAux(i: Int, gen: Gen[A], res: List[A]): List[A] &#x3D; i match case 0 &#x3D;&gt; res case _ &#x3D;&gt; { val generated &#x3D; for { value &lt;- gen } yield value val x &#x3D; generated.sample.get val newI &#x3D; if x &#x3D;&#x3D; None || res.contains(x) then i else i - 1 val newRes &#x3D; if x &#x3D;&#x3D; None || res.contains(x) then res else res :+ x createDistinctListAux(newI, gen, newRes) } createDistinctListAux(i, gen, Nil) 
 I tried with res.contains(generated) and returning a generator of list, but it didn&#x27;t work, it only worked this way.
 Any help is appreciated, thank you.
 (Scala 3 btw)

                    <span>Hello everyone. I&#x27;m coming out of my cave again to write a long post recommending a book: They Say/I Say by Gerald Graff and Cathy Birkenstein. I think it could be useful to many people here, especially those who are unsure about what they should include in a Zettel. It helped me get a better idea of how to structure a single note in a way that&#x27;s useful to me (i.e. for academic research in the humanities and social sciences broadly, and philosophy in particular, with the goal of producing academic papers and other nonfiction writing). But I think it could be useful to anyone reading or writing argumentative non-fiction. At best I think it could help combat a somewhat relativistic tendency I&#x27;ve noticed in online ZK/PKM communities.

                    <span>Every time I run embark-export, Embark gives me an Embark Collect buffer. For instance, if I use consult-ripgrep and then use embark-export on the results so that I can use wgrep, I get an Embark Collect buffer. I can&#x27;t get an Embark Export Grep buffer at all. I&#x27;m using the sample configs for Embark and Embark-Consult on Emacs 27.2 on macOS 11.4 with the latest packages as of 5/26. Any suggestions on how to fix this?

                    <span>I am stumped by some strange behavior in the org mode clock. I use the clock timer (C-x C-i) to time myself when working in different files, and it has always worked a treat. But recently I cleaned up the structure of my org folder, which had lots of subfolders for different clients. I moved all of these folders from /org into a new folder, /org/archive, to give myself a nice clean place to work. Now, however, when I try to start the clock timer, emacs refuses and instead shows me this:
 Use M-x make-directory RET RET to create the directory and its parents [165 times] apply: Setting current directory: No such file or directory, /home/me/org/client-folder/ 
 Where client-folder is the name of a client. I&#x27;m guessing that it&#x27;s trying to check all of my existing files for dangling, unclosed timers, but I don&#x27;t need it to do that. 
 I tried deleting the org-clock-save.el file in my emacs directory, which the program then recreated, but this is empty. 
 What&#x27;s telling emacs to look for files in their old directories, and how can I make it stop, or at least redirect it to the new directory path?

                    <span>I get the feeling many people don&#x27;t like the default binding of C-z to suspend-frame. I certainly don&#x27;t use it, and (put &#x27;suspend-frame &#x27;disabled t) in my configuration. But I feel I&#x27;m wasting a great keybinding by not binding something else there and am looking for inspiration. What do you use C-z for?

                    <span>Hi,
 If I do C-x right or C-x b I can switch the buffer shown in the current window. I have a layout where one frame can have some windows with some buffer. I want to separate all the buffers started in the current frame from other frames so I cant open a buffer from hobby project in a frame I am working on my emacs files. So it should not be possible to switch to a buffer started in another frame.
 Also like *Messages* shouldnt be possible to switch to. Maybe theese should be in a separate frame to separate them from others. Then I could still access them if I wanted to.
 My idea is that I want to have a frame for each project that I am working and it should only be possible to switch to the relevant buffers.
 If anything is unclear, please ask me :)
 Thank you

                    <span>I like to have imenu-list open while I am programming in Python to have an outline of my file and a list of functions/classes that I can quickly access (side question: are there better packages for this functionality?).
 However, when I open that list then switch the buffer to a different non-python file that I don&#x27;t need such a list for, I have to manually close that window only to open it back when I switch back to my Python buffer. 
 I am wondering if there&#x27;s a way to designate a particular window as a &quot;child&quot; of the buffer. So that everytime I switch to that buffer the window is automatically created and then destroyed when I switch away from the &quot;parent&quot; buffer. 
 I could probably code it myself by advising set-buffer, splitting the window if the buffer is a python-buffer and closing it if the old buffer is a python one. But I am wondering if there are better solutions out there.

                    <span>Hello guys,
 I was wondering, what is the consensus for the best version of eMacs on Mac? And is there a port better compatible with M1?
 I saw that mitsuharu Yamamoto’s port was appreciated, but recent posts (1 year ago... there is not a lot of osX users here!) seems to indicate that the NS version was more stable...
 In the past, I used eMacs and org with Ubuntu and WSL, but as I am switching my workflow to Mac, I am tinkering on having a native app installed (rather than using a VM for emacs...). I’ve used my Mac M1 extensively, and faced hundred of bugs and issues with intel based software (from VDI and OBS support to screen through Bluetooth etc)
 Thanks for your feedbacks!

                    <span>I have just published a git repo with Dockerfiles and wrapper scripts for running language servers in a way that is transparent to the LSP client, so that you can use them without the client having to know anything about Docker. So far it only has recipes for the two versions of ElixirLS that I am using, so I eagerly invite any contributions, questions, or feedback. I started this because I could not find any existing Dockerfiles for language servers, and I hope this can fill that gap for others.

                    <span>This is another embarrassingly basic question. I&#x27;ve been fiddling with writing transcoders for org publish and I&#x27;m confused about what is probably a simple data type. I&#x27;d google it if I knew what to type.. I&#x27;m exporting a table with a caption, so I add the property: #+CAPTION: This is Caption. Ok, so I can pull the :caption property from the table&#x27;s plist, but the value is wrapped in triple parentheses when I format it to a string: (((This is Caption))) When I try to do things like mapconcat it, the type object is displayed a bit differently: (#(&quot;This is Caption&quot; 0 15 (:parent #0))) 
 So now I&#x27;m closer, I know this is a list of text properties, right? So I can use car to get the string, but only if I nest it three times over the list: (car (car (car caption))) but there has to be a better way, right?

                    <span>Hi All
 Long time lurker and first-time (I think?) poster. Anyways, I implemented the Lamport one-time signature scheme a while back in Haskell and wanted to share.
 https://github.com/difelicemichael/lamport-haskell
 It also includes a module solely for the purposes of illustrating the dangers of key-reuse in this signature scheme.
 ​
 As with anything cryptography related, it&#x27;s always best not to reinvent the wheel, so it goes without saying that the module is not production-ready / suitable. Still though, couldn&#x27;t resist the urge to share, comments / criticisms are welcome (and encouraged!).

                    <span>The idea of a book that goes from zero to a working product is very intriguing to me. Building a CI also seems like a domain where I wouldn&#x27;t mind a bit more insight.
 I will almost definitely read it, unless someone says it is filled with bad practice and bad advice.

                    <span>HI All
 I have been using Emacs for Org Mode on an old mac from some time now. I have bought a Macbook pro and have installed Emacs.
 I have a Dropbox account where I have placed my .emacs.d folder and its contents in, including the init.el and the *.org files I use for the GTD system.
 On the Macbook, I have entered the following code in the init.el file so that my settings and files will be usable on the macbook and the experience will be the same as on my Mac desktop.
 I have setup the following code in the init.el file on my latop
 (setq user-init-file &quot;~/Dropbox/.emacs.d/&quot;)
 However when loading emcacs it just loads vanilla emacs.
 Also, when i use Dired to navigate to the dropbox location where i have some .org files located, if I try open a file it fails stating:
 &quot;File exists, but cannot be read&quot;
 ​
 Any guidance appreciated.

                    <span>I&#x27;m looking for a library that allows me to write effects in a similar way I do it with Monix or ZIO, but I can&#x27;t seem to find one.
 I&#x27;ve found something similar to the IO monad in RxJava, with the Single data type, but once I name RxJava, people assume I&#x27;m looking for a streams library and start suggesting stuff I&#x27;m not looking for.
 I&#x27;m looking for a library that allows me to build effects easily. From futures, completion stages, callbacks, etc. Also I&#x27;m looking if it has operators to zip effects in parallel or ideally, a fiber based concurrency model.
 I&#x27;m not looking for a streams library, not looking for libraries for distributed computing.

 I wanted to understand like where should I start and what are the resources I should be refer to. I want to get ready in a month or so. 
 My learning curve would be scala and Akka with Sbt. Any help is good. Currently I&#x27;m going through youtube but don&#x27;t find any streamlined courses. Only talks. 
 Thanks for your help

                    <span>I&#x27;m trying to match the type of an object and I was under the impression that the compiler would automatically detect the type but for some reason the compiler declares it as Any (see https://i.imgur.com/qwmNWvp.png). 
 Is that normal and am I missing something or is there something wrong with my IDE?

                    <span>If I have some method foo that can take a Option[Seq[Int]] and I want to have an identical method foo that can operate the same on Option[Seq[Double], what&#x27;s the idiomatic scala way of achieving that?
 In other languages, this would be done via method overloading but it&#x27;s apparently not recommended in Scala and also my compiler warns/errors about type erasure.

                    <span>This may be very dumb but please excuse my ignorance as I am very new to this. I want to learn emacs and more specifically use org mode for todo lists and agendas and then learn emacs as I go. But I have a few questions about the emacs program, mainly about security and privacy.
 Who maintains emacs? Are there regular updates for the program?
 I&#x27;m looking for a safe and private place to put all my notes, how do I know emacs is secure and private? What&#x27;s to stop the program from uploading my notes somewhere? (again, I am not that tech savy so please excuse me)
 Do I need to learn emacs before using orgmode?
 Thank you in advance!

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been using Emacs for a few years, but I&#x27;ve never been totally satisfied with my workflow for selecting files.
 In other editors (Sublime, vim) my primary mode of navigation is &quot;ctrl-p&quot;-like things: type a keybinding, fuzzy find a file, hit enter, done.
 Emacs is a bit more complicated, though; there are a lot more places where I want to select from a list of completions, so packages need to both be good for selecting from lists of symbols as well as lists of files.
 Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve used up to this point:
  
flx with ido. By far the best accuracy of any tool - I&#x27;m not sure what flx&#x27;s algorithm is, but it is incredible and gives me zero false positives. Unfortunately, flx is largely in maintenance mode and ido, among other things, has trouble being hooked into many places that use comp…</span>

 I&#x27;ve been following React JavaScript tutorial to setup LSP support in Emacs. It works but I get message:

                    <span>Should I invest the time into learning Emacs for Zettledeft or Org-mode (for the Zettlekasten Note Taking System). Is it worth the time that you put into learning Emacs? And how does it excel compared to programs like Obsidian and ROAM research? And Is there a map or graph which shows interconnected notes on emacs? Thanks in advance!

For example, if I want to switch from looking at files in C:\ to files in K:\. And, no, I can&#x27;t backspace past the C:\ if I do SPC-f-f.

 There&#x27;s a release announcement but it&#x27;s almost empty.
 Maybe current Forge users could explain why they use, to make up for the lack of any detail from my side. ;P

 I selected a block of latex text (in org mode) and ran M-x preview-section on it, but nothing happened. Whenever I search for an answer, all the answers are for &quot;inline latex&quot; not the preview
 I have doom emacs, set up with latex +lsp in my init.el. Is there another flag I need to add

                    <span>I&#x27;m using Emacs on a Mac and mostly have it open full screen. Sometimes I want to quickly open a new frame that&#x27;s not full screen (e.g., to put it next to a browser window), while keeping the full screen Emacs window/frame intact.
 To achieve this, I wrote the following function:
 (defun efls/new-frame () &quot;Create a new frame and ensure it&#x27;s not full screen.&quot; (interactive) (make-frame) ;; Return from fullscreen, if fullscreen (when (memq (frame-parameter nil &#x27;fullscreen) &#x27;(fullscreen fullboth)) (toggle-frame-fullscreen))) 
 My only problem is that apparently, the toggle-frame-fullscreen also impacts the original full screen Emacs window/frame.
 Does anyone have an idea what causes this? Or any other suggestions to improve this small convenient function?
 EDIT: So apparently toggle-frame-fullscreen can take FRAME as optional parameter. How can I point it to the current frame?

                    <span>I don&#x27;t want to stir up more drama, but the cat&#x27;s already out the bag. I am a channel operator of #evil-mode@Freenode. There is very little going on in the channel, but it has several very knowledgeable people in it. In the last few days there has been a push for many channels to migrate from Freenode to Libera due to mismanagement. I&#x27;ve set up #evil-mode@Libera to make it easy to find, but have been approached by an #emacs@Libera representative while trying to chanop status for #emacs-circe@Libera (I already have chanop for #emacs-circe@Freenode). That individual suggested me that #evil-mode@Libera might be better named #emacs-evil@Libera to fit into the Emacs namespace and profit from management by several channel operators.
 I find this idea highly intriguing, but don&#x27;t want to impose the mental burden of people having to migrate from #evil-mode to #emacs-evil, especially for a Libera-only thing (the existing Freenode channel is still there, though slowly thinning out). Therefore the following options are on the table:
 a) Leave things as is, with #evil-mode@Libera following the existing naming
 b) Create #emacs-evil@Libera, set up a redirect from #evil-mode@Libera to #emacs-evil@Libera and adjust documentation accordingly
 c) Other (explain in your comment what other option you see)

                    <span>I would like to have a table-based planner like the Growth Book by John Fish which I wish to use every day.
 It looks like this (1 big cell and 4 smaller ones):
 ​
  
 big cell 1 small cell 1 
  
 big cell 1 small cell 2 
  small cell 3 small cell 4 
 
 Now I have 2 questions regarding my plan:
 - How do I construct something like that (as far as I know, org-mode does not support such merged tables)?- How do I make it reusable? I mean, there must be a better way than creating a file for each and every day or manually deleting the content of such a table every day.

                    <span>Hi, I would like to make a instalation guide to be run with no graphical environment. 
 The idea is to have a guide that the person can read and execute the commands from within emacs, without need to type/copy/paste the commands. When the person executes a code block, a buffer with a term with the command inputted is created.
 * step 1 Explanation bla bla bla #+BEGIN_SRC screen :session my_session command #+END_SRC 
 The example above uses org-mode and ob-screen(org-babel-screen) but I can make it works only with need xterm This way the command is inputted in another desktop window outside emacs running xterm. I guess it also works with others terminal emulators that runs in graphical environments. 
 But as I mentioned I need a solution able to run in tty. Would be possible to use ob-screen with term/vterm inside emacs? Other possible solutions?
 Some extra considerations:
 In some steps the commands are interactives, you need to give some some answers, select stff etc. 
 ob-tmux is a valid alternative to ob-screen but seens to have the same restriction.

 When I start emacs it&#x27;ll just spit out x&#x27;s, c&#x27;s or c-c&#x27;s until I c-g or interrupt it with an arrow key for example. Any ideas what could be causing this? Thanks in advance.

                    <span>I am mid/advanced Haskell user, with some experience on the appplication side and I&#x27;d be interested to get into library development, but I confess I haven&#x27;t ventured into Core yet. This is why I&#x27;d be curious to know if there are purely language related patterns which, on the current or foreseeable future versions of the GHC, should be avoided if possible for their high burden on performance. 
 In other words, I&#x27;d be interested in a list of, say, the top 3-5 patterns which, when frequently used in a program&#x27;s source code, are the most likely to incur a performance drop that cannot be traced to anything else than their Core implementation. (Thus I am not really interested in performance costs caused by &quot;choosing the wrong data structure&quot;.)
 Of course there&#x27;s the suspicion that these &quot;likely performance-killers when used frequently&quot; will be symptoms of bad design decisions from the application author:
  
evaluating too often (i.e. excessive case pattern matching, incurring unnecessary computations)
 evaluating too rarely (i.e. excessive lazyness, incurring unnecessary garbage collection)
  
I am also interested in real life examples involving these, but perhaps a bit more in patterns that are likely to jam GHC optimization capabilities.

Both are remote-friendly (and the entire team is widely geographically distributed). Due to where Arista has offices, and related paperwork constraints, applicants in US/Canada/Ireland/India are strongly preferred.
 While we initially have a fairly tight notion of what the work we&#x27;re hiring into is going to be, over time both positions have plenty of room to grow and take on other projects (also in Haskell) throughout our codebase, or even greenfield new stuff. Both also offer the opportunity to work with a really great team of seasoned Haskell devs, as well as nix contributors, etc.

                    <span>Now that I have used backpack in raaz which has internally simplified the package quite a bit. However there are some ergonomic issues in their use at-least in raaz.
  
Firstly, I am not sure why backpack performs the mixing and matching in the .cabal file. I feel it makes the .cabal file rather large and unwieldy. The raaz.cabal is close to 900 lines of code with no real way to split it up. It is probably one of the biggest file in the repository
 
The documentation story is not very nice. Say Module A which depends on Signature Sig in an internal module. Now suppose the top library wants expose a version of A with some module mixed in for Sig, all the documentation of the functions defined are lost. One can solve this as this can be seen here. https://github.com/raaz-crypto/raaz/blob/master/raaz/Raaz/Digest.hs Documenting the functions in the source module (A in this case) is not useful because it is not visible one has to repeat this again in the outside exposed module. Whereas writing the documentation close to the function definition (in module A) make more sense.
 
Mismatch between documentation for hackage vs created by cabal haddock.
 
 I think 2,3 are probably bugs, or there is a way to handle it that I do not know about, but 1 is a design choice. It is curious because ghc supports .bkp files which is not recommended though. Currently .bkp files are only used to include test cases in ghc the compiler or to demonstrate backpack.

                    <span>I&#x27;m trying to create a custom agenda view to review what I did last week. Among other things, I want this to display a clock table of all the tasks I clocked into in the last 7 days. 
 ​
 The closest thing to this that I found is putting an &quot;agenda&quot; block in my custom agenda view and using org-agenda-clockreport-mode. The problem with this approach is that there&#x27;s no way to set the time range of this table the way I want. If I set a different time range in org-agenda-clockreport-parameter-plist, the function that displays this clock table overwrites it internally.
 ​
 It would be best if I could just put a custom clock table to the top of my agenda view by hand somehow. Which hooks or functions am I supposed to use to write custom text in an agenda buffer?

 Even better, one with parameterized error type?

 A new video in the series, about expressions (as opposed to statements) and about pure and impure functions. Beginner to lower-intermediate level, as usual. I think it&#x27;s the most information-dense video I made so far. Much more than in the past I tried to correlate what I say with what happens on the screen. Instead of switching from one panel to another as if they were slides in a presentation, the progress is more gradual.
 I hope you enjoy.

                    <span>I gave a talk at Scalacon recently about debugging and observing Scala code, and some people asked about how you set up the instrumentation to inject logging statements into JDK and library code. I set up a project to make it easier to work with, so you can start from there and copy bits out.
 The code makes an HTTPS call out to Google, and the SSLContext class is instrumented so that you can see logging on enter and exit:
  FoI3Xm5jH1w6O0Qbm7EAAA 6:59:29.018 [TRACE] j.n.s.SSLContext - entering: javax.net.ssl.SSLContext.getDefault() with arguments&#x3D;[] from source SSLContext.java:98 FoI3Xm5jH2g6O0Qbm7EAAA 6:59:29.030 [TRACE] j.n.s.SSLContext - entering: javax.net.ssl.SSLContext.getInstance(java.lang.String) with arguments&#x3D;[Default] from source SSLContext.java:166 FoI3Xm5jH8YdHaINzdiAAA 6:59:29.130 [TRACE] j.n.s.SSLContext - exiting: javax.net.ssl.SSLContext.getInstance(java.lang.String) with arguments&#x3D;[Default] &#x3D;&gt; (return_type&#x3D;javax.net.ssl.SSLContext return_value&#x3D;javax.net.ssl.SSLContext@4ad3d266) from source SSLContext.java:169 FoI3Xm5jH8adHaINzdiAAA 6:59:29.131 [TRACE] j.n.s.SSLContext - exiting: javax.net.ssl.SSLContext.getDefault() with arguments&#x3D;[] &#x3D;&gt; (return_type&#x3D;javax.net.ssl.SSLContext return_value&#x3D;javax.net.ssl.SSLContext@4ad3d266) from source SSLContext.java:101 FoI3Xm5jH8adHaINzdiAAB 6:59:29.132 [TRACE] j.n.s.SSLContext - entering: javax.net.ssl.SSLContext.getSocketFactory() with arguments&#x3D;[] from source SSLContext.java:311 FoI3Xm5jH8cdHaINzdiAAA 6:59:29.132 [TRACE] j.n.s.SSLContext - exiting: javax.net.ssl.SSLContext.getSocketFactory() with arguments&#x3D;[] &#x3D;&gt; (return_type&#x3D;javax.net.ssl.SSLSocketFactory return_value&#x3D;sun.security.ssl.SSLSocketFactoryImpl@15d0849) from source SSLContext.java:311

                    <span>It is not difficult to find articles that herald the benefits of using a Zettelkasten and because of this, a dose of skepticism is perhaps healthy. Do you really get magically productive? Produce world-class research? Uncover secret connections for elevated understanding? Write 10 books spontaneously?
In my case, neither of those, but I do think there is a point in telling about experiences (positive and negative) and here I&#x27;ll share a bit of mine on a recent conference paper I presented and published. This is not some amazing breakthrough or epiphany; but it is an interesting angle to an existing problem using ideas that were not obvious before working with the Zettelkasten.
I want to talk about this paper specifically because it truly emerged in my Zettelkasten. Ideas obviously come from…</span>

                    <span>I have a series of emacs files that define some of the more elaborate customization areas of my setup, such as orgmode, and gnus. The practice of keeping the setup in separate files is not the question; the advantage it gives for maintaining/tracking setup-specific questions makes it an easy win. However, right now I&#x27;m basically doing a load-file from my emacs.el to bring any of them in. My question is, should I instead by making them packages and loading them that way (e.g. finishing my gnus file with provides my/gnus-setup)? Is there a good reason for doing this instead of a floating .el file when it&#x27;s just me using them? And if so, does anyone have an example of this process, particularly how you load them/add them to your load path?

                    <span>In Windows 10, I have the following, which is based on what&#x27;s in the info manual (this is the entire contents of my init file):
 (setq w32-pass-lwindow-to-system nil) (setq w32-lwindow-modifier &#x27;super) (w32-register-hot-key [s-]) (global-set-key (kbd &quot;s-s&quot;) &#x27;save-buffer) (global-set-key (kbd &quot;s-a&quot;) &#x27;mark-whole-buffer) 
 The s-s binding works fine, but the s-a binding does not. Running describe-key s-a reveals that Emacs sees the s-a binding as C-a.
 The same is true when I try to bind s-z, s-x, s-v, s-c (and some, but not all, others).
 I have no idea how to even diagnose this. Any idea what&#x27;s happening here?

                    <span>Hi,
 I remember seeing mentions of adding use-package and more recently, transient to vanilla emacs. I only see it mentioned here or on blogs but I don&#x27;t know how and where to track the advancement of which packages make it into vanilla emacs and when they do so?
 Is there a single place with such references? 
 Thanks

                    <span>I am trying to make an extension to the wonderful Deft package that can preview/view files in a side window of the Deft buffer (similar to the functionality of the original Notational Velocity). Deft normally takes a set of text files and for each file, displays a widget in the Deft buffer that, when pressed/clicked, opens the corresponding file. For my extension, I would like the file to be opened in the side window with that window having focus, but with the Deft buffer window still visible. I have had some success getting this to work, but I came across a situation with different behaviors depending whether one &quot;presses&quot; the file widget (by hitting [RET] when the point is on a file widget), or one &quot;clicks&quot; the file widget (by clicking the widget with the mouse):
  
If the file is opened by hitting [RET] (invoking widget-button-press), the file is opened in the side window below and the file’s window now has focus. This is the desired behavior that I want.
 If the file is opened by clicking with the mouse (invoking widget-button-click), the file is opened in the side window below, but the focus remains with the Deft buffer. This is not the desired behavior.
  
To demonstrate this phenomenon, I have made a &quot;minimal&quot; example of it in a package I call &quot;Daft&quot;: 
 https://github.com/shankar2k/daft
 How can I make a widget-button-click action that can switch focus to a different window other than the current one?

                    <span>I want to reduce the clutter in the modeline of org agenda, so I have the following function:
 (defun org-agenda-set-mode-name ()
 &quot;Set the mode name to indicate all the small mode settings.&quot;
 (setq mode-name
 &#x60;(list &quot;&quot;&#x60; 
 (if org-agenda-clockreport-mode
 (if (eq org-agenda-clockreport-mode &#x27;with-filter)
 &quot; Clock{}&quot; &quot; Clock&quot; )
  &#x60;&quot;&quot;)))&#x60; 
 (force-mode-line-update))
 However, when I execute this this function, emacs just exits to the desktop. Is there a way to get more information about this crash?
 Incidentally, something else is wrong in my org setup, because the first time I want to open an org-file, I get
 Debugger entered--Lisp error: (void-function org-agenda-set-mode-name)
 org-agenda-set-mode-name()
 run-hooks(change-major-mode-after-body-hook text-mode-hook outline-mode-hook org-mode-hook)
 apply(run-hooks (change-major-mode-after-body-hook text-mode-hook outline-mode-hook org-mode-hook))
 run-mode-hooks(org-mode-hook)
 org-mode()
 I tried updating org-mode to today&#x27;s version of 20210524, but no avail. I no longer have a custom definition of org-agenda-set-mode-name in my init.el, but still it seems emacs does not want to pick up the default orgmode implementation of that function.
 This is on 27.1, Windows 10.

                    <span>I&#x27;m trying to make Emacs correctly jump into problematic file when I&#x27;m running C-x p c make test RET, which runs makefile test target. The problem is, that when error occurs, the error path is correctly detected in *compilation* buffer, but because there are two spaces before the actual path Emacs can&#x27;t find the file. For example, here&#x27;s the output:
 stack traceback: [C]: in function &#x27;assert&#x27; tests/multivalues-test.fnl:17: in main chunk [C]: in function &#x27;xpcall&#x27; /home/andreyorst/.luarocks/bin/fennel:4398: in function ? [C]: in ? make: *** [Makefile:32: test] Error 1 
 Here, when I press RET on the tests/multivalues-test.fnl:17: in main chunk line, Emacs tries to open &quot; tests/multivalues-test.fnl&quot; file (two leading spaces are included as part of the path (reddit strips those even in backticks for some reason)).
 I&#x27;ve tried modifying compilation-error-regexp-alist-alist variable by adding there the following regex as per this SO question answer
 (add-to-list &#x27;compilation-error-regexp-alist-alist &#x27;(fennel &quot;^.*\\([a-zA-Z/][^\n:]+\\):\\([0-9]+\\):&quot; 1 2)) 
 But no luck, Emacs still tries to open path with leading spaces. Any tips? Thanks.
  
Note, pressing RET on the second error line /home/andreyorst/.luarocks/bin/fennel:4398: in function ? opens correct file. I think because it begins with the / Emacs can find correct path start char.

                    <span>hello, i work on a yaml based DSL that generates java code, i use emacs for most things, so i am thinking of creating my first major mode that does syntax highlighting, auto-complete java class names defined elsewhere in the same yaml file, and most importantly provides a set of snippets. 
 ​
 any idea or recommendations or examples how to ship yasnippets with a major mode? 
 ​
 Ideally, users only need to install the package with &quot;M-x package-install&quot; and no more setup, i think i can update the &quot;yas/snippet-dirs&quot; and setup the snippets files correctly, but since this is my first major mode, i&#x27;d greatly appreciate if someone can point me to an example or just tell me if there is better way of doing this.

                    <span>Hi everyone! As above I’m learning Haskell and I would like to find some mates to create projects with on GitHub to enhance our skills and share knowledge. I’m opened to everything, just group up and code together.

                    <span>I was curious as to the state of Haskell and machine learning and I found this link: Haskell machine learning.
 Has anyone seen this?
 Is anyone using Haskell in all/part machine learning?

                    <span>I am in a situation where there is a suite of packages that is presently unmaintained by the original author. I have attempted to submit patches back upstream from my fork, however, there has been no response on GitHub, where the repository is currently hosted. I have also separately sent an email to the maintainer address specified in the cabal file and received no response.
 I am generally of the opinion that letting packages fragment due to maintainer absence is a generally bad thing when the ecosystem is small and could otherwise accrete contributions from outsiders. I am now puzzling over how I should proceed. The way I see it my only option left is to republish to hackage under a different name, further exacerbating fragmentation. This also leaves the question of how to name the package, whether naming it as a derivative name is appropriate or whether I should name it something else entirely. Is there any unspoken rules about how package naming should be done in situations like this (or even more generally)?

 I am trying to use this in a function countCables which should return as follows:

 I am completely stumped on how this could be done. 
 I just know that I somehow have to give out a (+1) Whenever it is not Empty and a 0 on the router. My thought process is it gives out (+1) that accumulate on the router that has gives a value of 0 and then all those (+1) act on it. But I am not quite sure.

                    <span>I have the following data type:
 data Transaction &#x3D; Deposit {value :: Float} | Withdrawal {value :: Float} deriving Show 
 When I create a Deposit, I can do print $ value (Deposit 20.5) to print the value. Can I do something like print $ contructorName (Deposit 20.5) and get &quot;Deposit&quot; printed?
 Of course, I can do:
 data Transaction &#x3D; Deposit {contructorName :: String, value :: Float} | Withdrawal {contructorName :: String, value :: Float} deriving Show 
 but that seems redundant because I have to run Deposit &quot;Deposit&quot; 20.5 to create a deposit.

                    <span>Has anyone had success with using gloss on Windows? (I&#x27;m using the Haskell Platform, installed through chocolatey.) When I try to run a program using gloss, I get this error:
  user error (unknown GLUT entry glutInit) 
 and with the alternative GLFW backend,
  user error (unknown GLUT entry glutStrokeCharacter) 
 My program works fine on Linux.
 I found some similar questions, but the suggested workarounds have had no visible effect.

 I have keen interest in System Design and really love to spread my readings. That&#x27;s why, I have started a youtube channel, where I talk on different topics related to Computer Science and Distributed System.
 Can you guys please watch video and tell me things that I can improve as a youtuber? Any suggestion is valuable at this time.
 If nothing, subscribing channel will help me alot!
 Thankyou.
 Here is link to my second video.

                    <span>Hello Scala Community,
 Is anyone using a product that scans for security vulnerabilities?
 More specifically, something that will go through all of my application&#x27;s Scala-specific dependencies and flag vulnerabilities? I looked at Trivy but looks like there is no support for Scala.

                    <span>This week I hope to get up the nerve to make another video. This time it will be on the script that will &#x27;Track people mentions in archive 202105160502.md&#x60;. It is a little more developed. I&#x27;ll be putting it out in public for your comments and suggestions. This one will not use any Keyboard Maestro Secret Sauce. Strictly a command line tool.
I&#x27;ll be onboarding Leigh Calvez&#x27;s The Hidden Lives of Owls - not too much there, I can&#x27;t recommend this book. To be fair there isn&#x27;t much known about the live&#x27;s of owls let alone their hidden lives. I&#x27;m not sure what I was expecting when I started this book. It makes me wonder about the next book in the queue The Hummingbirds&#x27; Gift: Wonder, Beauty, and Renewal on Wings by Sy Montgomery. Both of these books were recommended by Maria Popova, others that she has recommended have been winners. Overall she is a great reading recommendation filter.
I&#x27;m thinking how I use the OMNI BAR.</span>

                    <span>Initially I only used my ZK for non-tech related things I read.  I then wondered how useful it might be for the wide variety of technical things I read for work and pleasure and whether it might serve a similar purpose to allow for finding new connections between otherwise disparate topics or even items within a topic.  The jury is still out for me.  For example, I recently wrote about 30 Zettels for AWS security related topics.  I allowed my thought process to develop as a function of what I was reading, attempting to ask the same sort of questions I ask for non-tech things.  I don&#x27;t feel the same sort of power doing it for tech stuff yet.  The weird cross connects don&#x27;t seem to manifest as much or maybe since it&#x27;s a new way for me to look at tech it will take some time to get used to it.
I&#x27;d be curious to see if any developers, hackers or RE&#x27;s have used it for tech stuff and how they felt it went.</span>

                    <span>I may have requested this feature in the past, but I think this shows a better use case.
I&#x27;m often using the Omni Bar for searching with terms and Boolean operators for notes that might be relevant to create links. This is how I interact with my archive. For me, full text search rules! Everything else is secondary.
Once I enter a search and move the focus forward to check the returned notes, I can&#x27;t get back to my search query by hitting the back button. I can go back to prior notes, but it would be beneficial if I&#x27;d be able to come across my search query amongst the note history so I could change it without having to remember and retype it two or three times as I refine my query and narrow the focus.
It would be helpful if the omni bar&#x27;s history included user inputted queries. Its not a full history of the omni bars activity if it doesn&#x27;t include user inputted searches.
For example, if I query with the omni bar prompts writing and I start looking at the notes returned and decide this is not broad enough of a search. I am tempted to use the &quot;Back&quot; function to try to restore to my prior state. I want to edit the search to prompts AND &#x27;writing OR blogging but it is not there to be edited, so I have to remember what I already searched for and retype it.</span>

                    <span>Seeing @sfast &#x27;s concept of the one file Zettelkasten in another post, I decided to try it out.
I don&#x27;t know if he&#x27;s elaborated on this already, but my hunch is that &quot;if you can do it in a single file, then it means that you (more or less) understand the principles.&quot;

Would this be considered a good example of the one-file Zettelkasten?
Anyway, looking forward to the online course!
Seeing that these notes don&#x27;t have tags makes me wonder:

                    <span>Hello Zettelkasten friends,
Say you have accumulated a lot of notes from different books. But after reading the primary sources rather than the books, you now have a different view as compared to your existing atomic notes where you just relied on an author&#x27;s interpretation.
Do you:
Update your existing notes, even if they&#x27;re well-linked to already?
Create a new one and link to the existing?
Create structure note that generalizes both?
Do both #2 and #3?
Thanks!</span>

                    <span>Previously on given up on dictation, as i found the results weren&#x27;t good enough.
 Today I had a look at the VOSK-API and open-source speech to text engine and was pleasantly surprised to find it&#x27;s quite usable.
 I&#x27;ve put together a small utility for Linux that can be configured to dictate while a key is pressed.
 I&#x27;d imagine there is potential for Emacs to take advantage of this kind of functionality too, has anyone currently doing anything with dictation in a Emacs?
 The utility is linked here (although it&#x27;s not Emacs spesific).

                    <span>i am very new to elisp and emacs(like a month) 
 currently what i am doing is setting a variable inside the function as t or nil based on the function state and checking it at the beginning. another idea i got was writing a minor mode but i feel like its too much just to make a function toggleable.
 are there any elegant ways of doing this without creating tones of variables ?

                    <span>Hi,
 Any one know the shortcut for typing hex number in Emacs calc?
 Currently I always have to input prefix &quot;16#&quot; for input &quot;16#AB&quot;.
 And the yank &quot;0xAB&quot; is invalid, it require type input &quot;16#AB&quot; manually.
 I want to know, is there any shortcut like enter xAB instead enter 16#AB, or o67 instead 8#67, or b10 instead 2#10? 
 Thanks

                    <span>I am a Junior CS student. I want to make persistent layouts for each of my classes so that I can quickly pickup where I left off in each class. Since each class is a little different it would be nice to have a menu on my start screen that would let me open the proper buffers. Ex. Having treemacs, the last code file i was editing, and a terminal open for a programming classes. Or my notes in an org mode buffer for a gen ed class. Or even just dired in the directory i have reserved for the class.
 I have tried ivy view, however the push and pop functionality is not so favorable for my workflow.

                    <span>After installing aspell, and making flyspell-mode to run in Part I, (thanks to u/AsifShimon), this is my init.el configuration:
 (setq ispell-extra-args &#x27;(&quot;--sug-mode&#x3D;ultra&quot; &quot;--lang&#x3D;en_US&quot; &quot;--run-together&quot; &quot;--run-together-limit&#x3D;16&quot;))
 (setq ispell-program-name &quot;C:/msys64/mingw64/bin/aspell.exe&quot;)
 I think the next step is to face these challenges with &quot;words lists&quot;.
  
How to install dictionaries? (Problem #1)
 Best practices to choose which dictionary to use? (M-x ispell-change-dictionary is all we need?)
 How to manage the adding of new words, in different languages, to personal dictionaries? How to use one personal dictionary per language?
  
​
 ​
  
I&#x27;ve tried to install an aspell english dictionary in MSYS64, the command:
  
$ pacman -S mingw-w64-i686-aspell-en
 When I try M-x flyspell-mode, emacs gives me this ERROR:
 Starting new Ispell process C:/msys64/mingw64/bin/aspell.exe with default dictionary...done
 Error enabling Flyspell mode:
 (Error: No word lists can be found for the language &quot;en_US&quot;.
 Why can&#x27;t flyspell find the dictionary?
 If I try it changing the dictionary language, using:
 M-x ispell-change-dictionary portugues
 emacs sends me this message:
 Local Ispell dictionary set to portugues
 Starting new Ispell process C:/msys64/mingw64/bin/aspell.exe with portugues dictionary...done

 It&#x27;s funny the path to the dictionary, mixing &quot;\&quot; and &quot;/&quot;: (Error: The file &quot;c:\msys64\mingw64/lib/aspell-0.60/portugues&quot; can not be opened for reading.

                    <span>I have an ongoing issue where my python process in the inferior buffer constantly keeps dying.
 It is hard to debug, because I don&#x27;t see any errors or warnings. All packages are up to date (and had the same issue since a while).
 I have a REPL driven workflow with elpy, lsp-mode(pyright) and pyvenv.
 The process keeps dying randomly - either after a random command or just on idle. I have to re-activate the env and reload everything and since this can happen even after a few seconds, it is very annoying.
 This repeats many times in a fresh session, but the frequency at some point decreases and I can eventually work for tens of minutes without it dying...
 Did somebody run into a similar issue?

 I placed my override Yasnippet template in &#x27;~/.emacs.d/snippets/org-mode/src&#x27;
 Mine used to be just fine until I upgraded to Emacs 27.2.
 Here is the affected Yasnippet that I have placed in &#x27;~/.emacs.d/snippets/org-mode/src&#x27; whose aim is to just override the default non-Caps version of the same idea:

                    <span>We&#x27;re planning to migrate hackage to a bigger server that needs make no use of external block storage later today. There will be a short span of time (an hour or two) where the website is inaccessible. While https://hackage.haskell.org is inaccessible you won&#x27;t be able to use it to browse packages and documentation.
 However, cabal-install and stack should continue to work thanks to mirroring, and the process should be automatic.
 If you do need to configure manual mirrors of the package repository, the urls are
 http://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/hackage-mirror/ and http://hackage.fpcomplete.com/
 As usual we will post manual status updates at https://status.haskell.org/
 EDIT: The data transfer is taking longer than we hoped, though all else is going well with the new server. We will hopefully perform the cutover (with attendant downtime) tomorrow.

                    <span>Hello, 
 I&#x27;m currently writing a parser for a simple DSL and want to write a test where I load a file from disk, feed it to the parser, and study the output produced by the parser, something like an integration/system test if you want. I&#x27;m currently using hspec for unit tests and stack.
 My question is, what would be the best way to achieve this?
 1) is hspec the right tool for this kind of job? 2) how can I get the path of the file to load(assuming its in a know location in the same repo)?
 Thanks a lot and happy haskelling.

 Doing your taxes is no fun. But functional programming can ease the pain. In this post I describe and demonstrate the Haskell tax library, which provides data types and combinators for defining taxes.

                    <span>I find Doobie&#x27;s approach to transaction management very elegant.
 I&#x27;m running different operations in a single DB transaction in one of my domain services. For this reason I have a repository, that returns Doobie&#x27;s ConnectionIOs, which I then &quot;flatmap&quot; to get transactional semantics. I was wondering if you know any good technique(s) to hide this implementation detail, or you just live with it in your project(s).
 Example psuedocode:
 trait UserRepository[F[_]] {
 def insert(user: User): ConnectionIO[Unit]
 }
 ​
 class UserService[F[_]](xa: Transactor[F]) {
 def create(user: User): F[Unit] &#x3D;
 (for {
 _ &lt;- insert(user)
 _ &lt;- sendEmail(user).to[ConnectionIO] // &lt;&lt; can we hide ConnectionIO here? What about transactor?
 } yield ()).transact(xa)
 }

                    <span>I am reading Functional Programming in Scala book, In the chapter 3 &amp; 4 the author has introduced list and optional types for data structure and error handling. What I observed is, the author is creating a data type and data constructs and using Companion object or trait body to declare the functionalities. He is using pattern matching, based on the match respective case function is executed and on top using higher order functions to work with this data types by generalizing the pure functions and passing these pure functions to HOF
 For Example 
 trait List[A]
 case object Nil extends List[Nothing]
 case class Cons[A](head:A,tail:Cons:List[A]) extends List[A]
 In the book, He used a companion object List
 object List {
 // some functions to manipulate the list data type 
 }
 ​
 the pattern is similar for option data type as well but all the functions are implemented in trait body
 My question is what is the need to do things this way ?. May be I am not seeing the big picture and looking from the perspective of creating data types and HOF&#x27;s to manipulate them. How does this helps composing program.

                    <span>Hi Zettlers,
I recently reduced the font size in The Archive because I needed to windows next to each other to assemble a Q&amp;A (on selfdevelopment). Normally, I use pretty big letters (Menlo, 24pt). Now I am down to 18pt. I experienced a shift in my preference on how to structure my big notes. I use way more subtitles. I lean more towards a less formal outline and mix more elements together (TOC-like modules with comments and more).
What is your reasoning behind the font size of your Zettelkasten software?

                    <span>I defined a new custom variable with defcustom with a set/initialize function that does what I want, but now I want to be able to set that variable easily from a hydra. Calling customize-set-variable on its own or with M-x works, but then I have to select which variable I want to set. What I want to do is call (customize-set-variable &#x27;my-custom-variable) from a hydra option to jump straight to setting the value for that specific variable, but customize-set-variable requires 2 arguments, so that doesn&#x27;t work. 
 However, I noticed that the embark package does somehow get exactly the behaviour I want, but I&#x27;m having trouble understanding how it works so I can replicate it. In embark, customize-set-variable is in embark-variable-map, and selecting that action jumps straight to setting the value for the target variable. I&#x27;ve been reading through the embark source and trying various things and just failing to figure this out. At first it seemed that the variable would need an interactive property, but I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to even set that, and embark manages without it anyway. I feel like I&#x27;m missing some key bit of how this process works that I&#x27;d really like to understand. Can anyone point me in the right direction here?

 Basically, I would do a pattern search across a project&#x27;s files, and then after doing that I could do &#x60;C-c C-e&#x60; to enter a buffer listing the matches, where I could then edit each file in that one buffer, and save those changes with &#x60;C-c C-c&#x60;.

                    <span>Hi all, I&#x27;ve notice a strange behavior which I think is a bug. Start with some python file and open a shell, e.g. using C-c C-p. It&#x27;s an inferior-python-mode buffer, combined with comint-mode. Completion in this buffer stops working if flex style is added to the completion-styles where helm-completion-style is emacs. Alternatively, it works as expected when the styles are either helm or helm-fuzzy. So there&#x27;s some bad interaction between Helm and flex in this buffer. Thanks!

                    <span>Hello !
 I was an Ivy user for a long time, and recently tried to give a shot to the &quot;new&quot; suite Vertico/Marginalia/Orderless &amp; co.
 In doing so, I realized that although the Orderless package gives us a great tool to customize how minibuffer completion works, it also affects in-buffer completion, for which I use Company.
 Indeed, Company uses the company-capf backend, which itself relies on completion-at-point-functions to get and filter candidates. Those candidates are (as far as I understand) filtered us…</span>

                    <span>What is the right way to mute the messages that a function generates in the Messages buffer?
 In my case, when using org-gcal-sync, which runs every time I load my agenda, I get a 30-40 second long output that pops up in the Messages buffer as various events are synced. 
 I tried silencing the function&#x27;s output using this code below, but to no avail:

 I&#x27;d like to announce my very first Haskell library, vcs-ignore. Its main purpose is to work with files ignored by supported version control systems (so far only Git implementation is done), like checking if path is ignored, listing ignored paths, etc. It also comes with small executable that can be used standalone as command line utility. It&#x27;s already on Hackage and should be also on Stackage with next nightly build.

                    <span>Encountering a strange problem here. Helm is installed and active. When I want to create an agenda and select &quot;m&quot; from the org-agenda dispatcher, then I get a helm-buffer titled &quot;*helm-org-tags-view*&quot; with all my tags. But I would like to select for a given property in the properties drawer.
 Is there a way other to disabling Helm for the time I want to create my agenda so that I can enter a &quot;normal&quot; match-string?

                    <span>Goal: Sync Emacs config between two computers in my home. 
 Method: I have Syncthing setup between both of my computers and have successfully shared files between these two computers. 
 Question: So can I just drag and drop my Emacs config from my main computer into the sync folder and have that .emacs file be my .emacs for both of my computers?
 After putting the .emacs file into the sync folder do I just go to both of my computers and delete their current .emacs?

I was thinking of something like ViM + Latex but a little bit more friendly in terms of the basic stuff since I will use it to take notes on the University and sometimes I need to do it very fast since teachers don&#x27;t stop

 This must behave exactly like the start screen of the non-server version, i.e. when its buffer is killed, it must not return until a new instance of the SERVER is invoked.
 More straightforward instructions - 1. Start emacs server 2. Create a buffer with the startup screen 3. When a client is started with the above command, show this startup screen if it exists, otherwise show the scratch…</span>

Do you know anyway around this? BTW, I use pyright in lsp.

 The whole graphic must be visible.

                    <span>I just finished a class at my university where we learned about functional languages, and we learned about Haskell and JavaScript (not exactly pure functional, but it works well as an introduction to higher order functions). For our final project, we had to recreate a game in either language. I chose to recreate the classic game Tetris using Haskell, and my professor liked it so much he thought I should post it here.
 It is my first time using the language for anything big, but hopefully the code isn&#x27;t too …</span>

 The #haskell ecosystem on irc.libera.chat is now live. (libera.chat is the IRC network that was spun up by most of the former staffers for freenode.)
 Almost the entire set of #haskell channel operators either moved over completely or have established an additional account and are straddling the freenode/libera divide at the moment.
 Roughly a third of the community made the jump on their own, without any official designation as where we are headed, so if nothing else, it looks like this comm…</span>

                    <span>Hi, is there any actively maintained library for JSON handling that is compatible with the Aeson library? Alternatively, what would you use if you had to send data structures back and forth between PureScript frontend and Haskell backend? It seems to me quite odd that I couldn&#x27;t find any library that does not seem abandoned to communicate two languages that naturally fit together.

                    <span>I started to learn Scala generic content, and found that a lot of content in the source code is not understood, why is it designed like this? 
 for example:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;scala
 trait IterableLike[+A, +Repr]:
 def zip[A1 &gt;: A, B, That](that: GenIterable[B])(implicit bf: CanBuildFrom[Repr, (A1, B), That]): That &#x3D; {
 }
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 If +A is covariant , Why zip[A1 &gt;: A ....], Represent A is a subtype of A1?

 So far I&#x27;m aware of a great documentation that is out there (fs2.io) and some resources (https://fs2.io/#/documentation).
 What are the other recommended beginner-friendly materials (talks, articles, books) on fs2?

of the distributed nature of blockchains, different nodes can have different
ideas of what the current state of the blockchain is supposed to be. The
role of the consensus algorithm is to decide which of these possible states,
called forks or branches, will be selected globally. In the world of

There&#x27;s all manner of calfw stuff (which I don&#x27;t understand, but not strictly speaking the question here) and org-agenda and org-journal. So what is pulling up the little M-x calendar still good for?

                    <span>I was just thinking that I should really clean up my .emacs (yes, I&#x27;m old school). I use customize quite a bit, since its super easy to make and check out changes.
 But I thought it would be nice clean it up in a readable format for stuff I don&#x27;t change often once I like it. And thought hey...this could be automated somehow.

                    <span>I&#x27;m looking for a SIMPLE way to collaborate with my friends on text and tables. 
 They all use org but only one or two can or will use a vcs (git or anything else). 
 Do you guys know of any way to collaborate on the same org files easily (nothing needing vcs or advanced skills) ?
 I can self host a server if necessary. 
 Any lead would be appreciated.
 Edit: i looked at tools that allow real time sharing of a buffer. That&#x27;s not what i&#x27;m talking about necessarily.

However, I would prefer to use emacs for my notes for different reasons: I prefer org over markdown, emacs allows for much more control over keybindings, emacs is more keyboard-driven and, finall…</span>

                    <span>Affe provides an asynchronous fuzzy finder similar to the fzf command-line fuzzy finder, written in pure Elisp. A producer process is started in the background, e.g., find, fd or ripgrep. The output produced by this process is filtered by an external asynchronous Emacs process. The Emacs UI always stays responsive since the work is completely off-loaded to other processes. The results are presented in the minibuffer using Consult, which allows to quickly select from the available items.

 After searching for a very long time I could not find a way to insert dates in emacs calc (M-x calc). Is it even possible and how? Is there another package that does the same thing?
 I need to:
  
Calculate &quot;age&quot; based on 2 dates (e.g. 3 Jan - 1 Jan &#x3D; 2 days)
 Calculate exact time in hours (or days and hours) e.g. 3 Jan 3:40PM - 2 Jan 11:45PM ~&#x3D; 6:35 (the result was a guess)
 Has to be an interactive function, no M-x eval-buffer.

                    <span>Hello there,
 Noob question, but because I can&#x27;t find the exact question to this.
 Is it possible to make a pattern matching of a opaque type? If not, what type of data (case class, trait, etc.) can be used?
 Thanks in advance, and sorry if it&#x27;s really a simple question.

                    <span>There&#x27;s the community build, but it&#x27;s only a small fraction.
 If anyone&#x27;s up for it, I think it can be done by querying github API (to get a list of scala projects, and the number of stars for each) and maven central (to check for scala3 artifacts).

 Col A Col B

  4 9

  3 10  
  1 4  
  2 12  
 
 ​
 So I have a table similar to the one above(but like 800k lines) and Col A only goes from 1-5. How would I make a new Col C that includes just 5 lines and the averages of all the Col B which correspond to the Col A?
 So like:
 ​
  
 Col A Col C  
  
 1 9  
  2 8.5  
  3 11  
  4 5.5  
  5 24.5

                    <span>Hi!
 My name is Sergi and I have contributed to Melpa with two simple chemical utilities packages: molar-mass and chembalance.
 Now I have not got personal coding projects and I want to offer my collaboration to help in any elisp project. I am interested in maths, chemistry, editing, and I code in elisp and python.
 If you are developing packages to melpa and you need help, please tell me!
 Thanks.

                    <span>Hello! I&#x27;m in the process of switching from Spacemacs to Doom, and I&#x27;m wondering if there&#x27;s a package that provides functionality similar to Spacemacs&#x27; buffer-to-window- commands (i.e., the command that gets run in Spacemacs when you press SPC b ). I&#x27;ve searched high and low with no luck yet, but I&#x27;d be surprised if it wasn&#x27;t out there somewhere.
 Thank you!

 I&#x27;ve tried Gnus and, while I liked the paradigm, had to go back to notmuch because searching mails was only possible with mairix and too slow !
 But from Protesilaos config (deprecated), it looked like it&#x27;s possible to search mail in gnus with notmuch (with Emacs 28). The only catch is that I could not make it work with :
 (setq gnus-select-method &#x27;(nnmaildir &quot;gmail&quot; (directory &quot;~/mail/gmail&quot;) (gnus-search-engine gnus-search-notmuch (remove-prefix &quot;~/mail/gmail&quot;)) (get-new-mail nil)))

 I have just started using MacOS at work and I use Linux at home. I need to setup Emacs and also would like to set other IDEs, I use, to use Emacs keybindings.
  
How different are Emacs keybindings on MacOS? Do keybindings remain same across OSs? I am assuming Option acts like Alt and Command would act like Super.
 How is your experience using Emacs on Mac? Anything I should be aware of?
 Does anybody has experience using IntelliJ Idea with Emacs Keymap on MacOS?
  
Regards.

 There is something I may like help with, and that is testing my change to url.el.
 As for trying to replicate the issues, I think all that&#x27;s needed is to run emacs in the terminal with emacs -nw and start helm-google-suggest and mash keys. This should result in lost input, hanging and sudden exit of helm.

 I’m using the Modus Vivendi theme, but as far as I can tell it’s not interfering. I couldn’t find the answer in the manual, so thank you in advance!

                    <span>Hi, guys. I am a newer to emacs, I&#x27;ve found there are many packages for autocompleting the code, but what&#x27;s the exactly difference? I use python in my work, so take python for example, there are company-mode, lsp-mode, eglot, python-mode, elpy, etc. I know that lsp-mode and eglot are just clients for lsp, they don&#x27;t supply completion actually. Am I right? So, how about others? I think that may refers to the history of completion in emacs in some extent.

                    <span>So I&#x27;ve been a Linux user for a lot of years now, I only use emacs on Linux, also I do use it on windows 10 using WSL in work&#x27;s laptop which really not comfortable, I&#x27;m planning to buy a new laptop and the new M1 thing is too good to deny, so is it as painful as windows to have emacs running on Mac?
 PS: I&#x27;ve never used a Mac before!

                    <span>I&#x27;m using AMQP to communicate with RabbitMQ.
 One of my applications is listening on a queue, and when something comes in, it works on it and then sends a message on a different queue.
 ​
 Listening is just fine, but when it declares a new exchange, it simply hangs.

 Example:
 sendToExchange :: ToJSON a &#x3D;&gt; Channel -&gt; Exchange -&gt; a -&gt; IO () sendToExchange chan exchange msg &#x3D; do putStrLn $ &quot;Declaring exchange: &quot; ++ T.unpack exchange declareExchange chan newExchange {exchangeName &#x3D; exchange, exchangeType &#x3D; …</span>

                    <span>Hi,
I have opted for paper method. With the &quot;reference box&quot; and the &quot;main box&quot; boxes as in the youtube video titled &quot;Zettelkasten Note-Taking Method: Simply Explained&quot; by  Shu Omi.
Does the adress extend &quot;globally&quot; over both boxes?
Has anyone thought about a github zettelkasten (ie a collabarative one) for a specific context? or maybe no context? Seems to me that that is what science is but with their specific methodology etc journals specialised language?
Kind Regards,
onewhocanttank</span>

                    <span>Whenever I create a .cpp file emacs inserts an include line with the same filename. So if I create &quot;test.cpp&quot;, then line 1 of the file has &quot;#include &quot;test.h&quot;. I&#x27;ve searched around online but I can&#x27;t seem to figure out which package is doing this or how to stop it. 
 I&#x27;m using Doom Emacs. I enabled cc in the :lang section of Doom&#x27;s init.el and other than tweaking a few formats with a c++-mode-hook I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve changed any defaults.

                    <span>Hello!
 Just as in the title; I find it distracting for the popup to suddenly, well, pop up, in the middle of a keybinding, but I&#x27;m fine with the keybindings themselves to suddenly appear on the popup.
 Thank you kindly for the help!

                    <span>I have a ton of files in my org directory, and by default Doom Emacs looks through every file in your org directory when generating an agenda. For me this is a pretty slow process.
 My other option is to set a static list of files and assign it to the org-agenda-files variable, but I like to update this list frequently. For example, I like adding tasks to org-journal files, which are generated daily. 
 Finally, I really like the ergonomics of adding a file to the org-agenda-files list using the C-[ command.…</span>

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been meaning to explore skeleton.el and tempo.el as alternatives to yasnippet, I especially like how skeleton is interactive through the minibuffer. 
 However, the only documentation is the code and I&#x27;m kinda struggling to understand it. I was wondering if there were tutorials or examples from the community about using those? 
 Thanks

                    <span>Title should be self-explanatory. I&#x27;m writing my own Emacs config and don&#x27;t know if I should use Projectile or the built-in project.el. I don&#x27;t think I need too many features, just some must-have project-based commands and good LSP integration. I couldn&#x27;t find a good comparison online. So it would be really nice if someone could give me a good comparison between the two, the similarities, differences, etc.

                    <span>IMO emacs is bloat. there are so many features that i will never use.
 I need a box which displays text and has emacs like keybinds that can edit text.
 what are your recommendations for an emacs clone or similar editor.
 also i am willing to learn/spend time for editing efficiency. it might be worth it to learn a whole new editor.

                    <span>I would like to create a function that takes a string and outputs a list of substrings only if they were inside parentheses. Essentialy (&quot;abc(def)gh(ij)k&quot;) -&gt; [&quot;(def)&quot;, &quot;(ij)&quot;].
 I feel that there should be an uncomplicated solution but I fail to see it. Can you help me?

 Because im still learning Haskell I want to do it without using any high functions, I&#x27;m trying to do it using recursion and operators, but Im having problems making a auxiliary function that will return to my main function the numbers that can divide my input, let me show:

                    <span>Scala is a very easy, simple language that provides you far better syntax than the Java language. Scala supports both object-oriented programming and functional programming. The language is interoperable with the Java language. It has some amazing features from which the Java language is lagging. And in the future, it definitely becomes one of the most powerful alternative languages of Java.

One of the uses of templating is to support a temporary project or group of notes. For example,  every note taken in a class has specific layout requirements and reminders. Having a template assures uniformity and completeness.

                    <span>Hi.
 I&#x27;ve discovered, little time ago, org-habits in emacs. I like it. 
 So I thought that there could be some package, habits related in MELPA, and I found emacs-habitica, which discovered to me habitica and it seems cool, although I have not tried it yet.
 Have you tried habitica by itself or integrated with org-habits? 
 What I would like to do is to keep using org-habits, and to add to it the gamification of habitica. Would it be feasible or recommendable? Any thoughts?
 Best regards

                    <span>I&#x27;m using emacs 27.2. I have (transient-mark-mode 1) set and have confirmed this via describe-mode but when I open a file and use C-spc to set a mark and move the cursor, no highlight shows. If I then edit the buffer (insert or delete something, for example) and set a new mark, highlights between the mark and the cursor are seen as expected.
 Any ideas on why this could be, or how I could quickly diagnose/debug the issue? Thanks!

                    <span>Hey everyone,
 I just started using emacs. I wanted to use it as a main tool for editing tex-files, which is why i started looking into emacs. My goal is to edit all my tex-documents in a org-buffer and then export them.
 But when i try to evaluate a tex-buffer to test the setup using M-x tex-file i get this message:
 warning: kpathsea: configuration file texmf.cnf not found in these directories: /usr/bin:/usr/bin/share/texmf-local/web2c:/usr/bin/share/texmf-dist/web2c:/usr/bin/share/texmf/web2c:/usr/bin/te…</span>

                    <span>Hi! I am trying to modify the sources of a builtin package (transient). At first, I tried uninstalling the melpa package that I had, but then I realized that transient seems to be now builtin into Emacs. Which I do not want to try and delete.
 Is there a way to use my version of the package just for the development session, and then revert to the builtin or melpa (or any other) package for the rest of my editing needs?

In the wiki he describes how to create new ones, but I just need a list of those already present in org-mode. I would be very grateful if anyone should know of a page (Even not from the official wiki) where there is a complete list.

 Is Emacs reliable on Windows 10? or is the experience different then if it you were running Emacs on Linux?

 I installed and setup pop-shell today, which is amazing.

 Used the code snippet here for .emacs config:
 http://pragmaticemacs.com/emacs/pop-up-a-quick-shell-with-shell-pop/
 ​
 But this issue that I&#x27;m having is: that after opening a terminal at the bottom of the screen using pop-shell, when I try to do a find-file in the top window above the bottom terminal window in the frame, it instead opens another window horizontally, so I end up with 2 top windows and 1 bottom window?

                    <span>Anyone have a recommendation for an Emacs screen reader which works well with elfeed? I&#x27;ve tried Emacspeak and I can see that it actually works pretty well for most everything in Emacs however I cannot find a voice that I can understand well. So perhaps the ask should be more for an Emacs screen reader with easy access to voices for someone who speaks US English? Bonus if the voice works well when running at 1.5x speed.

                    <span>https://hackage.haskell.org/package/ghc-tags-1.0
 Meant as a replacement for hasktags and other tag utilities that aren&#x27;t using GHC for parsing.
 On my laptop with the i7-8550U processor (4 cores) initial generation of etags for the GHC repository with the configuration from README takes 6.9 seconds, then subsequent runs (when only a few files were modified) around 330 ms.
 Enjoy!

                    <span>I&#x27;m trying to do a weekly review of my Done/Undone tasks and be able to do some reflection on to why things were/weren&#x27;t done and whether they were done on time.
 What I need for this (at least the basic functionality) is, a list of tasks done, and when were they completed (if at all).
 I would like to note that I would like to get even more things, like original scheduling (before various reschedules happened), and counts for tasks/completed/completed on schedule, but I can live with doing those manually i…</span>

                    <span>I just came to know about Scala 3 has TypeClasses built in.
 Scala 2 users had to use frameworks like SCalaz,Cats which are based on typeclass and one has to understand the typeclass and FP idioms even they need only certain features on these frameworks. This leads to more complex code and hard to maintain . Hence new programmers always complain that the language is over-complex. I had seen many such feedback and teams started to move towards Java or Kotlin.
 Now with the inbuilt TypeClass syntax does it me…</span>

 In this version I have re-enabled the live-sync edit feature and added many more usability improvements.
 Test drive and feedback welcome (GitHub repo here).
 Thank you.

                    <span>The new repeat-mode in Emacs 28 seems really useful as it prevents you from pressing prefix keys multiple times.
 For example, to use enlage-window-horizontally multiple times I would need to press C-x } multiple times but with repeat-mode enabled I need to press C-x once and hold onto } to get the same behavior.
 But this doesn&#x27;t work for keys like C-c C-f in the inbuilt mhtml-mode.
 How can I configure this behavior for other keybindings?

                    <span>A common frustration when using GHCi with a large project is that compiler warnings can easily get buried by other output. This a problem because, unlike errors, they don&#x27;t always get reprinted from one reload to the next so you have to either search through terminal output or restart GHCi to make sure you didn&#x27;t miss any.
 I created a plugin that alleviates this issue by allowing you to show all the current warnings for a GHCi session on demand. As an added bonus, there&#x27;s a command to automatically fix cer…</span>

                    <span>I&#x27;m the very beginner at Haskell. I&#x27;ve started learning it due to my willing of just learning FP well. 
 I started wondering about at what field Haskell should be superior at. As it&#x27;s purely functional, strongly influenced by mathematical concepts language, shouldn&#x27;t a Machine Learning be such a field? 
 Shouldn&#x27;t Haskell be there first &quot;go to&quot; choice in ML stuff?
 If so, what are good resources for learning ML in Haskell?

I thought I would try making a charting library using these principles but am struggling to formulate an elegant algebra.

 Suppose I keep track of expenses in an org tree where lines describing expenses have a special tag (let&#x27;s say :expense:) and contain an amount ex. 20.56€. 
 Is there a way to automatically compute the sum of expanses in the sub-tree and include the result in an entry ? Like the [%] cookie used in hierarchical TODOs.

 How much time did you spend learning Emacs? (you can say e.g. 1 hour every day for the first few months and then 20 minutes every day)
 How much time do you think you save every day with Emacs?
 Do you still need to spend some time making Emacs better suit your needs?
 Are there any necessary features in Emacs that are not present in any other typical IDE e.g. VSC?

                    <span>When we&#x27;re using typeclasses for genuinely ad-hoc overloading like FromJson, incoherent instances are a complete nonstarter. When we&#x27;re using them for things like Applicative, which properly speaking are parameterized by some structure not represented in the type, then they&#x27;re merely very very dangerous. But what about Functor? It seems to me that if I write

                    <span>We are pleased to announce the release of Copilot 3.3, a stream-based DSL for writing and monitoring embedded C programs, with an emphasis on correctness and hard realtime requirements. Copilot is typically used as a high-level runtime verification framework, and supports temporal logic (LTL, PTLTL and MTL), clocks and voting algorithms. 
 Among others, Copilot has been used at the Safety Critical Avionics Systems Branch of NASA Langley Research Center for monitoring test flights of drones.

 You get to implement an interpreter for a

 and interpret the following commands:
 up -- increment y by one
 down -- decrement y by one
 left -- decrement x by one
 right -- increment x by one
 printX -- print value of x
 printY -- print value of y
 The interpreter will be a function of type [String] -&gt; [String].

                    <span>Hello. I&#x27;m a beginner org mode user. I was wondering if there was a functionality that enables a user to create a live copy of a subtree (mirror). The reason for needing this could be to maintain a copy of a todos derived from brainstorming or planning a project in a single org (file to maintain context and relevance) while using a live copy in a different action oriented .org file (Like a GTD one).
 Here is a link for the feature in workflowy: https://workflowy.com/feature/mirrors/

 Check it out if you are interested in #scala3 and/or #Camunda, #BPMN, #DSL!
 It is a nice example (at least I think that;)) for the new extension methods in Scala 3.

                    <span>Vcomplete builds upon the default completion interface, addressing two issues I have with it:
  
It doesn&#x27;t update automatically on input.
 Directly choosing a completion requires switching to the *Completions* buffer.
  
Vcomplete (specifically vcomplete-mode) addresses those issues by (optionally, on by default) automatically updating the *Completions* buffer on new input (and opening it on no input when completing in the minibuffer), and providing key bindings to move point to the next and previous compl…</span>

                    <span>Hello! In the past few years I&#x27;ve been trying to finally switch to emacs, but it&#x27;s been on and off, mainly because when it got to configuring it the way I&#x27;m used to with, say, VS Code, I fail somewhere and end up going back to an IDE. 
 I want to go all the way this time and make the switch, but one thing I&#x27;ve never gotten to work was autocomplete to work, for it to pull function definitions from included headers, and show autocompletes, as well as a shortcut to jump to the definition.

                    <span>Hi, 
 I wanted to configure my Emacs to be more of a Python IDE and read about Elpy. On Elpy&#x27;s Github there is a Disclaimer that maintenance and support are lacking for now. 
 Spacemacs seems to be another option but I just got comfortable using my emacs so I am hesitant to move. 
 Does anybody have recommendations?

                    <span>Beginner here. Why this does not work?
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;haskell cons :: (Ord a) &#x3D;&gt; a -&gt; [a] -&gt; [a] cons x xs &#x3D; x : xs
 cons 1 (cons &#x27;a&#x27; []) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 I can have a list of Int and a list of Char. Since both Int and Char have instances of Ord, I wondered if I could have a list of Ord, or any other class type, a bit like in C#/Java one could have a List holding different types, as long as they implements the specified interface.

                    <span>Hi!
 I need to create an acronym from a sentence. For instance, &quot;Laughing out Loud&quot; should result in LOL, all uppercase.
 I am using the Data.Text library and found that the &quot;words&quot; function is quite good. So, I want to split the sentence into a [Text], extract the first letter of each element and concat those to an acronym.
 My main question is: What functions do I use to work on a [Text] type? Of course, any additional ideas are welcome!

                    <span>I have some tasks that need to be completed on specific days each week (say, Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday, and Sunday). Can these be set as a repeating task?

                    <span>I am still learning to handle org-mode and haven&#x27;t yet explored some of its core features (such as agenda). I am unsure of how I want to build my digital knowledge base. What I am referring to are all these little snippets you discover or come up with and want to keep for reference.
 Currently I use a weird mixture of file hierarchies, org-mode headline hierarchies and tagging: https://i.imgur.com/Ab9Br71.png Basically I have different files for areas (tech, household, ...) and subdivide these with head…</span>

Make a structure note for the project inside my &quot;outlines&quot; overview note
Then gather a bunch of notes, starting from the related structure notes I have
Brainstorm a bunch of questions
Brainstorm/search for a bunch of resources that may answer these questions
Process these sources

                    <span>Hey folks,
I stumbled upon a solution to prevent file saving conflicts with some external editors that had the same file open. It boils down to letting macOS know before anything is done to a file so that other apps are prevented from simultaneous access.
On my machine, this increased the loading time from 2 to 28 seconds, though, as all my notes are read from disk 
Otherwise, typing and auto-saving seems unchanged, except when an external editor is open that seems to be especially greedy with regards to fi…</span>

                    <span>It looks like pdf-tools got a new maintainer and he already changed the the melpa recipe, so you can get it via the package manager. 
 I think this is a good development.
 My impression is, that he is new as an Emacs package maintainer, so please be kind and supportive, so he will stay on it for a while. :)

 Is there a way to set the box border in order to keep the line numbers clean? At the moment the box is left-truncated and I can&#x27;t figure out ho to properly set it.
 Here you can see the line numbers \&quot;influenced\&quot; by the box border and the box border truncated.

                    <span>Hey everyone. I&#x27;m a front-end software engineer and I use vim at work but in my spare time for the last couple of weeks I&#x27;ve been working towards an emacs setup that has a feature parity for my development workflow. It&#x27;s been fun getting to where I am today but there&#x27;s something in my development experience that I would like to pick the brains of some emacs experts or knowledgeable folks to see if I can customize some things with the UI.
 In my neovim setup I use a package called lspsaga whi…</span>

                    <span>I just discovered evil-matchit, a really nice package to jump between matching elements (besides brackets). Which made me think - are there other Emacs packages out there that enhance/extend on evil mode?

                    <span>Hey guys. I found a way to make an additional universal prefix (i.e. a different C-u). I took a fair bit of code from simple.el.
 There is one caveat, it doesn&#x27;t propagate the value from function to function. So a nested function will lose the value. For C-u, this is done via the &#x27;arg&#x27; variable of (interactive &quot;P&quot;). You must do this manually. The first function to be called with the global prefix will not need any special treatment. It should just work, as there is no propagation.

                    <span>I&#x27;m still relatively new to Scala and I&#x27;ve been having problems with older libraries because of the whole implicits to given/using thing. Many 2.13 libaries don&#x27;t seem to work in Scala 3.0 because of it. For example I&#x27;ve tried to find a library to automatically convert case objects to jsons and believe it or not I still haven&#x27;t managed to do it because apparently they still rely on implicit or pre Scala 3 macros.
 So my question is, what can I do if I&#x27;m dealing with &quot;old&quot; l…</span>

                    <span>Hi there!
 What is the best way to convert a bunch of markdown files (with links, codes, math, tags, mermaid, and transclusions) to org files?

                    <span>So I&#x27;ve got some experience with elisp. It&#x27;s not exhaustive, I mostly write stuff to make my life easier. While I was looking around for a data structure that was a little easier to work with than pure lists, I came across the documentation for cl-defstruct, and it&#x27;s completely upended my programming. A build-queuing system that I&#x27;d written for myself got much more compact and easier to maintain by switching over to cl structs.

 I had received the advice to not install anything and just start with plain emacs so I can learn emacs.

 EAF and Vue.js
 JavaScript, whether you like it or not, is one of the easiest and appealing ways to write programs with a modern UI.
 EAF Music Player, the latest addition to the Emacs Application Framework, utilizes the ecosystem and the accessibility of Vue.js, a modern JS framework known for its simplicity, and produces a GUI program that&#x27;ll take much more effort to match up with using plain ELisp.

 “Types help you reason about effects”, we declare. And they do! Except when they don’t. “Just follow the types!” we insist. But sometimes the types take you down a garden path.
 When the type checker is happy but the behaviour is all wrong, it can be hard to find where you took the wrong turn. In this post I’ll share real-world examples of this phenomenon, and offer some tips on how to avoid it.

                    <span>Three questions:
Do you really need to go outside the Archive and use Obsidian , Roam , etc.  to develop a PKM for yourself?
How can you use a Zettelkasten  as a practical tool for doing something such as writing a book, studying for a test etc.  in other words.  Is the Zettelkasten more than a note taking method?
Thanks, 
David</span>

                    <span>If you aren&#x27;t yet familiar with it, it&#x27;s worth giving the new version of Gingko a try. The developer has made it much more visually appealing and the sideways tree is a great way to write longer pieces.

The question is: How long does it typically take you to read an average book while taking notes that will end up in your zettelkasten? To aid ballpark-figure responses, I&#x27;m thinking about a book like Atomic Habits by James Clear - very readable, full of actionable insights/useful points worth noting down.
And to build on that, do you typically …</span>

                    <span>Hello, I have been using orgmode for writing various documents for a while now and I make extensive use of footnotes for citations and the like. But in my current project, I am up to 100 footnotes and upon attempting to normalise them with M-x org-footnote-action RET n I was informed that the action exceeded max-lisp-eval-depth. 
 No issue I thought, just (setq max-lisp-eval-depth 10000), this resulted in exceeding max-specdl-size which I set to 10k also, this wasn&#x27;t enough so I made it 100k, which caus…</span>

                    <span>I use Org Mode and Hugo to manage my websites. Hugo natively understands Org Mode, but with a few quirks.
 To create internal links, I currently copy the filename from Dired and type the Hugo shortcode text into the link, which results in:
 [[{{% ref filename.org %}}][link text]]
 Any suggestion on how I can write a function that asks for a filename and link text to create the link text?

 You can find it here, or find it from the build artifact.
 The Emacs source code that&#x27;s used to build this package is in this repo, straight from the master branch with a simple patch to allow to build on Windows.
 The scoop bucket for this package is https://github.com/kiennq/scoop-misc, you can just install the package with scoop install emacs-k

                    <span>I could not find any quick plotting program to just view tabular data really fast piped in from stdin. So I whipped up a little command line program to do basic plotting with &#x60;hvega&#x60; and thought it might be useful for people in data science.

                    <span>I just came across this blog post with quite some points I agree with. As a haskell beginner, the entire deriving story has been quite complicated for me to grok. Little things like FromJSON and ToJSON instances on a record feel not so straight. forward to understand. Also, with so many. deriving extensions, generics is still something I don&#x27;t yet understand. 
 I&#x27;m curious to hear what people think about the points raised in this article:

 - Personal TODOs.
 - Work
 - Career (not sure if programming languages can be here too).

 So I upgraded to Emacs 27.2 recently, and I realized my good ol&#x27; Yasnippet template to just use &#x27;&lt;s&#x27; + TAB --&gt; isn&#x27;t working.
 To give you some background on this snippet:
 It is basically a way to force the good old &quot;&lt;s&quot; expansion behavior to come back into my Org docs because it was awesome before, but was replaced with the non-caps version which I detest. I just like my source blocks to be in CAPS and in charge.
 Anyway, what happened in earlier versions was…</span>

                    <span>Hi,
 I cannot get syncing to work with both a local directory and dropbox.
 Syncing works with both a local directory only and dropbox only, however when I configure both a local and a dropbox repository it never seems to access dropbox at all.
 My understandig was that when you configure multiple repositories, syncing should be done with all of them - is that a misunderstanding?

                    <span>Hello, I am planning to develop a video player / video library organizer web app in purescript.
 Currently I am trying to decide on which library I want to use.
 An important aspect will be consistency within the app, meaning that e.g. the information about one video (e.g. how much of it has been watched) needs to be the same in every place in the app where it is displayed.
 Another example would be which video is part of which playlist. A playlist that is displayed in a side bar for example should automati…</span>

                    <span>Hi all, We&#x27;ve got a weird, random issue going on on our platform. Sometimes, for unexplained reasons so far, we encounter effects that do execute (we know they execute because we can confirm the side-effect successfully happens elsewhere, like a database write or a REST API request) but never flatMap/yield to the rest of a for-comprehension. Below is a made up example:

 Posted as a text post as unfortunately, Reddit doesn&#x27;t distinguish links as being different by the hash-fragment (and as it&#x27;s on GitHub Pages as a Scala.js app, it&#x27;s the hash path that goes to the particular deck).

                    <span>Hi!
I&#x27;ve been adding some notes that when I&#x27;m writing them, I have some &quot;aha&quot; moments or I know how they are related to to other notes, and then I remember that another note was related to this one, and so on. What I do is type [[]] and write in the omnibus the text of the note I&#x27;m searching, to copy the ID and paste it inside. It&#x27;s a little time consuming and I was wondering if there is an easier way where the [[-type something-]] automatically prompts some suggestion after I type something inside.
Thanks!</span>

When I press cmd+ctrl+s to minimise the sidepanel it minimises, but with a lag. The more info a zettel has bigger the lag. Empty zettels do not lag.
Is it possible to make the motion more fluid?</span>

I use &#x27;&gt;&#x27; or &#x27;&gt;&gt;&#x27; to highlight my code, but I suppose that it is not the intended use of these marks.
I would like the app to support either dedicated code blocks, like in Ulysses, or some other kind of a code highlight to delineate the code from the regular text.
P.S. I&#x27;ve lurked the forum and haven&#x27;t found a similar topic. I hope it is not a duplicate.</span>

                    <span>I usually have one buffer open in my primary window - and calling &#x60;lsp-treemacs&#x60; causes a (split-window-right) or (split-window-left) and the references show up in the new window (window 2)
 ​
 When I press &#x60;RET&#x60; to jump to a reference, I want the new file to be opened in the second window. However, it opens in window 1, and breaks my workflow. This seems to happen only with typescript mode. With java mode it doesn&#x27;t occur at all. How do I fix it?

                    <span>Has anyone here got js-mode to indent JSX tags with respect of the return statement instead of the opening tag? This is how js-mode indents my code
 function MyComponent() { return &lt;div&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;; } 
 And this is what I was expecting:
 function MyComponent() { return &lt;div&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;; } 
 I mean, eslint can correct that for me, but it&#x27;s kind of a background annoyance.

                    <span>Hey all, 
 I&#x27;m using &quot;M-x eval-buffer&quot; and emacs tells my I can use &quot;M-x ev-b&quot; instead. This looks like a 2nd shortcut but I&#x27;ve never seen the &quot;ev-&quot; prefix before and can&#x27;t guess what key it might be. There is no &quot;ev-b&quot; function I can find. I can find only passing references to it on the net and in this subreddit (nothing that tells me what it is or how to use it)
 Little help ?
 Thanks !

 The main contribution is a macro to generate contexts for multiple accounts and aliases. It&#x27;s a complete and working example, including an mbsync config. Examples include Gmail, Apple, GMX and Proton.
 Feel free using, commenting or suggesting ideas.

                    <span>What the title says. I find it pretty distracting that helping popups and buffers appear all over the place, as opposed to using the same area if possible. 
 When using lsp-mode and company-mode, a popup appears when we are writing the function name, and then a new buffer appears when we type the opening bracket (, before starting to fill the arguments of the function. Ideally (for me) the best kind of helper would reuse the company-mode popup and and simply highlight (using bold or color) each function arg…</span>

 The idea is to have a global config with only 2 layout. The master area above and the stack below regardless the mode im in or what im opening. Like this
 Thanks!

                    <span>Hi all,
 As a little side project, I began to write a new file browser for Emacs. I must admit I never really get used of dired, and as an old user of (al)pine I missed a little the simplicity of the Pilot file browser (the one packaged in pico/(al)pine or nano).
 That’s why I named it aeronaut (currently bindge-watching His Dark Materials too). All the development occurs in my own git repository.
 What do you think of it? Any comment welcome, and if you would like to send patch or else, feel free to do it …</span>

 And after hours spent trying to get it to work, I&#x27;m still having huge freezes where I can&#x27;t code anymore (happens while I dev python or golang).
 Is my configuration wrong ? 
 ​
 LSP-mode was my hope of having a nice simple emacs configuration for multiple languages. But it seems like I&#x27;ve got to go back to my old setup.

 I&#x27;m using emacs 26.3 on OpenSuse Tumbleweed.

 I found a color-scheme I like that I would like to tweak a little bit (just a few different colors) - what is the best way to do that?
 Evidently I could copy the el-file and tweak the color there but I wonder if it was possible to do some tweaking by maybe simply overriding some variables.
 The theme contains this line that looks as if it was made for customization, but as an emacs-noob I don&#x27;t know how to use that...

 I just made one, and as much as I hate it, it works.

 I&#x27;ve just arrived at explicitly declaring a function type, and up until now, alls good.I&#x27;m on the ghci terminal and trying to first run this
 addThree :: Int -&gt; Int -&gt; Int -&gt; Int 
 To then run this
 addThree x y z &#x3D; x + y + z 
 Turns out the first line when trying to declare input and output types haskell gives me this error:

                    <span>Hi,
 I am using ´getArgs´, but am having problems getting a directory path as input
 λ exe.exe &quot;D:\UserData\z\example dir\&quot;
 [INFO 2021-05-10 18:14:56 +0200 app\Main.hs:28] Args: [&quot;D:\\UserData\\z\\example dir\&quot;&quot;]
 The args variable, is pretty weird, with he double &quot;&quot; at the end of the string
 I suppose it&#x27;s a bug? getArgs does almost the whole job of escaping the backslashes, except the last..

 I found a couple of ways to make this type check, e.g.,
  instance Functor T1 where fmap f (T1 a) &#x3D; T1 (f . a) 
 …and
  instance Functor T1 where fmap f (T1 a) &#x3D; T1 (f &lt;$&gt; a)

 I have a question to the function org-update-statistic-cookies. This should update the &quot;counters&quot; inside an org heading or with C-u Prefix update the whole buffer.
 But using C-u C-c # inside an org buffer that is not written to file gives me the question: &quot;Non-existing agenda file [..] Remove from list or Abort&quot;
 Is this what should happen, if yes why?

 This is a slide that I export with org-reveal:

 The thing I don&#x27;t quite understand is that the dot code-block is not exported, however the generated picture is, whereas the perl code-block does get exported, but it&#x27;s result-block is not.
 What does this behaviour depend upon?

 Any idea where we&#x27;re standing, is a RC4 release likely at this point?

 Basically what the title says. It means that in the method I first have to check if the parameter value is not null before i can do something with that Optional.

                    <span>I have been working on my Emacs configuration since March, and have been loving it (previously using Doom for a long while.) However, with my EXWM setup, when I open an X application the entire WM freezes until that application is ready. Music still plays in the background, and the screen still updates, but input is not registered. Anyone else have these issues, or have fixed them?

                    <span>I missed two frequently used keybindings in eshell. First was EOF (C-d) to eshell which can be accomplished by typing exit and clear screen (C-l) - similar by typing clear-scrollback.
 The case was to combine eshell input command with keybindings which was done and explained here. I also added EOF shortcut and now my config looks that:

                    <span>Has anybody gotten the newly-merged gccemacs to work on WSL2, Ubuntu in particular?
 Snap and flatpak don&#x27;t seem to be very compatible with WSL, and I haven&#x27;t found a PPA with gccemacs.
 Building from source makes something totally broken, e.g. it doesn&#x27;t recognize the space key, colors show up wrong, etc. I&#x27;ve configured with:
 ./configure --with-native-compilation --with-mailutils --with-xwidgets --with-png --with-rsvg --with-tiff --with-wide-int --with-xft --with-xml2 --with-xpm CFLAGS&#x3D;&amp;q…</span>

                    <span>When using xref-find-definitions (in conjunction with lsp-mode, for instance), there are two post-jump functions (stored in the variable xref-after-jump-hook, which are recenter** and **xref-pulse-momentarily.
 The problem is that even when the jump destination (e.g. the function definition) is within visible reach (e.g. just a couple of lines above my jump start point), xref still recenters the whole buffer around the destination, which is quite visibly annoying when a simple cursor jump is sufficient with…</span>

 I run code . to open the current directory in vscode

 In general, I struggle to manage projects with multiple steps.The clearest example of my issue is reading papers, although this is a more general issue plaguing my overall workflow.

 I want to override the default title generation. I know that I can configure it in the .emacs file, but don&#x27;t know how to go about it.
  
Any suggestions regarding these are will be most helpful to me.

                    <span>In this wonderful article, Mike Vanier gently guided me through what a monad (roughly) is. I had several other attempts which failed, and would like to point out why this article is different for me. I just like to share my experience, and hopefully will help others who are still struggling.
 PS. I found his article from reading another excellent explanation of Y combinator. He did that pedagogically, so I somehow knew monad is (finally!) going to click for me before I read ;)
  
It could be possible that I…</span>

 Has somebody used both packages and could tell me whether zetteldeft misses some functionality of org-roam? Thanks!

                    <span>Org agenda lets you easily filter tasks by effort estimate via the command org-agenda-filter-by-effort, by default bound to the key _ in the org-agenda-mode-map keymap. However, you may have already been working on a task for quite some time, and used the clocking commands to measure the time spent on this task. It seems most useful to filter these tasks, not by effort estimate, but by remaining estimated effort, i.e. the original effort estimate minus the time clocked so far.

 Is there any way I can use setup file and macro pointing to a directory..
 My problem is that i want to be able to export my org file using setupfile with HTML_HEAD pointing to relative CSS files, but the since not all my org-documents are located at the same relative path I can&#x27;t seem to find a good way of doing it..
 I&#x27;ve been experimenting with macros, but I cant seem to get it to work.
 any suggestions? Maybe there is another way

                    <span>Hi,
 this must be really simply, but at the moment I am too stupid for it...
 I am playing with org-reveal and I cannot find a good way to leave comments for export-options that will not themselves get exported, so a way to annotate export-options that leave no trace in the exported files.
 So what I want is something like that:
 ### this does blah-blah #+options: num:nil 
 or
 ### comment this in to get blah-blah ### #+options: num:nil 
 without the comments themselves becoming part of the exported present…</span>

                    <span>Hi, 
 Recently, inspired by Paul Daniels I added functionality to bootstrap sttp-livestub using openApi specification. More on it here: https://github.com/softwaremill/livestub/blob/master/README.md#openapi-integration 
 Feedback appreciated :)

                    <span>The persistent benchmarks have been disabled, largely because we use reify and lookupTypename and these are not compatible with runQ :: Q a -&gt; IO a.
 I&#x27;d like to have benchmarks available to ensure that the TH code is going as fast as it can. Is there a way to benchmark Q?

 Summarizing directories is a bottom up traversal:
  
If every child is good, aggregate
 If every child is bad, aggregate
 Otherwise keep the directory structure
  
The result is an edge labeled rose-tree like

                    <span>Hi,
 I wonder if there is a way to set an option (is that the right term?) to a multiline-string.
 What I mean is e.g. in org-reveal you can specify the title-page like this:
 ​
 #+REVEAL_TITLE_SLIDE: &lt;ul&gt; #+REVEAL_TITLE_SLIDE: &lt;li&gt;hubba #+REVEAL_TITLE_SLIDE: &lt;li&gt;hubba #+REVEAL_TITLE_SLIDE: &lt;/ul&gt; 
 So you repeat the REVAL_TITLE_SLIDE option for every line, but I would like to have something like this:
 #+REVEAL_TITLE_SLIDE: &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;hubba &lt;li&gt;hubba &lt;/ul&gt;…</span>

 - be able to preview it in a side-by-side window
 - be able to browse the pdf and check for &quot;problems&quot; (mainly, since I&#x27;ve translated a book, I sometimes have problems with paragraphs, indentation, spaces between rows)
 - click on text which should take me to the paragraph in my org-mode file.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve got a checkbox list under a headline that has a TODO status on it. I&#x27;d expect that to update to DONE when I check off the last item in the list but it doesn&#x27;t.
 For example:
 #+SEQ_TODO: NEXT(n) TODO(t) WAIT(w) | DONE(d) * Thing ** Subthing *** TODO List of stuff [2/2] - [X] foo + a note - [X] bar

                    <span>For internal links I use the org-id CUSTOM_ID format. It works great.
 Now I would like to find all entries that link to this node. Orgmode has the &quot;Find existing link to here&quot; function but that seems to ignore the id.
 Right now I&#x27;m copying the ID to the kill-ring and do an org-agenda-search for this ID, but that is a bit complicated. Is there a way to do this elegantly with a single command?

                    <span>I think I finally have a handle how to implement ad hoc polymorphism with type classes and implicits. But now I’m try to figure out how to explain to my coworkers why this is a good thing. Ad hoc polymorphism seems to be more complex to implement and harder to understand. How can I sell it to my coworkers?

                    <span>Noticed something while starting to study a language, do not know where would be best to report it, their main site, git hub, or an email to the team, will explain now their might be something I could do but have not found anything. Found and issue when using IPA phoneme characters and table column alignment, tables work fine in rest of document but on the first table with IPA phonemes the rows are miss spaced offsetting the columns. Can try to space the miss spaced rows that have the &quot;|&quot; behind, …</span>

                    <span>Is there a way to set the warning delay (i.e., the when the task shows up in the agenda) in the mini-buffer when setting a DEADLINE? First instance, if I set a deadline with C-c C-d, I bring up the date dialog in the mini-buffer. If I were to type &quot;Fri&quot;, it would set the date to tomorrow.
 I was expecting that I&#x27;d be able to then type &quot;-0d&quot;, so that they task wouldn&#x27;t show up on the agenda till tomorrow. However, when I try that, it doesn&#x27;t carry that &quot;-0d&quot; over, an…</span>

                    <span>I am making beamer slides from org files. I&#x27;m using the Frankfurt theme that is fine except for the headline. If I create a one-liner tex file that turns it off then load this with the H option, it looks perfect. Can I do this more neatly by having pandoc pass that option through?
 % preamble.tex \setbeamertemplate{headline}{} 
 So this is the command that works:
 pandoc --pdf-engine&#x3D;xelatex -V theme:Frankfurt -H preamble.tex -t beamer slides.org -o slides.pdf
 but I don&#x27;t want to rely on preamble.t…</span>
