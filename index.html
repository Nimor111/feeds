                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m just a noob learning the wonderful way of life that is Emacs. I went from not knowing what the hell an M-x was to writing my own Elisp functions and minor modes. One thing I can&#x27;t figure out though, is how do I keep Treemacs open until I manually close it, for example when selecting a file that isn&#x27;t already open in a buffer somewhere? I checked all of the treemacs-visit-node-* functions, but they all seem to close Treemacs with a double prefix. Is there any way to change this behavior? I guess I could write my own treemacs-visit-node function, but I don&#x27;t know how to use the treemacs--execute-button-action macro. I&#x27;ll be glad for any help at all.

 If you’re considering or already using the howm package, there’s good news. Version 1.5.1 was recently launched.
 I think it&#x27;s a good time to update the manual too. The manual now includes two chapters on time management and has additional information in other sections. 
 Enjoy the new features and updates!

                              <span>Yesterday night I was searching for a command to highlight a word, and could not find one. The closest I found was M-@ which went to the end of a word from where the cursor was. I had heard you could do so much customization in emacs I thought I would prowl the web and see how to do it. After some searching I found some sample functions, and I bootstrapped them into this,
 ​
 (defun highlight-word () &quot;Highlight the current word you are on.&quot; (interactive) (backward-word 1) (set-mark-command nil) (forward-word 1)) (global-set-key (kbd &quot;C-c C-SPC&quot;) &#x27;highlight-word) 
 At least with this I can be almost anywhere in the word and I can highlight it, and then, for example, select all other occurrence. 
 ​
 After doing this I have a glimpse at what could be keybound. Just thought I would share.

 does anyboy have an idea why transparency doesn&#x27;t work? If I check the version it says:
 GNU Emacs 29.1 (build 1, x86_64-pc-linux-gnu, GTK+ Version 2.24.33, cairo version 1.16.0
 Thx.

 So I decided to do the same and now introducing the lsp-treemacs-nerd-icons package.

 I’m relatively new to Emacs and elisp particularly, so will be glad for review and some feedback

                              <span>Hey guys,
 I am a relatively new Emacs user (vanilla keybindings), but I am already starting to feel severely crippled when I have to use non-emacs keybindings.
 I do as much as I possibly can in Emacs and I love it, but I sometimes have to reach for a capable web browser.
 I tried out Nyxt, eaf-browser, qutebrowser, vimium browser extension, using Emacs/readline keybindings in GTK2/3 by setting gtk-theme-name &#x3D; &quot;Emacs&quot;.
 Current setup:
  
Firefox: I want to support a mature and well-maintained non-chromium browser. I also use a custom user.js and UBlock Origin to enhance privacy and security. Pages load very fast. Minimal strain on cpu and enhanced battery life.
 Vimium: Far from perfect, as many standard emacs keybindings like M-&gt; for (end-of-buffer), cannot be implemented. Setting ui.accelKey to 18, ui.key.chromeAccess to 0 and devtools.editor.keymap to &quot;emacs&quot; helped.
 GTK2/3: Setting gtk-theme-name &#x3D; &quot;Emacs&quot; really helps and makes editing input fields feel great. Unfortunately this won&#x27;t be supported anymore once firefox migrates from GTK3 to GTK4.
  
Maybe my standards are too high and I should just be happy with what I have.
 But so far I am not willing to give up on it, as my browsing experience is really the last puzzle piece missing to an otherwise perfect workflow.
 Alternative:
 Out of all the alternatives I like Nyxt by far the most.
 It truly supports emacs keybindings and I love the minibuffer. It is a joy to move around.
 If it only was possible to have extensions like UBlock Origin and maybe even swap out WebkitGTK in favor of Firefox&#x27;s Gecko Engine, I&#x27;d make Nyxt my daily driver immediately and never look back. It would be a dream come true.
 I&#x27;d really appreciate if some of you guys with requirements similar to mine (vanilla keys, ad-blocking, security and privacy concerns) could share their workflow.
 Although a student on a very tight budget, I&#x27;ll probably have to start donating regularly to Nyxt to keep my hopes alive.

                              <span>I am currently setting up doom-modeline, and have installed nerd-fonts with M-x package-install nerd-fonts; I have also downloaded JetBrainsMono Nerd Font from the nerd-fonts download page, and installed it with the &quot;normal&quot; Windows font install tool. However, the modeline seems to be somewhat problematic; here it doesn&#x27;t display icons correctly (sometimes it does) but it also just doesn&#x27;t have the same standard look that I&#x27;ve seen elsewhere. Does anyone have experience with this package? As well, does anyone know how I can get the modeline to set to a specific font, and/or change the overall buffer font?

 list :: [[Int]] 
 list &#x3D; [[1, 2, 3, 5], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9, 10]]
  
​
 The code is supposed to add +1 to the list with odd number of elements in it. The problem is that it either applies the function the all sublists or i could use empty square brackets for the otherwise case. But i dont want that. I want it to return the unchanged list if number of elements are even.
 I have tried to use xs for the otherwise case but gives an error. What am i missing here?

                              <span>I&#x27;m an unemployed .Net engineer with experience in F# and a functional variant of C#. I&#x27;ve been searching for a new job for nearly 8 months, but I have been unemployed for almost 13. This job market has been absolutely brutal for me. My interviewing skills have gotten much stronger, but I haven&#x27;t gotten any new tech screens for months. Just rejection after rejection. Needless to say, I&#x27;m branching out.
 F# is pretty much a no-go at this point. At any given time, it is entirely possible that there is not a single public job posting for an F# position. The positions that do pop up aren&#x27;t often particularly good ones. Even so, I apply and get rejected without a tech screen.
 I&#x27;m currently examining Scala as an option, since many companies use it as a functional language. This would be very similar to my experience using C# as a functional language, and my direct FP experience in F#.
 I&#x27;d like to know what I would have to do to successfully make that transition to Scala. Specifically, what is the minimum that I&#x27;d have to learn about Scala to talk my way in? Or, is there a way I can sell myself such that I don&#x27;t have to do any additional learning before I start a role as a Scala engineer?
 Thus far, I&#x27;ve gotten all rejections without tech screens for Scala positions just like everything else. But it&#x27;s not clear to me that the companies using Scala recognize the connection between Scala and my current F#/C# experience.

 Does anyone know what might cause this? Thanks for any assistance.

                              <span>Hi! I&#x27;m a complete beginner at Emacs (running on Windows 11) and just learning how to use it, so please excuse my ignorance. I understand some of the possibilities and what it can do, but I&#x27;m struggling with even some basic tutorials and have some questions. I understand some conceptual things, like buffers/windows/frames, kill ring, etc., but I don&#x27;t really know how to start integrating Emacs into my workflow. I come from VS Code and other IDEs like it.
 I began by skimming over this tutorial and these papers (1 and 2); however, when I try and use some of the macros they don&#x27;t seem to work. For instance, if I try and use C-h r, Emacs reports &quot;C-h C-r is undefined&quot;; I don&#x27;t get why this is the case, because I am holding down the CTRL key, then pressing h, then pressing r, then releasing CTRL, but it seems like Emacs is reading 2 separate presses of CTRL?. As well, I started watching this video to get the Emacs UI to look decent, but I&#x27;m not sure how I go about making a init.el file (like where do I save it, how do I access and edit the file, etc.). I know I can use C-x C-f to find a file, but it autofills c:/Program Files/Emacs; is this normal? I thought the init.el is in ~//AppData/Roaming/.emacs.d/init.el/? Do I have to type that in to go to the file?
 Thank you guys so much in advance; as well, are there any other resources that I should look at first as a beginner?

I tried ein:run then server command: /home/user/bin/python but an error saying Jupyter server failed to start, cancelling operation appears. 
 I&#x27;ve also tried using ein:run with the followup server command: /home/user/bin/jupyter-notebook, which returns the same error. I have run the command inside the activated virtual environment command line and it opens the API through the browser. 
 I&#x27;m not able to install jupyter notebooks for the user on this machine but I can make python virtual environments.

                              <span>I use tree-sitter and c++-ts-mode. I have set it up to use the K&amp;R indentation style by customizing c-ts-mode-indent-style. The code base I work with uses namespaces a lot, the company has a coding standard where everything within a namespace should not be indented. The K&amp;R style of c++-ts-mode (or c-ts-mode) indents everything within a namespace. I have tried to figure out how to customize c++-ts-mode to not indent within a namespace, without success.
 When I look at treesit-simple-indent-rules I do not find anything that seems to relate to namespaces. To do this, I guess I would use a rule involving parent-is, but I can&#x27;t find a label for a namespace declaration.
 I have failed to find any good examples on how to customize indentation in c-ts-mode/c++-ts-mode. Any suggestions on how to proceed?

                              <span>Emacs is an amazing tool when you&#x27;re the only one using it (org-mode to jot down personal TODOs, manage your monthly budget, etc.). However, I&#x27;ve consistently run into the issue where when another person needs to interact with your work in any way, it&#x27;s a major sticking point. Examples being your beautiful literate programming spec doc needing to be edited by many teams or Google calendar being the source of truth for availability at your job. 
 Have any of you successfully bridged this gap? I want to keep using emacs but find I throw away hours of work the second another human needs to even be tangentially related to the piece.

                              <span>I struggled with the live-coding experience during online interviews, so I&#x27;ve built an extension, Chrome-Emacs, for the Chrome browser, as well as an extended fork of the Emacs package atomic-chrome.
 It focuses on bi-directional editing in online text editors and text areas from within Emacs.
 Why Upgrade:
  
Manifest V3 Support: Ensures future compatibility with Chrome. (Upcoming changes from Google will disable Manifest V2 extensions in Chrome by June 2024.)
 Text, Scroll, &amp; Selection Sync: Provides real-time text, cursor, and selection synchronization between Emacs and the browser.
 Enhanced File Management and Auto Major Mode Detection: Offers improved handling for a smoother experience, supporting features like linting and auto-completion.
 Editable Area Navigation: Quickly switch between editable fields in complex web pages with hints.
  
Compatibility Note: These enhancements are in a fork, requiring an accompanying fork of the atomic-chrome.el package for full benefits. They still work with the original package for basic functionalities, though.
 Collaboration over Competition: I admire the original atomic-chrome.el project and intend this fork as a contribution, not a replacement. My goal is to merge these improvements back into the original to benefit everyone. I also admire the original atomic-chrome extension.
 Difference from Other Extensions:
  
Vs. GhostEditor: While a fantastic tool for bidirectional editing, it lacks real-time cursor and selection sync and is still based on Manifest V2.
 Vs. Edit with Emacs: Applies changes but not in live mode and isn’t bidirectional. It also doesn’t cater to online editors, operating on Manifest V2.
  
I&#x27;m eager to hear feedback, suggestions, and welcome contributions.
 The link to the extension in the Chrome Web Store is here.

                              <span>Hello!
 I&#x27;m learning Emacs and writing my own setup and I&#x27;m using the Elpaca package manager with use-package wrapper (my emacs dotfiles). Please feel free to roast my config and poke holes in it and suggest some improvements :)
 Currently I have 2 folders core/ (for emacs internal stuff) and modules/ (for packages) where core/core-init.el is sourced (required) from my init.el and it in turn sources the rest of core/ and all from modules/. Previously, what I have done for modules is that I&#x27;ve put the (elpaca-wait) command in each module, so that after each module is read elpaca processes the queue immediately and activates the package (at least that&#x27;s what I thought it did from how I understood it before).
 Since then, I&#x27;ve come to learn that elpaca processes the packages queue after reading the init file, so that made me think that it&#x27;s enough to call (elpaca-wait) only once at the end of my init.el after all the modules have been read -- which is what I did, however, now on startup I get warnings about bunch of packages that says:
  
ef-themes loaded before Elpaca activation (analogously for the others) and all of those packages are inactive and some of my settings for the font, theme, orderless, consult etc. aren&#x27;t respected.
  
Before I go ahead and refactor and fix everything, is my understanding correct that it is enough to write all package configs and then call (elpaca-wait) once at the end of my init.el for it to process and load all my package configs? If not, when should I call (elpaca-wait)?
 What is &quot;the best&quot; (a good, optimal) way of making as much use of Elpaca&#x27;s async powers as possible? Am I on the right track here?

 Every time I try to perform backward-sexp in python (with or without the shortcut) from a parenthetical at the end of a function, it will go to the start of the function, not the enclosing parenthetical.
 How do I stop it from going so far and going to the proper place?
 I am using the lsp python language server plugin but I was having this issue before I configured my emacs for python.

                              <span>Robe is a Ruby code assistance package.
 This is mostly to tag the changes that have been in the snapshot builds for the last few years, but also to announce that the next release should have more breakage (it should require Ruby 2.3+).
 And compared to the last release tag, this one has:
  
Ruby 3 compatibility.
 Emacs 28 and 29 compatibility fixes.
 Print &quot;keyrest&quot; params correctly in hints. Same for &quot;triple dot&quot; notation.
 company-robe shows icons for completions.
 Jumping to methods in classes which only have private methods.
 Jumping to methods referenced by symbol.
 File names printed (in the doc buffer) relative to the load path.
 Tracking of variable types after assignment (for improved completion). The implementation is still regexp-based.
 Likewise for calls where the target is a literal (string, hash, array).
 Less blinking with eldoc and documentation display.
 Navigation and completion for RSpec bindings (also regexp-based).
 The &quot;jump to constant&quot; call now works with BSD Grep too (Grep search is used as a fallback).
 New option robe-show-doc-source.
 Highlighting comments as comments in the doc buffer.
 More robust constant completion.
 Other tweaks and fixes.

                              <span>My goal is to iterate over a Map that contains several thousand records, and compare each matching key, with a column name from a Dataframe that has a hundreds of columns.
 I have a Dataframe that has a subset of objects:
 val petDF &#x3D; Seq(
 (1, “dog”),
 (2, “cat”),
 (3, &quot;horse&quot;)
 ).toDF(“Rank”, “Animal”,
 ….several hundred columns)
 ​
 And a map or dictionary with key/value pairs that has a superset of objects.
 val lookupMap &#x3D; Map (
 “Rank” -&gt; “Rating”,
 “Animal” -&gt; “Pet”,
 “Human” -&gt; “Person”,
 “Neighbor” -&gt; “Friend”
 …several thousand records…
 )
 ​
 I need to iterate over the Map and for each match with the Dataframe column, I need to reassign the column name in the Dataframe depending whenever there is a match on the key.
 For instance, when there is a match on the Map’s key “Animal” …</span>

                              <span>Hey everyone, I need to traverse a 2D-List (representing a matrix) that will follow diagonals that trace from the top right to the bottom left of the matrix, and go through each element of the diagonal in order when we process that diagonal. I can&#x27;t seem to grasp this traversal, can anyone help with a sample code snippet regarding this? Thanks in advance.

                              <span>In ancient times, computer programs were shared as software listings in magazines. You had to type the code yourself.
Now recently on Mastodon a C64 BASIC listing for a Zettelkasten was shared. Unlike normal code listings, this is a hexdump listing, so you&#x27;d be typing pages of hexadecimal codes.
It&#x27;s much tougher to debug arbitrary hex characters than it is to debug BASIC syntax.
If anyone with a C64 is inclined to do so, please share screenshots

                              <span>Background: Running Emacs on Windows (without WSL). I&#x27;m trying to do org-latex-preview, and I&#x27;m getting failures. This worked fine until about a month ago. In fact, any LaTeX export I do via org mode fails.
 The log shows this:
  ... (c:/texlive/2022/texmf-dist/tex/latex/base/textcomp.sty) ! Emergency stop.  l.30 \begin{document} ^^M No pages of output. system returned with code -1 
 There&#x27;s a message to edit org-preview-latex-process-alist
 Thing is, I&#x27;ve been down this road before. The reason it&#x27;s failing is pygmentize, and the solution on the Internet is to add -shell-escape to the latex/pdflatex commands. I did that at some point last year and LaTeX export worked fine - until recently.
 Digging into the code (org-compile-file), I see this line:
 (shell-command (format-spec command spec) log-buf) 
 The value of (format-spec command spec) is:
 latex -shell-escape -interaction nonstopmode -output-directory &quot;c:/Users/me/AppData/Local/Temp/&quot; &quot;c:/Users/me/AppData/Local/Temp/orgtexTdvuhN.tex&quot; 
 When I run this command verbatim in my console, everything runs fine. When I run it via shell-command, it fails with the error above.
 I&#x27;m at a loss as to why it fails with shell-command. I confirmed that it&#x27;s running the same LaTeX executable, and pygmentize is there in the path system-wide.
 Ideas?

                              <span>Hi all,
 My current theme employs darker colors for the foreground and background. However, when I launch emacs, it takes like a second to invoke my theme config and in that moment, launches with a blinding white background (default). How can I disable this behaviour? Thanks.

                              <span>I have the following function on js-json-mode-hook:
 (lambda () &quot;Use spaces instead of tabs in JSON mode.&quot; (make-local-variable &#x27;js-indent-level) (setq js-indent-level 2) (setq-default indent-tabs-mode nil)) 
 If js-indent-level is set to 2, then 2 spaces are inserted as expected for each indentation in a JSON file. But if js-indent-level is set to 4, a tab is inserted instead of 4 spaces. I&#x27;m at a loss trying to figure this out. Is some other setting overriding js-indent-level? If so, why when it is set to 4 and not when it is set to 2? How can I get 4-space indents in JSON files?
 Edit: It turns out that setting a custom value for tab-width elsewhere in the config somehow had the effect of overriding the value set by indent-tabs-mode by setting it to t.

                              <span>I have been unable to identify the source of this behavior. Heck, I&#x27;m not sure what I do that triggers it to start. It doesn&#x27;t happen after a restart of emacs.
 In a programming mode, (fortran or lisp), I&#x27;ll start spacing at the end of a line to add a trailing comment and I see that a period is placed after the last word on the line.
 I&#x27;ve gone through the list of major and minor modes active and I can&#x27;t see any that would do this. I checked lossage and it shows a self-insert of a period, but I absolutely did not type one.
 I&#x27;m still trying to pin down what I do that makes this start happening. Once it starts, it&#x27;s on everywhere.
 Any advice or does anyone know of this behavior?

Just throwing this idea out here...

                              <span>Hey guys, I have jumped back to Emacs after using regular editors (for quite a while). I&#x27;ve been using avy and the likes to accelerate my navigations. And they are awesome! The one big problem I have with emacs is the scrolling. When it scrolls the whole screen changes, including the point, which loses all points of reference. I have tried using ways like scrolling only half a screen, smooth scrolling, or resorting to using my mouse (which sucks btw). In the end, I&#x27;ve settled down with good-scroll for full-screen scrolls, and repeated C-u C-n/C-u C-ps. And there&#x27;s that.
 Except it isn&#x27;t. Because now the problem becomes horizontal scrolling. For example, the code in the header image. If I were to, say, scroll down while reading the code, I don&#x27;t really have a friendly way to scroll horizontally and back. Like, there&#x27;s always this violent skip which makes me think &quot;oh where was I again?&quot; If I was using regular code editors like Kate, I can scroll horizontally using the mouse, and the scrolling will be smooth so I can conveniently track and read the code. But for hscroll, there&#x27;s only C-e and M-m in emacs (at least to my knowledge). I guess there&#x27;s M-f etc as well, but they move too slowly so it&#x27;s not as efficient.
 So what I am looking for? Well something like C-l that places the point in the center, except this time it&#x27;s horizontally centered as well. The other thing is during these horizontal scrolls and I move the point down, and the next line is not as long as the previous one, it skips back to the left and when the next line length is long enough, it skips back again. If there&#x27;s something that can preserve horizontal point offset during these scrolls it&#x27;ll be awesome. But not something like scroll-left because I have to manually scroll-right to get back.

                              <span>I want to contribute to a package. I haven&#x27;t really used elisp other than setting variables in a configuration and decided that forking a package and contributing was a good way to learn.
 I was surprised to see that the entire package was just one huge file. 2000+ lines of code. Basically unreadable.
 If I wanted to contribute to basically anything else I can assume everything else works fine and add features to whatever class I need. Here I guess I would have to sift through the code searching relevant variables and functions.
 What is the reason for this? It seems like the standard for elisp packages. This doesn&#x27;t even look slightly acceptable for me. It&#x27;s like a group of college kids decided to do a group project in one file like it&#x27;s a Google doc.

I talk about both neovim and emacs with a few people while we&#x27;re having a productive conversation, there&#x27;s always some wise-ass butting in with a snarky comment about how we are wasting time or that we&#x27;re deluded, or that some other unproductive comment. These are primarily all VS Code users (they make it known at every chance they get when they behave this way). I don&#x27;t understand what they feel so threatened about.
 I get that some people are ignorant about some of the tools out there but I&#x27;ve never seen anyone taking such an active interest in not knowing them, but even more interest in shitting on those who actually enjoy these tools.
 I can&#x27;t remember the last time I joined a conversation I don&#x27;t belong to and then be a dick to everyone for no reason. So I&#x27;m curious if this hostility I get from these people just a one-way thing.

                              <span>For a group project, I am building a compiler in Haskell. Today is the deadline and I have an idea of adding a &quot;verbosity&quot; flag to the compiler that prints internal information like &quot;detected unused variable, removing the node&quot; or &quot;Found constant x &#x3D; 4 and replacing used instances of x&quot;, etc. 
 However, our code currently does not support having a string to append throughout the journey of the program. Additionally, using (++) on Strings is poor performance and our professors would not like it. 
 I thought of using Debug.Trace to do this, but the Documentation recommends not to use it in production since it forces a value to be computed instead of being lazy. 
 What can I do?

 %^{Set Completion Time}
 according to the org-mode manual, but it doesn&#x27;t work; it produces a prompt without the autogenerated timestamp and leaves the  in place.

                              <span>Hi,
 Is there a package that I could use to read an org document in emacs (without exporting) that would do some transformations like: 
 - hide all #+ directives
 - show header with alternative font and/or font-size depending on the node level
 - show code blocs with syntax-highlighting, quote blocs etc without showing extra delimiters (like &quot;SRC&quot;)
 - allows one-key navigation like in info-mode
 A package that is close to this requirements is the org-tree-slide mode but it assumes that nodes are slides (i.e. short) and does not deal with longer paragraphs as nicely as info-mode.
 The objective is to have a as close to paper look as possible and one-key forward navigation.

 And you want to use Org mode for planning-for-the-future purposes -- e.g. to give you advance warning of the actual event as well as any relevant planning info about the prep. work; but also for recording-the-past purposes -- e.g. keeping notes and clocking information about either the prep. work or the event itself.

                              <span>Tapir maintainer here. We are planning to stop supporting Scala 2.12 in the near future. There is still a small group of active downloaders, so I would like to take the opportunity and publish an open question: If you depend on Tapir for Scala 2.12, what are your circumstances? Are there any significant blockers that prevent you from migrating to Scala 2.13? Let us know, and our team at SoftwareMill will plan the discontinuation accordingly. Thanks!

                              <span>Hi all,
 I assume this is a rather common question on this subreddit about whether one should adopt evil mode right away when learning emacs or lean into the default keybindings, for someone coming from vim. Unsurprisingly, I belong in the same boat: using (neo)vim for the past 5 years and have setup a window-manager setup with bindings all very akin to vim (heck I even have a firefox addon to emulate vim inside my browser for moving around).
 Now, I don&#x27;t wish to learn emacs the vim-way and would like to learn it with default keybindings (makes it easier to follow docs, works well with other packages, etc.) but I&#x27;m afraid that&#x27;ll make me &quot;unlearn&quot; the bindings I have in place that are more vim like. Heck, I&#x27;m scared I might unlearn vim itself.
 What I want to know is if it&#x27;s possible to use emacs bindings inside emacs and my custom (vim) bindings outside it? Has anyone encountered this and made it work? Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Even with packages, I thought it would be fun to see what some of the Emacs-meisters here actually do in Emacs that the rest of the people are unaware.
 Seeing the use of yasnippets blew my mind at times. I&#x27;m really curious about other amazing things that I and many other people may have overlooked.
 Please share some examples of Emacs-wizardry.

                              <span>I want to set a font attribute as follows:
 (set-face-attribute &#x27;outline-1 nil :height 120) 
 Unfortunately, something occasionally resets it to &quot;unspecified&quot; (according to describe-face). I haven&#x27;t been able to pin down what&#x27;s doing that - so I thought maybe I could add a debug watchpoint with debug-watch to trip when it&#x27;s changed - the debug stack might give me a clue.
 Trouble is - debug-watch wants a variable to watch and I can&#x27;t figure out how to point it at a font attribute.
 Anyone have any ideas?

 Also, do you save the original text in any form? I started using EWW and wondering if there are any user flows where you perform some annotations on the eww page, and then save it in your notes - similar to org-noter?

 Following is my configuration. emacs-lisp (setq doom-font (font-spec :family &quot;FiraCodeNerdFont&quot; :size 16)) (after! doom-themes (setq doom-themes-enable-bold t doom-themes-enable-italic t))  What configuration is missed out?

                              <span>Hi everyone, I use the pass package in emacs to manage my passwords. This package has password-store and password-store-otp as dependencies. After recently updating the package, a newer version of password-store-otp is required (0.1.5) and elpaca seems to be pulling in (0.1.0). This error does occur in a fresh emacs install using emacs -q, installing elpaca, and installing pass with elpaca-try. 
 I&#x27;ve tried creating a use-package block for password-store-otp to update password-store-otp by setting a specific git commit. I&#x27;ve tried downloading and loading a local version of password-store-otp as well. Either way pass seems to always pull in the outdated version and use that. 
 Is there a way to make sure dependencies are updated with elpaca? Thanks for any help!

                              <span>Anybody else use notmuch treeview here?
 I have a bunch of saved searches, which I configure like this:
 (push &#x27;(:name &quot;Personal Unscreened&quot; :query &quot;tag:inbox AND tag:unread AND (NOT query:screened-addresses)&quot; :key &quot;u&quot; :search-type &#x27;tree) notmuch-saved-searches) 
 Regardless of whether I set :search-type to &#x27;tree or &quot;tree&quot;, when I select the search (either from notmuch-hello or notmuch-jump) it opens the search in search view (notmuch-search-mode), instead of tree view (notmuch-tree-mode).
 When in search view, I can press &#x27;Z&#x27; to get to the tree-view (notmuch-tree-from-search-current-query), but it&#x27;s another step and creates another buffer, and I&#x27;m trying to get the search to start in tree view directly.
 I&#x27;m new to notmuch, so I&#x27;m probably doing something wrong. Does anybody have any ideas? Or should I join the notmuch mailing list and ask there?

 I&#x27;ve tried the following on my .hlint.yaml:
 -ignore: {name: Anti-pattern}
 -ignore: {name: unsafe functions} &#x27;&#x27;&#x27; but it didn&#x27;t do the trick
 Please help
 Pd.: I&#x27;m practicing some things and have a file with lots of this warnings and is so uncomfortable to work in.

 Trying to with a sample program that depends on a package that&#x27;s not yet on Stackage - it&#x27;s a GitHub repo.
 The docs say that adding the following to the project&#x27;s stack.yaml should work:

 However, when I try to build the sample program using &#x60;stack build&#x60;, I&#x27;m getting &quot;Could not find module . . .&quot; for all the references to the Botan package I&#x27;m trying to refer to.

I would like to receive TODO items with a date as a stdout which I can print or alert on my window through status bar (waybar), dmenu, or tiling window manager via &quot;urgent&quot;/bell notifications (probably simplest solution).

                              <span>Hello!
Yesterday, I experienced a situation that I&#x27;m surprised I didn&#x27;t notice before.
When we use object tags, we seek to identify the objects interacting in a note&#x27;s main argument. However, there are times when those objects may refer to qualities one may or may not have.
For example, let&#x27;s imagine I have two different notes where I explain the following ideas:
(1) Being too strict causes problems
In note (1), we could identify the object tag #strict. While in note (2), we could identify #relaxed as an object tag. However, the important point is that this decision is arbitrary. I could perfectly well have written the notes as follows:
(1a) Being too strict causes problems
or
(1b) Being not enough relaxed causes problems
In notes (1a) and (2a), I would have identified #strict. In notes (1b) and (2b), I would have identified #relaxed. However, all notes talk about the same object idea: there is a right amount of strictness/relaxation that avoids problems.
So, my question is the following:
How would you handle this situation?
Do I accept this arbitrariness and continue using both object tags?
Or, do I try to find a way to avoid this arbitrariness?

The example I showed is a simplification of a text I am processing about Semantic Versioning: https://semver.org/
The paragraph that provoked this situation was the following:

  
If the dependency specifications are too tight, you are in danger of version lock (the inability to upgrade a package without having to release new versions of every dependent package). If dependencies are specified too loosely, you will inevitably be bitten by version promiscuity (assuming compatibility with more future versions than is reasonable)


Using too tight or too loosely dependency specifications casues problems :-)</span>

Extending destination-passing style programming to arbitrary data types in Linear Haskell by Thomas Bagrel

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;m about to give a demo on how to maintain an engineering diary and a knowledge base. Of course, this will be an Org-mode demo. There won&#x27;t be any public recording but I might publish the Org-mode source in a proper format on Github later-on. 
 For showing off, I&#x27;d like to add three babel blocks to demo the pseudo-literate programming part within a minute or so. I&#x27;m not that creative, so I&#x27;d love to see your ideas on that. Bonus: if the content is relevant to engineers/devops/admins.
 My idea for this part: each block is using a different language (shell, python, ?). Each block generates some kind of data which is human-readable (e.g., as a nice table or at least some data the viewers are able to understand quickly). The next block takes the result from the previous and adds some pro…</span>

                              <span>I have a strange problem in org-mode, where org-preview-latex (including org-fragtog) only works when working in some directories - most annoyingly, it does not work in any subdirectory of the directory where most of my work projects are kept. I have no idea what causes this. It does not matter where the file I am working on is located, it is the current working directory when generating the previews. that matters.
 I have org-preview-latex-image-directory set to a single folder in my .emacs.d, but when I am not working in one of the offending directories, the error message I get seems to be that dvipng is looking for dvi files in /tmp/, where they are not found.

                              <span>Emacs 29.2 on Void Linux no packages installed new to emacs and just trying to use vanilla.
 I installed rust the suggested way using the curl command on their site and went to try eglot and it couldn&#x27;t find the rust-analyzer binary I check in my terminal and it seems rust doesn&#x27;t include it.
 I did some searching and found some Github issues suggesting downloading the binary and adding it to my PATH so I did.
 Now eglot finds it and suggests it can use it when I do M-x elgot, I confirm but it dies instantly.
 There&#x27;s no error information in the error message it just says &#x60; [eglot] -1: Server died&#x60;
 Any help would be appreciated, Thanks!
 Edit: I found another post suggesting I install rust mode I used package-install and tested it that way and eglot still crashes. It works fine for other languages C,C++, Python. The issue is isolated to rust-analyzer.
 Edit 2: Rust analyzer works find in VSCode, Neovim, and in my terminal I&#x27;m able to call the binary without it crashing.

 Any good places to get started? I want to be as compatible and competitive with vscode as I can.

 I&#x27;ve run into a frustrating problem when trying to use dir-locals-set-class-variables to set key bindings specifically for a npm projects when changing projects. It works for all files and directories apart from the project-root one!
 Is there any way to have this key binding / minor mode apply to the project root as well as all the subdirs and files?
 (use-package npm :config (defvar npm-project-map (make-sparse-keymap) &quot;Keymap for npm projects.&quot;) (define-minor-mode npm-project-mode &quot;A temporary minor mode to be activated only for npm projects.&quot; :keymap npm-project-map) (keymap-set npm-project-map &quot;C-c p&quot; &#x27;npm) (dir-locals-set-class-variables &#x27;npm &#x27;((nil . ((mode . npm-project))))) (defun setup-npm-project+ (project-root) &quot;Setup npm projects with &#x60;project-root&#x27;.&quot; (when (file-exists-p (concat project-root &quot;package.json&quot;)) (message &quot;setting up npm project mode&quot;) (dir-locals-set-directory-class project-root &#x27;npm))) (advice-add &#x27;project-switch-project :after #&#x27;setup-npm-project+))

                              <span>Hi all,
 I have been a neovim user for two years (I write my own configs using lua). I am considering switching to emacs after going through a major youtube rabbit hole on how emacs is a production environment, the beauty of org mode, evil mode key bindings, and it is still useable in the terminal when I ssh into a remote computer (do not have to install most of the time like neovim, especially when I do not have sudo permissions).
 One of the things that really made me consider switching to emacs is that for neovim, some of my plugins will break due to updates or be no longer maintained. Additionally I have no idea where the direction of neovim is going. I want something that I can customize, but also relatively stable and low maintenance. Does emacs offer this advantage? 
 Thanks!

 Hyperbole is a single package that can significantly raise your Emacs productivity with its broad information authoring and management capabilities, including giving you easier access to existing Emacs features that are hard to find or set up correctly. Give it a try for one month and see what you think.
 After an extensive year-and-a-half of development and quality-assurance, GNU Hyperbole 9.0.1, the Rhapsody release, is now available on GNU ELPA. And oh what a release it is: extensive new features, new video demos, org and org roam integration, Markdown and Org file support in HyRolo, recursive directory and wildcard file scanning in HyRolo, and much more.
 Hyperbole is like Markdown for hypertext. Hyperbole automatically recognizes dozens of common patterns in any buffer regar…</span>

 Will have a bind mount to my local project repository (will be /app in the container) for quick debugging and deploying.
  
However, I&#x27;m struggling with both since I have to re-download the dependencies to my container every time I create one. How can I create an image that satisfies my needs? Thank you in advance and I apologize for any misinterpretation, I&#x27;m still learning the ropes.

 BACKGROUND:
 &quot;Functional Software Architecture&quot; refers to methods of construction and structure of large and long-lived software projects that are implemented in functional languages and released to real users, typically in industry. The goals for the workshop are:
  
To assemble a community interested in software architecture techniques and technologies specific to functional programming;
 To identify, categorize, and docu…</span>

                              <span>I searched this everywhere but couldn&#x27;t find an answer. Consider the two definitions for generating the nth fibonacci number
 fibMem &#x3D; 0:1:zipWith (+) fibMem (tail fibMem) fibTail n &#x3D; helper n 0 1 where helper 1 _ acc &#x3D; acc helper n prev !acc &#x3D; helper (n-1) acc (prev+acc) 
 Time complexity for both will be linear in n. But what will be the space complexity?
 I feel like the memoized definition should be linear in space and the tail definition (with the bang pattern) should be constant in space. I tried profiling with RTS and the only thing changing was &quot;bytes allocated on heap&quot; with the tail definition having slightly less allocation, but still increasing with increasing n. Also, not sure whether &quot;bytes allocated on heap&quot; is what I should be looking for anyway.
 If the memoized definition is indeed linear in space, then its not so cool afterall? and maybe it should be mentioned in every discussion that tail definition is what you should be using?

                              <span>Hey everyone!
 We&#x27;re looking for new colleagues for our Haskell teams at Channable (Utrecht, Netherlands). There are not a lot of SaaS companies that have Haskell in their tech stack, so I&#x27;m happy to share this with you all! 
 You can take a look at the job description here
 And if you&#x27;re interested in knowing how Channable uses Haskell you can take a look at the Tech blog where my colleagues write about their work. 
 For this role, you&#x27;d need to work in with a hybrid work policy. If you don&#x27;t live in the NL you can still apply and we can have a chat! Channable can help with relocation and the Netherlands is a beautiful country (especially if you like rain).

                              <span>I installed Haskell using the ghcup method and I&#x27;m on Debian 12. I&#x27;ve created a directory .../HaskellAlgebra and I&#x27;ve run cabal init in my terminal in that directory, then cabal run. The Hello... message is displayed. Good. Then I went into the HaskellAlgebra.cabal and added many packages to the executable HaskellAlgebra build-depends:
 build-depends: base ^&gt;&#x3D;4.17.2.1, text &gt;&#x3D;2.1.1, algebra &gt;&#x3D;4.3.1, hmatrix &gt;&#x3D;0.20.2, algebraic-graphs &gt;&#x3D;0.7, diagrams &gt;&#x3D;1.4.1, QuickCheck &gt;&#x3D;2.14.3, HaskellAlgebra 
 I then do cabal run again -- and after a long time I again get success and output. Then I open a ghci session with cabal repl in the terminal. At the prompt I try to load or access one of the packages or modules, with success.
 λ&gt; :set -package hmatrix package flags have changed, resetting and loading new packages.. 
 I try
 λ&gt; import Numeric.LinearAlgebra λ&gt; m &#x3D; (3&gt; m (3&gt; :set -package hmatrix cannot satisfy -package hmatrix (use -v for more information) λ&gt; :set -package Data.List cannot satisfy -package Data.List (use -v for more information) 
 Any ideas what could be wrong? Any Emacs haskell-moders out there? I basically just want to run stuff in a .hs file and have it run in a REPL for now.

                              <span>My research leads me to a nice model with like-minded groups of people working with Zettelkasten method. It&#x27;s a visual concept that helps me to find further insights to understand Zettelkasten interactions. My initial view is showing groups with different learning approaches and different knowledge intensity.
The largest group according to my survey are the &quot;Self-Learners and Autodidacts (29%)&quot; with some milieu-specific characteristics:
Personalized learning journeys driven by individual interests and goals.
Flexibility to explore diverse topics and resources at their own pace.
Utilization of Zettelkasten as a tool for self-reflection, goal tracking, and continuous improvement.
Even though we all use the Zettelkasten method, each group still has different needs and preferences. This helps me better understand some of our discussions here in the forum.

This is yet another opportunity to share with your friends what you are working on. Add to this discussion by telling us about your zettelkasten journey. Share with us what you&#x27;re learning. Sharing helps me and, hopefully, you, too. It helps us clarify our goals and visualize our thinking. And sometimes, a conversation sparks a magical moment where we can dive into an idea worth exploring. We&#x27;d love to hear more from you.  🫵🏼
It&#x27;s spring break! It&#x27;s time to catch up on zettelkasting projects.
Ideas I&#x27;m exploring with my ZK:
To make a note is to isolate an object of attention and investigate it with vigor.
The ideas around developing an ambiance for thriving.
The novel idea of ambient love.
The meaning of &quot;cogent&quot; as related to ideation.
The constellation of ideas around the portrayal of blindness in Young Adult Literature.

A look at this week&#x27;s ZK work themes:
0 zettel - meta zettelkasting
★★★★★
The &quot;My rolling ten-day zettel production&quot; is produced by a script for attachment to my daily journaling template. I do my journaling in Bear to keep personal journaling separate from my knowledge work.
Let me know if you would like to discuss any of these notes.

                              <span>In most apps on MacOS, the built-in autocorrect spelling correction works. But not in Emacs. I know there&#x27;s Aspell and abbrev, but I&#x27;m curious if there&#x27;s actually a native typo-fixer that works like everything else in MacOS without having to manually run aspell?

                              <span>I am writing a paper for an IEEE journal.
 In their template they specify a bunch of environments, e.g. abstract that need to be inserted in the document, but before \maketitle. When exporting Org mode to LaTeX, \maketitle is inserted straight after \begin{document}.
 Org mode behaviour: latex \documentclass{ieeeaccess} \title{Very boring} \begin{document} \maketitle \begin{abstract} Yada yada yada \end{abstract} Lorem ipsum \end{document} 
 What I need is: latex \documentclass{ieeeaccess} \title{Very boring} \begin{document} \begin{abstract} Yada yada yada \end{abstract} \maketitle Lorem ipsum \end{document} 
 Any means to achieve this?

                              <span>(solved, it was a hook that created the error, not org-roam)
 I have a template that when expanded creates the error:
  org-id-add-location: ‘org-id-get’ expects a file-visiting buffer 
 I have narrowed the error to a trailing space. This template works:
  (org-capture-fill-template &quot;* PROJ&quot; ) 
 but this one does not, the only difference is the trailing space after PROJ.
  (org-capture-fill-template &quot;* PROJ &quot; ) 
 fails with:
  org-id-add-location: ‘org-id-get’ expects a file-visiting buffer 
 Is this a bug in org or a feature that I have hit by mistake?
 thank you

 Here is link to the full playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list&#x3D;PLiYD0LWExCDkXGpYRY3WjNscDfhe4D0ND
 Thousands of developers have taken this course on fp-tower.com and Udemy and gained a robust understanding of functional programming (no specific library). The course is really hands-on with lots of exercises on topics like:
  
Parallel data processing (Chapter 3 https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list&#x3D;PLiYD0LWExCDlAls-ucYLGydz\_uP07R1Mn)
 Concurrent IO (Chapter 5 https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list&#x3D;PLiYD0LWExCDnkATO7yP350HEsXBUGftSO)
 Error handling &amp; data modeling (Chapter 6 https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list&#x3D;PLiYD0LWExCDmSukQM59oNkzlaQoCJ-30A)
  
The course consists of around 20 hours of videos and 30-40 hours of exercises. It is made for beginner to intermediate Scala developers. Some companies have used this course to train their new hire.
 All exercises, answers and slides are on GitHub: https://github.com/fp-tower/foundations
 It took me around 2.5 years to produced this course including 9 months full time. I gave my best to provide simple and practical examples of FP principles. Please let me know what you found useful (or not).

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently exploring the world of functional programming and seeking to deepen my understanding of how algebraic data types (ADTs) and type classes are utilized to construct contexts and specify behaviors. Specifically, I&#x27;m interested in how ADTs are employed to create context data types like Option, Either, and Future, and how type classes such as Functor, Monad, and Applicative define behaviors for these contexts.
 Here&#x27;s a bit more context on what I&#x27;ve been pondering:
 Algebraic Data Types (ADTs):
 ADTs allow us to construct complex data types by combining simpler ones. For instance, Option represents values that may or may not exist, utilizing ADTs like Some and None. Similarly, Either embodies values that can be of one of two possible types, using Left for errors and Right for succ…</span>

                              <span>endless-transaction is a new Scala library with functional abstractions to orchestrate distributed transactions using two-phase consensus. This is not “old-school” 2PC: it allows for both short and long-lived transactions (aka sagas).
 Operations spanning multiple entities in actor clusters often require coordination to ensure consistency: the lib integrates well with the parent library endless4s offering functional abstractions for distributed systems (but can also be used separately).
 In this blog article, I explain the motivations, use cases, and abstractions, illustrated with an example.

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to put emacs into docker containers for testing on a kubernetes system. 
 The kubernetes deployment does not have access to the internet. I like the emacs keybindings but need certain syntax coloring default emacs lacks. 
 So I want to do this in the docker build steps. 
 I&#x27;ve started a container ran alt x packagage refresh, package install then commited the image and used it that way but that is really slow and not automated.
 Is there anyway to automate emacs commands without opening emacs? Do you understand that question?
 In otherwords, install a melpa package in emacs in the build steps of a dockerfile. So automatically and without human interaction.

                              <span>First: I&#x27;ve searched for solutions and experimented but without success. Hopefully you have some ideas!
 The tl;dr is that I&#x27;m keen to find a way to edit files on remote Windows hosts using ssh as the protocol from a Linux host.
 I&#x27;m a Linux user through-and-through but have to manage Windows boxen sometimes. Modern Windows can run sshd, though, and combined with powershell, managing remote Windows hosts is actually bearable. However, I&#x27;d prefer to edit files within my local emacs session rather than through a terminal running ssh. The challenge is finding the right C-x C-f path spec to connect to a remote ssh host that works when that target is running Windows (with all those caveats).
 Some considerations:
  
I know that I can connect to Windows hosts remotely via ssh correctly and passwordless. I can edit the login shell, I&#x27;ve tinkered with both cmd.exe and pwsh.exe without much success.
 I do have the ability to target sh.exe or bash.exe, although I haven&#x27;t managed to make that work either (by changing TRAMP connection properties for the remote host)
 I assume there may be something I need to set to make the connection &quot;aware&quot; that the remote is Windows despite connecting over ssh, though I&#x27;m not sure what that setting might be (for example, changing a line ending setting)
  
I&#x27;d love any ideas or help with this.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been using a package called org-brain that is using, I&#x27;m all but certain, the .org-id-locations file as its database to store graph-like relationships between org files and org headings. org-brain is a sort of graph database which adds a PROPERTIES drawer with just the ID field with a UUID to an org file, as well as to the org headings in each file. So I opened this 127k file residing in my .emacs.d directory and apparently whatever is in my org directory and has a PROPERTIES drawer with ID field winds up in .org-id-locations represented as lists in one big list, one list for each file that has one or more drawers. But you knowledgeable people here know all this already. However, it surprised me since such a format as this

 (use-package pyvenv :ensure t :config (pyvenv-mode 1) (pyvenv-activate &quot;~/miniconda3/envs/dl/&quot;)) (setq major-mode-remap-alist &#x27;((python-mode . python-ts-mode))) (add-hook &#x27;after-init-hook &#x27;global-company-mode) (use-package company :ensure t :config :hook (python-ts-mode . company-mode) (setq company-idle-delay 0.01 company-minimum-prefix-length 1)) (use-package eglot :ensure t :defer t :hook (python-ts-mode . eglot-ensure)) (with-eval-after-load &#x27;eglot (add-to-list &#x27;eglot-server-programs &#x27;(python-ts-mode . (&quot;ruff-lsp&quot;)))) 
 The linting through ruff-lsp seems to be working well, but when I have a partial bit of code and run &quot;company-complete&quot; nothing is happening. Can someone please help me resolve this?

                              <span>I was reading the Hacker Files and I spotted this. 
 From Issue 1 of the Hacker Files
 The Hacker Files was about a hacker called Jack Marshall who freelances for the Government and uncovers all sorts of underhandedness. This was created by Lewis Shiner and Tom Sutton, and it seems to have been created for an informed audience. I mean, in most popular entertainment, hacking involves hoodies, fantastical visualisations to make someone typing in the terminal more interesting and so on. This comic has none of that, and yet is quite gripping.

                              <span>Has anyone been able to configure Copilot-like services, in my case Codeium , in their completion framework so there is less friction when using them?
 IMHO in a super-capf setup it can outshout other capfs because it returns longer results which take up posframe space. Similarly, i don&#x27;t want to have to change buffers to choose a suggestion, so the older completion styles seem clumsy.
 After some fiddling, my best guess is that it needs a separate completion mode which shows suggestions in an overlay within the current buffer. So in place, one at a time with some ability to move up and down through the undisplayed completions via M-n / M-p and with some kind of hint in the presentation about current position in the list.
 How have other folks been setting these things up?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been using Helm since the time I started using Emacs. A couple of weeks ago, Helm started giving me an error, and I searched for alternates and finally installed Vertico, Orderless, Consult and Embark.
 Now Helm is working again, but I&#x27;d like to leave my present config as is.
 What I need help with is:
  
In Helm when I M-x, I am shown the candidate from the last time I used M-x. In vertico, I have to search again, if I want the same candidate. Does anyone know how I can bring this Helm style behavior into Vertico? 
 
I&#x27;m not sure if this is an orderless or vertico function. When I M-x and type in the command i&#x27;m looking for, in Helm, I don&#x27;t need to enter the Hyphen. In this current setup, I need to enter a hyphen as a seperator, otherwise no matches are show. So for list-packages I need to type li-pa. li pa on its own won&#x27;t work. 
 
There is a horizontal bar running at the bottom of the screen, which I think shows the same candidates as in the completion list. Where is this coming from? Embark? WHat is it&#x27;s purpose?
 
 Attached image to indicate each of the points.
 Thank you!

                              <span>Hi,
 Emacs newbie here. I have an issue regarding flycheck as in a gif below.
 When removing something in a buffer sometimes the error doesn&#x27;t propagate to another buffer, buffer when method is removed. The error is shown in rust, however the error as well occurs in some other languages. It doesn&#x27;t matter if I&#x27;m taking someone&#x27;s config or my own, the error will occur.
 Example scenario (occurs in config from a link pasted below):
  
Go to buffer 1.
 Remove method.
 Error occurs on buffer 2.
 paste back method on buffer 1.
 Error still occurs on buffer 2 after switching to buffer 2, despite implementation being already pasted back in buffer 1 (which is incorrect behaviour).
  
Another scenario shown on gif:
  
Go to buffer 1.
 Remove method.
 Save buffer.
 Go to buffer 2
 method use m…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking at integrating code coverage reporting for the work project. I&#x27;ve successfully generated a .tix file and the reports locally. Due to the time that a coverage build/test takes, we won&#x27;t be running it on each PR/commit, but once daily on the master branch.
 I am currently investigating code coverage services, like codecov.io and coveralls.
 One complication with Haskell coverage is that we get three things: &quot;top level definitions&quot;, &quot;expressions&quot;, and &quot;alternatives&quot;. Top level definitions includes things like derived instances and record fields, which significantly harms coverage figures. We&#x27;d like to primarily track expression and/or alternative coverage instead of top-level definitions.
 I&#x27;m curious if y&#x27;all have recommendations on how to do this nicely.

 i would love feedback, regarding scribes would it be preferrable for me to export the escape hatch i’ve used to remove the IOE constraints or to include scribes from other katip packages? the problem with the second approach is that i do not want to maintain multiple packages, so i would either increase the number of dependencies or include the scribes in sublibraries.

                              <span>Hi,
 My dahastes.cabal:
 ...
 executable dahastes
 import: common-options
 hs-source-dirs: app
 main-is: Main.hs
 build-depends:
 , dahastes
 , turtle
 , text
 , foldl
 , extra
 ghc-options: -threaded -rtsopts -with-rtsopts&#x3D;-N
 ...
 I&#x27;ve been trying this:
 !?master ~/spaces/haskell/dahastes&gt; cabal install exe:dahastes --installdir&#x3D;&quot;~/.local/bin&quot;
 Wrote tarball sdist to
 /home/alexey/spaces/haskell/dahastes/dist-newstyle/sdist/dahastes-0.tar.gz
 Resolving dependencies...
 Symlinking &#x27;dahastes&#x27; to &#x27;~/.local/bin/dahastes&#x27;
 !?master ~/spaces/haskell/dahastes&gt; ls
 &#x27;~&#x27; app bench BUILDME.md cabal.project CHANGELOG.md dahastes.cabal dist-newstyle flake.lock flake.nix hie.yaml LICENSE README.md src test
 ​
 Looks sensible, but I&#x27;ve got two problems:
  
No symlink in ~/.local/bin. No real surprise: I expected a binary in ~/.local/bin, and was promised a symlink _to_ ~/.local/bin, God knows where.
 It created an empty &#x27;~&#x27; directory in my project directory, which looks suspicious to me.
  
​
 I hope my intention is clear: install a project executive to a common bin directory. What am I doing wrong?

Dear CISA team,
I appreciate your effort to gather comments about your recently released “Software Identification Ecosystem Option Analysis” white paper. As you say in the Executive Summary, “Organizations of all sizes must track what software they own and operate to perform user support, inventory administration, and vulnerability management”.

                              <span>Hi all!
 Three years ago I wrote a tiny library, https://hackage.haskell.org/package/safe-wild-cards-1.0.0/docs/SafeWildCards.html, to work around the lack of a GHC warning when you do smth like this:
 instance ToJSON Rec where toJSON Rec{..} &#x3D; object [ &quot;a&quot; .&#x3D; fieldA , &quot;b&quot; .&#x3D; fieldB -- oops I forgot to handle fieldC ] 
 To me, a very nice thing about Haskell is that the compiler tells me when I have to update my code, so I felt that the lack of warning was a serious omission and worth writing a library for.
 The library provides a Template Haskell pattern, fields, that lets you do the following instead:
 instance ToJSON Rec where toJSON $(fields &#x27;Rec) &#x3D; ... -- equivalent to: -- toJSON Rec{fieldA, fieldB, fieldC} &#x3D; ... 
 All fields will be added to scope and you will get a warning if you don&#x27;t explicitly ignore the unused ones.
 I&#x27;m not doing open source Haskell anymore, so I&#x27;d like to give this library away. In three years it saw only one PR (dependency version bump). If you want it, please DM me on Reddit, email me, or open an issue at https://github.com/monadfix/safe-wild-cards.
 Thanks!

                              <span>i want to display the current git revision that my program was built with in an info menu. to do that i have a template haskell function that looks like this
  git &#x3D; $(readProcess &quot;git&quot; [&quot;rev-parse&quot;, &quot;--short&quot;] &quot;&quot;) 
 this is simplified for the purpose of this post
 the problem is, it runs this command every time the program runs, rather than once at compile time, so it always tries to read the revision of whatever your cwd is. is there a way to make this only run at compile time and never again?

 Release notes:
  
With one exception, this release fixes bugs.
  
Changes since v2.15.1:
 Behavior changes:
  
stack path --global-config, --programs, and --local-bin no longer set up Stack’s environment.
  
Bug fixes:
  
Due to a bug, Stack 2.15.1 did not support versions of GHC before 8.2. Stack now supports GHC versions from 8.0.
 --haddock-for-hackage does not ignore --haddock-arguments.
 On Windows, package locations that are Git repositories with submodules now work as intended.
 The ghc, runghc and runhaskell commands accept --package values that are a list of package names or package identifiers separated by spaces and, in the case of package identifiers, in the same way as if they were specified as targets to stack build.
  
Thanks to all our contributors for this release:

 Following the handover of the Stackage project to the Haskell Foundation the file at Stack’s default URL is no longer up to date.
 stack init uses this file to decide which snapshots to try when creating a stack.yaml file. stack new uses stack init by default.

                              <span>Hi,
 What is the Haskell way to manage this kind of nested workflow? Here is an example in JS:
 /**
 * Reduces a sequence of names to initials.
 * u/function makeInitials
 * u/param {String} authors A comma-delimited list of authors.
 * u/param {String} sep A period separating the initials.
 * u/param {String} trail A period ending the initials.
 * u/param {String} hyph A hyphen separating double-barrelled names.
 * u/return {String} Properly formatted initials.
 */
 function makeInitials(authors, sep &#x3D; &quot;.&quot;, trail &#x3D; &quot;.&quot;, hyph &#x3D; &quot;-&quot;) {
 const rDot &#x3D; new RegExp(&#x60;[\\s${sep}]+&#x60;);
 return authors
 .replace(/\&quot;(?:\\.|[^\&quot;\\])*\&quot;/g, &quot; &quot;)
 .replaceAll(&#x27;&quot;&#x27;, &quot; &quot;)
 .split(&quot;,&quot;)
 .filter((author) &#x3D;&gt; author.replaceAll(sep, &quot;&quot;).replaceAll(hyph, &quot;&quot;).trim())
 .map(
 (author) &#x3D;&gt;
 author
 .split(hyph)
 .filter((barrel) &#x3D;&gt; barrel.replaceAll(sep, &quot;&quot;).trim())
 .map((barrel) &#x3D;&gt;
 barrel
 .split(rDot)
 .filter((name) &#x3D;&gt; name)
 .map((name) &#x3D;&gt; name[0])
 .join(sep)
 .toUpperCase(),
 )
 .join(hyph) + trail,
 )
 .join(&quot;,&quot;);
 }
 This kind of stuff looks pretty much the same in Dart, Kotlin, PHP, Rust, etc. Somehow I can&#x27;t figure out how to structure it in Haskell. There must be a way to keep uniformity and readability in Haskell; autoformat should like it, too.
 PS I still can&#x27;t figure out how to make code snippets readable. If it&#x27;s Markdown, why the &#x60;backticks&#x60; won&#x27;t work?

                              <span>Hello I am new to Emacs and I was wondering if its possible to change the code blocking syntax in Emacs. Currently Emacs uses the following syntax to contain code...
 #+begin_src cpp
 #+end_src 
 Instead I wanted use the following...
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;cpp
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; 
 How do I go about in making this happen?

                              <span>Posting this for any of y&#x27;all interested. I had to compile emacs 29.2 the libxml2 support because the eww-url-transform url wasn&#x27;t available on the emacs 28.
 You can create a function that takes a URL as input and returns a &quot;transformed&quot; version of the URL. The eww-url-transformers variable will be a list of all the &quot;transform&quot; functions you create. When you click on a link, eww will automatically run the URL through all the functions in that list before bringing you to the webpage.
 Adding this to your init.el will automatically redirect www.reddit.com to old.reddit.com
 (defun eww-reddit-redirect(url) &quot;Redirect reddit.com to old.reddit.com automatically.&quot; (replace-regexp-in-string &quot;https://www.reddit.com&quot; &quot;https://old.reddit.com&quot; url)) (setq eww-url-transformers &#x27;(eww-remove-tracking eww-reddit-redirect)) 
 Note, the eww-remove-tracking is a function built into eww.el to remove some tracking information from URLS.

                              <span>I am trying to make e-mail scheduling possible in Emacs based on gnus-delay but for notmuch.
 A lot of stuff in notmuch calls pop-to-buffer-same-window and similar functions which is making things complicated. Like when calling notmuch-draft-resume (which I call to bring up the postponed message, check headers and send).
 I would also like to run the queue processing in the background on a schedule, which will disrupt my work if I am doing something and all of a sudden windows start to move around.
 So I think I have two options when processing the queue:
  
Save the current window configuration, process the queue and restore it.
 Create a new frame, make-frame-invisible it, and delete the frame when done.
  
On the second option, something does not work after calling make-frame-invisible, as if pop-to-buffer-same-window would not work on an invisible frame. Is that possible?
 On the first option, as I would like to have the queue processing run on a schedule, I guess I&#x27;d need some way to &quot;run this function every X minutes ONLY ONLY ONLY if the session is inactive&quot; to not disrupt my work. Is there such a function/package available to detect if the session is inactive?

                              <span>Hi,
 Before someone runs in and suggests project.el or projectile, hear me out please. 
 My work consists of both programming and a lot of designing. I manage my repositories nicely with projectile, but my design resources are a complete mess. 
 I have directories with org-mode files, diagrams made both inside of emacs (with plantuml) and outside of emacs. I also have presentations and other miscellaneous files. 
 I am looking for a smart way to access and organize all these directories and files in a way that resembles org-roam. Would such a thing exist? 
 My current alternative approach that I haven’t tested yet involves swapping altering the org-roam database using .dir-locals.el together with projectile, but I haven’t tried this.

                              <span>Is it possible to have the org-habit graph display a day where a task was missed with a solid colour block rather than a glyph? For example having a red block on a day where a habit was missed followed by a green block where it was done? It seems that all the various org-habit faces are used to identify when habits are due vs overdue and such but there are none that actually denote what is a completed task vs failed one. Is a glyph the only way to identify this or is there any alternative?

                              <span>If you see my post history, I have been trying to move to Emacs full time for both, work and personal. I used my own config, then moved to Spacemacs, tried Doom and finally settled in Spacemacs.
 For personal stuff, I have a few annoyances but nothing major but, for work, there are a few things that hurt my productivity - I need to get things done and don&#x27;t have much time to fix, so I am using VSCode instead.
 Some of the things that are blocking me: - multi-vterm refuses to work. It just says that it cannot find vterm-mode. vterm works, so the mode is there but nope - vterm keeps on scrolling down to the prompt, making going through logs or things like that impossible - LSP seems to be unable to find my .venv and use the pyright inside, even when I start it from the shell
 It is possible that I am &#x27;holding it the wrong way&#x27; but I am not ready to change my full workflow for this.
 This is not a complain, just a post so people see what it is if you are not an expert - Google shows no solutions to these issues, no matter what I do and I don&#x27;t have the time to fix them. I understand that Emacs is more of a &#x27;here are the parts, put them together in any way you want&#x27; but that same approach, while mitigated by distributions like Spacemacs, make it way harder for people who need to get things done now, if you happen to hit any issues.

                              <span>Is there some kind of option/package, which can create C block comments in a way that it only puts a comment marker at the beginning and at the end of region?
 I mean, if I comment this with comment-region:
 Something here and there 
 I get this:
 /* Something here */ /* and there */ 
 But I&#x27;d like to have this:
 /* Something here and there */ 
 comment-region is inconsistent with the behavior if I write the comment by hand. I mean, if I start creating the comment by /* Some ..., emacs creates the second version. But if I uncomment it with uncomment-region, and then add the comment back with comment-region, I get the first version.

                              <span>I picked up obsidian recently after taking over a job from another guy. I love its TODO features and the beautiful markdown format it has which is really easy to use, but that is all I really use it for. I am normally a minimalist, I used to take notes and todo lists only in notepad (its very manageable with ok formatting), as well as physical notes in a few notebooks I regularly replace. My work is in Mechanical Engineering so its normally just about task management in the background while I have my CAE software &amp; outlook in front. Work PC is windows and obviously I cannot change that. 
 I discovered Emacs a few weeks ago, and its been rough trying to learn its systems since I have limited free time. I am really interested in org-mode, and the possibility of not only task management, but interlocking its systems with email, IRC (and therefore slack/discord), maybe learning VIM keybinds, etc but I really have no interest in using it as a coding interface, or in writing academic papers.
 Is emacs right for my use case?

                              <span>Eglot has this feature where the variable at point and its references in the code below get highlighted in bold.
 Does anyone know a feature or package that adds the same or similar highlighting to emacs lisp?
 And I mean not just highlight by name, but by binding, so if I (re-)bind the same name many times in multiple nested let expressions or let*, it should correctly highlight only the references of the same binding.
 Side-note:
 I really feel like emacs lisp is falling behind a bit with all the cool treesitter and LSP features other languages have now. I understand that treesitter support would be hard due to elisp&#x27;s syntactic ambiguity between macros and functions and highlighting and indentation would probably be worse than emacs itself which can respect the indentation guides and highlighting provided by the functions/macros themselves. 
 But a language server would really help a lot, for example to get xref-find-references working with functions not currently defined in the running emacs instance, for example when writing stand-alone scripts.

                              <span>Hello everyone, how do you handle the situation where you want certain keybindings to be conditionally bound. Here is what I have as an example:
 My config
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; ... (defvar-keymap my/code-keymap &quot;d&quot; #&#x27;xref-find-definitions ) 
 (defvar-keymap my/lsp-code-keymap &quot;d&quot; #&#x27;lsp-find-definition &quot;i&quot; #&#x27;lsp-find-implementation ) 
 (defvar-keymap my/leader-keymap &quot;.&quot; #&#x27;find-file &quot;/&quot; #&#x27;consult-ripgrep &quot;g&quot; #&#x27;magit &quot;:&quot; #&#x27;consult-mode-command &quot;Q&quot; #&#x27;ave-buffers-kill-terminal
 &quot;f&quot; my/file-keymap &quot;p&quot; my/project-keymap &quot;w&quot; my/window-keymap &quot;b&quot; my/buffer-keymap &quot;r&quot; my/rings-and-regs-keymap &quot;e&quot; my/edit-keymap &quot;!&quot; my/error-keymap &quot;i&quot; my/insert-keymap &quot;t&quot; my/toggle-keymap &quot;c&quot; my/code-keymap ) 
 (unbind-key &quot;SPC&quot; evil-motion-state-map) (bind-key &quot;SPC&quot; my/leader-keymap evil-motion-state-map)
 (add-hook &#x27;lsp-mode-hook (lambda () (make-local-variable &#x27;my/leader-keymap) (bind-key &quot;c&quot; my/lsp-code-keymap my/leader-keymap)) )
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Here I replace my-code-keymap with my-lsp-code-keymap if I am in an lsp-mode buffer. This nearly works, but making the keymap buffer-local doesn&#x27;t seem to work. Thus once lsp-mode is turned on in any buffer, all buffers have their code keymap replaced. 
 What I don&#x27;t want to do:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; (defvar-keymap my/not-wanted-lsp-code-keymap &quot;d&quot; (lambda () (if lsp-mode (call-interactively #&#x27;lsp-find-definition) (call-interactively #&#x27;lsp-find-definition)))
 &quot;i&quot; (lambda () (if lsp-mode (call-interactively #&#x27;lsp-find-definition) (message &quot;lsp is not available&quot;))) ) 
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 I want to avoid binding keys to some function that checks if lsp is bound and runs the appropriate command. This is because I don&#x27;t want which-key showing the &quot;SPC c i&quot; option in non lsp buffers since it doesn&#x27;t do anything because lsp is not available.
 Can keybindings even be buffer-local?
 I would appreciate examples of how this is handled in your config.

                              <span>I&#x27;m importing my calendar events into org so they are integrated into my weekly agenda etc. The thought occurred to me today - can I see a weekly time spent in meetings vs average. I don&#x27;t specifically tag them but could definitely add that to my workflow to make that easier.

                              <span>Have you ever heard of Worked Examples from Cognitive Load Theory?
If not, this simple, teacher/student oriented video explains worked examples quite well.
As I have been learning a bit about cognitive load theory and the effects of worked examples, I was wondering what how it applies to the Zettelkasten Method. Specifically, in the video above, it seems that elaborative encoding might not be as effective without the schema being represented well to the learner first when they are a novice.
It seems that a lot of the ideas around ZKM or just Zettelkasten more generally are heavily founded upon deep processing or elaborative encoding from a more constructivist flavor.
I was wondering if there was more of a need for worked examples as one develops knowledge within their ZK and even as one works on getting better at the method itself (ZKM).
Would love to hear if any others have thoughts on this.
Note: I know that Math is focused on this video. But, it seems to me that zettling is a practice/skill. And, even a lot of what we develop within the ZK should be able to used in some skill. So, worked examples seems relevant. Feel free to pick at that assumption too!</span>

                              <span>TL;DR: LLMs are unreliable, but oh my, this unreliable?!?
I have been working through a beautiful (and funny!) book, A.C. Grayling&#x27;s &quot;The History of Philosophy&quot; (2019). My main interest has been the ideas therein and less biography, but I decided to have a note each for the major philosophers I care about, and started using Claude 3 Opus (the latest model from Anthropic, claimed to be GPT-4 level) for just the biography part. What could possibly go wrong?!?
Well, in the dozen philosophers I have had Claude write a short bio for, maybe nothing wrong was seen. But then, I am hardly an expert on Thales (born around 624 BC) so wouldn&#x27;t have spotted a small lie here or there.
So I asked it to write a biographical note for someone I know well --- me. The results were horrendous. I report them in full detail (with correction) here: https://amahabal.substack.com/p/dissecting-the-people-make-errors (as part of the bigger question in response to someone saying &quot;but people make errors, too!&quot;).
Beware!</span>

 Its actually more of a rant about people not learning their tools. But I use my emacs setup to drive the point home.

 Would love some feedback!

                              <span>r/emacs is such a valuable resource; I&#x27;ve learned so much in conversation with you all. I&#x27;ve recently discovered that we have only one active moderator (thanks to them!). While so far I haven&#x27;t noticed issues arising from this, I think we can all agree that drawing additional moderator support from among our most active members would strengthen an already strong community. The advantages of a larger pool of moderators include distributing the work effort and bringing in other viewpoints. The former is especially important, as we all know how work and life commitments ebb and flow.
 If you are interested in serving as a moderator for r/emacs, please reply with your short &quot;Emacs bio&quot; — how long you&#x27;ve been involved with Emacs, what areas of the Emacs landscape most interest you, and what approach you&#x27;d bring to moderation.
 If you have concerns about moderation in general, please save those for another thread. If, like myself, you are supportive but cannot yourself commit to moderating, please join me in thanking our current moderator along with those who volunteer!

                              <span>I just managed to get my emacs to have that modernistic blurred background look so I thought I&#x27;d share the result. My approach is unfortunately platform specific (requiring some modification to the wayland compositor). I&#x27;m not sure if this belongs here so sorry in advance if it doesn&#x27;t!

 EDIT:If you&#x27;re interested, you need to do 2 things:
  
Make Emacs&#x27; background transparent (for example by doing this in init.el). This is to take advantage of a feature in Plasma to blur windows that are transparent.

                              <span>Hello everyone, I am relatively new to emacs and have stumbled on a problem that has completely stumped me.
 My setup:
 I have a leader keybinding setup. I press “SPC” and which key shows the next prefix keys. I can do “SPC b” to get to buffer-specific keybindings and “SPC c” for code-specific keybindings. 
 This is achieved by having a my-leader-key-map, where “c” is bound to my-code-key-map, and “b” is bound to my-buffer-key-map. 
 “d” is bound to xref-find-definition in my-code-key-map. Thus “SPC c d” will call that command.
 What I am trying to accomplish:
  
“SPC c d” to be lsp-find-definition if and only if I am connected to lsp in that particular buffer.
 “SPC c i” to be lsp-find-implementation if the lsp supports it and I am connected to lsp in this particular buffer. Keep in mind …</span>

                              <span>I am trying to get to the bottom of a strange issue with omnisharp [1] and eglot, and I&#x27;d appreciate any pointers. The issue is documented here [2] and here [3], but I haven&#x27;t got very far with it so I thought I&#x27;d ask here. My setup is as follows:
  
Operative System: Windows 10
 LSP server: Omnisharp 1.39
 Emacs: 29.1
 Programming language: C# (csharp-mode)
  
In general, omnisharp and eglot work great, but when I choose code actions nothing seems to happen. You can see a screenshot of this as well as the JSON RPC debug log:
  
https://github.com/joaotavora/eglot/discussions/1322#discussioncomment-8711304
  
I am just trying to understand:
  
if this is an eglot issue or an omnisharp issue;
 any pointers as to additional means to figure out what is failing. I have tried debugging with edebug as well as additional logging (JSON RPC etc) but no luck.

                              <span>Hello, i&#x27;m a little new in this subreddit, i want to share with you all a little hack that makes flymake support error indicators in margins, like flychecks does.
 This allow showing flymake&#x27;s error indicators in TUI and in GUI makes it more modern with scaling better for HIDPI screens.
 The solution i&#x27;ve found is make an advice for flymake--fringe-overlay-spec function:
 (advice-add #&#x27;flymake--fringe-overlay-spec :override (lambda (bitmap &amp;optional recursed) (if (and (symbolp bitmap) (boundp bitmap) (not recursed)) (flymake--fringe-overlay-spec (symbol-value bitmap) t) (and flymake-fringe-indicator-position bitmap (propertize &quot;!&quot; &#x27;display &#x60;((margin left-margin) ,bitmap)))))) 
 The only change here is in the propertize part for use left margin instead of fringe (if you want to use the righ…</span>

                              <span>Personally I have a habit.org file that I add to and then I use org journal for a personal diary which I add single item to-dos.
 I mark things done at the end of the day and try to use org pomodoro timers if I&#x27;m on my laptop.
 I&#x27;m having some problems having a fully functional workload using orgmode and am looking for some examples of what the workflow is like day to day.
 Some of the biggest things I feel like I&#x27;m missing is visibility on other platforms. I like the idea of having my habit scorecard and schedule in my face whether on emacs, laptop, phone, watch.
 I have problems with tracking away from my laptop. I assume some use a mobile org or maybe a third party app with an open api. Only a few of my tasks a day am I going to have my laptop on hand.
 How are you using org mode for scheduling? What other tools do you use in conjunction?

                              <span>Hey guys.
 Ive used org-mode and roam for about a year now. Recently I started taking notes for a new DnD campaign, and was thinking of using the zettlekasten method with org-roam like i usually do. 
 However, once i started to think about it, It didn&#x27;t make sense to me why i cant just keep the whole campaign in one file? I know that this is not the zettlekasten idea, but how does it logically change anything? I can links to all other headings when needed to have it work like a wiki, still use org-roam-ui AND get a clearer navigation system since its in one file and i can see all the headings above a node to make mental connections on the big picture on how things are connected. 
 Am i missing something? I understand that having separate files for two completely different topics can be useful, but i can&#x27;t see it for a single topic.

 Does Obelisk use something different to target the Android NDK? Where can I learn more about that and see an overview of the architecture of an Obelisk app beyond the browser – like what renderer is used for the UI of an Android native Obelisk app?

                              <span>are there good examples of libraries or plugins that allow users to modify behavior (e.g. how typeclasses are derived) by adding annotations to values and types? An example present in other languages is annotating record fields to change how de/serialization (e.g. from/to JSON) works.

                              <span>Hi, in my work I use Scala for a Spark powered app. It&#x27;s a part of a big Spring Boot application and it&#x27;s 100% vanilla Scala, because most devs in the company use primarily Java (sometimes i rewrite their vars and imperative loops into nice flatmaps and for comprehensions).
 I&#x27;d like to find out what problems would be solved if we started to use and effect system like Cats Effect (it won&#x27;t happen, but i&#x27;d like to know what we&#x27;re missing out).
 So in my free time I&#x27;m creating a http4s program which will expose endpoints to run various transformations using Flink. 
 At first I&#x27;ve created methods without any effects (writeToIceberg in the code below) and only in the end i would wrap them in IO (writeToTarget). This is the code if you&#x27;re curious, it&#x27;s quite regular Flink code glued together fr…</span>

                              <span>I have a situation where I have several traits with each trait containing a set of methods. I have now to expose these functionalities to the external world through profiles. For example., a basic profile will be another trait, but this contains just the methods a and 2 from trait 1, methods 4 and 5 from trait 2 etc.,I can create these profiles as a new trait and repeat the method implementation, but how can I reuse the already defined methods in my trait and just create the profile traits more elegantly? For example.,
 trait InternalTrait1 { def method1(int: Int): Int def method2(int: Int): Int } trait InternalTrait2 { def method3(int: Int): Int def method4(int: Int): String } 
 I would now like to have:
 trait BasicProfile { def method2(int: Int): Int dev method4(int: Int): String } 
 I want to refer the method2 and method4 from Trait1 and Trait2 respectively. Any ideas? Self traits come to my mind, but not sure if that is a good idea?

                              <span>Overview
 I am considering writing a new mode for running .NET / C# unit tests, and I thought I&#x27;d ask for some advice on how to go about it. Or, if there already is an existing mode which does what I&#x27;m after, if you could please point it out. The remainder of this post describes my requirements, what I have found out so far, and the approach I intend to take. I apologise in advance for the length of this post, but it seemed easier to lay down all the information I have thus far.
 High-Level Requirements
 My requirements are as follows:
  
the ability to see a unit test tree across all projects in a solution.
 ability to run individual tests, or nodes from the tree.
 ability to see which tests have failed and which tests have passed within the tree.
 ability to see details of the failure.

                              <span>Hello Emacs Community!,
 ​
 I just configured Forge at some Gitlab Repositories, I now can see issues related to the projects I&#x27;m in,
 Now, my team doesn&#x27;t use the issues on specific projects much, but open issues in a different Board on gitlab, which is not a project but contains all the important issues I do want to see.
 ​
 I see that I can see issues and posts on each project, but I want to see the one that is in a board, problem being that as it is not a project, it doesn&#x27;t end with .git, but /team-1/board, while a project would be /project-1.git.
 ​
 Adding the board repository will result in a wait without messages, just a Pulling wait that doesn&#x27;t seem to be pulling anything.
 ​
 Is there a way to add this board?, and even better, to have it globally?, or can I only see those PRs and issues related to the project I have added?
 ​
 Thanks!

                              <span>This is something that has bothered me for many years now, but I was always too lazy to dig in. Well, this time I&#x27;m at least not too lazy to ask:
 Is there a way to make Emacs buffer ordering be per-window and remembered separately for each window?
 The way I work is using eyebrowse to create &quot;screens&quot; or &quot;workspaces&quot; (I used escreen before eyebrowse, a long time ago). Each of these is usually further separated into windows. That means that certain buffers naturally end up &quot;belonging&quot; in certain workspaces. For example, my Clojure REPL always lives in screen 4.
 This setup is great, but the way buffer switching works doesn&#x27;t play nice with it. If I jump from screen 1 to screen 4 and back to 1, my previous buffer will be my REPL, which is not what I want. Screen 1, and more specifically, the window in that screen that I&#x27;m working in, should remember which buffers were used in it recently, so that I can use previous-buffer/next-buffer predictably.
 I think I would expect all other buffers (ones not visited in that window) to be appended at the end, as I don&#x27;t want to limit myself. I might want to switch to some of those some day.
 Does something like this exist? Is it possible at all?

                              <span>I make updates to my bib file that I have embedded, and the changes do not take effect when I refresh the preview pane (all changes within the .tex do) and even when I fully exit my emacsclient. 
 Even killing the preview buffer, re-starting emacs client, does not help. Even with using a new emacs instance it does not work. Last time to fix this, I wiped the files in the directory and re-opened the tex file (after copying them in from another place) for the bib to work.

                              <span>Ultimately, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a single perfect book for getting into Haskell.
 Learn You A Haskell For Great Good is an excellent starter, especially for introducing FP concepts and the basics.
 I like Will Kurt&#x27;s Get Programming With Haskell, the explanations are very clear and visually, it&#x27;s got great design.
 Although I like the book very much, I struggle a bit with Chris Allen and Julie Moronuki&#x27;s very in-depth Haskell Programming From First Principles after the first few chapters.
 The one I&#x27;m most excited about is the one I just got. It&#x27;s Tom Schrijver&#x27;s Soar With Haskell and am finding this quite good. It covers some of the territory that Allen and Moronuki cover, but in a more accessible manner (albeit in less depth). This strikes me as a very solid intro to the language that doesn&#x27;t avoid advanced features or oversimplify.
 Curious what others think of these books.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve just switched over to ghcup and away from exclusively stack. I&#x27;m also trying to use Emacs&#x27; org-mode Babel, which is Jupyter notebook-style literate programming with more functionality than the Jupyter, IMHO. The going is not smooth getting the code blocks in the org-mode text to work, as they are run in a ghci session -- with all the restrictions such as multiple line versus single line to deal with. So when working with Haskell on org-mode, I first start a project with cabal init inside a directory, e.g., .../myproj. This will just be a skeleton, since I will throw my org-mode Babel files in this directory too. Next, I want to install Hackage packages, so I add them to the myproj.cabal build-depends section and do cabal run. Now, since org-mode&#x27;s Babel is sending my Haskell code blocks to ghci, can that ghci session see and use the packages of myproj? If I do :show paths in the ghci buffer it reports .../myproj so no need to do a :cd  Very well. But my question is, does the ghci session see, can use my included packages from the project? As I understand, packages are installed per project (ergo per directory). But is there a global way with ghcup to install a package for all projects to use? For example, if I want QuickCheck globally and not have to include it per project, is this possible? Similarly, if I want to open a ghci REPL anywhere, how can I access packages?

                              <span>I see this has been brought up in the past, but no definite solution. I&#x27;ve got a reliably failing scenario in a pretty vanilla system (emacs-mac from brew, GNU Emacs 29.1 (build 1, aarch64-apple-darwin22.5.0, Carbon Version 169 AppKit 2299.6) of 2023-08-08, current m2 mac, working through the emacs-bedrock configuration so there&#x27;s not a lot loaded).
 Essentially if I use the right click context menu, and move the pointer around said menu, I&#x27;ll get the briefly spinning and then forever frozen beachball cursor. C-g does nothing, pkill -SIGUSR2 also did nothing helpful.
 I don&#x27;t need the context menu, so I&#x27;ve removed the code in init.el that enables context-menu-mode.
 Anyone else still seeing these hangs, or have any ideas on a real solution?

                              <span>I am a long time vim user. I started using emacs about four years ago mainly for notmuch email.
 I tried evil for a while, but it had some quirks and incompatibilities with other packages, so I went back to the default key bindings.
 I find the default key bindings to just not stick with me. I keep reverting to using the cursor keys or mouse. Do the majority of folks use the default key bindings? Or do you map them to something that suites you? Or do I just need to force myself to use the default keys?
 In the various discussions I have never gotten a feel for just how wide spread evil is.
 Thanks.

                              <span>There was a recent thread about writing org mode init files where I noted that tangling an org file doesn&#x27;t fit my workflow due to several considerations I&#x27;m going to leave aside here but I like having a nicely formatted documentation file for sharing.
 Basically what I wanted was a way to postprocess my elisp files (primarily init.el but in theory any one) and generate either markdown or org that looked similar to literate programming examples that I could then publish if desired on github etc.
 I didn&#x27;t find anything that fit my scenario so I went ahead and wrote a fairly simple proto-package at
 https://github.com/benleis1/elispdoc
 I haven&#x27;t figured out publishing yet and its still in beta stage but you can clone and load-file it to try it out. Already the output is pretty enough for my purposes.
 I auto-generated the readme.md on the repo using elispdoc on itself.
 I&#x27;m hoping someone else will find this useful and I&#x27;m interested in any feedback.

                              <span>Emacs is a fantastic software that has become my swiss army knife as a pentester. The problem is that recently I&#x27;ve had a muscle issue, radiculopathy, and navigating around DWM with my current configuration is my personal hell. This is fixable with a reworked sxhkd configuration. 
 Questions regarding the issue:
 Q1: Is there a prefix key on the left side of the keyboard that can feel as smooth as firing C-x without creating any real pressure between the thumb and index finger?
 BLABLABLA: Define smooth, right? lmao... ig the same way you can glide on and off the defaults for save-buffer, or new-window-on-right. 
 Q2: Is there a way to get Emacs to use the same exact hotkey you&#x27;re using globally? 
 BLABLABLA: This is obviously the magical, superfast route, so I don&#x27;t expect a response to this question. Maybe though... a script, syntactical directive, something... 
 Answer either question at your leisure. I&#x27;m still hacking away at it myself and just wanted to delegate the task to anyone willing. C-x and M-x appear to be masterful in terms of flexibility.

                              <span>I am trying to set up my own config and want to use lsp-mode.
 I have a pretty minimal config with lsp-mode, lsp-ui, and vertico. When I open a JS file I can see diagnostic messages and hover over functions for information. When I try to type, I expect a popup to appear with suggestions from typescript-language-server as well as pieces of text from my buffer, but this does not happen.
 Do I need to install another package or set up some keybindings for this? I&#x27;m sort of confused at what consult/company/ivy/helm/vertico/etc are and where each of them fit in and want to understand this all better.

 I&#x27;m using doom with company and vertico enabled in the :completion section; I&#x27;m not sure which one is responsible.
 Has anyone seen this behaviour? Any suggestions of how I can determine which package is causing it, or even better, how to fix it? Thanks!

                              <span>i am a college student and nobody i know uses emacs, i learnt vim by watching my mentors use it but i feel emacs will be much better than vim
 i&#x27;m so bad at emacs i spent 3 days trying to change my indentations from 8 to 4 and still couldn&#x27;t manage to do it
 i tried liberachat #emacs on IRC but people aren&#x27;t much present on irc
 i wish there was a discord channel where i could talk to people who use emacs
 i have never online seen a person use emacs as his goto IDE/OS :D
 neither have i seen a person offline 
 my teacher who i really respect uses vim and says it would&#x27;ve been better if he had got hang of emacs
 i wish i don&#x27;t comfort myself with vim for too long or it would be painful switching editor to emacs
 i use tmux, vim , arch , hyprland, i3 , dwm 
 however i&#x27;ve never felt the fear of using these while starting 
 but emacs scares me as i know how much time i spent trying to learn it and it was all vain

                              <span>I would like to be able to write a bunch of functions that call company-complete and then continue doing things after I&#x27;ve selected the completion. The idea is to pretend company-complete has been called from inside a \ref.
 This is a simple example
  (defun f1 () (interactive) (insert &quot;\\ref{}&quot;) (backward-char) (company-complete) ;; now choose the completion, etc (backward-char 4) (insert &quot;i_used_to_be_a_&quot;)) 
 If the above worked, I&#x27;d be using company-completeas if it was being called from a \ref, but then I&#x27;d modify the \ref to, in this example, \i_used_to_be_a_ref.
 The problem is that the above immediately modifies \ref, but I never get to choose the completions . I&#x27;ve tried variations of the above, like call-interactively, without success. I think I am missing something very obvious (emacs lisp novice here).
 Why do I want to do this? Because I want to use company-complete for arbitrary macros in latex as if they were \ref. I can do this modifying company-reftex&#x27;s company-reftex-labels-regexp, but ideally I&#x27;d like to do it without modifying that variable, or when company-reftex is not called, for example when using LSP.

                              <span>EDITED: As I can&#x27;t change the title any more: It&#x27;s not a Treesitter-issue but breadcrumb-mode
 Read on - this is not a rant but an exchange wheather I should subimt a bug report
 Using GNU Emacs 30.0.50 (build 1, x86_64-w64-mingw32), pre-built treesitter libraries version v0.12.148 from https://github.com/emacs-tree-sitter/tree-sitter-langs/releases
 When I open a prettified JSON with 17944 lines, 370 kB in size, opening takes
  
js-json-mode: 1 Second
 json-ts-mode: 10 Seconds
  
Larger files also open, but become simply unwildly to use as eg. an undo seems to completely re-parse the file in json-ts-mode, which makes operating files in that mode really cumbersome.
 So using json-ts-mode is an order of magnitude slower and I wonder if my settings are wrong, this is to be expected or if I should submit a bug report?

                              <span>I want to learn emacs as a long-time neovim user. I love the way emacs is self documented as I find it so challenging to understand/fix things myself in neovim.
 I work on a monorepo at my job - a variety of projects in different languages inside of a single git repo. I will open a tmux session in my terminal emulator and keep a window open for whatever number of the projects I&#x27;m working with on. Typically I will use an alias to open a project in a new window, open neovim, and open a vertical split with a shell for running the project.
 The thing I like about this is it&#x27;s super easy to switch between projects and they all keep whatever pane layout I have set up. I can also spawn new windows for any other work I need to do.
 I&#x27;m not really getting how I can do this in emacs. I have set up dashboard.el and projectile.el and can open a project, but I have to then open another emacs frame if I want to open another project. I would much prefer to have a little tab bar or some shortcuts to switch between projects in a single frame.
 Any guidance is appreciated!

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 We are very excited to announce Copilot 3.19 [2]. Copilot is a stream-based EDSL in Haskell for writing and monitoring embedded C programs, with an emphasis on correctness and hard realtime requirements. Copilot is typically used as a high-level runtime verification framework, and supports temporal logic (LTL, PTLTL and MTL), clocks and voting algorithms.
 Copilot is being used at NASA in drone test flights. Through the NASA tool Ogma [1] (also written in Haskell), Copilot also serves as a runtime monitoring backend for NASA&#x27;s Core Flight System, Robot Operating System (ROS2), and FPrime (the software framework used in the Mars Helicopter) applications.
 This release drastically increases the test coverage of copilot-core. We also remove deprecated functions from copilot-core…</span>

                              <span>Hi,
 I tried Neovim and VScodium as the most popular Haskell IDEs. Curiously, the problem looks exactly the same with those mostly unrelated tools: the informative part gets lost beyond hope to the right of the right margin. No status bar, no hovering, nothing. It&#x27;s hard to believe that it&#x27;s intended to be so. What do I miss?

The note would be something like &quot;Emailed HR and waiting for reply&quot;. I don&#x27;t want to mark the TODO item as DONE yet, since I&#x27;ll need to continue with the task after receiving replies from someone else. How should I do it?

                              <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;ve been trying out Cursor recently - it&#x27;s a fork of VSCode with AI codegen baked in.
 They do some interesting things like indexing your codebase via embeddings and then use RAG to help do contextual codegen. You can provide your own API keys as well.
 This has been by far the best AI codegen experience, IMO. I was wondering if there are any good packages that replicate similar functionality in emacs.

                              <span>I noticed my computer was running hot and discovered that emacs was using 100% CPU usage on one core. I ran the profiler and it shows ~80% usage by redisplay_internal (C function) &gt; jit-lock-function &gt; jit-lock-fontify-now &gt; jit-lock--run-functions &gt; run-hook-wrapped. I then noticed this only occurred with org files that had links to web pages. For example, I opened an org file without links and CPU usage was low, I then added a link to a webpage and CPU usage went to 100%. In case it&#x27;s relevant, I&#x27;m using doom with emacs 28.1. 
 Please let me know if you have any ideas or if there&#x27;s any other info I should provide.
 Edit: Full profiler report Also forgot to mention I&#x27;m using Linux Mint

 Is there a way to skip the intermediate variable? What I really want is:

 Ideas? The docs are pretty thin on this.

 I&#x27;ve set TERM &#x3D; xterm-256color in Windows Terminal, I&#x27;ve set it in my emacs init.el but yet whenever I check getenv TERM it returns &#x27;dumb&#x27; and doing a meta-x list-colors-display shows me 16 colours. I know the actual Windows Terminal can display 256 colours because I ran some Python to get it to display them and it worked as expected. Any idea how I can get this to work? Is it even possible? Sadly it&#x27;s a work PC so I have no option but to use Windows otherwise I&#x27;d just use Linux and be done with it.

                              <span>Suppose I call completing-read-multiple with the following list of candidates: 
 (&quot;1&quot; &quot;2,3&quot; &quot;4,5,6&quot;) 
 If the value of crm-separator is [ \t]*,[ \t]*, selecting the second candidate will result in the list (&quot;2&quot; &quot;3&quot;), and not (as one might have expected) (&quot;2, 3&quot;). This is not very surprising of course, and if you are building your own completion tables for use with completing-read-multiple, the problem can be avoided by keeping the value of crm-separator in mind. The problem is that sometimes the completion table is generated on the basis of input the user may have no control over. 
 For example, in mu4e there&#x27;s a function mu4e-view-save-attachments which does what the name suggests: it lists all attachments in a given message for the user to choose (possibly more than one) and then saves the selected attachments in a specific directory. If you are dealing with a message with files whose names contain a comma, selecting one of those files will lead to trouble. 
 Now, I can just define a little function that will temporarily change the value of crm-separator to handle these cases, e.g.: 
 (defun my/toggle-crm-separator () (interactive) (let ((original-separator &quot;[ \t]*,[ \t]*&quot;)) (if (string&#x3D; crm-separator original-separator) (let ((separator (completing-read &quot;Select one of the following options&quot; &#x27;(&quot;;&quot; &quot;,,&quot; &quot;-&quot;)))) (setq crm-separator (replace-regexp-in-string &quot;,&quot; separator crm-separator))) (setq crm-separator original-separator)))) 
 Still, I wonder if there&#x27;s a smarter solution out there. Off the cuff, I can imagine scanning the completion candidates to ensure none of them contain an instance of the value of crm-separator and, if they do, at least alerting the user of the need to pick a different value for crm-separator? But I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s a better way to handle this situation. 
 Thoughts?

                              <span>Greetings everyone,
 I wanted to share a function that I&#x27;ve found incredibly useful while conducting qualitative data analysis of interviews. During this type of research, structuring my interview data and maintaining a clear overview is crucial. To assist with this, I&#x27;ve developed a function in Emacs Lisp that uses tags to extract specific headlines into a new buffer.
 This function, extract-headlines-by-tag, prompts the user to enter a tag. The function then scans the entire buffer, and for each headline that contains the specified tag, it extracts not only the headline but also its content. These extracted parts are then transferred into a new buffer. I&#x27;ve made the new buffer pop up for immediate review after the extraction process.
 Here&#x27;s the piece of code:
 (defun extract-headlines-by-tag (tag) &quot;Extract headlines and their content from current buffer by TAG.&quot; (interactive &quot;sEnter tag: &quot;) (save-excursion (let ((result-buffer (generate-new-buffer (concat &quot;/Extracted Headlines &quot; tag &quot;*&quot;)))) (with-current-buffer result-buffer (org-mode) (insert &quot;* Extracted Headlines by Tag: &quot; tag &quot; *\n\n&quot;)) (org-element-map (org-element-parse-buffer) &#x27;headline (lambda (headline) (when (member tag (org-element-property :tags headline)) (with-current-buffer result-buffer (insert (org-element-interpret-data headline) &quot;\n&quot;))))) (pop-to-buffer result-buffer)))) 
 This has greatly improved the way I manage and analyze my qualitative interview data. Sharing it here in case it&#x27;s of use to anyone else in similar situations.

                              <span>When I get an iCalendar (text/calendar) MIME part, it shows up in a mu4e article buffer like this:
 Summary: Pre-Planning Meeting Location: Room 101 Time:  Organizer: wgates@microsoft.com Attendance: Required Method: REQUEST Status: Not replied yet 
 How can I get the time to display in a 12-hour format, like &quot;2024-03-07 1 pm-2 pm&quot;? Including a UTC offset would be nice, too.

                              <span>I implemented a custom JSON parser for emacs. Instead of using a library which creates an intermediary JSON representation which is then converted to Lisp objects, my solution creates Lisps objects from the JSON stream without any intermediary steps.
 Measured by ~1 MB of clang LSP messages, it works ~8x faster than the current emacs JSON parser. Maybe it can be helpful for people whose LSP works slowly, as an alternative solution to emacs-lsp-booster (I didn&#x27;t do any comparisons).
 You can check out the faster-json-parsing branch here: https://github.com/geza-herman/emacs/tree/faster-json-parsing. Is it based on master, but I think it can be easily applied to any recent version of Emacs (it&#x27;s just one commit).
 This JSON parser misses some error handling, like for example it doesn&#x27;t check for utf-8 encoding errors. So please consider it as a proof of concept, not as a production quality thing. But I&#x27;ve been using it for a while, it works for me with clangd perfectly.

For my use case, I am using a hydra to navigate around my buffers and every time a buffer is focused I run maximize-window, what I want to happen is the other open buffers stack on top of each other like in i3 can this be done?

                              <span>Hi all!
 I have evil mode enabled in my minibuffer by setting the evil-want-minibuffer variable to true. Is there a way to rebind C-n and C-p specifically in the minibuffer? I tried remapping it using the following but it didn&#x27;t work
  (define-key minibuffer-local-map (kbd &quot;C-p&quot;) &#x27;previous-line) 
 Before I used to be able to scroll up and down through my Ivy completions using C-n and C-p but now I cant. When pulling up the minibuffer with &quot;:&quot;, those ctrl keys map to the following when no text is inputted to the minibuffer.
 Note: These keybinds actually work as intended
  C-n next-complete-history-element [2 times] C-p previous-complete-history-element [4 times] 
 When I start typing and my ivy completion comes up, the ctrl keys map to the following
  C-p evil-complete-previous [6 times] C-n evil-complete-next [3 times] 
 The C-p and C-n dont go up and down the list of items as intended, which is why i want to rebind them to the original next-line and previous-line
 Any help would be awesome. Thank you! - Queztaz
 ANSWER
 This code fixed it
  (eval-after-load &quot;evil-maps&quot; (dolist (map &#x27;(evil-motion-state-map evil-insert-state-map evil-emacs-state-map)) (define-key (eval map) &quot;\C-n&quot; nil) (define-key (eval map) &quot;\C-p&quot; nil) ))

                              <span>I&#x27;m in need of a good contract-first approach to REST services. What I would like is to be able to generate the server-side code based on Li&#x27;s https://com-lihaoyi.github.io/cask/ framework (It&#x27;s great, and good for the scala community to have lovely approachable, useful and simple platforms like his).
 I&#x27;ve made a start here:
 https://github.com/kindservices/openapi-generator 
 The additional goal is to take a slightly different approach to traditional OpenApi templates, where the team is expected to have the generated code alongside the hand-cranked code.
 This template is intended to be packaged up in a jar, which can then be brought in to a clean new project as a simple jar dependency, allowing engineers to just &quot;insert your business logic here&quot; in a simple, tiny scala-cli style app.
 ​
 The main pieces are there, but it would really benefit from some collaboration, sanity checking, and getting ready for production use.
 So - does that make sense? Is anyone interested?

                              <span>Hey everyone. We are looking for two engineers to work new long-term project in the payments area. Haskell is already giving us an edge in terms of maintainability and developer efficiency so I&#x27;m keen to meet anyone who is wanting to take a new position to work with Haskell in their day job.
 The project is still rather young, so there&#x27;s plenty of opportunities to make an impact. We&#x27;re open to having remote employees. We sponsor visas and help with relocation too. Unlike a couple years ago, we are looking for more senior engineers. That is, people who have real life experience in production systems and whose expertise goes beyond Haskell. Experience with data modelling, infrastructure or frontend programming is highly appreciated.
 I&#x27;m happy to answer any questions about the role here, but if you want to apply for the position, please use our page.
 About the company
 We are a leading, fast-growing Nordic fashion and beauty e-commerce company. You can find our headquarters in Malmö, Sweden, but we also have a few physical retail stores in the Copenhagen area.

                              <span>Functional programming is a very new concept to me, and all I&#x27;ve known is imperative python and some oop java. 
 I&#x27;ve played with JS/TS before, but never learnt any of the theory behind it. 
 So, what is FP? Why would you use it over OOP? 
 Everything is immutable, but what&#x27;s the benefits of that? I get that mutability implies certainty of input-&gt;output, but why does that even matter?
 If anyone can give an ELI5 or tldr, that&#x27;d be great!

 Is there an existing solution I am missing?

                              <span>The idea of one note &#x3D; one object of attention is rocket fuel—a change in attention &#x3D; a link to a new note. The level of detail depends on the elevation of the perspective you are paying attention to. If you are studying to be a sports trainer, the details you&#x27;d view ketosis with would be different from those of a person studying contemporary art design. The trainer might have a note mentioning William Wegman, and the artist might have a note mentioning macro balancing, but neither should feel the need to do a deep dive into topics outside primary areas of exploration. That doesn&#x27;t mean notes have to be exclusive, without the flavor of life.
This object of attention was sparked from watching Bianca Pereira, Linked Knowledge Does Not Work.</span>

                              <span>The most important thing the GPT for Zettel Critique does for me is point out areas where my note (thinking) is weak (has gaps) and offer suggestions like a patient and watchful tutor. This alone is a fine-tuned game-changer. If the GPT had a persona, it would be a smart, but not snarky, it would be patient, but not hold back, it would act with my best interests in mind. The GPT doesn&#x27;t have a persona. It is a huge algorithm of &#x27;linked knowledge,&#x27; and the benefit comes from its ability to pull out appropriate threads and apply them to the case at hand.
My role in this shindig is to be honest when reviewing the critique. I dream of &quot;What Would Richard Feynman Do?&quot; Maybe I should get this tattooed on my wrist. W.W.R.F.D. This would be a great slogan to go along with zettelkasting.  Try to be responsible and not give up independence to the machine. That doesn&#x27;t mean that the GPT is wrong in its critique, it means the it should be viewed like any tutorial, describing best practices while leaving open the opportunities to think in ways that support your individual style and goals.</span>

                              <span>Three years ago, a blog post introduced destination-passing style (DPS) programming in Haskell, focusing on array processing, for which the API was made safe thanks to Linear Haskell. Today, I’ll present a slightly different API to manipulate arbitrary data types in a DPS fashion, and show why it can be useful for some parts of your programs.
The present blog post is mostly based on my recent paper Destination-passing style programming: a Haskell implementation, published at JFLA 2024. It assumes basic knowledge of Linear Haskell and intermediate fluency in Haskell.

 I&#x27;ve encountered code that mixes the infix and non-infix (DSL style?) syntaxes. It is sufficiently abstract that despite 13 years of Scala experience, I cannot mentally parse and understand it. And that is even after unsuccessfully attempting to refactor it into a consistent infix style manually.
 What resources, if any, exist to transform an existing snippet of Scala source code such that it reformats it into a consistent infix style? And then enables reformatting it to a consistent non-infix (DSL style?)?
 Details:
 I&#x27;ve been using Scala since 2011. I come from a strong OOP background (Eiffel, Delphi, C++, Java, etc.), meaning that learning FP has been a bit of a cognitive dissonance over the years. That said, I have persisted and have mostly wrapped my head around FP in Scala.…</span>

                              <span>So my first instinct when I have some notes to take is to fire up notepad++, despite having used emacs for 20 years. I&#x27;ve never liked using emacs for plain text; it&#x27;s always felt like a code editor only to me. 
 I&#x27;d kind of like to use it for more text things, but one thing that I&#x27;m not sure how to do is maybe fire up a frame that only has access to txt/org files and won&#x27;t be cross-contaminated by all the code buffers I have open. Is there a good way to have a frame/window be dedicated to a type of file?

 I found this code block, which I believe should produce an image in the pdf when rendered, but no figure appears, only the r code. 
 Might I be missing something in my init.el file or in my header?

 When I view the SVG file in Emacs, the tooltips and links are gone. Is there a way to display fully-featured SVG files inside Emacs?

 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 But in the query builder buffer my query looks like this: lisp ((call_expression function: (member_expression object: (identifier) @call.object property: (property_identifier) @call.property)) @call (#match? @call.object &quot;console&quot;) (#match? @call.property &quot;log&quot;) )  The query builder works perfect, since it highlights only one node but the function returns me more than one node, it is returning all the console calls

                              <span>Hi,
 In projectile or emacs&#x27;s project.el, is there a way to support a project consisting of disjoint folders? i.e. folders without common parents? Or a way to exclude folders that I don&#x27;t want to be included?
 ​
 Thanks

                              <span>When I run emacs (GNU Emacs 26.1 (build 1, x86_64-redhat-linux-gnu, GTK+ Version 3.22.30)), I get a bunch of warnings like this:
  
(emacs:870588): Gtk-WARNING **: 17:46:44.937: Theme parsing error: gtk.css:978:50: Missing closing bracket for :not()
  
I do have a gtk.css file in .config/gtk-3.0, but it just imports a colors.css file - and that file just calls @define-color a bunch of times. And I tried commenting out the import - didn&#x27;t help.
 The default theme seems to be HighContrast, so I checked its gtk-3.0/gtk.css and there&#x27;s nothing it in. Could the problem being coming from another theme?
 It&#x27;s not a huge problem, but these warnings fill up my terminal. I can keep two terminals open to the same directory so I can see what I&#x27;m doing, but I was wondering if there&#x27;s any way to suppress this stuff.
 Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve tried:
  
I got rid of my .emacs file.
 I created a configuration file (~/.emacs.d/early-init.el) containing:
  
 (setq warning-minimum-level :emergency) 
 (setq warning-minimum-log-level :emergency) 
 (load-theme &#x27;leuven&#x27; t)
  
The theme takes effect, but the warnings are still there. Is there a global location that could be overriding my configuration? I got pissed and sent the warnings to /dev/null, but that means I can&#x27;t see any warnings at all - so not the best solution. Any better suggestions?

                              <span>A while back I installed Haskell using stack. I seemed to have a system-wide install that has ghc as version 9.0.2 from a terminal prompt in any directory. Then I created projects with
 stack new projname stack setup stack build 
 So I just installed ghcup according to the instructions and did ghcup tui where I chose ghc 9.4.8. But now ghc --version reports 9.0.2 -- as if it doesn&#x27;t know about my ghcup choice. I do ghcup set ghc 9.4.8 -- and again ghc --version still gives 9.0.2. I fear I&#x27;m messing things up. How can I get my Haskell world totally into ghcup and out of stack? The ghcup set ghc did say /usr/bin/ghc is &quot;shadowing&quot; and I should remove it. Will this solve this issue entirely, or is my previous stack world going to linger and cause more problems? I see in /usr/bin a cabal and cabal --version and which cabal yields, yes, /usr/bin/cabal and this not the ghcup cabal. Remove it too? What else?

                              <span>20240306154602 The algorithm of Neocortex
 #map #neuro #intelligence
In science existence of many constraints make it harder to find a model that fits. However, after an eureka moment all constraints seem harmonious.
In his book A Thousand Brains Hawkins look for a uniform algorithm implemented by cortical columns, the neural unit of neocortex.
Mechanism
Brain constantly tries to predict its inputs. When there is a mismatch between predictions and an input, the system immediately notices. Our model of the world being inaccurate deserves evolutionary attention.
The model we construct is not separate from our body. Neocortex, not being a simple I/O circuit stores data in reference frames  Meaning, we encode the location of a cup relative to our hand for instance.
The reasoning goes for abstract knowledge too. There are no &quot;is&quot; statements in the world.
I&#x27;m trying to go through a paradigm-shift in my understanding of Zettling, from &quot;PKM&quot; to keeping a ZK. Here is a simple structure note I created to dive deep into a topic, short because I haven&#x27;t split it into parts yet to work deeply. But I don&#x27;t know how to proceed. Any help is much appreciated.</span>

                              <span>Hi,
 This is an old story, once solved with {-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}
 Now I&#x27;ve got two errors:
 167 | strp path &#x3D; T.unpack $ fromRight &quot;&quot; (FPS.toText path)
 187 | Just ext -&gt; (T.unpack $ T.toUpper ext)
 https://github.com/Tyrn/dahastes/blob/master/src/Lib.hs
 Once it was ghc 8.x, now it&#x27;s 9.4.8. What could be the cause of the error?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve made this repository which was supposed to try out the parallel library, but using parallelism in Haskell, just in general, seems to not work any more. It&#x27;s no longer faster than just using a single thread. I&#x27;ve tried monitoring multi-threaded Haskell programs using htop, and I think the problem is that they&#x27;re not using the setpriority system call to get a high enough priority. 
 ​
 I can&#x27;t find any information on how to set the thread priority for the latest version of ghc (9.8.2), and I still haven&#x27;t gotten a follow up on any bug reports I&#x27;ve made.

So if I do a list-packages and don&#x27;t see it offered to install, but I notice it&#x27;s listed below in the dependency section, that means it is already installed, ready to use, and I won&#x27;t see offered in the available section, correct? I test out ht and it seems to work fine. So what is this mechanism with dependencies? I don&#x27;t remember installing ht, but I&#x27;ve got it -- as a dependency.

                              <span>In orgmode, I am using org-id to create a CUSTOM_ID property in each org headline.
 For example:
  
* Test Headline 
 :PROPERTIES: 
 :CUSTOM_ID: id-3d58ec46-5e2a-4453-bf10-41f8b2767afc 
 :CREATED: [2024-03-04 14:31:14] 
 :END:
  
​
 When I go to do an internal link somewhere, I need it to be:
  
[[#id-3d58ec46-5e2a-4453-bf10-41f8b2767afc][Test Headline]]
  
​
 I would like a function to call that could create that link from an org headline that I could yank (paste) elsewhere in the file.
 ​
 Additionally, if possible, I would like to learn how I would figure this out on my own for future ideas.

 /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs -q -batch --eval (&quot;require &#x27;em-script)&quot; --eval &quot;(catch &#x27;eshell-replace-command (eshell-source-file \&quot;t.es\&quot; &#x27;() t))&quot; 
 but none of them run and print to stdout. I figure there must be a way to do this but it&#x27;s surprisingly difficult (I found an old post from another account but it wasn&#x27;t quite there either).

                              <span>I created an emacs extension named org-linker that allows users to link a file in org-mode (the attachment is identified as a UUID), offering a secure and flexible method for referring to other files in org-mode. Try it out!
 Comparison with org-attach
 org-linker differs from org-attach in its approach to file attachment. 
 org-attach uses an org heading as a basic storing unit, which can lead to issues if not managed carefully (e.g. refiling or adding shadowing subtrees). 
 On the other hand, org-linker assigns a unique UUID to each attached file, ensuring a more robust linkage system. By treating individual files as the fundamental unit, org-linker provides a safer and more flexible approach to handling attachments in org-mode documents. For example, this allows easy movement and copying of links across various org files and headings.
 Both tools have their strengths and are suitable for different use cases. However, if you prioritize a secure and straightforward attachment system, org-linker might be the preferred choice.
 Example
 For instance, if the root is /tmp/org-linker/, and the UUID for the transaction is 20240101-235959, and the file is readme.md, the file will be copied to /tmp/org-linker/20240101-235959/readme.md with the transaction recorded in /tmp/org-linker/db.tx. And an org-link [[linker:20240101-235959/readme.md]] is inserted at point.
 You can customize the uuid generator. In particular, you don&#x27;t have to use timestamp.
 You can also remove the uuid easily by fuzzy searching with M-x org-linker/trash-folder-uuid, or just remove the uuid at point with M-x org-linker/trash-folder-at-point. The trashing function is customizable too.

 There is quick way to switch to a todo/agenda view, maybe of multiple files?
 ​
 thanks

                              <span>I know it is natively possible to save the folded state of each sub-tree. Is there any elisp snippet or package that can help achieving that?
 I am asking about a snippet/package because simply having the property :VISIBILITY: folded&#x60; as described in the org-manual, like below, does not work for me. When I re-open the file, all sub-trees are unfolded.:
 * Main ** A - Level 1 *** A - level 2 :properties: :VISIBILITY: folded :end: Lorem ipsum ** B - level 1 *** B - level 2 :properties: :VISIBILITY: folded :end: Lorem ipsum ** C 
 I need to save the folded state in the file itself, using the VISIBILITY property, so that every time I open that file all subfolders have the desired folded/unfolded state.
 It must be something very simple which I am overlooking, any pointers, please?
  
 Edit: wording

                              <span>I am trying to refactor some of my old code with type parameter and can&#x27;t come up with a clean approach. Any suggestion is appreciated.
 ​
 I have two methods like following
 def doSomething(input: model1): model2 &#x3D; {
 ......
 }
 ​
 def doSomething2(input: model3): model4 &#x3D; {
 ....
 }
 ​
 doSomething() and doSomething2() are doing the same thing. So, i thought of passing the type as parameter and came up with the following
 ​
 def doSomethingGood[A, B] (input: A): B &#x3D; {
 ...
 return value.asInstanceOf[B] //---&gt;Is this good?
 }
 Now the issue is i have to cast the return value to B, is this good practice? Is there any better way to refactor it?

                              <span>Hello scala community! Basically the question in the title. We have a webapp that is implemented with finagle. Json is handled with Jackson. What are some of the benefits that we could have by moving to the typelevel ecosystem: http4s, cats-effect and circe. Also, what are some inconveniences that might come with such migration. Thanks!

                              <span>Since I couldn&#x27;t find any obvious online resources for this issue I thought I&#x27;d write a small post.
 I&#x27;ve been experimenting with turning on mouse mode when using emacs in the terminal via
 (unless window-live system (require &#x27;mouse) (xterm-mouse-mode t) (defun track-mouse (e)) (setq mouse-sel-mode t)) 
 This has some side effects that mess with cutting via the system command-c combination since the mouse selections are managed by emacs rather than my terminal, iterm2. I can live with that but I wanted some kill-ring / system clipboard integration since I do frequently want to cut text from inside emacs and paste outside of it in another app. So I added some advice to do that 
 ​
 ;; Advice to the kill functions that also copies the last kill ring entry to ;; the system clipboard. ;; This is called after the copy so we can ignore parameters. (defun pbcopy-region-filter (begin end &amp;optional region) (let* ((text (current-kill 0)) (process-connection-type nil) (proc (start-process &quot;pbcopy&quot; &quot;*Messages*&quot; &quot;pbcopy&quot;))) (process-send-string proc text) (process-send-eof proc))) ;; For terminal mode add advice to copy to clipboard (unless window-system (advice-add &#x27;kill-region :after #&#x27;pbcopy-region-filter) (advice-add &#x27;kill-ring-save :after #&#x27;pbcopy-region-filter))

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to set up Emacs on my personal computer in the same way it&#x27;s configured at my office, and I was surprised by how copying my init file from one to the other didn&#x27;t set up my font faces as I wanted.
 Turns out there&#x27;s a different set of colors available on each, even though both are running with xterm-256color. Doing list-colors-display in one gives the list of X11 color names that I expect -- 556 of them -- and in the other there&#x27;s a list of only 256 colors, the 16 ANSI terminal colors followed by colors numbered 16 to 256.
 I can&#x27;t find any documentation about this list of numbered colors anywhere, where is it coming from?

                              <span>I&#x27;m using latest master emacs with treesit support, ts-auto etc. So when I load a .cpp file it&#x27;s in c++-ts-mode. All good so far, but I notice none of my custom C++ snippets load anymore, because they&#x27;re in snippets/c++-mode. Is anyone working on solving that?
 It seems to me, from a user perspective, that the c++-mode/c++-ts-mode split is causing a lot of headaches. It may be solving some that I don&#x27;t know about, but it is frustrating sometimes.

 I am also open to methods to accomplish this other than adding an entry to my display-buffer-alist.

                              <span>Hi Experts
 Maybe I am not asking the right question, but please bear with me...
 Lets say i created an org document in which i used different org source blocks like shell, python, lisp ... and finally i get the data ... 
 How do finally wrap everything up in an interactive function, like i call that function and the whole org document is evaluated and gives me result 
 Is it even possible to achieve that?
 TIA.

                              <span>I&#x27;m on FreeBSD and have gotten suspend and resume working. Everything looks fine if I leave emacs open between suspend and resume, but if I restart emacs after resume, the fonts look like the standard unconfigured xterm-like font.
 Everything else renders fonts correctly. I have checked via M-x describe-fontset and it seems to be my font: Fontset: -PfEd-DejaVu Sans Mono-regular-normal-normal-*-16-*-*-*-m-0-fontset-auto2.
 What&#x27;s weird is this is after restarting emacs, so it&#x27;s something surviving in the system between restarts. Rebooting my laptop resolves the issue.
 Any ideas where to look to debug this?

                              <span>For using languages like python or julia, there are options like ob-ipython and ob-julia, which should interact with the REPLs directly. On the other hand, there is emacs-jupyter, which provides an interface with Jupyter, which also allows us to use like python.
 My question is: What is the benefit of emacs-jupyter for lang like python, when using org-babel? I think ob-python has provided the same functionalities.

                              <span>Hello, I am here to solve some doubts about &quot;Solarized Dark&quot; theme.
 I am considering these 2 versions:
 - Solarized-Dark 
 - Doom-Solarized-Dark
 ​
 I have these questions:
  
Is &quot;Doom-Solarized-Dark&quot; supposed to be better than the ordinary &quot;Solarized-Dark&quot; ? I would like to use the most complete theme and the one that supports more extensions. I don&#x27;t use Doom Emacs but that&#x27;s not an impediment to use the doom-solarized-dark theme. Which one is better and which one would you recommend me to use ?
 Solarized theme is a legendary theme, however it seems that has some flaws in its design (at least under my eyes). It is also true that I am not an expert in the topic. I am referring specifically to the fact that, talking about syntax highlighting, there is no color for strings (Font Lock String Face). That is, color for strings and foreground is exactly the same. Does it have any logical explanation ? Is it a flaw at a design level that needs to be improved ?
  
Thank you in advance for your help.

 When magit 3.3.0 is installed, either from nongnu archive or directly from its tar file, it will pull down the latest 0.5.3 from the elpa archive.
 Is there a way to let magit not install transient 0.5.3 but use the built-in 0.4.3, which should satisfy the dependency requirement ?
 Edit: another package, transient-dwim, shows the same issue by pulling the latest transient even though this 2022-year package specifies transient 0.1 as its dependency.
 Solution:
 A temporary workaround until the bug reported by u/nv-elisp is fixed. Put this in init.el:
 (add-to-list &#x27;package--builtin-versions &#x27;(transient 0 4 3)) 
 Hope this is helpful and many thanks to all the people who chimed in!

                              <span>Hi!! I have been working as a Fullstack Dev for al most 2 years and, for most of my daily working routine I have been using VsCode. I am a Linux fan, but... During my studies I started with atom and finally moved to VsCode, using vi/vim/nano/fish/tmux for server managing and quick file modifications.
 I imagine that moving all my dev working routine from VsCode to Emacs is going to be... Hard, specially for the first days but this is the way my future working routine is going to be so... I am really excited and affraid to. I have a few tutorial from YouTube marked as &quot;to watch&quot; but I would like to have your personal experience feedback and your opinion for the usual question: why should I use emacs instead of, for example, VsCode?

 [ As part of 3.0.0-dev, we fixed an issue where a C-u prefix argument was needed to select a silo. ]
 I am aware that the top two functions currently still need the C-u prefix fix to correctly let you select silos (since I&#x27;m still on denote 2.2.4) Aside from this, I&#x27;m still running into two problems:
  
whenever i enter my silo in dired it always prompts me about the local variables list in my silo or .dir-locals.el containing values that may not be safe (*) and asking me to perform the action of ignoring it or applying the local variable list. But even after i choose the ! to permanetly mark these values as safe, the effect only lasts for that session and the next time I start up emacs and dired into that directory, it ends up asking me again.
 the three denote-silo-extras functions (aside from the C-u prefix issue on 2.2.4 which will be fixed in 3.0), all three of these functions when used don&#x27;t seem to pick up on my silo&#x27;s local variable denote-known-keywords for the silos when i execute the functions - they just show my normal global denote-known-keywords. They only seem to work when I manually dired into the silo directory first and then execute the functions while physically in the silo.
  
​
 ;;; Directory Local Variables. For more information evaluate: ;;; ;;; (info &quot;(emacs) Directory Variables&quot;) ((nil . ((denote-directory . &quot;~/Documents/recipes/&quot;) (denote-known-keywords . (&quot;french&quot; &quot;italian&quot; &quot;american&quot; &quot;mexican&quot; &quot;chinese&quot; &quot;japanese&quot; &quot;korean&quot; &quot;thai&quot;)) (denote-infer-keywords . nil)))) 
 Anyone encountering these problems?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve just released a compiler plugin that allows for auto-instrumenting an application for emitting open telemetry traces based on user configured rules. It relies on the wonderful hs-opentelemetry project by Ian Duncan for all open telemetry functionality.
  
github
 hackage
  
This is being used in production at my work and has provided useful insights around performance bottlenecks, exception context, and overall visibility into code execution.
 The plugin makes it so that you do not need to manually insert instrumentation code into function definitions, improving maintainability and reducing noise. By defining rules in a config file, you can specify which functions to instrument based on their return type or constraint context. This gives you control over whether you want the blanket approach of targeting your application&#x27;s primary monad/constraint or a more conservative approach of defining a type that explicitly indicates that it will be instrumented.
 A MonadUnliftIO instance must be available for a function to be instrumentable. In particular, pure functions are not eligible.

 About month ago I updated ghc to 9.6.4 and all related packages, such as HSL, cabal and so on.
 And now HSL behaves strange in tandem emacs&#x27; eglot.
 For example: I&#x27;ve created test project, made a mistake in a file and ran HSL in the directory where I did mistake. And that&#x27;s what it shows:

 Also, I created another project and ran there too and it showed me mistake, however on the next run, it started showing the same error
 How to fix that? I&#x27;ll appreciate any hints or something

                              <span>Hi, I freshly installed my PC with Ubuntu 22.04 and I want to set up a dev environment for Haskell.
 I run the curl command to install ghcup and let install everything including hls.
 Then I run stack new hello to build a neu project. The first thing I noticed is that another GHC version was installed.
 [GHCup-00130] The version 9.6.4 of the tool ghc is not installed.
 It installes GHC 9.6.4, which is neither recommended nor hls-powered
 It also installes HLS 
 If I run stack build I get the next error
 ghc-9.6.4: \gcc&#x27; failed in phase &#x60;Linker&#x27;. (Exit code: 1)&#x60;
 And if I open the project in VSCode (with the Haskell extension) I also get errors
 I had trouble figuring out the exact GHC version for the project. Falling back to using &#x27;ghc&#x27;.
 Failed to find the GHC version of this Stack project. Error when calling stack --stack-yaml /home/markus/dev/haskell/hello/stack.yaml setup --silent
 What went wrong? Did I miss some steps while installation? Do I need to install something additional on the OS?
 seems that I needed some packages. I installed these, But stack still wants to install a newer version of ghc. Does that matter?

Saving my org file generates the toc with links formatted like this: - [[#introduction][Introduction]] ; can I get it to simply make the link [[Introduction]]?
 ​
 Thanks!

                              <span>Dear Zettlers,
you might have heard it: ChatGPT challenged me and my honour. Let&#x27;s see if I can keep it, or bow down in shame.
Here is a 100% authenticated record of a conversation I had yesterday (what a coincidence):

  
LUHMANN: What is best in life?


See this thread for full context: https://forum.zettelkasten.de/discussion/2837/gpt4-zettel-critique-assistant-robo-zettel-feedback
The idea is to compare the feedback of ChatGPT and me. So, we need notes. 2--3 are enough. The content needs to be accessible to me. So, I cannot deal with mathematical content software code. Also: Really intricate details in specific domains might be out of reach. However, I have broad knowledge in the basics of most domains. So, just give it a try.
Please, submit notes for this battle.
Live long and prosper

 This loaded on startup in the warning screen as soon as I downloaded doom (before I changed anything to the init or downloaded any packages). I tried adding the following to packages.el and my config.el respectively:

                              <span>A couple of days back I made a post here asking how I can replicate my Emacs configuration for Front-end web dev in case I have to use a new computer. Some asked me to share my configuration.
 I installed the following packages from MELPA:
  
Company
 Emmet-mode
 lsp-mode
 web-mode
 yasnippet
  
I added these lines to my .emacs:
 ​
 (require &#x27;web-mode) (add-to-list &#x27;auto-mode-alist &#x27;(&quot;\\.html?\\&#x27;&quot; . web-mode)) (add-to-list &#x27;auto-mode-alist &#x27;(&quot;\\.css\\&#x27;&quot; . web-mode)) (add-to-list &#x27;auto-mode-alist &#x27;(&quot;\\.phtml\\&#x27;&quot; . web-mode)) (add-to-list &#x27;auto-mode-alist &#x27;(&quot;\\.tpl\\.php\\&#x27;&quot; . web-mode)) (add-to-list &#x27;auto-mode-alist &#x27;(&quot;\\.[agj]sp\\&#x27;&quot; . web-mode)) (add-to-list &#x27;auto-mode-alist &#x27;(&quot;\\.as[cp]x\\&#x27;&quot; . web-mode)) (add-to-list &#x27;auto-mode-alist &#x27;(&quot;\\.erb\\&#x27;&quot; . web-mode)) (add-to-list &#x27;auto-mode-alist &#x27;(&quot;\\.mustache\\&#x27;&quot; . web-mode)) (add-to-list &#x27;auto-mode-alist &#x27;(&quot;\\.djhtml\\&#x27;&quot; . web-mode)) (defun my-web-mode-hook () &quot;Hooks for Web mode.&quot; (setq web-mode-markup-indent-offset 2) (setq web-mode-css-indent-offset 2) (setq web-mode-code-indent-offset 2) ) (add-hook &#x27;web-mode-hook &#x27;my-web-mode-hook) (require &#x27;emmet-mode) (add-hook &#x27;web-mode-hook &#x27;emmet-mode) ;; Auto-start when the web-mode starts (add-hook &#x27;emmet-mode-hook (lambda () (setq emmet-indent-after-insert nil))) (add-hook &#x27;emmet-mode-hook (lambda () (setq emmet-indentation 2))) ;; indent 2 spaces. (require &#x27;lsp-mode) (add-hook &#x27;web-mode-hook #&#x27;lsp-deferred) 
 I installed VSCodes&#x27;s language servers by running this command on the terminal:
 npm install -g vscode-langservers-extracted 
 I added the directory (where the language server was installed) to my PATH variable.
 That&#x27;s all. This config provides me with HTML/CSS autocomplete, autoclosing HTML tags and syntax checking CSS syntax.
 Any tips/opinions would be appreciated. I have not yet been able to get syntax checking of HTML, like what VSCode does (highlighting misspelled tags in red)

 Anyone had the same experience and know how to fix it? Or maybe where I should report a bug?

                              <span>Hi,
 In python it is possible to create a class that inherits a slew of methods and properties, how can I make these visible in emacs?
 People often mention speedbar,occur or imenu, but these only deal with the structure present in the current buffer. I need a way to see the entire resulting object and all of its methods and properties.
 I have been looking for a solution to this for a minute now and all I have right now is to open a python shell, import the class and do ´´dir(MyClass)´ and parse this.
 ECB is broken for emacs29, pyreverse breaks on our codebase and many people here mention just using a jump-to-definition type of function, which I consider to be only better than poking in the dark by having a cigarette lighter on you.
 Is it possible at all in emacs? 
 ​
 thx,

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been trying to get org-noter to work as demonstrated in this video by its maintainer. Here is a minimal init.el:
 (require &#x27;package) (setq package-archives &#x27;((&quot;elpa&quot; . &quot;https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/&quot;) (&quot;melpa&quot; . &quot;https://melpa.org/packages/&quot;) (&quot;org&quot; . &quot;https://orgmode.org/elpa/&quot;))) (package-initialize) (unless package-archive-contents (package-refresh-contents)) (unless (package-installed-p &#x27;use-package) (package-install &#x27;use-package)) (require &#x27;use-package) (setq use-package-always-ensure t) (use-package org :mode (&quot;\\.org\\&#x27;&quot; . org-mode)) (use-package pdf-tools) (pdf-tools-install) (use-package org-noter) 
 But unlike in the video (timestamp1 timestamp2), my pdf-buffer does not highlight passages in the pdf that have annotations. Things I have tried to no avail:
  
looking into the the maintainer&#x27;s emacs configuration, but nothing springs to my eye there.
 playing around with org-noter-highlight-selected-text as mentioned in this solved issue
 installing packages such as org-pdftools
  
Does anybody have an init.el with an org-noter setup that highlights pdfs, which they would be willing to share with me?

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently using protobuf-mode (https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/main/editors/protobuf-mode.el) and I want to solve some highlighting issues. I&#x27;m new to this so excuse me if my description is not accurate.
 The problem I have is with the following statement:
  syntax &#x3D; &quot;proto3&quot;; 
 Even though, in the mode, syntax is declared as a keyword (c-other-decl-kwds) it is not highlighted. My guess is that it is not declared in the right category because syntax &#x3D; &quot;proto3&quot;; is considered as an assignment in C/C++.
 Can anyone point me to the documentation to highlight syntax in this case but only if its followed by &#x3D; &quot;proto3&quot;;? Also, I&#x27;d like to highlight in the same color as import if possible, is there a way to change the color?

                              <span>I have been thinking about how to build a distributed database and it seem like a reasonable idea, may be terrible, to store all data and relations in a distributed map. However, I have only seen information on distributed hash maps and not maps that group related data to a node or group of close nodes. Does something like this exist?
 If not, would a key comprised of group id, table id, time, and data hash organize the data in the map so that table queries could still run quickly and not have to search all machines for the randomly distributed records.
 Also, I am intending this to be distributed across less than a hundred nodes, not thousands.

And sometimes, a conversation sparks a magical moment where we can dive into an idea worth exploring. We&#x27;d love to hear more from you.  🫵🏼
Ideas I&#x27;m exploring with my ZK:
A mindset that revolves around the organization and clarity of thought processes in note-making. How notes are proxies for ideas, and if I want clarity in my ideas, I need clarity in my notes.
Again, with the mindset. Having a mindset that matches the challenge is the key to flourishing.

                              <span>This version brings some minor enhancements to Iron&#x27;s internals and API as well as support for another library: Borer.
 Main changes
 First order types support
 Iron now provides refinement methods for first order types:
 List(1, 2, 3).refineAllOption[Positive] //Some(List(1, 2, 3)): List[Int :| Positive] List(-1, 2, 3).refineAllOption[Positive] //None 
 Such methods exist for:
  
Imperative (refine/refineUnsafe)
 Option
 Either
 &quot;Further&quot; equivalents
  
Borer support
 Iron now supports Borer&#x27;s codec derivation:
 type Username &#x3D; String :| DescribedAs[Not[Blank], &quot;Username must not be blank&quot;] type Age &#x3D; Int :| DescribedAs[Positive, &quot;Age must be positive&quot;] case class User(name: String :| Not[Blank], age: Int :| Positive) derives Codec Json.decode(&quot;&quot;&quot;{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;hey&quot;,&quot;age&quot;:25}&quot;&quot;&quot;.getBytes).to[User] //Right(...) Json.decode(&quot;&quot;&quot;{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;age&quot;:25}&quot;&quot;&quot;.getBytes).to[User] //Left(ValidationFailure(&quot;Username must not be blank&quot;)) 
 Other changes
  
Gen/Arbitrary instances for types such as List[Int :| Positive] will not fail anymore, even for big sizes.
 refine is now deprecated in favor of refineUnsafe
 Upgraded doobie dependency to 1.0.0-RC5
 Minor changes to existing documentation
  
Adopters
 Marss was added to the list of adopters.

 ​
 title, I am working in a django repo and most classes have inheritances sometimes 8 levels deep and it is as good as impossible for me to have an understanding of what this class at point is capable of.
 ​
 thx

                              <span>AUCTeX (Emacs modes for LaTeX documents) adds metadata to the end of LaTeX files like this:
 %%% Local Variables: %%% TeX-master: &quot;master&quot; %%% End: 
 I&#x27;m slightly bothered by this. How portable is this syntax when the same LaTeX file is opened by a different IDE, such as VSCode, TeXLive or (cloud-based) Overleaf? This is a concern when collaborating with others on editing a LaTeX file.
 Is it possible for the original LaTeX file to be untouched, while saving the &quot;local variable&quot; information in a different place for AUCTeX to access?

                              <span>For quite some time I&#x27;ve had electric-pair-inhibit-predicate set to electric-pair-conservative-inhibit, which prevents the automatic insertion of closing delimiters in certain situations—even when electric-pair-mode is active.
 Recently I tried to get to the bottom of what this actually does, in case I wanted to further tweak its behavior. Unfortunately, I&#x27;ve found myself a little confused by some small things.
 The documentation for electric-pair-inhibit-predicate states
  
The function is called with a single char (the opening char just inserted). If it returns non-nil, then electric-pair-mode will not insert a matching closer.
  
The source code for electric-pair-conservative-inhibit is
 (defun electric-pair-conservative-inhibit (char) (or ;; I find it more often preferable not to pair when the ;; same char is next. (eq char (char-after)) ;; Don&#x27;t pair up when we insert the second of &quot;&quot; or of ((. (and (eq char (char-before)) (eq char (char-before (1- (point))))) ;; I also find it often preferable not to pair next to a word. (eq (char-syntax (following-char)) ?w))) 
 I find this code a little confusing and am left with a few small questions.
  
Is there any difference between calling (char-after) and (following-char) in the context of this function?
 
Inside the and, why is it tested that char is equal to (char-before)? If char was just inserted, then I would imagine that this will just always be true.

 But still EGLOT never managed to be able to connect to it,
 until
 For Python, I just installed pylsp, changed my config to use it, and suddenly EGLOT was able to connect! prompting both servers, I chose pylsp and it works well, and even has the module functions when you import them in the popup. I shutdown the server and chose the pyright option and was disconnected after connecting (RIP).
 I did the same thing for clangd and installed a newer version of it, likewise, EGLOT managed to conenct.
 Moral of the story? Update your LSP&#x27;s or just install a different one? :P
 I just need to get external libraries for C to be recognised by Company and then I&#x27;m good.

                              <span>In order to improve my geek chops I have obtained a compact keyboard with no function, arrow keys and PageUp/PageUp/Home group and the going is getting tough, but I&#x27;m sure I will get there.
 One of my problems now in Emacs is to navigate up and down the M-x list which usually involves the up and down arrow keys. Those keys are available by using the function key in combination with the others, and also with the help of the mouse in GUI programs like this browser, but that is CHEATING.
 What are the native Emacs keys for that?
 Are there some cheatsheets that can help with these keyboards, for both regular emacs and evil-mode?
 I&#x27;m mostly an evil person, but having to switch to normal mode to navigate makes learning those Emacs key combinations worthwhile.

                              <span>This has been a problem for me ever since I started using it. I press C-c C-w for example, and it says it&#x27;s not defined. I have to switch to the treemacs window first before I can do that.
 In some rare cases, even when I click on the Treemacs window, it&#x27;s not actually active. I wasn&#x27;t able to reproduce this.
 I can&#x27;t seem to be able to remember which window I&#x27;m actually on since I keep switching between them often I keep forgetting to check the statusbar to verify which window is actually active. Even when I&#x27;m trying to write code, sometimes I forget whether I&#x27;m in Insert or Normal mode and there seems to be some other mode sometimes that I can&#x27;t get out of and when I type ESC, it takes that as part of a new macro. After trying it frustratingly, I manage to get back to the mode where I can actually start typing.
 Even having to check the statusbar every time before I need to do something does not seem correct to me. Is this what everybody does or am I missing something fundamental?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve started experimenting with the javascript framework Astro. 
 Astro templates have their own file extension: .astro.
 Unsurprisingly, by default emacs doesn&#x27;t know anything .astro files. 
 I can load web-mode for .astro files.
 .asto files seem to combine css and js.
 This would seem to make it suitable to use with web-mode.
 This seems to give me syntax highlighting and indentation. 
 It&#x27;d be great to get completions. 
 Over the last few months I&#x27;ve been using lsp-mode for completions.
 But because my lisp knowledge is limited, I&#x27;m reliant on finding snippets online for configuring lsp-mode.
 Do any emacs&#x27;ers here use astro?
 If so, what does your configuration look like?

                              <span>Hello,
 I&#x27;m struggling with setting up an org-roam capture template that adds notes to a single, pre-defined file as org-mode headers instead of saving each note as a separate file.
 ​
 The following tests write the note into a file of my choosing, but the properties drawer with the ID is placed at the top of the file, not under the created header.
 Test 1:
 (add-to-list &#x27;org-roam-capture-templates &#x27;(&quot;a&quot; &quot;test&quot; entry &quot;* ${title}&quot; :if-new (file &quot;/mypath/myfile.org&quot;))) 
 ​
 Test 2:
 (add-to-list &#x27;org-roam-capture-templates &#x27;(&quot;a&quot; &quot;test&quot; entry &quot;* ${title}&quot; :if-new (file+head &quot;/mypath/myfile.org&quot; &quot;#+title: ${title}\n&quot;))) 
 ​
 Test 3:
 (add-to-list &#x27;org-roam-capture-templates &#x27;(&quot;a&quot; &quot;test&quot; plain &quot;* ${title}&quot; :if-new (file+head &quot;/mypath/myfile.org&quot; &quot;#+title: ${title}\n&quot;))) 
 ​
 This test is adapted from https://systemcrafters.net/build-a-second-brain-in-emacs/keep-a-journal/ and will create a header with the properties drawer + ID - but that will always stay the top header of the file. Subsequent captures are placed within the same file but without property drawer and ID:
 (add-to-list &#x27;org-roam-capture-templates &#x27;(&quot;a&quot; &quot;test&quot; plain &quot;* ${title}&quot; :if-new (file+head+olp &quot;/mypath/myfile.org&quot; &quot;#+title: ${title}\n&quot; (&quot;${title}&quot;)))) 
 ​
 I&#x27;m currently making things work using regular org-mode capture templates. But I&#x27;d rather use org-roam capture templates so I can create new notes on the fly when searching for notes and finding they don&#x27;t exist yet.
 ​
 Any ideas what else I can try to get this to work?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been attempting The One Billion Row Challenge in Haskell and my current solution is embarrassingly slow, taking roughly 6m15s. I&#x27;m still trying to eke out single-threaded performance for now, and I&#x27;m constraining myself to GHC boot packages (although I think &#x60;async&#x60; and &#x60;parallel&#x60; would probably be in the spirit of the challenge). With profiling it seems like currently most of my time is spent inserting into a Set in order to keep the weather station names sorted, but I don&#x27;t know how to do better. Does anyone have advice and/or suggestions for how to optimise my solution?
 Edit: I optimised set insertion and now it&#x27;s no longer the bottleneck, the new runtime is 3m20s:

 I was wondering if there are any conventions for the org filetree structure.
 Do you all just make directories and files randomly or how do i do this? All in one directory, or several for different topics, or do you even put everything in one file?

                              <span>Okay, I&#x27;ve finally gotten around to setting up emacs-lsp-booster, and my first impression is: it works. And it works really well. I already liked LSP-Mode in general, but it was too slow for my very large Unreal project. I&#x27;d get constant timeouts, suggestions and completions just outright wouldn&#x27;t work, and it was a very disappointing experience.
 I switched to LSP-Bridge because it promised better performance, and that was 100% true. It did completions where LSP-Mode and Eglot would choke, but it was a bit of a hassle to set up. I&#x27;m on a Windows machine and that always makes things a little more complicated for me. I had to make sure to write a project-root-finding-function or it wouldn&#x27;t understand my project setup (devs: not everyone uses git, stop assuming that we do), etc.
 Ultimately, I&#x27;m switching back to LSP-Mode because it integrates with xref and helm and various other things a lot better. The LSP-Bridge built-in completion is adequate, but it worked in ways that I wasn&#x27;t expecting/didn&#x27;t like (the lsp-bridge-find-references function, for example, would split the buffer, and when I quit it, sometimes it would kill the buffer I&#x27;d been visiting as well. User error? A bug? Don&#x27;t know.) You just end up having more flexibility with lsp-mode.
 What I can tell you is that no matter how you slice it, for a project of moderate to large size, you should be using something like lsp-bridge or emacs-lsp-booster. (For reference, based on my compile-commands.json file, there are about 17000 files in my project.)
 Also, it seems that the root of this problem is emacs&#x27; ability (or lack thereof) to parse JSON efficiently. That really should be looked at; emacs-lsp-booster is a project that shouldn&#x27;t have to exist, but I&#x27;m grateful that it does.

                              <span>Have used Emacs as my daily-driver text editor for years now, but always on Linux systems. Setting it up now on my work laptop (a Mac) and having difficulty getting it to launch the way I want. If I try to run it from the terminal with the plain old emacs command, I run into the problem described here. The stty -tostop suggestion didn&#x27;t work. However, elsewhere I found the suggestion to directly invoke the application from its installation directory, e.g. /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs.
 This solves the &#x27;suspended output&#x27; issue and does indeed launch a GUI Emacs session. However, if I attempt to do this with the --init-directory flag, it fails to load the specified init.el and Emacs greets me with an &#x27;unknown option&#x27; error. On the other hand, if I run Emacs in the foreground in the terminal, the --init-directory flag works and it sets up (as much as possible) according to the specified init.el file. I&#x27;m running version 29.2
 Does anyone know how to get this to work?

                              <span>One solution to wrapping tables in the buffer is to use org-table-wrap-functions to wrap cell contents of an org table. The issue with this is that the wrapped text will be recognized as different cells when exporting to latex, and does not look the best. Would it be possible for me to define a special character sequence and an use an export filter such that if I have one of these manually inserted line breaks, that on export, the filter will essentially use a temporary buffer, search for these sequences, rejoin the cells affected, and remove the escape sequences? If so, what would be the best way to do this? Thanks.

                              <span>Hello, I&#x27;m trying to configure polymode for Databricks notebooks. They are text files that have their content like this for some NotebookExample.sql :
 -- Databricks notebook source -- MAGIC %python -- MAGIC print(&quot;Hello&quot;) -- MAGIC print(&quot;World&quot;) -- COMMAND SELECT 1 FROM table 
 I&#x27;ve tried to replicate the configuration from their documentation and got to this:
 (use-package polymode :straight t :config (define-hostmode poly-databricks-hostmode :mode &#x27;sql-mode) (define-innermode poly-python-databricks-innermode :mode &#x27;python-mode :head-matcher &quot;-- MAGIC &quot; :tail-matcher &quot;-- COMMAND &quot; :head-mode &#x27;host :tail-mode &#x27;host) (define-polymode poly-databricks-mode :hostmode &#x27;poly-databricks-hostmode :innermodes &#x27;(poly-python-databricks-innermode) ) ) 
 But this is not working as expected because from my investigations it expects to have some closed block. Like on this (another great one from u/mickeyp) post https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/polymode-multiple-major-modes-how-to-use-sql-python-in-one-buffer where the SQL code is contained with a well delimited piece of code between the:
 r&quot;&quot;&quot; CODE &quot;&quot;&quot; 
 Anyone knows if there&#x27;s a way to make it ignore the &quot;--MAGIC&quot; markers between the beginning and the end? I also tried the indent option but it seems to just work with whitespace.
 Thanks

                              <span>Hi, I have a feature in mind that I can&#x27;t find, but am also struggling to articulate, so I&#x27;m still not sure if it exists or not!
 I&#x27;m thinking of something like literate programming, but without tangling, as the source code lives in files separately from the text. Instead of source blocks containing code in the literate document, the literate document instead specifies &quot;views&quot; into the source files. The views would be specified by a file name and a line number range, and that range of lines would be visible in the literate buffer as if that was where the text lived, but it actually lives in its own source file.
 So on-disk this &quot;view src block&quot; might look like this:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 +begin_view :file src/main.rs :lines 120-124
 +end_view
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Whereas in the emacs buffer it might look like this:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 +begin_view :file src/main.rs :lines 120-124
 let rectangle &#x3D; Rectangle { length: 3.0, height: 4.0 }; let triangle &#x3D; Triangle { length: 3.0, height: 4.0 }; print_debug(&amp;rectangle); println!(&quot;Area: {}&quot;, area(&amp;rectangle));
 +end_view
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Editing text within this view would be propagated back to the source file, and adding a newline at the end of the view would increment the end of the line range.
 The motivations for this would be avoiding problems with eglot/lsp in an org document for example, or a document explaining some bits of code in detail, without committing to the full literate workflow.
 Does this have a name and does anyone know of any implementations of something similar to this? If not, does anyone have any insight into how hard this would be to achieve in emacs?

 I&#x27;ve been using emacs for some time now so, in that regard I&#x27;m not so new. I learned a couple of things about elisp in that time. However the creation of a major mode and a package development is completely new to me. I would appreciate first of all some general feedback and constructive criticism on my code and good practices.
 Also I&#x27;d like to ask if somebody here (or maybe there&#x27;s a forum for that) would be open to give me advice from time to time. My references are usually the emacs lisp manual and internet search (i.e., emacs.stackexchange.com) but sometimes is difficult to find the exact info that you need, or the good practices or conventions. I&#x27;d appreciate if I could ask from time to time and get an experienced opinion and/or at least a good reference to solve particular problems.
 Any ideas, pointers or comments are welcome.

                              <span>I have been a happy user of project.el for a while. I also like monorepos, and I&#x27;m glad to say that the support for them is good in project.el. One thing that I haven&#x27;t figured out, is how to use project.el on projects outside of version control. I&#x27;d like to ask how I could fill that gap.
 For monorepo support, I have the following config, which probably looks straightforward to most of you.
 (defun common-lisp-project-p (dir) (directory-files dir nil &quot;.*.asd$&quot;)) (defvar monorepo-root-markers &#x27;(&quot;package.json&quot; &quot;mix.exs&quot; common-lisp-project-p)) (defun monorepo-try-find-project (dir) (when (file-exists-p dir) (let* ((root (seq-some (lambda (root-marker) (locate-dominating-file dir root-marker)) monorepo-root-markers)) (vc-backend (ignore-errors (vc-responsible-backend root)))) ;; I require a vc-backend, otherwise things break (when (and root vc-backend) (list &#x27;vc vc-backend root))))) (setq project-find-functions &#x27;(monorepo-try-find-project project-try-vc)) 
 The problem is simply that this only works for projects under version control.
 How do people deal with this while using project.el?

                              <span>I am somewhat of a novice when it comes to org mode and elisp. I&#x27;m trying to write a code block that can generate a table that is formatted in a particular way when exported as a pdf.
 Manually I can get the result I want by doing this.
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; |---+-----+-----+-----| | | foo | bar | baz | |---+-----+-----+-----| | / |  |  |  | | |  |  |  | | | 1 | a | b | | | 2 | c | d | |---+-----+-----+-----|
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 However when trying to generate the table with a code block it doesn&#x27;t output the line with the /.
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 +BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :exports results :results value table
 &#x27;( hline (&quot;&quot; &quot;foo&quot; &quot;bar&quot; &quot;baz&quot;) hline (&quot;#&quot; &quot;&quot; &quot;&quot; &quot;&quot;) (&quot;/&quot; &quot;&quot; &quot;&quot; &quot;&quot;) (&quot;#&quot; &quot;1&quot; a b) (&quot;#&quot; &quot;2&quot; c d) hline 
 )
 +END_SRC
 +RESULTS:
 |-----+-----+-----| | foo | bar | baz | |-----+-----+-----| |  |  |  | | 1 | a | b | | 2 | c | d | |-----+-----+-----|
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 What is the best way to generate the table I created manually?

                              <span>I have been trying really hard to set up Emacs for front-end web development. After a lot of trial and error I finally got the major stuff working (snippets, autocomplete, syntax checking). To do this I had to install several packages and also add some elisp to my .emacs as mentioned on the websites of those packages.
 If i need to replicate this configuration later, maybe on another machine, how can I do it easily without having to go Googling again? Like is there some code to ensure that if a particular package is not found it will be installed automatically by Emacs, so the elisp in the .emacs that deals with this package wont throw an error? I do keep a record of my .emacs in my GitHub
 I don&#x27;t know how to put this in a better way, but I just want to be able to replicate this configuration with another emacs installation without the same amount of effort.

                              <span>Hey, I&#x27;m trying to go through Crafting Interpreters (parsing chapter) using Scala and somehow I&#x27;m messing up the direct instructions. I&#x27;ve finished the parser, but every time I use the REPL it just gives me this kind of stuff:
 &gt; 2+2 [line 1] Error: Expect expression. &gt; &quot;yes&quot; [line 1] Error: Expect expression. &gt; [line 1] Error: Expect expression. &gt; true [line 1] Error: Expect expression. &gt; 
 I&#x27;ve been going through my code trying to fix it and I honestly can NOT figure out what I did wrong. I hate to just ask to look through my entire page of code and find out but idk what I&#x27;m missing, and I imagine a lot of people here have read the book too... I haven&#x27;t used Scala before this so please bear with my non-idiomatic/bad code lmao. I was mostly just trying to do what the book did without much deviation.
 Here&#x27;s my Parser &amp; Expression files, which I think are the culprits:
 Parser – https://pastes.io/3cx3m2y8bx
 Expression – https://pastes.io/xyqhkan7ql

                              <span>I am still evaluating Scala 3 and decide to do a small imperative project (i.e. drawing a triangle with LWJGL). I immediately got bitten when I accidentally ignored a Try[Unit] and it swallowed an exception without warning:
 scala Using.Manager: use &#x3D;&gt; //... some code that threw an exception // ^-- return value not used! 
 That I forgot to handle the Try did not generate any warning, and the ignored error caused bugs in a completely different place. This sounds pretty dangerous and I think there must be a way to avoid it. Am I missing some design patterns here?

                              <span>Hi all - just wanted to share a library I&#x27;ve been working on for a while. I love using Tidal but I have not found it very easy to take the source apart to target backends other than SuperDirt/OSC. For this reason, I have been working on minipat, which is largely Tidal-compatible but hopefully makes it easy to add new backends! Currently, there are two - SuperDirt and MIDI. If anyone is interested, I would love some help adding backends for DAWs like Bitwig or Renoise, turning the system into a tool for rapid composition. Anyway, check it out if you are interested. Contributions welcome. Thanks!

                              <span>I am writing a toy program.. it takes a string say &quot;tom&quot; and splits it into individual characters and gives out the following data 
 t &#x3D; thriving o &#x3D; ornate m &#x3D; mad here the adjectives thriving, ornate and mad are stored in a data structure as key value pairs eg: (&#x27;a&#x27; , &quot;awesome&quot;) 
 The issue i have is when a string has the same characters, the same adjective gets repeated and i don&#x27;t want repetitions. 
 eg:- if i give the name sebastian, the adjectives &quot;serene&quot; and &quot;awesome&quot; is repeated twice.. which i don&#x27;t want..
 It should select another adjective for the letters s and a ? How do i do that? Should i add more data structures? How do i move from one to another so as to avoid repetitions? 
 I am reproducing the code done till now below 
 ​
 -- Main.hs module Main where import qualified Data.Map as Map -- Define a map containing key-value pairs of alphabets and their values alphabetMap :: Map.Map Char String alphabetMap &#x3D; Map.fromList [ (&#x27;a&#x27;, &quot;awesome&quot;), (&#x27;b&#x27;, &quot;beautiful&quot;), (&#x27;c&#x27;, &quot;creative&quot;), (&#x27;d&#x27;, &quot;delightful&quot;), (&#x27;e&#x27;, &quot;energetic&quot;), (&#x27;f&#x27;, &quot;friendly&quot;), (&#x27;g&#x27;, &quot;graceful&quot;), (&#x27;h&#x27;, &quot;happy&quot;), (&#x27;i&#x27;, &quot;innovative&quot;), (&#x27;j&#x27;, &quot;joyful&quot;), (&#x27;k&#x27;, &quot;kind&quot;), (&#x27;l&#x27;, &quot;lovely&quot;), (&#x27;m&#x27;, &quot;mad&quot;), (&#x27;n&#x27;, &quot;nice&quot;), (&#x27;o&#x27;, &quot;ornate&quot;), (&#x27;p&#x27;, &quot;peaceful&quot;), (&#x27;q&#x27;, &quot;quiet&quot;), (&#x27;r&#x27;, &quot;radiant&quot;), (&#x27;s&#x27;, &quot;serene&quot;), (&#x27;t&#x27;, &quot;thriving&quot;), (&#x27;u&#x27;, &quot;unique&quot;), (&#x27;v&#x27;, &quot;vibrant&quot;), (&#x27;w&#x27;, &quot;wonderful&quot;), (&#x27;x&#x27;, &quot;xenial&quot;), (&#x27;y&#x27;, &quot;youthful&quot;), (&#x27;z&#x27;, &quot;zealous&quot;) ] -- Function to look up a character in the map and return its value lookupChar :: Char -&gt; String lookupChar char &#x3D; case Map.lookup char alphabetMap of Just val -&gt; val Nothing -&gt; &quot;Unknown&quot; -- Function to split a string into characters and look up their values lookupString :: String -&gt; [String] lookupString str &#x3D; map lookupChar str main :: IO () main &#x3D; do putStrLn &quot;Enter a string:&quot; input &lt;- getLine let result &#x3D; lookupString input putStrLn &quot;Result:&quot; mapM_ putStrLn result

                              <span>Hi all, newcomer here. 
 I am a technical consultant in IT. Currently I have a lot of client projects running in parallel. Every client case I log meticulously in Orgmode and it gives me and my clients a lot of comfort. Also the end product is plain text and I can store it on every knowledge repository they use. I think it upgraded me as a professional. Being organized to the max goes a long way. 
 I’m totally hooked! Orgmode is addictive! 
 2 questions: - I use doom emacs, some orgmode packages and Org Agenda. Are there any more cool packages I should know about? - ODT exports are ugly. Weird line splits. I know about using templates but is there a simple way to make them more usable out of the box?

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to migrate all Markdown files from Obsidian to org mode but but also keep the linking between files working. Anyone that has done that could point me in the right direction?
 Thanks

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I am a computer science student and one of my future lesson is on contribution to open source software. I&#x27;ve been using Emacs for 3 years now, and I always wanted to deep into Elisp. Moreover, I discovered the functional language Coq last year, and I&#x27;ve become fond of it.
 Linking those two, I&#x27;d like to contribute to Proof General, the interface for proof assistants and especially for Coq inside Emacs. Do you have any advice on how to start ? i.e how to get enough knowledge on the software, getting in touch with contributors, general manners...
 Thanks in advance !

                              <span>hi
 ​
 I have a basic question about &#x60;embark-export&#x60;
 ​
 So i can run &#x60;consult-ripgrep&#x60; and export the results using &#x60;embark-export&#x60; 
 ​
 I can modify in the exported buffer and they get reflected. 
 ​
 But i am not able to find a way to filter further or delete the result from the exported buffer.
 ​
 How do i filter the exported results further ?
 ​
 TIA

                              <span>It’s annoying to org-agenda-switch-to every time I want to adjust a clock. The clock is shown in the agenda buffer and said function jumps straight to where it is. I don’t want to make some weird custom function for something I think we could use in vanilla org mode.
 Does anyone know about something like this? Do you guys experience this same problem adjusting clocks?

 When I try to print names of faces for selected texts I get something like:

 How can I change value for black color? It is barely visible on dark background.

 I tried setting &#x60;(setq forge-notifications-selection &#x27;(unread))&#x60;, but it always seems to attempte load 400 pages but fails eventually.
 There are about 21000 &quot;done&quot; notifications and a few hundred unread. 
 Why are read notifications fetched at all (by default)?

                              <span>Okay, so first of all, I think it is super interesting that the shell utilities like find, ls, grep, etc. are all implemented in Eshell.
 I just don&#x27;t understand why. The native binaries are gonna be faster so what was achieved from doing a reimplementation of these utilities in Lisp? I asked ChatGPT about this and it says this enables deep integration between the shell and emacs. But, what does that even mean? Whether I type ls or grep as a shell command or the lisp version of it, the output is the same anyway. So what kind of integration are we talking about?
 I&#x27;m coming from the vim world and just been using Emacs since a few days. So I&#x27;m trying to understand it. I&#x27;m really curious what people actually do in Eshell that the other shells can&#x27;t do.
 EDIT: Got some great, insightful answers. I&#x27;m glad I asked this. Clearly there&#x27;s a lot for me to learn. This is gonna be a fun journey. Thank you everyone!

                              <span>Hello fellow emacsers,
 A question that I could not find an answer to so far is how one can expand/raise minibuffer window in emacs in a similar fashion to vim when you press &#x60;C-f&#x60; during a command. This will raise the command line prompt, allowing you to edit it with usual vim keys. An equivalent in emacs would remove the need to have copied (yanked) a long text for the prompt and paste it in the minibuffer.

 vim command-line window allows you to use vim keys when entering a command

 I know of &#x60;flymake-show-project-diagnostics&#x60;, but I prefer the ux of grouping errors by file. Does flymake have a different &quot;frontend&quot; that&#x27;s more tree-based?

                              <span>Hi, everyone. I wanted to post a quick tip to help other noobs like myself. I love org-capture, but I sometimes want to make a completely new file out of quick note, rather than append it to an existing org-mode file. I searched and only found outdated or kind of hard-to-understand answers. So here is a quick snippet to put into your init.el and capture templates to enable creating a new file. 
 (defun jj/open-new-project-file () (let ((fpath (read-file-name &quot;File name: &quot; &quot;~/Sync/inbox/&quot; nil nil nil))) 
 As prescribed in the org docs, this creates a new function that will prompt you for a file name to create, starting in the directory you specify in the function. Then, in your org-capture templates add:
 (&quot;i&quot; &quot;New note in Inbox&quot; plain (function jj/open-new-project-file) &quot;#+title: %?&quot;) 
 This will use your function to create the file and set your cursor ready to type the title in your new org file.
 ​
 I hope this helps someone. I know most people would probably just append to an inbox.org file or similar. I was doing the same thing, but after reading Building a Second Brain, I&#x27;m trying to separate the notes into files that can be dragged-and-dropped via Treemacs into the PARA setup I&#x27;ve made. It&#x27;s a little simpler than trying to use org-refile because in the PARA method, your directories are constantly changing and moving.
 ​
 This solution was heavily inspired by this post: https://www.jesseevers.com/org-capture-function/
 I just modified it to fit my own use case and thought someone searching on Google in the future might appreciate it. Cheers!

 I am using doom emacs and enable the latex language module and setup everything else, anyways, I am not sure how to use Latex in emacs, so I was wondering if you know of good instructions on how to do this correctly, and for my case I am not sure if I should go with org mode as well, because I have never used it, thanks for the help.

                              <span>Hello! I am an org-mode newbie and am having trouble getting a usable configuration set up. I am using Doom Emacs and have installed org-modern as well. I think there may be some problems with how they integrate together as the style is broken in agenda mode.
 The warning shown below occurs any time my cursor goes over any headings such as &quot;Important&quot; or &quot;Habits&quot; and gets stuck. I have to use my mouse or error keys to get off the heading line.
 I&#x27;m not sure how I would go about debugging this as I&#x27;m not getting any warnings or errors that gives me any real information. Does anyone have any tips to try to get more information?
 Here is my org-super-agenda part of the config
 (setq org-agenda-skip-deadline-if-done t org-agenda-include-deadlines nil org-agenda-block-separator nil org-agenda-compact-blocks t org-agenda-start-day nil ;; i.e. today org-agenda-span 1 org-agenda-start-on-weekday nil org-super-agenda-groups &#x27;(;; Each group has an implicit boolean OR operator between its selectors. (:name &quot;Important&quot; ; Optionally specify section name :todo &quot;TODAY&quot; :tag &quot;bills&quot; :priority &quot;A&quot;) (:name &quot;Habits&quot; ; Optionally specify section name :todo &quot;TODAY&quot; :habit t) (:name &quot;Errands&quot; :todo &quot;TODAY&quot; :tag &quot;errand&quot;) (:name &quot;Media&quot; :todo (&quot;TO-READ&quot; &quot;TO-WATCH&quot; &quot;WATCHING&quot;)) (:name &quot;Other&quot; :priority&lt;&#x3D; &quot;B&quot;))) (org-super-agenda-mode)

 Is there even an equivalent? Do I have to mix two styles to get some local variables?

                              <span>Happy to announce the release of Apache Pekko 1.0.3-M1! Ordinarily I wouldn&#x27;t make an announcement for a patch release but this one is special because the major headline change is the capability to migrate from Akka to Pekko clusters as a rolling upgrade (see https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/PEKKO/Pekko+Akka+Compatibility). This is also why its a milestone release, we wan&#x27;t people to test this functionality out before making a full release.
 For more details on the release please see https://pekko.apache.org/docs/pekko/1.0/release-notes/index.html#1-0-3-m1

                              <span>I might be missing something very obvious here. I am learning Scala 3 and trying to do a test project (last experience with scala was 2.11). However, I notice that while the project is using Scala 3, build.sbt itself seems to support only Scala 2.
 Does sbt still only runs on scala 2? It feels very strange to use two different versions of the same language for the build system and the main project.
 I also see scala-cli, but I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s powerful enough to handle platform-specific dependencies like lwjgl.

                              <span>Hi,
 Is there a way to get a Haskell toolchain that just works? I&#x27;ve got sour experience with Haskell from the Linux repos (Arch). It&#x27;s huge, unwieldy and is apt to turn into a brick on update (if it used to work before the update).
 https://hub.docker.com/r/fpco/stack-build/
 This one is much better. Ideal, I&#x27;d say, if it weren&#x27;t for Docker :) . Several years ago I&#x27;ve seen a project on GitHub dedicated exactly to this purpose: A Haskell Toolchain that Just Works. Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t remember the name of the project, and can&#x27;t find it.
 The OS is Linux. Any suggestion is welcome.

GHC 9.8.2 is now available by Zubin Duggal

More QualifiedDo examples by Oleg Grenrus
Qualified do-notation, QualifiedDo, is a nice syntactical extension in GHC. Probably its best property is that it changes semantics only locally, by using explicit “annotation”: by qualifying the do keyword. This means that enabling the extension doesn’t change meaning of other &amp; existing code.

                              <span>I thought I was going to be able to read 3 books in tandem but my circumstances taught me the lesson that I will not be able to do that.
This month I wanted to read Meditations, Effective Notetaking and The Stand by Stephen King.
I usually read novels before I go to sleep, it’s the habit I use to replace the use of my phone before bed. To try to improve my english I usually read while following the audiobook (I don’t even know if it’s useful though, but I like it). Novels and other kind of fiction content is the only one I hear with an audiobook.
I read nonfiction mainly two times a day, at breakfast and when I eat my lunch with a 30 min timer to remind me when my reading session is over. I carry my pencil with me everywhere so that I can also read if I find myself waiting for someone, in …</span>

                              <span>Tweag developed rules_nixpkgs to empower Bazel users with the ability to leverage
Nix’s reproducible builds and its extensive package registry. That ruleset has proven to be
especially advantageous in endeavors demanding intricate dependency administration and the
maintenance of uniform build environments.
However, rules_nixpkgs is incompatible with remote execution. This is a major limitation given that remote
execution is possibly the main reason why people switch to Bazel. And that rules_nixpkgs provides a great way to configure hermetic toolchains, which are an important ingredient for reliable remote execution. There is no trivial fix as
can be seen in the related, longstanding open issue. At Tweag we
investigated a promising solution presented at Bazel eXchange 2022 (recording), but …</span>

 I&#x27;ve opened a php buffer and enabled lsp-mode.
 Now, after a type a few characters the Warnings buffer pops up. 
 This is intrusive and unneccessary.
 How can I stop this from happening? 
 I&#x27;m using Emacs 29.2 on linux.

                              <span>The immense popularity of org-mode is completely justified, but I would like to caution new users against starting their Emacs journey by creating their configuration file in org-mode.
 Because that approach is useful when we want to comment code extensively, elaborate on the reasons behind specific settings in the configuration.
 This is particularly relevant when the configuration is complex or when creating tutorials for others.
 A great example of such configuration is https://protesilaos.com/emacs/dotemacs.
 However, these needs do not apply to beginners or even moderately advanced users.
 And these functionalities come with significant costs:
  
Increased difficulty and complexity
 Increased boilerplate with +begin/end src blocks
 Complicates debugging

                              <span>So my vanilla GNU Emacs (no Doom, no Spacemacs, etc) with catppuccin-theme looks like [see image below] when looking at my home directory, which isn&#x27;t very cool. It looks decent enough when actually editing text, but the bland white colours when browsing directories just doesn&#x27;t do it for me. The catppuccin/emacs git promised me this, and mine looks nothing like that. Probably because the example uses Doom, which I don&#x27;t like and I&#x27;m not willing to use.

                              <span>When you look at a consult/marginalia mini buffer, the right hand column are descriptions of the item in the list. So if you look at the ctl-x-map variable in the mini buffer it says
 Default keymap for C-x commands.
 Is there a way to do an isearch or regex search of these descriptions from within the mini buffer? So that I can filter the list of candidates based on text in those descriptions, instead of the names of the commands/variables/functions/etc?
 I know you could embark export the list of candidates and then search them that way and that works with small lists but embark export does a lot of things in the buffer that I don&#x27;t always need. If I just want to find something, don&#x27;t know what it&#x27;s called but do have an idea of what it does, this could be a very helpful way of refining the list of candidates.

 (i don&#x27;t need full rss reader functionality, i just need to quicly browse feed url to understand format of feed entries, if there are new ones, etc (for programming purporses))

                              <span>I use both RefTeX and company-reftex for latex documents. For choosing the bibliographic reference, I much prefer company-reftex. But I like how C-c ] (reftex-citation) allows choosing from a list of citation formats (ditto for reftex-reference). The problem is that reftex-citation takes you to RefTeX&#x27;s mechanism for choosing the bibliographic reference, which is not company-reftex.
 So I am now doing this:
  ;; From my reftex-cite-format; for real, this is a longer list (defvar my-cite-options &#x27;(&quot;\\cite[][]{}&quot; &quot;\\citep[][]{}&quot; &quot;\\citealp[][]{}&quot; &quot;\\citep[][p.~]{}&quot;)) (defun my-cite-menu () &quot;Insert citation based on user choice.&quot; (interactive) (insert (completing-read &quot;Choose citation type: &quot; my-cite-options)) (backward-char) (company-complete)) ;; Preserve muscle memory (bind-key (kbd &quot;C-c [&quot;) &#x27;my-cite-menu reftex-mode-map) 
 (Same comments apply to reftex-reference, where I reuse my reftex-ref-style-alist, and create a my-reference-menu).
 This seems to me like the obvious solution because: a) it preserves muscle memory; b) I can reuse my lists of citation options and reference styles, and if I wanted to go back to a pure-reftex solution it would be simple; c) I can continue easily choosing structure; d) I use company-reftex; e) it seems simple enough.
 But I have not found anything similar when searching for it. I wonder if I am doing something silly, or reinventing a wheel (and ending up with a square wheel as a result, given my elisp ignorance).

                              <span>Recently, I&#x27;ve started using Emacs again, mainly because Emacs 29.2 has built-in eglot and treesit. I spent about a week configuring it to see if the current Emacs can achieve the smoothness of lsp code completion on par with Neovim.
 My system is a MacBook Pro M1 MAX, so there should be no problem with hardware performance.
 I am using emacs-plus@29 and have enabled nativecomp. Here are the parts related to lsp code completion and performance in my configuration, I did everything I can find to boost the performance but still not as fast as Neovim&#x27;s lsp (via gopls and rust-analyzer).
 Is there anything to improve?

 I use dape for debugging and plz to test an api.
 When you set a breakpoint in the api and you try to test this method with a request then the UI will be freeze...
 I think this is because both different thread try to use the same UI thread ...
 I don&#x27;t know it is an issue or just as designed and I can use the curl from console as well but I think it is a limitation if I think correctly.
 What do you think ?

 I&#x27;m using doom emacs, and I followed all the instructions to enable Latex in doom emacs, but, when I use gptel to query with gpt4all, whenever I query math equations it&#x27;s not showing up in the nice latex, so, any tips on how to get this working, so I can view the math and physics equations in a nice way. Thanks for the help.

 I am just dabbling into emacs and elisp code so please assume i have no idea what i am doing
 ​
 So i have a string of the form
 ​
 Exp pkt:req: (req_uvc::transaction@6094583) { response_expected: 0x0 txn_phase: TXN_PHASE_UNINITIALIZED begin_cycle: x end_cycle: x pd: { txn_id: 0xc54 resp_err: CHI_RSPERR_OK req_size: CHI_SIZE_32B resp: CHI_RSP_I opcode: CHI_DAT_NONCOPYBACKWRDATA tgt_id: 0xcc src_id: 0x25 } enable_a1: 0xx reset_: 0xx } 
 ​

 And i want to convert it into something like this 
 ​

And now I&#x27;m testing flyckeck Grammarly, it is better but the explanation of the issue with text is not helpful. My English is not perfect and I have problems understanding what to do to fix the grammar mistakes. Example:
  
The noun phrase first element seems to be missing a determiner before it. Consider adding an article.
  
I don&#x27;t understand what this hint suggests. The browser extension has a suggestion that you can click to fix the grammar mistakes. Does any Emacs mode have something similar? I thought that lsp mode use company mode to allow fixing grammar mistakes from dropdown menu, but I was told that the company mode only works with completion and doesn&#x27;t work with lsp-grammarly.
 I can fix mistakes by hand, but I need to have a list of fixes to apply. lsp-grammarly had even more cryptic hints &quot;Correct article usage&quot;. Those are only in browser extension but there is a proper grammar listed that I can apply.

 Hope you&#x27;re all doing awesome! I&#x27;m Jesse Amos, and I&#x27;m excited to announce that I&#x27;ve conquered the Haskell course (Haskell MOOC)! Now, I&#x27;m diving into a personal project and on the lookout for a mentor and buddy. I&#x27;d love to have someone I can hit up with questions as I tackle hurdles. Your wisdom and insights would be super valuable to me. Can&#x27;t wait to connect with someone willing to share their expertise. Thanks a million!

                              <span>So I am working on a web backend using scotty, and I would like the server to rebuild and restart whenever I change some file in the project. Its a cabal project not a stack one.
 How would one generally go about doing that?

                              <span>For the past years, I had to write encoders and decoders for a bunch of datatype files. In this time, a common theme was a separation between the encoder and the decoder part. While with some trickery, you can get a specification such as code &#x3D; Constructor  extractA  extractB to work for newtypes, I have never found a nice approach for ADTs that let me plug-and-play codes for field (without changing the type definitions, anyway. I know you can do some magic with an additional functor argument that you put in front of every field. Your mileage may vary).
 In any case, I found the state unsatisfactory and set out to find a solution and - to my own surprise - was successful. If you just want code here is a proof of concept on github. It even has a few comments and a nice README.

                              <span>Hi so im very new to haskell and i was wondering how do you fix the variable not in scope error.
 double x &#x3D; x + x
 quadruple x &#x3D; double (double x) 
 i know this is a very simple code, but when i try to run quadruple 2 in powershell, it just gives me an error of Variable not in scope: quadruple :: t0 -&gt; t. I still dont know what im doing wrong.

                              <span>Hi everyone, I&#x27;m a newbie in Haskell and just learned it for about a week. I got this error while trying to build a library.
 : error: panic! (the &#x27;impossible&#x27; happened) GHC version 9.6.4: Couldn&#x27;t find module Data.Type.Ord CallStack (from HasCallStack): panic, called at compiler/GHC/Utils/Error.hs:454:29 in ghc:GHC.Utils.Error 
 FYI, I&#x27;m using rules_haskell as builder and base-4.18.2.0.
 As I checked https://www.stackage.org/lts-22.12/package/base-4.18.2.0, this base does have Data.Type.Ord.
 I tried to downgrade the ghc version but it still didn&#x27;t fix this issue.

                              <span>This is my first time trying to edit files remotely using emacs. When trying to ssh into a remote server using C-x C-f /ssh:user@host:/path tramp hangs after the second colon and sometimes after pressing C-g will display in the minibuffer the message [Tramp: opening connection nil for user@host using ssh...failed]. I thought the issue might be that I was using windows, so I tried /plink:user@host:/path and got the same message, albeit without emacs hanging and it instead saying &quot;using plink...failed&quot;. The only person I&#x27;ve been able to find with the same problem is here https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/qnyv6r/tramp_is_unusable_in_the_latest_git_version/ and I&#x27;m not using mac so their solution doesn&#x27;t apply to me. Does anybody have any ideas for how to fix this?

My main issue is emacs presuming to create new windows when I do not want it to. I especially want all of my regular file buffers to always open in the same window. Does anyone have suggestions for controlling your windows? Are there any really good packages or dot-files I should be looking at to solve this issue?

                              <span>I am trying to use Nicholar Rougier&#x27;s &#x60;mu4e-dashboard-mode&#x60; (https://github.com/rougier/mu4e-dashboard). It was quite easy to use it, except for one small issue. Suppose I am in the dashboard and click or select “Inbox”. Now when I quit “Inbox” it goes the mu4e&#x27;s default (ugly) dashboard. How do I prevent that from happening and only use the dashboard from above?

                              <span>For anyone that&#x27;s interested. I have a debug template that works well for me running dap-mode for debugging rust with lldb. Here&#x27;s what works for me, including finding the target debug binary. I think the projectile functions could be replaced with LSP workspace variables/functions but this works for me so I haven&#x27;t tried.
 (add-hook &#x27;rustic-mode-hook (lambda () (dap-register-debug-template &quot;Rust LLDB Debug Configuration&quot; (list :type &quot;lldb-mi&quot; ;; Make sure the path to lldb-mi is in your path :request &quot;launch&quot; :name &quot;Rust::Run&quot; :MIMode &quot;lldb&quot; :target (concat (projectile-project-root) &quot;target/debug/&quot; (projectile-project-name)) ;; Requires that the rust project is a project in projectile :environment [] :cwd &quot;${workspaceFolder}&quot;))))

                              <span>I have been using go templ and htmx to write web server for a while. There is a templ-ts-mode for Emacs user to use. But the functionalities are so limited that it does not have HTML keyword completion. I tried to integrate web-mode or html-mode into it but no success. Both the source code of web-mode and html-mode are so complicated that I don&#x27;t even know where to find the auto-completion related functions.
 So I decided to do it my own way, with the help of built-in treesit, it was a fun and successful experience. I recommend more of you try out the treesit related stuffs. 
 Here is my blog post about it.

 I&#x27;m trying to get GPT4ALL working with the gptel package, after getting past some errors, now another error got thrown while trying to use gptel: could not parse http response?
 The gpt4all-chat gui works fine, but in emacs with gptel, it throws this error.
 I found a similar issue in the gptel repo, so I posted my issue there, if any of you would like to take a look, thanks.

                              <span>I just installed Fedora KDE and I&#x27;ve run into an embarrassing problem. Neither my terminal of choice (wezterm) nor Emacs can find my installation of nerd fonts. I installed them as per normal in ~/.local/share/fonts and they show up in the fonts section of the GUI appearance manager (and are completely usable in KDE). However, they can&#x27;t be found by wezterm or Emacs.
 Anyone had this problem before? I&#x27;ve never had an issue with openSUSE or Arch. 
 I&#x27;ve also installed them in /usr/share/fonts and of course ran sudo fc-cache -v.

                              <span>are there any good examples of specific tasks to compare these paradigms, especially ones where haskell is more convenient than imperative languages?

                              <span>By comparing the parser combinator implementation in the paper Parsec: Direct Style Monadic Parser Combinators For The Real World and the one actually used in the parsec library, I found they are quite different.
 The implementation in the paper defines the Parser type as follows
 type Parser a &#x3D; String → Consumed a data Consumed a &#x3D; Consumed (Reply a) | Empty (Reply a) data Reply a &#x3D; Ok a String | Error 
 The implementation in the parsec library uses
 newtype ParsecT s u m a &#x3D; ParsecT {unParser :: forall b . State s u -&gt; (a -&gt; State s u -&gt; ParseError -&gt; m b) -- consumed ok -&gt; (ParseError -&gt; m b) -- consumed err -&gt; (a -&gt; State s u -&gt; ParseError -&gt; m b) -- empty ok -&gt; (ParseError -&gt; m b) -- empty err -&gt; m b } 
 The latter uses a continuation-based approach instead of different constructors. I can see why it works. But until yesterday I did not know that this method had a formal name - &quot;church encoding&quot;.
 My question is
  
Why does church encoding improve the performance of parser combinators? Surely it avoids the &quot;wrapping&quot;/&quot;unwrapping&quot; data into/out of constructors. So the abstraction and application of lambdas must be cheaper, right?
 And how much? I haven&#x27;t found a paper describing refactoring of parser combinator libraries using church encoding and the benchmark comparison.

                              <span>I have been using org-roam for a while. But I have found its template system confusing.
 I think there are two use cases:
  
Creating a new node (for this the templates work well)
 
Adding data to an already existing node.
 
 The templates are also used when the user runs org-roam-node-find and the selected node-title does not exist. This is probably whey templates in org-roam behave very different than org templates.
 Last weekend I finally spent time and address some of these issues. The commits are here:
 https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam/compare/main...dmgerman:org-roam:main
 for example.The first template will only work when creating a new file (see :create-file). It will ask for the node-title and use it to create the file (the slug).
  (add-to-list &#x27;org-roam-capture-templates &#x60;(&quot;A&quot; &quot;area&quot; plain &quot;%?&quot; :target (file+head ,(eval (dmg-roam-build-path &quot;areas/${slug}.org&quot;)) ,(eval (dmg-roam-template &quot;plain.txt&quot;))) :create-file yes :unnarrowed t)) 
 If the path is provided, the user will not be asked for the destination. if the template has :create-file no, and the file does not exist, the capture will be aborted.
 In contrast, this template will ask for a node id, and then search for the &quot;Tasks&quot; header. node and node+olp will not create a new file.
  (add-to-list &#x27;org-roam-capture-templates &#x60;(&quot;t&quot; &quot;todo&quot; entry &quot;*** TODO %?\n%t\n%a\n\n%i&quot; :target (node+olp nil (&quot;Tasks&quot;)) :unnarrowed t)) 
 If the node id is provided, the user will NOT be asked for the node id.

                              <span>alphapapa&#x27;s org-ql package looks really nice.
 I&#x27;m looking for a good way to use it to &quot;filter&quot; an org buffer as explained below.
 The idea is:
 [input org buffer] --&gt;  --&gt; [new output org buffer]
  
Starting with some org buffer (the &quot;input&quot;)
 Produce a new &quot;filtered&quot; org buffer (the &quot;output&quot;)
 Where the &quot;filtered&quot; buffer would contain those nodes of the first org buffer which satisfied some &quot;matching&quot; criteria.
 The &quot;structure&quot; of the &quot;filtered&quot; buffer would be the same as the first org buffer, but with unmatched nodes effectively pruned.
 The matching criteria would ideally be based on alpha-papa&#x27;s nice org-ql package.
 The &quot;output&quot; is a new org buffer 
 not a sparse tree folding of the original buffer
 not an agenda view into the original buffer

 I am trying to install scala using courser but it cannot access the internet (work limitation) so it cannot get the json file that tells it what JVM I have or if one is installed. I have openJDK 8 installed and verified that when running java -version. Is there a way to use courser without the internet?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hi, I am trying to cache immutable maps(string keys and case class values ) to Hazlecast. I tried using old Hazlecast lib but it is giving errors as it was compatible with 3.12 version of Hazlecast not latest version. If I go with Java implementation I have to write my own serializaton implementations(I have 50+ maps to serialize). Is there any other way I can serialize so that I can store maps easily. I am using scala dotty.

                              <span>Hello! :-)
It is good practice to keep the titles of a Zettel short:
On the one hand, the task of writing a short title helps the learning process.
On the other hand, the visualization of the notes is better if the title is short.
However, my question is, do you know if there is a sweet spot for the length of a title?
In my case, I try to write titles of 80 characters or less (with the UUID included). I selected this quantity due to my background in programming, where it is recommended to limit code lines to 80 characters. In my experience, this length is a good challenge that helps both objectives (1) and (2).
But I am considering increasing it a bit: maybe 100 characters.
What maximum length for titles do you use?</span>

 initTails [] &#x3D;&#x3D; [] 
 or
 initTails [] &#x3D;&#x3D; [([],[])]

                              <span>Someone has to ask again the age old question: How is Dependent Haskell going? The last I&#x27;ve heard was from this Serokell post. Call it anxiety (and you would be right) but the community has been longing for dependent types for a long time and I&#x27;m no exception, lol.

 Do you have any resources ?
 EDIT Update &#x3D;&gt; Ok Update. The problem was only in the version 9.2.8.

                              <span>Suppose I have the following in my emacs config.
  (use-package general :config (general-create-definer leader-key :prefix leader-key-pfx) (general-create-definer local-leader-key :prefix local-leader-key-pfx)) 
 I could then use the above to create a binding in a specific key map (e.g., for emacs-lisp-mode) as follows.
  (local-leader-key :keymaps &#x27;emacs-lisp-mode-map &quot;e s&quot; &#x27;eval-surrounding-sexp) 
 I would like to group such bindings, for instance, based on the mode they affect.
 If I understand correctly, use-package could be used for arbitrary configurations and does not need to be tied to a specific package.
 So, I tried the following.
  (use-package emacs-lisp-mode :config (local-leader-key :keymaps &#x27;emacs-lisp-mode-map &quot;e s&quot; &#x27;eval-surrounding-sexp)) 
 Now, the settings do not take into effect when I open an elisp file or a buffer in emacs-lisp-mode.
 Could someone help me fix the config?

                              <span>Hi, I installed emacs in macOS (emacs-plus@29) and immediately noticed that the font rendering was a bit off, slightly darker or bolder than in other apps. For example, this is Source Code Pro (Regular 15) in VSCode (above) and in emacs (below):
 https://preview.redd.it/ctq8s69dyzkc1.png?width&#x3D;342&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;079e1ee0f334bf0a80516fd81ce8ff0123d75bbf
 Does emacs use a different font rendering engine than the rest of the system?
 I tried setting ns-use-thin-smoothing but found no difference in rendering.
 Thanks!

                              <span>On Friday I updated all my lsp language servers (I use ts-ls) and all my emacs packages, and now whenever I save it&#x27;s overwriting all my imports incorrectly; it&#x27;s also (stupidly) adding an emacs backup file to my &#x60;tsconfig.json&#x60; file. I&#x27;ve been looking at the lsp-mode documentation, but I can&#x27;t figure out how to disable code actions on save (and honestly, I&#x27;d rather keep that and just turn off whatever it&#x27;s trying to do to the imports, but I haven&#x27;t found a setting for that). I&#x27;ve also been looking at the configuration options on the ts-ls repo, but I&#x27;m unsure of how to set those through emacs-lsp, and couldn&#x27;t find any documentation on setting server-specific settings. 
 Here&#x27;s what it&#x27;s doing:

 #+name: sus-questionnaire-results #+caption: SUS Questionnaire Results #+attr_latex: :align l|r|r|r|r|r|r|r|r|r|r|l :font \fontspec{Noto Sans Condensed Light} | USER | Q1 | Q2 | Q3 | Q4 | Q5 | Q6 | Q7 | Q8 | Q9 | Q10 | SUS | |------+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+-----+------| | U1 | 5 | 2 | 2 | 1 | 3 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 60.0 | | U2 | 5 | 2 | 4 | 2 | 5 | 1 | 4 | 1 | 4 | 1 | 87.5 | | U3 | 5 | 2 | 4 | 1 | 4 | 2 | 4 | 1 | 4 | 3 | 80.0 | #+tblfm: $12&#x3D;&#x27;(ux:sus-calc-score-per-row &#x27;($2..$11));N 
 The SUS column is calculated for each row using the values from column 2 to 11. When the ‘N’ flag is used, all referenced elements are parsed as numbers and interpolated as Lisp numbers
 Here is the elisp function:
 (defun ux:sus-calc-score (lst) (let ((counter 0)) (mapcar (lambda (x) (setq counter (1+ counter)) (if (&#x3D; 0 (% counter 2)) (- 5 x) (1- x))) lst))) (defun ux:sus-calc-score-per-row (lst) (* (apply &#x27;+ (ux:sus-calc-score lst)) 2.5)) 
 Thats all!

                              <span>A while back i made a post on a different Problem where i mentioned this as well, but i&#x27;m not able to track this down. So i&#x27;m, once again, asking for help here.
 Basically, at a random point in time after starting emacs, it will create buffers named &quot;*emacs*&quot; in the background.
 https://preview.redd.it/sy147bu3mxkc1.png?width&#x3D;898&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;72f99a091f59e8332e2a1a067b2b2ad8eeff33ae
 They seem to be somehow related to me moving through files. I have only my init.el file open and moving up and down makes new buffers appear in that list. This isn&#x27;t consistent though. If i restart emacs, i can move through my init file just fine. And at some point, this just starts happening.
 Some of those buffers are empty, and some have just &quot;Lisp Expression:&quot; with nothing else written in them.
 I already tried stripping down my config and haven&#x27;t been able to track it down. I ripped the whole completion setup out, threw out treemacs and such, ran without all the eglot and language modes and tried without org and evil configuration. Nothing seems to help.
 Is there a hook or option i can use to get more information on how or by what those buffers are created? Maybe write a verbose log on those events or such? Although i&#x27;ve worked with emacs for quite some time, i seem to be pretty bad at configuring and troubleshooting it, so some hints would help me a lot here.
 If someone wants to look at my config, the current state is here: Dominik Schlack / Domacs · GitLab

                              <span>Hi 👋
 I&#x27;ve always had this problem and I want to see if someone can please help me: I have the following code in my config:
  ;; Set backup directory for files (setq backup-directory-alist &#x60;((&quot;.&quot; . ,(expand-file-name &quot;backups/&quot; user-emacs-directory)))) ;; Set auto-saves directory for buffers (make-directory (expand-file-name &quot;auto-saves/&quot; user-emacs-directory) t) (setq auto-save-list-file-prefix (expand-file-name &quot;auto-saves/sessions&quot; user-emacs-directory) auto-save-file-name-transforms &#x60;((&quot;.*&quot; ,(expand-file-name &quot;auto-saves/&quot; user-emacs-directory) t))) ;; Disable lock files - enable if they cause trouble while compiling ;; (setq create-lockfiles nil) ;; Set directory for temp projectile and lsp files (setq projectile-known-projects-file (expand-file-name &quot;tmp/projectile-bookmarks.eld&quot; user-emacs-directory) lsp-session-file (expand-file-name &quot;tmp/.lsp-session.v1&quot; user-emacs-directory)) ;; Make backups to backup directory (setq backup-by-copying t delete-old-versions t kept-new-versions 6 kept-old-versions 2 version-control t) 
 It creates ## files as backups in the directory, which is really nice. But, if I have a [/] in an org header (a progress thing for a checklist), it continually asks upon hitting &#x60;C-x s&#x60; if I want to save the file. If I quit out of Emacs with &#x60;C-x C-c&#x60;, then it will not only ask, but also say that some buffers are modified, and do I want to really quit? I find this behavior to be a little weird. I&#x27;m just looking to see if anyone can help me make it so that backups are saved/taken care of silently in the background, and when hitting &#x60;C-x s&#x60;, it doesn&#x27;t prompt me to save the backup file each time. Instead, it prompts for normal (non-backup) buffers.
 I don&#x27;t know *why* it continually updates the backup files if I have a [/] in the header, but it does. If anyone has any ideas, please let me know?
 Thanks! 🙃

                              <span>Hi, 
 I have a perfectly working setup in emacs 28 using eglot and tresitter. I am moving to emacs 29, and trying to figure out which parts of the configuration can be removed since both eglot and treesitter are part of emacs now. I know that treesitter-auto can do a lot of heavy lifting in emacs 29. The relevant config from the emacs 28 installation is: 
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; (use-package eglot :straight :hook ((python-mode julia-mode) . eglot-ensure) :config (add-to-list &#x27;eglot-server-programs &#x27;(python-mode . (&quot;python-lsp-server&quot;)) &#x27;(julia-mode . (&quot;eglot-jl&quot;))))
 (use-package tree-sitter :straight t :config (global-tree-sitter-mode) (add-hook &#x27;tree-sitter-after-on-hook #&#x27;tree-sitter-hl-mode)) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; Any help/tips would be awesome. Thank you!

                              <span>Greetings,
 I&#x27;m having trouble getting this to work, linked below is the github issue, if any of you would like to take a look, thanks.
 https://github.com/karthink/gptel
 Recently I installed the gpt4all-chat package from the nix packages unstable channel:
 gpt4all-chat
 And it works really well, but I wanted to get gpt4all working in emacs since I do everything in there. Anyways, your gptel package is just what I need in order to have gpt4all working smoothly in emacs. But I&#x27;ve run into some an error when trying to setup gpt4all working in emacs with your gptel package.
 Warning (gptel): Preferred &#x60;gptel-model&#x27; &quot;gpt4all-falcon-newbpe-q4_0.gguf&quot; notsupported in &quot;GPT4All&quot;, using &quot;nil&quot; instead Disable showing Disable logging
 I copied the model files from the settings section of the gpt4all-chat gui app, then pasted them in the gptel configuration in config.el(I&#x27;m using nix-doom-emacs). But this error is getting thrown? nix-doom-emacs repo broke a while back so it&#x27;s stuck at doom emacs version 28.2, but that shouldn&#x27;t be an issue for this gptel package, at least I don&#x27;t think so?
 Thanks in advance for the help.
 Here&#x27;s my config.el configuration for gptel below:
 ;;---------------------------------------------------
 ;; gptel llm configuration:
 (use-package! gptel
 :config
 ;;(setq! gptel-api-key &quot;your key&quot;)
 ;; OPTIONAL configuration
 (setq-default gptel-model &quot;gpt4all-falcon-newbpe-q4_0.gguf&quot; ;Pick your default model
 gptel-backend (gptel-make-gpt4all &quot;GPT4All&quot; :protocol &quot;http&quot;))
 (setq-default gptel-max-tokens 500))
 ;; gptel llm backend configurations:
 (gptel-make-gpt4all &quot;GPT4All&quot;
 :protocol &quot;http&quot;

                              <span>Just wanted to show you how to use org tables with custom elisp functions, in case you dont know its possible:
 The following table shows results from a questionnaire:
 #+name: sus-questionnaire-results #+caption: SUS Questionnaire Results #+attr_latex: :align l|r|r|r|r|r|r|r|r|r|r|l :font \fontspec{Noto Sans Condensed Light} | USER | Q1 | Q2 | Q3 | Q4 | Q5 | Q6 | Q7 | Q8 | Q9 | Q10 | SUS | |------+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+-----+------| | U1 | 5 | 2 | 2 | 1 | 3 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 60.0 | | U2 | 5 | 2 | 4 | 2 | 5 | 1 | 4 | 1 | 4 | 1 | 87.5 | | U3 | 5 | 2 | 4 | 1 | 4 | 2 | 4 | 1 | 4 | 3 | 80.0 | #+tblfm: $12&#x3D;&#x27;(ux:sus-calc-score-per-row &#x27;($2..$11));N 
 The SUS column is calculated for each row using the values from column 2 to 11. When the ‘N’ flag is used, all referenced elements are parsed as numbers and interpolated as Lisp numbers
 Here is the elisp function:
 (defun ux:sus-calc-score (lst) (let ((counter 0)) (mapcar (lambda (x) (setq counter (1+ counter)) (if (&#x3D; 0 (% counter 2)) (- 5 x) (1- x))) lst))) (defun ux:sus-calc-score-per-row (lst) (* (apply &#x27;+ (ux:sus-calc-score lst)) 2.5)) 
 Thats all!

                              <span>I am using org-mode to takes notes and inserting images, which are stored in local in a relative directory. I am really puzzled because some images are not displayed and instead i see a simple link to the image. 
 The format i am usiing is
 [[file:images/img.jpg][DESCRIPTION]]
 Images are correctly placed in folder because clicking the link open the image.
 Things i have tried:
 - org-display-inline-images from the config and toggling it in the same buffer, no luck 
 - org-toggle-inline-images, no luck 
 - remove all configurations from my emacs
 - install latest org-mode using package-manager replacing the native one
 I am sure is something silly I am not figuring out. Help?
 emacs: 29.2
 org-mode: 9.6.19
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hi. I am using &#x60;org-msg&#x60; to write emails but it always exports code blocks with some kind of formatting, even in a text export, example:
 ┌────
 │ (require &#x27;org)
 │ (load-theme &#x27;leuven t)
 │ 
 │ (dolist (face &#x27;(org-level-1 org-level-2 org-level-3 org-level-4 org-level-5
 │ org-level-6 org-level-7 org-level-8))
 │ (set-face-attribute face nil :extend t))
 │ 
 │ (setq org-fontify-whole-heading-line t)
 │ (scratch-buffer)
 │ (org-mode)
 │ (insert &quot;#+title: (Infty, 2) Reading Group
 │ #+ROAM_TAGS: \&quot;Quasicategories\&quot;
 ...
 How can I export such a code block completely in plain text, like if I had just copy-pasted the code directly?

                              <span>Following on from this question about restricting property values during capture, I have a followup.
 I&#x27;m currently implementing that value restriction in my init.el with something like this:
 (setq org-global-properties &#x27;( (&quot;MEETING_ALL&quot; . &quot;Staff Finance ProjectX ProjectY&quot;) (&quot;FLAVOR_ALL&quot; . &quot;Strawberry Chocolate Vanilla&quot;) ;; ... and so on )) 
 However, I want to be able to have some property values that contain whitespace. So &quot;Project X&quot; and &quot;Project Y&quot; instead of ProjectX and ProjectY. I read the org-global-properties description but I still haven&#x27;t got enough hang of car and cdr and cons to know for sure what it&#x27;s on about. So I guessed and simply \-escaped some &quot;&quot;, like this:
 (setq org-global-properties &#x27;( (&quot;MEETING_ALL&quot; . &quot;Staff Finance \&quot;Project X\&quot; \&quot;Project Y\&quot;&quot;) (&quot;FLAVOR_ALL&quot; . &quot;Strawberry Chocolate Vanilla&quot;) ;; ... and so on )) 
 To my surprise, that works fine, but is it The Right Way to do it? One small thing that concerns me is that it doesn&#x27;t appear to be handled very well by emacs&#x27; lisp mode. So if I have it as a vertical list, I get this:
 (setq org-global-properties &#x27;( (&quot;MEETING_ALL&quot; . &quot;Staff Finance \&quot;Project X\&quot; \&quot;Project Y\&quot;&quot;) (&quot;FLAVOR_ALL&quot; . &quot;Strawberry Chocolate Vanilla&quot;) ;; ... and so on )) 
 None of this is the end of the world, I know, but I just wanted to check in case I&#x27;m really supposed to code it as some kind of nested parens monstrosity, but one that&#x27;s at least indented according to some sensible aesthetic! Ye know -- the kind of thing you come to expect with Lisp :-)

 subst f g x &#x3D; f x g(x)
 As far as I understood, f is a function that takes two arguments f (x , y). But, in this particular case, one of its arguments is a function g, f (x, g(x)), so I have no idea how the subst type assignature should be. Should f be a function whose one of its arguments is also a function or just a type variable?
 I am starting my studies with Haskell that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m still dumb, please have some patience.
 I am asking this question in this subreddit because there no other one that can help me out.

                              <span>Hello, I know this might be a very dumb way to do this, but I have a test file that imports and runs functions. The problem is because of my particular use case, the function that is being tested may not always be defined. When this happens, the test itself errors out because the function doesn&#x27;t exist and I have to comment out that test. Is there a way to detect if a variable has been defined, and return a Maybe where if the variable doesn&#x27;t exist it returns Nothing and if variable A does exist it returns Just A? I have other ways to go about this but this would be the most convenient way.

                              <span>So i want to use eglot to have autocompletion for html and css in Emacs (Windows). I installed eglot from melpa and installed the language servers using npm as shown in Github. When I run M - x eglot in any HTML file, I get the message &quot;Enter program to execute&#x27;. When i enter vscode-html-language-server.cmd and enter, i get the error message:
 [jsonrpc] Server exited with status 1
  
error in process sentinel: eglot--error: [eglot] -1: Server died 
 error in process sentinel: [eglot] -1: Server died
  
When i enter vscodehtml-language-server.ps1 and enter, i get the error message:
  
Searching for program: Permission denied, vscode-html-language-server.ps1
  
What might be the problem be with this? the language servers are in my path.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been working on writing some wrapper functions in consult for my workflow, and for the life of me can&#x27;t seem to figure out how to get a particular behavior in the consult menu.
 The behavior I&#x27;m looking for is exemplified by consult-gh: https://github.com/armindarvish/consult-gh. If you take a look at the demo GIFs in the README, you&#x27;ll see that when repos are searched for, it shows a list where each repo has multiple &quot;columns:&quot; one for the repo author/name, one for it being public or private, one for a date, and one for a description. Looking at the source code, I see that the author of this package in particular used propertize to get different faces for each part, but it&#x27;s not clear to me how to get the column alignment looking nice. Suggestions on the column alignment would be most appreciated!

                              <span>I&#x27;m pretty new to Emacs, so go easy on me if I&#x27;m missing something obvious, but I&#x27;ve read all of the documentation that I could find on running Emacs as a server and every time I think I&#x27;ve fixed the issue something strange happens again.
 I am on version 29. Currently, the way I start the daemon is with systemd. I enable and start the service as the documentation shows.
 The issue has to do with where the daemon creates the socket. Sometimes when I boot up my machine, everything works exactly as I expect it to: I can simply run &#x60;emacsclient -nc&#x60; and it pops right up. I can also set my shell environment variable EDITOR to emacsclient and open files easily that way. When things are working right, I note that the socket is in /run/user/userID/emacs/server.
 Probably half the time I boot up, the socket is in ~/.emacs.d/server/server, which means I have to pass the path to the socket to emacsclient for it to work. This means I have to change the scripts bound to my keybindings, etc., every time this happens. Pain in the butt. And for some reason I don&#x27;t understand, setting EDITOR&#x3D;emacsclient -cn -s /path/to/server doesn&#x27;t work the way I want it to. It opens up a new frame, but does not open a buffer with the current file.
 So my questions more broadly are
  
How does Emacs determine where it creates the socket? You would think it just looks at server-socket-dir, but there&#x27;s obviously more to it than that, because it changes it up on me regardless of whether I explicitly set that variable.
 And does anybody have any hunches as to what could be causing it to seemingly randomly flip back and forth between socket locations?

                              <span>I would love to have the ephemeral buffers sorted in an extra category below the regular buffers when calling consult-buffer. The following definition doesn&#x27;t work. It does sort them as wanted, but when I choose them, the buffer doesn&#x27;t switch to *Messages* or *scratch*, it just stays as the current buffer. (The regular buffers can be chosen in the upper part of the consult-menu as usual.)
 What did I do wrong?
  (setq consult-buffer-sources &#x27;(consult--source-hidden-buffer consult--source-modified-buffer consult--source-buffer (:name &quot;Ephemeral&quot; :narrow 109 :category buffer :items (&quot;*Messages*&quot; &quot;*scratch*&quot; &quot;*Async-native-compile-log*&quot; &quot;*Bookmark List*&quot;)))) (setq consult-buffer-filter &#x27;(&quot;\\&#x60; &quot; &quot;\\&#x60;\\*Completions\\*\\&#x27;&quot; &quot;\\&#x60;\\*scratch\\*\\&#x27;&quot; &quot;\\&#x60;\\*Messages\\*\\&#x27;&quot; &quot;\\&#x60;\\*Bookmark List\\*\\&#x27;&quot; &quot;\\&#x60;\\*EMMS-Log\\*\\&#x27;&quot; &quot;\\&#x60;\\*Flymake log\\*\\&#x27;&quot; &quot;\\&#x60;\\*Semantic SymRef\\*\\&#x27;&quot; &quot;\\&#x60;\\*tramp/.*\\*\\&#x27;&quot;)) 
 I need to filter them, so they are not listed twice, but just in the extra category. And neither :category buffer nor :category &#x27;buffer works.
 I am grateful for any advice.
 Edit: I am using Emacs 30.0.50 and Consult 1.3.

                              <span>Hi,
 I usually don&#x27;t use emacs but I am getting into org-mode again and I am having trouble installing packages from melpa.
 When I do a &quot;M-x package-refresh-content&quot; emacs tells me that it is contacting host elpa.gnu.org:443 then elpa.nongnu.org:443 , then melpa.org:443 and finally gives up with &quot;failed to download melpa archive&quot;.
 I have this in my init.el:
 (require &#x27;package) (add-to-list &#x27;package-archives &#x27;(&quot;melpa&quot; . &quot;https://melpa.org/packages/&quot;) t) (package-initialize) 
 I can however type the configured melpa-url in my brower, where it works.
 I am on Debian with emacs 29.
 Does anybody have an idea what this problem might me or how to attack it?

                              <span>Hello, I need some help assessing the root of my performance problems when using Emacs, especially while using org mode.
 If while writing an Org document I end up with a rather long paragraph (~550 chars), editing becomes noticeably slow to the point of being pretty annoying and kinda frustrating.
 I ran the profiler of Doom Emacs (https://imgur.com/a/nMYWLOz) and my results show that jit-lock, which IIRC is like a variant of font-lock, and more especifically jit-lock-fontify-keywords-region, is my main culprit here, or at least the most notable one.
 After that, I disabled font-lock-mode in my buffer and the editing was snappy again, so I tried disabling some modes inside that same buffer but to no avail.
 My hunch here is that either I&#x27;m facing an Emacs limitation or maybe it&#x27;s just my hardware being too slow. I&#x27;m leaning more towards the latter, but I&#x27;m pretty new to Emacs so I just don&#x27;t know (and can&#x27;t reliably test this in my other, more powerful laptop).
 So what do you think? What could I do to mitigate this while not sacrificing too much of the eye-candiness of Org?
 Thanks in advance!
 My PC specs:
  
CPU: AMD Ryzen 3 3250U (2 cores, 4 threads @ 2.6 GHz) w/integrated GPU.
 RAM: 12 GB DDR4 @ 2400 MT/s
 Screen: 1920x1080p LCD LED

                              <span>Hi Experts
 ​
 Maybe i am doing this wrong.
 What I want to do is understand what a function in an emacs plugin is doing.
 E.g. I want to understand what consult--fd-make-builder does in consult.el file
 ​
 What i did was copy over the function locally and renamed (rd/consult--fd-make-builder) it and then added the advice
 ​
 lisp (advice-add &#x27;consult--fd-make-builder :override #&#x27;rd/advice-consult--fd-make-builder) 
 ​
 intention is that this will now execute my local function and i can look at it with message
 ​
 Now when i run consult-fd i get
 ​
 lisp apply: Invalid function: (&quot;.&quot;) 
 ​
 i tried just copying the function without renaming.
 ​
 then i get
 ​
 lisp Error running timer: (void-variable cmd) \[2 times\] 
 ​
 ​
 Can someone help me as to how i can do this or what I am doing wrong?
 ​
 TIA
 EDIT: Figured out the issue, looks like lexical scope was defined.

 I have installed and have libtree-sitter-elisp.so (and -lisp.so), but I am having trouble on which mode to use when editing .emacs or other elisp files. There&#x27;s no lisp-ts-mode nor elisp-ts-mode that can be run interactively.
 I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s user error, but what am I doing wrong? (And/or, where should I be searching for this, or what did I miss when searching here?)

                              <span>While doing some package maintenance, I&#x27;ve noticed that when visiting &quot;circe-pkg.el&quot; file, flycheck highlighted the define-package function as obsolete. So I went to the source and found the following, suggesting it has been obsoleted in Emacs 29.1 without a replacement to use:
 (defun define-package ( _name-string _version-string &amp;optional _docstring _requirements &amp;rest _extra-properties) &quot;Define a new package. [...]&quot; (declare (obsolete nil &quot;29.1&quot;) (indent defun)) (error &quot;Don&#x27;t call me!&quot;)) 
 I&#x27;ve checked the git blame output and found nothing useful in the commit message motivating this either:
 ade7a212a882540178d9504e7e0bd3be3bf1fd41 Author: Stefan Kangas  AuthorDate: Mon Jul 11 12:41:50 2022 +0200 Commit: Stefan Kangas  CommitDate: Mon Jul 11 12:51:00 2022 +0200 Parent: c0ced4e4998 Prevent setting user time if the WM doesn&#x27;t support it Merged: emacs-25 Contained: master Follows: emacs-28.1.90 (157359) Precedes: emacs-29.0.90 (6898) * lisp/emacs-lisp/package.el (define-package): Make obsolete. 
 No mention in the NEWS file either or on emacs-devel.
 The best explanation I have for this is the following:
  
You&#x27;re not supposed to call the function, it merely acts as special syntax for package.el to interpret.
 Outright removal of the function is a bad idea due to people looking up its docstring.
 Before actually removing a function, it is obsoleted to detect people still using it and give them ample time to adjust.
  
I still find obsoletion shows the wrong signal here. One is still supposed to use it as seen in the elisp reference and marking the function as obsolete only creates more confusion. What was the motivation to do that?

 ​
 One question that has come to mind though is whether anyone uses &#x60;query-replace&#x60; over &#x60;query-replace-regex&#x60; and if so why? What are the benefits that &#x60;query-replace&#x60; has over its regex alter ego, or conversely am I instead missing some drawbacks to always defaulting to the &#x60;regex&#x60; version?
 ​
 For context, I&#x27;ve rebound &#x60;M-%&#x60; to use the &#x60;regex&#x60; version as it&#x27;s already a bit of an awkward key bind, but am I struggling with Chesterton’s Fence in this case.

 I&#x27;m starting to use .authinfo to save some encrypted information, that works pretty nice. The problem I&#x27;m facing is that Emacs tries to decrypt the authinfo.gpg file eagerly at startup which when running as daemon is kind of problematic.
 Is there a way to delay the decryption of authinfo.gpg until it is needed?

                              <span>So now that treesitter and eglot come with emacs theres no need for all my plugins. Flycheck was giving wierd errors with LSP, replaced it with built in flymake and the errors reporting is spot on. It&#x27;s also really quick now with native comp built in. Thanks to mickey for this guide. Actually didn&#x27;t even need to build from source though I used homebrew as i&#x27;m on an M1. 
 I&#x27;m late to the party on this stuff as i&#x27;ve not been coding on emacs for a couple years now but this stuff is amazing, finaly emacs is coming out the box with the stuff!

                              <span>I&#x27;m a big fan of org-roam and would like to add all of my old notes in there of course! These notes are spread over a lot of directories on my system and in different formats (.txt, .md, .doc). Migration to org-roam will make navigating through all of my notes much more comfortable and I already migrated most of my notes.
 The last notes I want to migrate have a &quot;directory context&quot;. For instance holiday notes in my pictures directory. I am considering to copy/paste these files to org-roam and add a tag to the directory and delete the old note. The downside is that this is kinda an org-roam lock in, because migrating these notes back could be a PITA. If I use a special tag in the roam-note to the original directory then it is possible to migrate the files back with a simple elisp script I guess but could break when directories are renamed in the future. Hopefully I am making myself clear .
 Just before sending this to Reddit a light bulb went off. I could copy/paste the original note in the org-roam note in a code block and tangle it to this directory. I would prefer to not use a code block but something like this seems to be the way.
 How are you guys dealing with old &quot;directory context&quot; notes?

                              <span>Title. I have projectA, and some of it files are .gitignored (for the purposes of version control), but i still would to be able to see in them in emacs when using project-find-file, etc.
 Is there a way to make project.el disregard .gitignore?
 I know i can &quot;(project-find-file &#x27;INCLUDE-ALL)&quot;, but is there a way to set 1 one time so i can M-x project-find-file and it will just work (without any addtional flags.)

                              <span>Hey folks, 
 I&#x27;ve been working professionally in Scala for the last year and a half and it was nothing but unrest.
 First, the Scala 3 migration started this painful event that fragments the already fragmented multi versions hassle that everyone needs to go through 2.12 / 2.13, and now 3. Have to mention, this is not only dependent on our codebase. For example, Databricks is still on 2.12, on the other hand, some new libraries are Scala 3 only, or Scala 2 support was deprecated.
 Then Akka became a non-open source, and we had to find a solution and picked the Typelevel ecosystem.
 There was another &quot;shock&quot; to the ZIO ecosystem when their leader left the project. Fortunately for us, we haven&#x27;t invested in ZIO not a single hour, but this is another negative event in Scala ecosystem.
 After working for half a year with Typelevel, we wrote some services and a few internal libraries. It wasn&#x27;t bad, maybe not as simple as Akka, but it worked as expected. However, it was a huge struggle for half of the team to understand this code and for some to even understand the concept.
 Then Pekko came out and we had another meeting, where 100% of the team voted against using Typelevel again.
 So, we are &quot;officially&quot; using Pekko for all our new services, which is basically the old Akka in maintenance mode. I don&#x27;t see how this stack has any future.
 Now, it looks like a few experimental libraries evolve around virtual threads. My bet this is the future of Scala since they are simple yet powerful as Effect systems.
 But I hear more and more people are saying - until these are ready, there will be &quot;no Scala&quot;, since the language in a rapid decline (sad, but true).
 Sharing this because I&#x27;m tired of the constant unrest in Scala, and curious what strategy your team has regarding this.
 Thanks

                              <span>It seems that SkillsMatter is no more (again), and the videos were completely removed from the internet. The Haskell Foundation, apparently, were able to secure the HaskellExchange videos from them, and are now working towards making them available online on youtube (https://discourse.haskell.org/t/haskell-video-archive-call-for-volunteers/8863)
 Can the Scala Center reach out to the SkillsMatter management and do the same? It would be a terrible shame to lose those amazing talks.

                              <span>So, I just finished a project of writing a programming language on Haskell with an interpreter. I tried to use as few libraries as possible to really learn how everything works. However, this was my first big project with the language (and in designing a language) and I would love some feedback on things. Im sure a seasoned functional programmer would see some other better approaches and i&#x27;m all ears

                              <span>Hi,
 This comes up all the time when I try to write some haskell but I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s a better way to handle it, it happens most often when I am using new type
 Suppose I have a new type
  newtype Matrix &#x3D; Matrix [[Int]] 
 and in function pattern matching I am destructuring it:  invertMatrix :: Matrix -&gt; Maybe Matrix invertMatrix (Matrix xss) &#x3D; ................... 
 but then in the function body I might have to use some other util functions that take the newtype Matrix instead of the internal representation. In this example I probably would need  determinant :: Matrix -&gt; Float 
 This often means I am rewrapping xss in Matrix just to pass it to determinant, which is cumbersome and I don&#x27;t know if that would cause performance issue?
 Is there a way in the function pattern matching to get xss and an additional variable to bind the whole Matrix xss so I can pass it around? I believe in rust for example they have a way to do that by using @ like
  match x { Constructor(inner) @ whole &#x3D;&gt; .... }

                              <span>I&#x27;m a beginner in programing.
 Currently, I&#x27;m reading a Haskell (my first language) book and pretend to make a project with the intent of learning by doing things in practice; the project is: Design a game engine, I know there&#x27;s a big potential of learning with such project, because it involves a lot of things (I also would like to make this engine &quot;a real thing&quot;, if things go the right way)
 As I have read, people don&#x27;t recommend using primarily Haskell for such, and I can&#x27;t tell a lot of the reasons, because I&#x27;m a beginner; the reasons I&#x27;m aware of are:
 1 - Worse performance compared to languages like C/C++/Rust (which is relevant to games).
 2 - Haskell is not mainstream, so there&#x27;s not much development being done with regards to games.
 I&#x27;m not sure if in someway it becomes &quot;bad&quot; to do &quot;game engine things&quot; with a functional language for some strange reason, I believe you guys might have the property to know about it.
 I pretend to learn Rust after getting a good understanding of Haskell (although I believe I might need to learn python first, considering the demand nowadays).
 Regarding the game engine project, I&#x27;d like to know if it would be a good idea to use Rust as the main language while Haskell for a lot of parts of it, or would it be a terrible thing to do? (losing a lot of performance or any other problem associated with this association of Rust + Haskell).
 Thanks to everyone.

                              <span>Hi all,
 I have made a guide on how to play media (local and remote) using Emacs and MPV so it works with unified config across both Linux and Android.
 To install and configure the GUI Emacs app on Android and see my unified configuration file you can check out my dotfiles on danijelcamdzic/dotemacs and also read about it in one of my previous posts - Sharing my Emacs workflow and dotfiles
 Up until now, I wasn&#x27;t able to get a working config which would allow me to play media through the MPV commands in my Android Emacs but I have figured it out and would like to share the steps for anyone who, like me, wishes to quickly check out their knowledge base, movie collection, song collection etc. in Emacs and quickly play them on your phone.
 The steps are described in my README - MPV section and this is how it looks like when I try to play a video on my Emacs Android:

                              <span>I need some help resolving a gap in my understanding of elisp. I have a hard time understanding what kinds of arguments a function expects. Here is an example with define-key, but happens to me with lots of functions. Basically, I can never tell if an argument needs to be quoted. Correct usage of define-key:
  (define-key gnus-article-map (kbd &quot;i&quot;) #&#x27;gnus-article-show-images) 
 I frequently make the error where I think I am supposed to quote the keymap. I have to look up some old code to see, oh yeah, you don&#x27;t quote the keymap.
 Then when I use use-package, I would write
 (use-package gnus :bind (:map gnus-article-map (&quot;i&quot; . gnus-article-show-images))) 
 Now the function gnus-article-show-images is unquoted, I guess, because this is a macro? The structure of the arg list to :bind is unclear from the function documentation, so I just have to look up another example where I used :bind to figure out the format. Anther example, in general-define-key both keymap and function are quoted. Why?
 What am I missing so that I can better understand whether args need to be quoted or not?

                              <span>Hi all!
 As you may know, mu4e is an email client for emacs. It consists of a server program that scans your email messages and an emacs program talking to this server program, as well as a number of command-line utilities.
 I&#x27;m happy to announce mu 1.12, a new stable release which has been in development for ca. 1 year since the 1.10.
 Some highlights:
  
Significant speedups in both mu and mu4e 
 Reworked message composition, closer to its Gnus origins which adds many of its features
 Overhauled the query parser; squashing a number of bugs/limitations, incl. dealing with CJK messages 
 Experimental folding of message threads 
 Better and faster indexing of HTML messages 
 Experimental search by (human) language wit CLD2

 If I add the following line to config.el in .config/doom on linux
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; (setq doom-font (font-spec :family &quot;FreeSans&quot; :size 20))
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 I do not see any modification after stoping the emacs window and then turning it back on
 If I try doom/reload-fond I receive a warning in the .config/emacs/lisp/lib/fonts.el about unknown type: font.
 I have checked that the font exist with M-x describe font.

                              <span>justl is a major mode for driving justfiles. Justfiles are a way to save and run project-specific commands. Think of them like Makefiles, but they are purely focused on running commands and processes, and not for a build system.
 ​
 This mode gives the ability to execute just recipes from within the editor itself.
 ​
 The new release with the changelog details here: https://github.com/psibi/justl.el/blob/master/Changelog.org#014
 ​
 The major highlight in this release is support for per recipe buffer and a major rewrite from Steve Purcell.

                              <span>(edit, using org-roam, obviously... should have mentioned that in the title...)
 I am trying to extend the functionality of the roam buffer so that it not only updates to show backlinks for the node at point, but also so if point wanders over a link, it will show backlinks for the linked node, rather than the node I currently have open. I tried advising org-roam-node-at-point like this (code generated with chatgpt&#x27;s help, apologies if anything is wrong; my elisp-fu is weak):
 ​
 (defun my-org-roam-node-at-point (&amp;optional assert) &quot;Return the Org-roam node at point if it exists, or the node corresponding to the link at point.&quot; (interactive) (let ((id (plist-get (link-hint--get-link-at-point) :args))) (if (and id (string-prefix-p &quot;id:&quot; id)) (progn (print (substring id 3)) (org-roam-node-from-id (substring id 3))) (org-roam-node-at-point )))) (advice-add &#x27;org-roam-node-at-point :override #&#x27;my-org-roam-node-at-point) 
 This doesn&#x27;t work, but it does succeed at breaking the roam-buffer, so I suspect an approach sort of like this could work, but I&#x27;m in over my depth. Anyone have any ideas, insight, or a snippet that does this already?
 ​
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hello, so I&#x27;m currently in uni trying my best to manage my time and I&#x27;ve found org-agenda very useful for that cuz of how simple it is. I am kinda new to doom emacs and org, but I&#x27;ve learnt how to set reoccuring tasks (refer to ss attached). However, only recently this issue has occured where tasks of previous days e.g. MATH1061 LEC1, scheduled for a monday, is at the bottom of Friday? Maybe i&#x27;ve accidently turned on a setting or there&#x27;s a syntax error. Thank you!

                              <span>Hi,
 I don&#x27;t have a lot experience with emacs and so I am pretty sure I am doing something wrong here as this is simply too tedious...
 What I am trying to do is to attach a file without a mouse, just by using a keyboard.
 Currently this is how it looks like:
 I want to attach a file to I press C-c c-a to open the attachment-dispatcher where I press another &quot;a&quot;. This gives me a prompt at the bottom. I now press &quot;tab&quot; and the prompt tells me (I write this from memory) something about &quot;not unique&quot;, so I press &quot;tab&quot; another time and now I get a new windows where I can select a file - but this window does not have focus. So I now press C-x o to switch to this window where I finally can select the file to attach...
 I find this extremely clumsy - so could someone please let me know how to properly attach a file using only a keyboard?

                              <span>I am practicing identifiying the types of given functions and I seem to have grasped the concept only partly - I have problems with functions that are defined through other functions. 
 Example : evens &#x3D; filter even
 Since 
 filter :: (a -&gt; Bool) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [a] 
 and 
 even :: Integral a &#x3D;&gt; a -&gt; Bool 
 I thought it should be 
 Integral a &#x3D;&gt; (a -&gt; Bool) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [a]
 But :t gave me Integral a &#x3D;&gt; [a] -&gt; [a]
 Why excactly is Bool not part of it? 
 I tried to find an answer but maybe this is too specific or simple. 
 Help would be appreciated.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve settled on using tab-line for my tabbing because it fits my normal workflow. However I like my tabs to basically operate the same way as in the browser and terminal. After some work and references to the tab-bar implementation I finally have drag and drop tab movement working. The prerequisite is keeping the tabs in a fixed order (also a desired behavior) rather than relying on whatever happens to be the state of buffer-list as is the default.

 This seems like really bizarre behavior to me, and I&#x27;d really prefer it to only use the lsp server for the current project. 
 ​
 Anybody know how to get that working that way?

                              <span>Hi Experts
 ​
 A very basic question. I am very new to emacs so please bear with me.
 ​
 I understand how to pass arguments to an elisp function.
 ​
 but not able to comprehend how to use it in conjunction with a list
 for example
 (interactive (list (read-shell-command (if shell-command-prompt-show-cwd (format-message &quot;Async shell command in &#x60;%s&#x27;: &quot; (abbreviate-file-name default-directory)) &quot;Async shell command: &quot;) nil nil (let ((filename (cond (buffer-file-name) ((eq major-mode &#x27;dired-mode) (dired-get-filename nil t))))) (and filename (file-relative-name filename)))) current-prefix-arg shell-command-default-error-buffer ) ) 
 i can understand what this code does, but because i dont understand how/what arguments the list will take e.g. &#x60;read-shell-command&#x60;/&#x60;current-prefix-arg&#x60;/&#x60;shell-command-default-error-buffer&#x60;/&#x60;read-string&#x60;
 i am having a hard time creating one myself.
 ​
 Can someone please explain this to me in a simple way?
 Also what all can i pass?
 ​
 i can think of command line arguments in couple of forms:
  
shell command
 string
 integer
 file
 buffers
 perfix
  
etc.
 I am guessing there will be a particular form of these commands i should use.
 TIA

Perhaps point people to How to Ask Questions the Smart Way in the rules or posting guidelines?

 folks from emacs have always been saying that emacs offers a better and well Integrated interface to command line, ie EMACS REPLACES YOUR TERMINAL i am curious to hear your thoughts on similar kind of easy of use in emacs, as shown in video, to avoid a proprietary terminal emulator and go foss.
 i update the post with a shorter 3 min demo of their product

                              <span>Hi,
 Jetbrains Inttelij Idea / NeoVim user here. I&#x27;m thinking about installing Emacs (org-mode is the main selling point) and switching (at least from NeoVim) to Emacs/Doom Emacs. While I was reading about how to install it, I found that there are a couple of different emacs releases that can be installed: 
  
If I search Homebrew for the &quot;Emacs&quot; term, there is one cask called &quot;emacs&quot;, let&#x27;s call it &quot;standard&quot;.
 But there is also &quot;emacs-plus&quot; which should be first tapped: https://github.com/d12frosted/homebrew-emacs-plus?tab&#x3D;readme-ov-file
  
I have a couple of questions: 
  
I&#x27;m wondering what is the &quot;correct&quot; way to install emacs on MacBook Pro M1 with Sonoma - standard or plus release.
 If emacs-plus is the correct way should I include those additional flags like &quot;--with-native-comp&quot; and if yes which ones?
 If emacs-plus is the correct way, what is better to use &quot;emacs-plus@29&quot; or just use the latest version? I guess that if I just use the latest version, then it will be updated whenever I run brew update and upgrade, and I&#x27;m not sure how things are going in emacs world with those updates. I used to have problems with NeoVim updates, as well as plugin updates, so at one point in time, I was afraid to run plugin updates :) Hope Emacs is more stable.
  
Thanks in advance.

                              <span>I feel like this should be pretty obvious, but i&#x27;m pulling my hair out on the order of operations here.
 I want to customize some faces with a box. And i want that box to use a color from my current theme. But i don&#x27;t want to hard code the color value, but for it to use the dark or light color of the modus theme, depending on which is loaded on starting.
 So far i have tried using the function modus-themes-get-color-value but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be available at the point the tab-line gets activated. Then i tried this at the very end of my init.el:
 (custom-set-faces &#x27;(tab-line ((t (:box (:line-width (5 . 5) :color ,(face-background &#x27;tab-line)))))) ) 
 Which seems to be run before the theme is loaded, as i&#x27;m getting a white box on the modus-vivendi theme.
 I tried setting this up in a use-package statement for the tab-line-mode, for the modus theme and for the emacs pseudo package. I tried adding :after (modus-themes) to the use-package statement for the tab-line. All without success. I don&#x27;t even want it to track the theme when i change it after starting emacs. Just, get the background of the tab-line at start, after the modus-theme is loaded and use that for the box color.
 I feel like i&#x27;m somehow overthinking this. How can i get the tab-line border to look right regardless of the configured theme? Is this a case of having to set up a variable for your theme and then making this into a cond statement with hardcoded Color Values? This should work for now, but would mean i&#x27;d have to rewrite the any time i want to change themes.
 Just for completeness, here&#x27;s the entire config, if anyone want&#x27;s to take a look:

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently trying to generate a list of all times backups on my various servers are scheduled. There is a property &quot;BCKSCHED&quot; assigned to each server heading with the time as string. Like
 :PROPERTIES: :BCKSCHED: 01:00 :END: 
 I tried to use org-ql to generate a dynamic block that shows all times as a table. My dynamic block looks like this:
 #+BEGIN: org-ql :query &quot;property: BCKSCHED&quot; :columns (heading property) #+END: 
 When I run it with C-c C-c I get the error
 Symbol&#x27;s function definition is void: org-dblock-write:org-ql 
 So I tried a minimal example like this
 #+BEGIN: org-ql :query &quot;todo: &quot; :columns (heading property) #+END: 
 And also the example from the repository
 #+BEGIN: org-ql :query &quot;todo: priority:A,B&quot; :columns (todo (priority &quot;P&quot;) ((property &quot;agenda-group&quot;) &quot;Group&quot;) deadline heading) :sort (deadline priority) :take 7 :ts-format &quot;%Y-%m-%d %H:%M&quot; #+END: 
 But both have the same error as a result. What am I doing wrong here?

                              <span>Hi all! I compiled a hello world library with sbt-assembly, and linked the jar in a Kotlin Android Studio project. The Scala library targets Java 1.8: javacOptions ++&#x3D; Seq(&quot;-source&quot;, &quot;1.8&quot;, &quot;-target&quot;, &quot;1.8&quot;). The symbols from the Scala code are being resolved, however deploying to the device fails. I removed the annotated main function as it is seemingly mentioned in the error, but it didn&#x27;t help. Any idea how to fix this?

                              <span>I posted about using outline-mode for elisp about 5 years ago and I&#x27;ve gone a bit potty since then on folding most everything I work with - to the extent that I&#x27;ve even dropped most org-mode usage to outline-mode as I never really used the funky stuff (like agenda, todo etc).
 The motivation is that it makes viewing, organising and editing these files so much easier without the need to maintain +BEGIN/END SRC blocks and the tangling that comes with using org mode.
 I&#x27;ve also implemented the imenu index stuff so that I can have an alphabetic index to my headings.
 So far, I&#x27;ve converted elisp mode, org mode, sway, i3wm and waybar configurations to be folding with outline mode. The dotfiles are in my gitlab repo.

                              <span>Hello!
 I am using diff-hl and having a weird issue - in a repository I am unable to stage hunks of files that are not in the root directory of a git project. I am getting an error message when calling &#x60;(diff-hl-stage-diff (current-buffer))&#x60; or just calling the &#x60;diff-hl-stage-current-hunk&#x60; interactive function. 
 error
 Now, as you can see from the screenshot, the &#x60;git apply ...&#x60; tries a temp file but the path is relative to the root of the project instead of the file that I am in.
 I traced it back to vc-git-command but am not proficient in elisp so can&#x27;t make sense of it.
 Has anyone encountered a similar issue?

                              <span>eat is a great terminal inside emacs. I&#x27;m curious if there is a way to make the buffer&#x27;s name show the current path. In vterm, we can set vterm-buffer-name-string to make this, but it seems there is no similar option for eat.

 Thanks.

                              <span>I used doom emacs for a while, but over the last couple of weeks wrote my own config, to be a bit more flexible.
 I want to use org-agenda, and in doom emacs I just let it check all my files under &quot;~/org/&quot;, so I can create TODOs everywhere and don&#x27;t have to think about what I should be putting in which todo file - or manage a single one.
 To achieve this, I have the following lines in my init.el:
 emacs-lisp (use-package org :pin org :commands (org-capture org-agenda) :config ;; agenda (setq org-agenda-start-with-log-mode t) (setq org-log-done &#x27;time) (setq org-log-into-drawer t) (setq org-directory &quot;~/org/&quot;) (setq org-agenda-files &#x27;(&quot;~/org/&quot;))) 
 I always run emacs as a daemon, and this is annoying for two reasons: 1. My recentf history is always filled with org files. I want them there, but not if they were opened by the org-agenda scan 2. I have a lot of org buffers initially
 How can I solve this? Or am I doing something which is not intended? I had the same setup in doom emacs, but never noticed that my recentf history or my buffers are spammed with agenda files. I want the agenda files on startup to work with the emacs-dashboard. I&#x27;m somewhat confused that this is not a more common problem, as I&#x27;m not sure how else I should be using org-agenda
 What I tried so far
  
do not keep org-agenda-files open after generating agenda I don&#x27;t understand that quiet though, I don&#x27;t want a solution that closes buffers when I close the agenda buffer
 Prevent recentf from being flooded - Reddit I neither want to ignore all my org files though

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I have a huge org file, and I get this error &quot;end of file during parsing&quot;.
 This usually means I have parenthesis not matching somewhere, I started removing the chapters of my files one by one, and retried to tangle: no change, I got the same error everytime, this does not make sense to me, I should have been able to tangle at some point!!
 I tried with a diff (I have a backup of this file), but I am not good at reading diff buffers (and I only discovered difftastic yesterday... that I can not implement, due to the error...).
 It forces me to get better at dealing with changes in my configuration &#x3D;&#x3D;&gt; I will better document the changes from now on (Magit)
 Now to my question:
 Is there an emacs function that checks code blocks only, ignoring the litterate content? Using the #+BEGIN_SRC and #+END_SRC entries to locate the blocks, and only checking the content for syntax errors?
 Thanks for your support!!

                              <span>I loved my emacs exwm environment so much. But I had to let go of her eventually because I needed IDE features easily. I mainly work in python and sometimes in typescript, rust. 
 Adding language support (Go to function definition, syntax checking) always proved to be difficult for me. Almost never configured one successfully.
 So I finally just went with VS code. I want to go back to my emacs EXWM full setup. Any recommendations on how I can handle the language support part?
 Note: spacemacs support for EXWM was not so good. Or it might just be my inexperience with it.

                              <span>Have you ever thought to yourself, why should I give Emacs commands like a plebian, when an LLM can just control Emacs for me? Well the first step is now done, we now have a way to make any elisp command callable by an LLM that does function calling. For example, here is me switching buffers by telling the LLM to switch buffers by just describing the buffer I want switched to. It&#x27;s not exactly a huge time-saver, but it&#x27;s cool and shows the potential.
 ​

 In my llm package, I&#x27;ve created a new function calling branch after learning that Ollama will soon support function calling. Right now both Open AI and Gemini do this (but Gemini has some limitations). As part of that, I have a utility to use function calling to create function definitions for elisp functions (which aren&#x27;t really rich enough in information to be passed to function calls as-is).
 I&#x27;ll be thinking about interesting new interactions that can be built off by having the LLM just control emacs via a few predefined commands. But it&#x27;s quite useful for certain things where you want the LLM to produce structured information. For example, I created a function that will create an example sentence given a word in a language, and then it can be passed to anki, etc. These things were a bit painful to do previously.
 As normal, I&#x27;m not planning on creating an actual end-user package here, but I want to encourage people to think about what can be done using function calling and, if there is something you want to put into a package, use the &#x60;llm&#x60; package to make it easy and portable (somewhat). Ideas and feedback are most welcome!

                              <span>I am a noob trying to set up the init.el file from scratch.
 ​
 I want to load a custom theme (aircon-theme) which is available at list-packages. I have created a folder called el inside .emacs.d In the el folder I have a core folder which has a theme.el file whose content is 
 (use-package aircon-theme :ensure t)
 In the init.el , I refer to the theme via 
 (load-file (expand-file-name &quot;el/core/theme.el&quot; user-emacs-directory))
 I was hoping this would auto-load the theme. However this only downloaded the aircon-theme, which I then selected manually using the drop down menu.
 ​
 Can someone point out why this method was not sucessful and what can be done to autoload the theme?

                              <span>In procedural/OOP laguages, for loops are O(1) space because they can mutate a single variable.
 If each iteration in a functional program is a recursive function call, would it result in n levels of recursion and hence O(n) space usage in the stack? This seems pretty absurd but I can&#x27;t find any resources on this.

                              <span>And I do mean basic! Barely qualifies as a DSL.
 In short, I need/want a way to attach some color metadata to some text, and be able to concatenate those together. I want a bunch of concatenated items to (ideally) be the same type as a single item. (A Semigroup, in other words, I think?) And of course a function that prints it out to the terminal.
 So I want to do something like:
 t &#x3D; R &quot;some red text, &quot;  G &quot;some green text, &quot;  Y &quot;and some yellow!&quot; printColor t 
 I&#x27;ve tried a couple of ways and haven&#x27;t been super happy, wondering if there&#x27;s a better way!
 Attempt 1
 data ColorText &#x3D; R Text -- red | G Text -- green | Y Text -- yellow | N Text -- no color, default | Arr [ColorText] 
 ...and I made it an instance of Semigroup. This recursive definition worked fine practically speaking, bu…</span>

 I want the following behaviour for RET: If I am on a link it should follow it, otherwise I want it to call org-cycle.
 What I cannot figure out atm (being an emacs-noob) is how to test if point is currently located on a link.
 So could someone please explain to me how to test for a link at point?

                              <span>Reading through the Elisp of alphapapa&#x27;s immensely useful package burly.el, I came across this function definition:
 (defun burly--bookmark-window-state-hack (&amp;optional _)
 (unwind-protect
 (progn
 (cl-assert burly--window-state)
 (window-state-put burly--window-state (frame-root-window)))
 (setf bookmark-after-jump-hook (delete #&#x27;burly--bookmark-window-state-hack bookmark-after-jump-hook)
 burly--window-state nil)))
 I could not figure out the function argument, &quot;_&quot;. The function body does not reference it. The argument&#x27;s name seems to be intentionally non-descriptive.
 I Googled for information about Emacs and the underscore character but found nothing helpful. Then I asked ChatGPT, which replied:
 ​
  
In Emacs Lisp, when the underscore _ character is used as an argument to a function, it conventionally indicates that the argument is not used within the function body. This is a way to signal to other programmers that the argument is intentionally ignored or not relevant to the function&#x27;s operation.
  
If the argument is intentionally ignored, at it seems to be, why include it in the first place? Especially when the argument is &amp;optional anyway? What does it add to the function?

                              <span>I am using lsp-mode with company to edit some Python files. I noticed though that when I use it to edit C my company completions are much more complete. As an example, if I type in 
  void main(){ pri } 
 and select the top option (printf) it gives me
  #include  void main(){ printf(const char *, ...) }  Which puts my cursor on the first argument.
 But if I type in pri in Python and select print it just completes the word without even adding the parenthesis at the end. As a more complete example, I am working with a postgresql database and I type in 
  connection &#x3D; psycopg2.con  and it completes it to connection &#x3D; psycopg2.connect but without parens and it also doesn&#x27;t add in the arguments like how C does with printf. Is this an lsp limitation with Python? I am using an up to date company mode and lsp mode with pyright as my python lsp and clangd as my C lsp.

 If it is possible to find out or create a function in Emacs that can accomplish the same effect in Vim, is it a straightforward matter of binding the key sequence to the function?
 Does the evil framework provide some support for this?
 I was thinking whether there was an automated way of accomplishing this but on reflection it seems impossible.

                              <span>Hi Experts
 Newbie here, I wanted to open file under cursor in a split ... so wrote this elisp function.
 ​
 Just FYI using DOOM emacs.
 (defun rd/evil-find-file-at-point-with-line-split() &quot;lets extend the evil-find-file-at-point-with-line function to open in a split&quot; (interactive) (require &#x27;evil-commands) (let ((display-buffer-alist &#x27;((&quot;&quot; (display-buffer-reuse-window display-buffer-below-selected)))) (parent-file (current-buffer))) (evil-find-file-at-point-with-line) (split-window-vertically (- height)) (other-window 1) (pop-to-buffer (parent-file)) ) ) (define-key evil-normal-state-map (kbd &quot;C-w C-f&quot;) &#x27;rd/evil-find-file-at-point-with-line-split) 
 It works very inconsistently. File does open but sometimes in the same window, sometimes in a vertical split and sometimes in horizontal split(the intended).
 ​
 Can someone please point out what i am doing wrong?
 ​
 TIA

                              <span>Hi all.
 I&#x27;m facing strange problem and couldn&#x27;t figure out.
 Whenever I turn on jinx-mode in latex buffer, auctex (e.g. LaTeX-mode) automatically turned off and switched to latex-mode.
 Same issue occurs when I turn on jinx-mode globally.
 jinx-mode is perfectly working in other major-mode and auctex also works fine if jinx-mode is not turned on. 
 I tried to reinstall both packages and config them with many different settings
 but still no luck. 
 These are part of my configs. What am I missing?
 (use-package auctex :demand t :ensure (auctex :pre-build ((&quot;./autogen.sh&quot;) (&quot;./configure&quot; &quot;--without-texmf-dir&quot; &quot;--with-packagelispdir&#x3D;./&quot; &quot;--with-packagedatadir&#x3D;./&quot;) (&quot;make&quot;)) :build (:not elpaca--compile-info) ;; Make will take care of this step :files (&quot;*.el&quot; &quot;doc/*.info*&quot; &quot;etc&quot; &quot;images&quot; &quot;latex&quot; &quot;style&quot;) :version (lambda (_) (require &#x27;tex-site) AUCTeX-version))) (use-package latex :ensure nil :mode (&quot;\\.tex\\&#x27;&quot; . LaTeX-mode) :after auctex :config (setq-default TeX-master nil) (setq-default TeX-command-extra-options &quot;--shell-escape&quot;)) (use-package jinx :demand t :bind ([remap ispell-word] . jinx-correct) :hook (emacs-startup . global-jinx-mode) :config (setq jinx-languages &quot;en&quot;) (set-face-attribute &#x27;jinx-misspelled nil :underline &#x27;(:color &quot;#ffcc00&quot; :style wave)))

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to get more in-depth in Haskell currently by doing the protohackers.com challenges. These challenges require your program to be a TCP server, accept connections, read some data (sometimes binary, sometimes UTF-8 encoded strings), and reply with some meaningful data.
 I&#x27;ve made decent headway in Haskell&#x27;s flavor of socket programming, using Network.Socket and Network.Socket.ByteString, and have successfully solved the first challenge. I find myself struggling with the myriad ByteString types, in that I&#x27;m constantly fighting to determine which flavor of ByteString each function needs and how to convert between them. When there&#x27;s this much of a struggle, I feel like I might be going about it the wrong way and would appreciate any insight here.
 My ByteString related imports:

                              <span>Hi there. I have a big org file that, after a batch conversion, is displaying all Spanish characters (ñ, á, é, í, ó, ú) with digits combinations. But only with I open it with emacs, not with any other editors like leafpad or mousepad. Any tip? 
 This is a sample of what I see: 
  
Trascripci\303\263n del texto escrito durante el d\303\255a del 30 de junio de 2016...
  
But open in leafpad, I see this: 
  
Trascripción del texto escrito durante el día del 30 de junio de 2016...

                              <span>Update: I can make all tables foldable by changing name to result, ex: +NAME: mytable1 to +RESULTS: mytable1. Not sure what are the cons in this &quot;solution&quot;. It&#x27;s better than incapsulating table in block BEGIN/END.
 Wonder why can&#x27;t be tables (+NAME blocks) be foldable by default? There is so many posts on stackoverflow, etc about it.
  
Original OP: Hello everyone!
 I use org tables with +NAME: field and usually no code block, example
 +NAME: mytable1
 | | col1 | col2 | col3 |
 | row1 | 5 | 10 | aaa |
 | row2 | 10 | 20 | bbb |
 | row3 | 10 | 40 | ccc |
 and i need to be able to fold them. I searched through different solutions online, and seems all stoped working due to recent org update.

 Is it possible to manually select which files go into each project? Example:
 I have following project strucutre:
 myproject/ 
 -----------/.git 
 -----------/mynotes.org 
 -----------/scripts/ 
 -----------/tests/ 
 -----------/logs/ 
 -----------/data/
 that&#x27;s the most logical dir set-up and most conveniet way to access file for me most of the time.
 However sometimes say i am working on &quot;pull_rss_feeds&quot; part of my project and need to access related files in scripts, tests, logs, data folders. So is there a way to manually create project pull_rss_feeds and tell exactly what files i want to be part of this projects?
 Another use case is my emacs config. Part of config is in my emacs folder, part is in .emacs.d folder... I would like to manually create emacs project and tell exactly where files are.

                              <span>I want to use Eglot when editing HTML or CSS files. From Eglot&#x27;s source code,
 (html-mode . ,(eglot-alternatives &#x27;((&quot;vscode-html-language-server&quot; &quot;--stdio&quot;) (&quot;html-languageserver&quot; &quot;--stdio&quot;)))) ((css-mode css-ts-mode). ,(eglot-alternatives &#x27;((&quot;vscode-css-language-server&quot; &quot;--stdio&quot;) (&quot;css-languageserver&quot; &quot;--stdio&quot;)))) 
 In order to install these language servers, I tried to use npm but I&#x27;m not very familiar with it. In particular, if I don&#x27;t want to install them using root privileges, what should I do? npm install -g vscode-langservers-extracted for example, attempts to install everything in /usr/local/lib/node_modules.
 I also tried npm install --save vscode-langservers-extracted to get all packages in a folder but have no idea how to hook it with Eglot.

                              <span>tl;dr: what i want is fuzzy find my way through my projects, and then after choosing one, all the buffers or terminals get re-opened from last time.
 if you don&#x27;t know projectile. it&#x27;s basically a package that let&#x27;s you index all your project directories so that later you can just fuzzy find your way to what you want to work on.
 so you look for the project -&gt; tap enter -&gt; then you will be prompted to choose the file from inside that project.
 this is great. but if i close emacs and then i open it again (for whatever reason) i have to look for and re-open the same files i was working on.
 i guess what i need is a way to fuzzy find through my projects (like in projectile) but instead of prompting with choosing a file (after i pick a project) it will re-open the same buffers that were opened last time.
 ps: i sort of asked about this before but i think that i didn&#x27;t communicate my issue properly.
 thanks

                              <span>Hi guys i&#x27;m totally new to emacs and here (this is my first post).
 Let me describe my problem: i installed typescript-language-server protocol on emacs and via npm (don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s required btw, installing both for my system and emacs).
 After 5-6 hours strulling i did it ! I got it working, now i can select any .js file in my react folder, i can activate lsp by &quot;C-x lsp&quot;, works totally great until i move on another .js file. The language server works for only one file i&#x27;m currently on, i need to enable it for every .js file and that&#x27;s odd. Can you help me ? Thanks in advance !
 Edit: Thank you u/Bortolo_II , i solved the problem by adding (add-hook &#x27;js-mode-hook &#x27;lsp) to my ~/.config/doom/config.el file then did doom sync and everyting is fine now !

                              <span>I have been a sporadic Emacs user. it has been my fav text editor. I love its infinite extensibility compared to alternatives like Vim. However I have been wondering if Emacs is on its way down.
 I guess it all started with the birth of NeoVim about a decade back. The project quickly grew and added features which made it better of an IDE than stock Vim (I think). Now i know Vim is not designed to be an IDE, but many NeoVim users seem to want that functionality. Today neovim has plugins t not only code and autocomplete, but also debug code in most languages. i lbelieve it has been steadily attracting users of stock Vim (and of course Emacs)
 Then enter, VSCode about 6 years ago. I guess this project attracted a lot of users from aother text editors (including Emacs). Today it has an extension for everything. Being backed by microsoft means its always going to be better.
 Now whenever I try to look up solutions for Emacs issues on the web, most posts i see are at least 10 years old. For example, I googled for turning Emacs into a web dev IDE. A lot of reddit and Stackoverflow posts that the search turned up were more than a decade old.
 I am wondering if Emacs is on a steady decline . The fact that it is not available by default on many systems seems to be an additional nail in its grave. Even on this sub, a lot of Emacs lovers who used to post regularly, like redguardfoo and Xah are no longer active
 This makes me sad. I absolutely hate having to install a browser disguised as a text editor (VS Code) which will be obsolete probably by another 5 years. I hope that Emacs stays around. Its infinite extensibility is what i love the most (and of course elisp) 
 Would like to hear your thoughts

Yank works successfully and kill/save only works when running the function under edebug… it successfully shows up in my system when stepping through and just letting it continue. But when I disable debug on entry it stops working again.
 In debug mode I see it enters the following function, iterates through some selection stuff, then shows up in my clipboard. Has anyone seen this before, the C code hasn’t seem to changed in years. https://github.com/emacsmirror/emacs/blob/670e8db683c94cfaf7c3328b47be54147795250f/src/pgtkselect.c#L143.

                              <span>In the world of Emacs, there&#x27;s a perennial debate between purists who swear by Emacs&#x27; native keybindings and those who find solace in the familiarity of Vim keybindings through Evil Mode. Proponents of Emacs keybindings argue for their extensibility and deep integration with Emacs&#x27; ecosystem, while advocates of Evil Mode tout its efficiency and the muscle memory carried over from Vim.
 For those who&#x27;ve made the switch, what are your experiences with either Emacs keybindings or Evil Mode? Did you find one to be more intuitive or productive than the other? How seamless was the transition from Vim to Evil Mode within Emacs? And for Emacs veterans, do you find that sticking to Emacs keybindings offers advantages that outweigh the allure of Evil Mode?
 Share your thoughts, tips, and insights on navigating the Emacs keybindings vs. Vim (Evil Mode) dilemma in Emacs, and help others find their preferred path to a more efficient editing experience.

                              <span>I&#x27;m in charge of a small team working on a small web app, which is a typescript/express project. It&#x27;s still pretty small, and I&#x27;m already seeing it spiral into the spaghettiverse. I do plenty of code reviews, we refactor stuff, we make healthy use of generics and tests, but it still doesn&#x27;t feel clean.
 For context: I&#x27;ve only ever worked on awful codebases. My biggest work project before this was a php + symfony project that was so riddled with dependency hell that the previous devs couldn&#x27;t get composer to work, so they started FTP&#x27;ing the dependencies around to new instances (and to new dev&#x27;s work computers!!).
 So this is the first time I feel like I have an opportunity to work with something that isn&#x27;t a mess. I thought that typescript with a strict focus on type safety would do the tr…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to get stack traces from a live running GHC (version 9.2.2) compiled Haskell program. 
 I understand I need to send SIGQUIT to the process to get the stacktraces of the currently running threads.
 But everytime I do this I just get the message: &quot;This build does not support backtraces.&quot;
 This is what I have done:
  
Our build is using nix, so I&#x27;ve added the following to the overrides for the GHC build:
  
 ghc &#x3D; old.ghc.overrideAttrs (oldAttrs: { configureFlags &#x3D; oldAttrs.configureFlags ++ [&quot;--enable-dwarf-unwind&quot;]; buildInputs &#x3D; oldAttrs.buildInputs ++ [pkgs.elfutils]; }); 
  
I&#x27;ve added the following flags to all the builds of our packages:
  
 -ticky -g -fprof-auto -fprof-auto-calls 
  
I added the flag --enable-debug-info to the cabal build command. 
  
I don&#x27;t know what else to do. The docs say:
  
On POSIX-compatible platforms GHC’s runtime system (when built with libdw support) will produce a stack trace on stderr when a SIGQUIT signal is received
  
It doesn&#x27;t say here how to build with libdw support, but I read somewhere elsewhere that one needed to add --enable-dwarf-unwind, and indeed when I did that the GHC build initially complained about not being about to find the libdw library until I added elfutils to the buildInputs.
 The error message also doesn&#x27;t make it clear whether the build of GHC doesn&#x27;t support backtraces or the build of my executable doesn&#x27;t support backtraces. Which makes hunting this down even more difficult.
 What am I missing? Is there anyway to ask GHC whether it&#x27;s compiled with libdw support so I can at least work out whether the problem is with the GHC build or the build of my executable?
 (x-post from https://discourse.haskell.org/t/how-to-get-stack-traces-out-of-ghc-executables/8844 sorry I&#x27;m not sure the best place for these questions)

                              <span>I’m a software engineer (using TypeScript and Rust mostly) working mainly in Web Development and some Enterprise/Desktop Development.
 I recently used Haskell for the 2023 Advent of Code and fell in love with it. I’d love to work more with Haskell professionally, but it doesn’t seem widely used in Web Development.
 Folks using Haskell professionally: what’s your role/industry? How did you get into that type of work? Do you have any advice for someone interested in a similar career?
 Edit: thanks for all the responses so far! It&#x27;s great to see Haskell being used in so many diverse ways! It&#x27;s my stop-looking-at-screens time for the night, so I wish you all a good night (or day as the case may be). I really appreciate everyone for sharing your experiences and I&#x27;ll check in with y&#x27;all tomorrow!

This is another installment of the What Are You Working On? thread. Add to this discussion by telling us about your zettelkasten journey. Share with us what you&#x27;re learning. Sharing helps me and, hopefully, you, too. It helps me clarify my goals and visualize my thinking. And sometimes, a conversation sparks a magical moment where we can dive into an idea worth exploring. We&#x27;d love to hear more from you.  🫵🏼
Ideas I&#x27;m exploring with my ZK:
I&#x27;m adventuring on the path of a project-filled life. I&#x27;m using my ZK to document and reflect on ideas and progress centered around a project-filled life. I&#x27;m coming to this late in life; I&#x27;m 67, but that doesn&#x27;t matter. I&#x27;m here now, and I&#x27;ve started. We&#x27;ll see.
Why create a routine of short knowledge cycles, because it&#x27;s a simple process of recording and reviewing.
I&#x27;m looking at OpenAI&#x27;s ChatGPT as a tutor for exploring ideas.
I&#x27;m using my ZK to explore what it means to have an intellectual life.
Things I&#x27;m reading:
Sertillanges, A. G. and Ryan, Mary. The Intellectual Life: Its Spirit, Conditions, Methods. 1987.
Zentner, Jeff. The Serpent King. First Ember edition, Ember, an imprint of Random House Children’s Books, a division of Penguin Random House LLC, 2017.

I&#x27;m tempted to try replacing the current buttons it depends on with a tree widget or perhaps try my hand at getting the caret icon to change from left to down depending on whether the subsection is folded or not.

I also have the grammars (TS and TSX) installed with treesit-install-language-grammar from GitHub.
 The treesit-font-lock-level is the default 3.
 It seems to work OK except that it does not color the code (for instance, the HTML tags and classes):
 Am I missing something important in my configuration?

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently trying to save my org files after every change. I know this might be sub optimal but I want to finish this at least for the purpose of learning how to do something like this.
 So my approach was to add a hook for org mode that adds a hook for after-change-functions. Unfortunately this is active for all files once I&#x27;ve opened an org file. This is the code
 (defun savebuf(begin end length) (if (and (buffer-file-name) (buffer-modified-p)) (save-buffer))) (add-hook &#x27;org-mode-hook (lambda() (add-hook &#x27;after-change-functions &#x27;savebuf))) 
 So I added another hook for major mode changes to remove the after-change-functions hook like this
 (defun leave-org-mode-function() (when (eq major-mode &#x27;org-mode) (lambda() (remove-hook &#x27;after-change-functions &#x27;savebuf)))) (add-hook &#x27;change-major-mode-hook &#x27;leave-org-mode-function) 
 Unfortunately this doesn&#x27;t seem to work. The first hook still stays active and saves everything regardless of major mode. Any Ideas how I could make this work?

                              <span>I recently upgraded to emacs 29.2 on MacOS Sonoma via brew. Not thoughtfully as a mass update of everything. Things are mostly working with one exception that is very annoying to me. If I enable and use the auto-complete package, quitting emacs takes approximately 40 seconds.
 I&#x27;ve profiled the functions listed in kill-emacs-hook and the problematic function is ac-comphist-save. This function writes out a file: ~/.emacs.d/ac-comphist.dat, which on my system is approximately 73K. I searched and found an exchange about someone having the same problem on an older version of emacs on linux, and the only offered solution was to remove ac-comphist-save from kill-emacs-hook. Sadly, this affects the effectiveness of auto-complete as it doesn&#x27;t remember what completions you&#x27;ve used repeatedly and r…</span>

 Anybody knows if there exists a formal representation out there of Haskell&#x27;s hierarchy of typeclasses (see picture below) into some kind of ontology like OWL/RDF? I&#x27;d see value into having this available.

                              <span>After reading and experimenting I&#x27;m about 99% sure this just isn&#x27;t possible. Basically, I was trying to lift the api version into the type system to clean up some code so that the focus of the code was on the business logic instead of determining what api version to use in a bunch of places / passing around a isV1 boolean everywhere. This does mean that the api version would need to be determined at runtime, and nothing I&#x27;ve tried has made it able to get the client implicitly. I thought with everything sealed and having implicit defs for both of V1/V2 that it would work, but I&#x27;m guessing type erasure / something with subtyping makes it indeterminable. I tried classtags and the aux pattern, but couldn&#x27;t get it to work. This is scala 2.12 btw. I have something like this:
 sealed trait ApiVersion object ApiVersion { sealed trait V1 extends ApiVersion sealed trait V2 extends ApiVersion } sealed trait ApiClient[Version &lt;: ApiVersion] class V1Client extends ApiClient[ApiVersion.V1] class V2Client extends ApiClient[ApiVersion.V2] object ApiClient { implicit def v1Client: ApiClient[ApiVersion.V1] &#x3D; new V1Client implicit def v2Client: ApiClient[ApiVersion.V2] &#x3D; new V2Client } abstract class WrapperDomainObject { type Version &lt;: ApiVersion } object WrapperDomainObject { def apply(thing: ApiThing) &#x3D; if (/* some business logic */) new WrapperDomainObject { override type Version &#x3D; ApiVersion.V1 } else new WrapperDomainObject { override type Version &#x3D; ApiVersion.V2 } } class Service { def serviceFn(thing: WrappedDomainObject)(implicit client: ApiClient[thing.Version]) &#x3D; client.doBusinessThing } 
 Is this possible?

                              <span>Hi all,
How do you find notes and chain of thoughts without backlinks, when your ZK grows up?
TL;DR
My ZK is about 455 notes (some atomic, some literature, etc...).
But reading your past threads a question arose in my mind: what happens when my ZK grows bigger, say hundreds or
Furthermore, I realise that the more I get accustomed to backlinks, the more I&#x27;m dependent on specific tools such as Obsidian (not all Markdown editors have backlinks).
That is, I&#x27;d like to move to IA Writer, that I like much more: it has wikilcnks, but not backlinks.
Hope it makes sense.
Thank you!</span>

 Windows emacs 29 (but same problem on Debian Bookworm).
 With fido mode enabled (built-in):
 org-ql-find
 [Error in post-command-hook (icomplete-post-command-hook): error &quot;Invalid completion style flex&quot;)]
 If I disable fido mode, no problem. I note this thread from June: https://github.com/alphapapa/org-ql/issues/284
 Can I provide any other info to help answers/fix it? Happy to raise an issue on GitHub if that&#x27;s appropriate. Thanks.

 Sometimes I use VS Code for work, to understand a plugin, and just to explore.
 Window splitting in VS Code drives me nuts. Window management is too closely tied up with tabs. You end up with an hierarchy of &quot;Editor Groups&quot; and &quot;Editors&quot; instead of being able to recall any buffer wherever you want. Then Quick Open (buffer switcher) opens a file multiple times—one per Editor Group. Using VS Code&#x27;s &#x60;revealIfOpen&#x60; option partially addresses this, but reveals in the previous Editor Group—it can&#x27;t recall the file into the Editor Group your cursor is currently in like in Emacs.
 We added &#x60;revealIfOpenInActiveGroup&#x60; to fix this. This allows you to make VS Code work just like Emacs buffers. Here are the docs for the Get Started page in VS Code docs:
 ### Simulating Buffers
 If you&#x27;re coming from buffer-centric editors such as Emacs or vi, you can emulate that workflow with:
 &quot;workbench.editor.showTabs&quot;: &quot;single&quot;,
 &quot;workbench.editor.revealIfOpen&quot;: true,
 &quot;workbench.editor.revealIfOpenInActiveGroup&quot;: true,
 &quot;workbench.editor.closeEmptyGroups&quot;: false,
 VS Code has a model where Editors live hierarchically within Editor Groups, and to split your screen you must use Editor Groups. Using &#x60;revealIfOpen&#x60; with &#x60;revealIfOpenInActiveGroup&#x60; causes Quick Open to move already-open Editors into the active Editor Group. This allows you to emulate buffer-centric environments—no tabs, split your screen, and you can view any Editor within any Editor Group without opening a file multiple times.

                              <span>I did the first half of the tutorial and skimmed the second half. I learned the hotkeys for moving around sentences and lines, moving up and down screenfuls etc. I did a lot of looking up about Emacs and am overwhelmed on how to get out of it what I want to. I want to learn more things like those hotkeys and how Emacs can be used to edit and navigate text fast. Are there any resources for that specifically, as well as complete guides to not only Emacs itself but the whole Emacs ecosystem? Are there any lists for all the popular ecosystem things like Spacemacs and Evil mode?

 is it possible to merge &#x60;evil-ex-search-history&#x60; with the &#x60;isearch-history&#x60;?
 I was looking around but could not find anything out of the box.

                              <span>I want to tell emacs to, for every c/c++ file, fold every syntax which starts and ends with, lets say:
 {{{ and }}}
 #ifdef PLATFORM_ and #endif
 and maybe i want to add few other syntaxes
 how to do that?
 (i&#x27;m aware outline-mode and hs-minor-mode exist, idk if i&#x27;m even supposed to use them together, or are they their own separate things..?)

                              <span>i started using emacs only for org-mode but i want so bad to just live in it while coding too.
 one thing that&#x27;s keeping me is that i can&#x27;t restore open buffers and what i was working on when opening a directory.
 in neovim it is as easy as installing a plugin an then it will work whenever you open neovim inside a directory.
 in doom emacs i found the workspace feature that i liked because it creates a new workspace whenever i use &quot;projectile switch&quot; but when i kill emacs all i find left is the last workspace (i don&#x27;t know if i am doing anything wrong but i am using SPC TAB . which is like &quot;M-x workspace switch to&quot;)
 i believe that i just don&#x27;t know the keyword to look for my solution (because that&#x27;s how i descovered Projectile too +\) )
 thanks for any help
 edit: lmao why so many down votes?

                              <span>Hi there. I&#x27;ve been back and forth with emacs and neovim for a long while now, preferring emacs but also kind of getting wrapped around the axel a bit with lisp. But, now as I start to move back to emacs (ORG mode is just too good, and I like some of the TUI abilities elsewhere that emacs gives me) , I&#x27;m looking for if there&#x27;s a generic and good way to set up LSP akin to neovim&#x27;s &quot;Mason&quot; project, which lets me just select the languages I need and properly set everything up.
 If not, that&#x27;s cool, but discoverability is still very weird in the editor world. I know how to use package managers and plan on starting a config with elpaca or straight, and then adding on evil and which-key and some doom-themes and doom-modeline, but the whole setup and configuration of various LSPs are where there&#x27;s a plethora of choice and I&#x27;m curious to see how people do it.
 Thanks!

                              <span>One of my favorite questions: How can I improve my Zettelkasten?
As an expert in our field, we are likely to find an answer. However, why not consider a different perspective on potential solutions? Here&#x27;s a concept for thinking outside the box, beyond the confines of one&#x27;s own thoughts. The key to a wide array of solutions lies in adapting well-known principles or frameworks from established sciences or schools of thought.

Can you re-find your own solutions to improve your Zettelkasten?

                              <span>Is it possible to specify directories that are used whenever org-wikinodes is looking for a headline? Right now it only works either in-file or in the same directory the file is in.

 It&#x27;s a game changer when you use dependencies like Jackson or OpenTelemetry for instance and want to keep all their modules version consistent easily across the dependency tree.

I wanted to install the haskell language server, but on the docs it says that I need to use ghcup. In your experience, could installing ghcup and pulling packages through it cause any conflicts or breaks in my xmonad?

                              <span>I get up four hours before work to bake, brew and grow mushrooms. There are many processes involved in each, and a lot of passive time during each process. 
 What I’ve been trying to figure out is how to automatically determine the best ordering of any given set of processes to maximize passive time, so I can free up as much of time as possible while also being more productive. How would you about accomplishing this?
 So far, I’ve got a ‘process.org’ file with a global process tag. I have a list of processes as headers, with properties like ‘TOTAL_TIME’, ‘ACTIVE_TIME’, etc. What makes it challenging is some processes need to occur sequentially and have active time between them or throughout. Like mixing flour and water, waiting, then adding yeast and doing the first fold, waiting, then folding again, waiting, then proofing and preheating oven, waiting, then baking and waiting. 
 What I’d like to be able to do is go through my process.org file and just change the TODO state to ‘NEXT’ then have the cumulative list of all processes for the next morning optimized for me.

                              <span>I just started using doom emacs and I wanted to increase it&#x27;s font size so I added the line (setq doom-font (font-spec :family &quot;Fira Code&quot; :size 18 :weight &#x27;regular)) to the config.el file in ~/.doom.d folder. Now the font size in emacs has increased but it is still the same as it was before in emacsclient. How do I make changes in the configuration so that they are reflected across both emacs and emacsclient? Any help would be appreciated.

                              <span>I last rewrote my init.el a decade ago, before use-package, and now it&#x27;s a giant heap of files, often one per added package to init a package, that get loaded in, along with various global settings that are adjusted through setq or function calls and then a custom.el
 And this works, but it takes some time to start emacs up....
 So I was thinking of re-doing this with the new fangled use-package all the kids are doing and was a bit dismayed to find now there are several other package managers, we went from none to plethora.
 At any rate, I was wondering what the best way to lay out an init.el was, especially regarding ordering of things like
  
loading of packages
 loading of custom.el (do I even need to explicitly load custom.el)
 setting of global settings via setq or function call
 key bindings
 other??
  
When I lay it out like this, I think that&#x27;s a pretty logical way of laying it out, but is it?
 What else should be considered in laying out an init.el to make it survive the decades?

 So I am not sure which version of emacs is the safest to install : the 28.3 one on Fedora that does not exist in the releases page, the 28.2 which got an update, the 29.1 or 29.2 that Fedora does not provide ?

                              <span>hi,
 im new into IT stuff and a freshman in uni and I worked only w vim till now. I decided to switch to emacs (doom) but im so clueless. Idrk which configs I should do, don&#x27;t know wich packages exist and which I should install, so a little instruction would really help me. im so lost and I don&#x27;t even know what I don&#x27;t know if you get what I mean? for now I only work w java, html, css and I can navigate through terminals, currently using wezterm but emacs is a completely new world to discover but it looks very promising but im obviously overwhelmed. Appreciate every help from u guys!

                              <span>In scala 2.X usually there is a method to go from one collection to the other. For instance, you go from a Queue to a List using queue.toList.
 But sometimes there is no method available. Take converting a List to a Queue, there is no toQueue available. You can always do Queue.from and that&#x27;s fine, but I&#x27;m wondering how does the to method works, does anybody have examples or is it just an internal mechanism?
 For instance, I&#x27;ve tried:
 (0 until 5).to(Queue[Int]) (0 until 5).to[Queue[Int]](Queue[Int]) 
 But both seem to be invalid. Any pointers? Just looking for ergonomic ways to do these conversions. One can always foldLeft or use the above-mentioned collection.from but it&#x27;s less ergonomic.
