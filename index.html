                              <span>With my new keyboard often I hit Meta instead of Super, with the result that I start passing numeric args to the next command instead which can be destructive when I don&#x27;t catch it in time and C-g out of it.
 Can I change my mode-line during numeric arguments being entered? I already do that when I&#x27;m in God Mode, so I would like to copy the same thing. Only, I don&#x27;t know a mode or other indicator for &quot;I&#x27;m entering numeric arguments now&quot;. How can I do this?

 This is the minimum I’m looking for:
  
“Jump to definition” should work, including when I jump into dependencies and keep going (which are installed into virtualenvs)
 Syntax errors, undefined variables etc, should be highlighted
 I should get completions/popups when writing code
 I need for support for multiple Python projects, each in its own virtualenv, often with different Python versions, preferably with very little setup required.
  
Trying this out with lsp-mode and the different options (pyright, pylsp), I’m hitting major bugs, and wondering if anyone else has actually got this working in a satisfactory way.
 With python-lsp-server I can’t figure out how to get it to see my virtualenv at…</span>

 I copied this diagram by Martin Grund from https://punchcard.wordpress.com/2010/10/09/emacs-movement-shortcuts-wallpaper/ with the aim of making a printable version. If you want to edit it yourself, I&#x27;ve got the original .drawio file in the gist too, but it only renders as text. You&#x27;d have to save it and open it with https://www.diagrams.net/ or the application you can download from there.
 I am still trying to figure out the best presentation of the printable version, so any general suggestions will be very much appreciated. The aim is to have something that will be visible and useful printed on a sheet of Letter or A4 paper, viewed from about 3 feet away. (in other words, the distance from my eyes to the patch of wall where I&#x27;ve got a copied pinned up!)

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 Trying to do more with emacs, I wanted to integrate my conda environments into my workflow. I spotted the conda.el package, and tried to install it with use-package : elisp (use-package conda :ensure t :init (setq conda-anaconda-home (expand-file-name &quot;~/miniconda3&quot;)) (setq conda-env-home-directory (expand-file-name &quot;~/miniconda3&quot;)) :config (conda-env-initialize-interactive-shells) (conda-env-initialize-eshell))  This does not pose any issue when evaluated (and I&#x27;ve checked on github, people do it that way). My miniconda install is indeed in ~/miniconda3. However, when I try to execute M-x conda-env-activate, I get the following message : Symbol&#x27;s value as variable is void : proper-dir
 Has anyone any idea how to fix this? Or is there another way to activate conda environments inside of emacs?

                              <span>Has anyone encountered the bug where you suddenly see a bunch of *.~undo-tree~ hidden files scattering everywhere? (Whenever I undo an edit in a file, a new file gets created with the same file name except with .~undo-tree~ file extension appended to it.) I&#x27;m not exactly sure what happened since this morning -- it was working fine then. I reinstalled Emacs and nuked the elpa packages and reinstalled them all, but the problem is still here. I&#x27;ve never seen this behavior before. Any help would be appreciated!

                              <span>EDIT: This has been solved in the comments.
 It seems to me that uuid is &quot;the way to go&quot; for creating IDs for linking since they are guaranteed unique, and will survive movement of a heading to another tree or file. Right?
 So I&#x27;m just starting to get into the whole linking-thingy in org mode, and it seems like I&#x27;ll need to call org-id-get-create just about every time before org-store-link. Rather than make both calls each time, would it make sense to create a new function, my-org-id-get-create-and-store-link, so it simply calls both functions? Could someone help me with a function that will do both id creating and link storing?
 I do have the following set:
 (setq org-id-link-to-org-use-id t) 
 Such a function must have been done before a thousand times, right? Or am I missing something in terms of id creation and workflow?

 Just published a blog post on how to build a Java timer/scheduler from scratch. It was a great excuse to explore the low-level mechanisms of concurrency in the JVM.Code snippets are in Scala!

 I hope to write a bunch more on the topic, if people find it interesting.

                              <span>I have a Python personal project that I&#x27;m trying to port to another language with a stronger type system. I&#x27;m new to Scala but it seems like one of the most promising choices.
 I use Linux at work but Windows on my personal laptop, which I still use for development. Yeah I know, everyone says developing on Windows sucks, but Git Bash fits decently well into my usual VS Code workflow, and until now I haven&#x27;t run into any issues big enough to need to dual-boot or use WSL. But with setting up a dev environment for Scala 3, I tried setting it up through Coursier as recommended and ran into a bunch of problems/annoyances with the installed tools. (I then tried the same thing on my Linux work laptop and everything worked smoothly right off the bat.) Here&#x27;s some of the issues:

 More importantly what (packages, libraries) would Haskellers love to have?

                              <span>Been a long time away from org-mode, several years. Org-mode used to manage my life, but due to unfortunate crises, I fell out of the habit. Updated my &#x60;init.el&#x60; to where EMACS would load without error, but org-mode still will not update using el-get as it should, nor will it compile without error.
 Upon attempting to run &#x60;make oldorg&#x60; I recieve the following output, which is generated output from &#x60;makeinfo --no-split org.texi -o org-info&#x60;
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; shell
 makeinfo --no-split org.texi -o org.info

 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 I am able to compile org without generating the info files, but encounter difficulties getting EMACS to autoload org-mode from the &#x60;lisp/&#x60; directory correctly. 
 Any suggestions would be appreciated, or a better place to seek help. Thanks in advance.
 Org on people, org on.

                              <span>Hi, I try to create a function that reads a file and creates a Map with the word as key and the value 1 for all of them, and setting 0 as default. I got the following function defined:
 def mapFile(filePath:String): Map[String, Int] &#x3D; { Source.fromFile(filePath).getLines().map { line &#x3D;&gt; line.split(&quot; &quot;).map{ word&#x3D;&gt; (word,1) }.toMap.withDefaultValue(0) } } 
 Basically, 1st I try to iterate over the lines of the file, and then iterate over each word that is obtained when the line is splitted by spaces. The problem that this is returning me Iterator[scala.collection.immutable.Map[String,Int]], not Map[String, Int], so Im getting and error.
 Any idea how could I get the desired Map with all the words and 1 values?
 An example would be having the following file as input:
 hello this is a test bye 
 And the output should look like:
 Map(&quot;hello&quot; -&gt; 1, &quot;this&quot; -&gt; 1 , &quot;is&quot; -&gt; 1 , &quot;a&quot; -&gt; 1 , &quot;test&quot; -&gt; 1 , &quot;bye&quot; -&gt; 1)

 Here the code, purely functional state, chp6
 The beginning is a example (create a purely state random generator) and the end with Candy is just the generalization of the example that suppose to introduce the state monad.
 The use case for candy (THIS JUST A FINITE STATE MACHINE):
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Let&#x27;s implement a finite state automaton that models a simple candy dispenser. The machine has two inputs: you can insert a coin, or you can dispense candy by turning the knob. It can be in one of two states: locked or unlocked. It also tracks how many candies are left and how many coins it contains.
 - Inserting a coin into a locked machine will unlock it if there’s still any candy left.
 - Turning the knob on an unlocked machine will cause it to dispense one candy and return to a locked state.

                              <span>I would like to get some feedback from people that have used this library for abstracting over tagless final code.
 I have been looking at the distage example (https://github.com/7mind/distage-example), and it looks very promising for writing effectful programs that work both with ZIO and cats-effect as the effect implementation. Although I do wonder if the same can be achieved by defining the APIs in terms of a trifunctor effect, instead of the bifunctor effect type showcased in the example.
 Would appreciate any input on this or links to further related materials.

                              <span>I am currently working at a quite well known startup in my country as a Data Engineer for more than 2 years. Primarily I do Data Analysis, because of my academic Machine Learning background, which makes my role closer to Data Scientist. 
 However, I am interested to work on Distributed System, Databases, and Stream Processing- that is Distributed Data Systems in broad. I wrote a Microservice in Golang in my current workplace. But I do not think this experience is sufficient to get hired as a Data Engineer working on Distributed Systems.
 I guess, after talking to some other Data Engineers and going through job posts, a project that involves mocking data streams, data ingestion with Kafka, data processing with Flink, serving with ad-hoc Scala microservices, containerization with Docker, and deploying on a Kubernetes (MiniKube perhaps?) cluster might help. What else to add or remove?
 What may I do to learn and later get hired to work as a Data Engineer working on Distributed Systems?

                              <span>Since monads can be seen as some sort of &quot;container&quot; (functor), you might expect monad transformers to &quot;contain&quot; a value of the base monad. It&#x27;s the opposite though: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/transformers-0.6.0.4/docs/src/Control.Monad.Trans.Maybe.html#MaybeT
 newtype MaybeT m a &#x3D; MaybeT { runMaybeT :: m (Maybe a) } 
 I would have expected &quot;Maybe (m a)&quot; instead of &quot;m (Maybe a)&quot;
 All the others I checked are similar (StateT and ExcepT).
 Is there a hand wavy explanation for that ? I can see that monad and transformer laws apply, but I don&#x27;t really understand why it&#x27;s this way.
 EDIT: Looks like I&#x27;m not the first to wonder https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/r20a4j/why_is_the_maybe_monad_transformer_defined_as/?utm_medium&#x3D;android_app&amp;utm_source&#x3D;share

                              <span>Hi I’ve been wondering, we’ve got Tweag‘s inline-java. And there’s an abandoned project providing .NET bindings. The Haskell Wiki states there’s no production ready approach currently available.
 I‘m immensely grateful for inline-java, and soon JVM‘s own FFI will improve over JNI, which is great in its own right. But do we have something for embedding C# code as well? Or some stable IPC to CLR or some other integrated way with little overhead that’s more robust than crude subprocessing or RPC?

                              <span>Fundamental question is :
 Is there a way to debug C++ in a docker with emacs ?
 What did you expect to happen?
 I&#x27;m launching gdb in emacs(I use DOOM) with this command after , gdb :
 gdb -i&#x3D;mi /docker:name_of_docker_container:/mnt/build/logicalError -ex &quot;set substitute-path /home/name_on_manjaro/CPP-Debug-Docker/ /mnt/&quot;
 I was expecting no issue because of &quot;set substitute-path&quot;.
 What actually happened?
 I&#x27;m trying to use gdb on code in a docker but it is not working well. I can debug with gud-gdb(console on left and code on right) but not with gdb &quot;gdb -i&#x3D;mi&quot; (with all information in 6 windows).
 I tried it on manjaro (and also ubuntu) with different projet. To be sure, I tested with this simple projet to reproduce with &quot;hello world&quot; and a docker and I have the same result : http…</span>

                              <span>Hey folks,
 Hope you&#x27;re doing great. I&#x27;m using Emacs for about 15 years (So basically a rookies in scale of Emacs :P). Based on my experience over the years and specially in the recent times, not many people know about the wonderful world of Emacs and why it is such a fascinating tool. To me they are missing out a chance to enjoy Emacs. So, a while ago I&#x27;ve decided to create a video series and talk about Emacs Lisp in context of a long running project to create an &quot;editor&quot; with Emacs Lisp, In hope to help more people to enjoy the tool that changed the way I use computers and brought me joy over all these years.
 Yesterday, I recorded the 4th episode of the video series. I thought to myself that It might be a good idea to share it on this subreddit as well. I have a looooooong term plan for this series and looking forward to your feedback.
 Like to the latest episode(4): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;NE1XUfrrGYI

                              <span>I have been switching to dired as a file manager and I wanted to send a file to someone. I see drag and drop only works for dropping a file onto emacs, and have not found a way to drop from dired to other windows. Is there a way to do this?

                              <span>Hi
 I&#x27;ve just updated to 27.1 on Ubuntu 21.10, and I&#x27;m encountering some weird behaviour with &quot;M-.&#x27;
 Basically, it pops up a small &quot;text bubble&quot; where I can type a macro, which can get executed with enter. (See screenshot)
 I cannot figure out which commando is bound to M-. so I can disable it. Describe-key does not seem to work and overwriting it does not seem to help either
 My previous behavior was that M-. was bound to xref-find-definitions.

 Does anyone know what could be wrong here?

 I wanted to order an Emacs t-shirt from FSF.org but the shipping cost of 16 USD for a t-shirt that costs 25 USD is quite high for me.
 Could please recommend me an online store where I can buy an Emacs t-shirt with low shipping cost? Thanks in advance!

                              <span>For certain reasons I am switching from LSP-mode to Eglot. I am a Python developer who works a lot with conda environments. Sometimes I will open a python file before realising I am in the wrong conda environment. This means the LSP server (pyright) started with LSP-mode uses the wrong Python interpreter, not giving completions for libraries which are envionment-specific.
 For this reason, in LSP-mode, I had:
 (add-hook &#x27;conda-postactivate-hook (lambda () (lsp-restart-workspace)))
 I cannot find the equivalent for Eglot. If I do:
 (add-hook &#x27;conda-postactivate-hook (lambda () (eglot-reconnect)))
 Note I am using the conda.el package for conda environment switching.
 This does not work, instead I get the error &quot;Error running timer: Process EGLOT (test/python-mode) not running&quot;
 Is there a way for me to cleanly restart Eglot in the buffer as though I had changed environments before visiting the file? Note, if I change environments first and then open the file, Eglot is correctly started in the proper environment.
 Any help appreciated!

                              <span>Sometimes, when I decide to remove a link, I also need to remove the local file it is pointing at. Would it be at all possible for me to remove both using a single command, say, org-remove-link-and-trash-linked-file? For a safety measure, I&#x27;d rather use move-file-to-trash than to actually delete the associated file. 
 I already have this function to trash the current file, which works on my system (Linux Manjaro):
 (defun my-move-to-trash () (interactive) (if (y-or-n-p &quot;Trash this file?&quot;) (progn (setq this-buffer buffer-file-truename) (move-file-to-trash (buffer-file-name)) (kill-current-buffer) (message &quot;%s was trashed&quot; this-buffer))) nil)) 
 Thanks!

                              <span>I have been trying to figure out if there is a way to create a section in an org file that has instantiations of different images to be used as figures later in the document where they do not get exported there, but do get exported later when they are referenced.
 Using DOOM Emacs, and exporting to PDF via LaTeX
 * Pictures Used :noexport:
 #+caption: something here
 #+name: fig:test
 [[filepath]]
 * This should be exported
 [[fig:test]]
 ​
 or something along these lines. The issues that arise are
  
the :noexport: stops the fig:test from being referenced at all and doesn&#x27;t export
 if the :noexport is removed, then it just exports inside the Pictures Used section, and a link is created to that location where I want the image itself
  
any help on this matter would be very useful, thank you.

                              <span>Hi all. I have this very simple org file,which looks like this:
 #+LATEX_HEADER: \usepackage[scaled&#x3D;1.5]{helvet} \renewcommand\familydefault{\sfdefault} Testing equation #+BEGIN_EXPORT latex \begin{equation*} 1 + 1 &#x3D; 2 \end{equation*} #+END_EXPORT 
 Basically, just write out a line and then a Latex export block. The first line can be used to control the font size, by setting scaled to be whatever you want, it is set to 1.5 in this case. I cant seem to change the font size of the export latex block. You can see in this picture below:
 ​

 The body text is gigantic but the latex export font is not affected. How do I change this font size globally? I have a lot of these Latex export in my real document, and would like to know how to do that. 
 Appreciate all the help.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve got a project that I&#x27;m working on for managing projects, I&#x27;m calling it projectwarrior (because it is built to integrate with taskwarrior). I want to add a project open command which would check org-roam for a node associated with this project and create one if it can&#x27;t find one (The idea is that this node would contain the project&#x27;s support material a la GTD). I had originally thought to use org-roam-protocol&#x27;s roam-ref, but I think I don&#x27;t understand how the file-ref which org-roam-protocol requires works.
 It seems intended mostly for citation purposes, which I think could work (maybe there&#x27;d be a way to get from emacs back to the projectwarrior project eventually?). But to do that, I think I&#x27;d need to write some sort of custom citation format. Unfortunately my Google-fu is failing me at the moment, as searching &quot;new org-ref protocol&quot;, &quot;custom org-roam-ref citation format&quot; and several other related results hasn&#x27;t brought up any results that pointed me in the right direction. So, here&#x27;s the question(s):
  
Is there a way I can suppress the warnings from org-roam when I put a ref that is plaintext? This isn&#x27;t actually my preferred solution, but I figure I&#x27;d start here.
 Is there a place I can find instructions on how to create a custom whatever-it-is that org-roam is expecting in the ref field?
 Is there another approach to opening (or creating if necessary) an org-roam node from the command line? Would something like emacsclient (open-this-node ) that might be simpler and easier to create?
  
Thank you in advance for the help!

                              <span>Is this the correct use of a Monad Transformer?
 In my current code I have some pipes and a Consumer that logs info about incoming data, eg:
 haskell ledgerFoundInfo :: (Monad m, MonadIO m) &#x3D;&gt; AtomicLRU Int Ledger -&gt; Consumer Ledger m r ledgerFoundInfo cache &#x3D; forever $ do msg  show (lLedgerIndex msg)) liftIO $ infoM &quot;Ledger&quot; (&quot;Has processed ledger this run: &quot;  show (isJust exists)) liftIO $ debugM &quot;Ledger&quot; (&quot;Received ledger data: &quot;  show msg)  
 Is this bad? How would I make this more FP style? Is there some Free Monad/type system magic I could use here?
 Thanks and sorry if I&#x27;m dumb.

                              <span>Hi!
 [Disclaimer] I just started learning Scala. So I hope this question is not too basic.
 I&#x27;m doing the Advent of Code 2021 challenges to get a feeling for the language. Day 2 is a task where we have to parse a file, where each line contains a command. Each command updates one of 2 variables. I&#x27;ve tried to implement this using a functional programming style. I convert the commands to (Int, Int) tuples, where each element is a delta introduced by the command. Then, I need to sum these tuples element-wise (like a vector sum). Doing this sum was not very nice, because Scala seems to disallow tuple destructuring in (anonymous) function parameter position. Am I missing something?
 Also, do you have suggestions how I could make my code more idiomatic? I would love to hear them!
 Thank you in advance!
  def problem1_tuples(input: Iterator[String]): Int &#x3D; { // input is an iterator of lines val (position, depth) &#x3D; input.map(s &#x3D;&gt; ( applyRegex(s,forward_pattern), // returns update for first value in tuple or 0 applyRegex(s,down_pattern) - applyRegex(s,up_pattern) // update for second value )).fold((0,0))((a,b) &#x3D;&gt; (a._1 + b._1, a._2 + b._2)) // this is *ugly* position * depth // the challenge asks for the product }

 What i expect to come out of this is
 (1, 2, 3) -&gt; (Inf stream of(i(1) ++ j(1) ,..., Inf stream of(i(3) ++ j(3)) -&gt; (Concurrent execution of those 3 infinite streams)
 But the resulting stream has the length of 0 and I don&#x27;t understand why. Can someone help me?

 I have below code in my config. Simple org-roam-bibtex config.
  (use-package! org-roam-bibtex :after (org-roam) :hook (org-roam-mode . org-roam-bibtex-mode) :config (require &#x27;org-ref) ;; (setq org-roam-bibtex-preformat-keywords ;; &#x27;(&quot;&#x3D;key&#x3D;&quot; &quot;title&quot; &quot;url&quot; &quot;file&quot; &quot;author-or-editor&quot; &quot;keywords&quot;)) ;; I can&#x27;t find this variable in orb ;; (setq orb-preformat-keywords &#x27;(&quot;&#x3D;key&#x3D;&quot; &quot;title&quot; &quot;url&quot; &quot;file&quot; &quot;author-or-editor&quot; &quot;keywords&quot;)) (setq orb-templates &#x27;((&quot;r&quot; &quot;ref&quot; plain (function org-roam-capture--get-point) &quot;&quot; :file-name &quot;${slug}&quot; :head &quot;#+TITLE: ${&#x3D;key&#x3D;}: ${title}\n#+ROAM_KEY: ${ref} - tags :: - keywords :: ${keywords} \n* ${title}\n :PROPERTIES:\n :Custom_ID: ${&#x3D;key&#x3D;}\n :URL: ${url}\n :AUTHOR: ${author-or-editor}\n :NOTER_DOCUMENT: %(orb-process-file-field \&quot;${&#x3D;key&#x3D;}\&quot;)\n :NOTER_PAGE: \n :END:\n\n&quot; :unnarrowed t)))) 
 after I start emacs, orb-xxx variables are not found in describe-variables. and I need to &#x27;(require &#x27;org-roam-bibtex)&#x27; to have orb-xxx variables loaded. 
 What is going on here? 
 Is there a reading material about this? I am truely exhausted.

The keybindings for the window show nothing of interest. I suppose it&#x27;s possible to update multiple modules at once. Right? Right?!...

 ​
 I would like to automatically refresh my *Python* (ipython) buffer when longer than x lines, without refreshing the variables.
 ​
 I had: 
 (add-hook &#x27;comint-output-filter-functions &#x27;comint-truncate-buffer)
 ​
 But it doesn&#x27;t look like it&#x27;s doing anything... Any help is much appreciated! Thank you a lot!

                              <span>* Buy milk ... * Tasks ** Buy/Return 
 I want * Buy milk under the ** Buy/Return heading. Then the C-c C-w org-refile completion looks like
 Standard Tasks/Buy\/Return/ 
 That can get very confusing esp if you have a few slash alternatives in one or more headlines. If I were given the choice between reserving the slash char for my human-readable org headlines vs. used in the completion tree syntax, I&#x27;d rather the completion tree syntax look more like this:
 Standard Tasks%Buy/Return% 
 or perhaps:
 Standard Tasks|Buy/Return| 
 But if I have to live with it, I guess I could use the pipe char
 * Buy milk ... * Tasks ** Buy|Return 
 Then 
 Standard Tasks\Buy|Return\

                              <span>Hi all. I previously posted about Vertico, Marginalia, and Orderless and Corfu, Kind-icon, and Corfu-doc.
 This time I wrote on Cape!
 I highly recommend using cape to those who use corfu. It provides many useful completion-at-point-functions as well as transformers such as cape-capf-buster and cape-capf-silent. My favorite is cape-company-to-capf which converts company backends to completion-at-point-functions! This was the killer feature for me.
 Though this post is less thorough and has less &quot;developed&quot; code than my previous two posts, I hope a few of you still find it useful :)
 Edit: Some of you may notice the website redesign. I hope it adds clarity.

                              <span>Helll Guys I recently tried using dap mode for debugging and it worked fine in GUI. In terminal it was mostly good expect for breakpoints not showing on the left fringe.
 Has anyone encountered this and knows how to fix it ? Otherwise i might try something with a background overlay upon breakpoint toggle but that would be suboptimal
 Thanks !

                              <span>Hi all, I&#x27;m looking into writing some new functionality for emacs and as part of it need to be able to dynamically highlight individual characters, I&#x27;ve looked into messing with font-lock-mode briefly but that seems to be more geared to syntax highlighting based on regex. 
 I also tried using put-overlay and am now trying the highlight.el package but the way I&#x27;ve written it so far doesn&#x27;t actually work and I&#x27;m not sure why. Can anyone point me in a better direction if this ain&#x27;t the way/tell me where I&#x27;m screwing up?
 first I define a face:
 (defface position-1-face &#x27;((t (:foreground &quot;#FF0000&quot; :weight bold))) &quot;The face for the first increment out of from the cursor&quot; :group &#x27;increment-faces) 
 Then I apply it like this
 (when (&#x3D; neg (point-min)) (hlt-highlight-region neg neg &#x27;position-1-face)) 
 Where plus and neg are values that are 10 characters from the current point in either direction. My eventual goal with this is to have characters like 10, 20 and 30 characters out from the cursor highlighted so I can jump around more easily without having to figure out distances. 
 I know the faces are getting applied from the output of describe-char but they do not seem to actually show up.
 Ideally I&#x27;d like to drop the dependence on highlight.el so if there is a better built in way then please do let me know

                              <span>Hey there, I&#x27;d like to program some stuff for my arduino via (doom) emacs, but there are a few things, that I need:
  
Syntax Highlighting
 Auto completion
 Support for Arduino and Teensy
  
What I have tried
  
https://github.com/arduino/arduino-language-server - It needs modification of lsp-mode though, as it doesn&#x27;t support passing cli arguments ootb
 https://github.com/motform/arduino-cli-mode and https://github.com/yuutayamada/company-arduino/ - Together they seem somewhat fine, but as soon as the project has a few .c/.cpp files the .ino triggered arduino-cli-mode poofs.
  
What I want to avoid
 Installing an IDE, I want to stay with emacs as far as possible. I don&#x27;t like chonky bloated IDEs
 Other options
 https://github.com/sudar/Arduino-Makefile - How with the above mentioned QOL though
 Note: I&#x27;m very unfamiliar with elisp, I can do very basic things via trial and error while copying other stuff from my config.
 Do you have any idea what could be done here? I have tried everything I could.
 Thanks!

                              <span>Just an FYI for all windows users. I installed Gccemacs on my work computer last night, and the process was very simple.
  
Install Msys2
 In Msys2 terminal, install libgccjit. Add to $PATH if it&#x27;s not already there.
 Download emacs 28 or 29 from GNU: https://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/pretest/windows/ and run it. I used 28.0.91 build.
  
The snapshot Emacs binaries are compiled with native comp. It just works.
 Thanks to the dedicated folks that create window binaries.

                              <span>Sorry guys if I am being annoying, but I got another problem that I cannot figure out by myself.
 As stated previously I was following the old emacs from scratch series from system crafters youtube channel to customize my emacs and it throws of error along with the line loading file .../elpa/bind-key-number.number/bind-key.elc failed to provide feature &#x27;bind-key&#x27;
 So, at first, I thought I may don&#x27;t have the package but when I tried installing it I was failing. So I searched the web a bit and found this bind-key file from tumashu/elpa git repo. So I copied it and pasted it in my bind-key.elpa file. After evaluating the buffer if I re-evaluate my init buffer everything seems to work. But if I re-start emacs the error comes back again which again goes off after re-evaluating the said buffers. 
 Is there any permanent fix for this problem? What am I doing wrong?

 tl;dr: I&#x27;m usually at least as happy with M-&amp; and dired as I am with bash in a terminal. Keyboard macros replace bash one-liners.

 emacs-pgtk-native-comp-git 29.0.50.154614-1 (An unofficial fork combining the development branch of GNU Emacs (including native compilation) with the new rendering engine PGTK.)
 emacs-git 29.0.50.154805-1 (Development branch of GNU Emacs. As of June 2021, it includes support for native compilation merged from the Emacs&#x27; branch: feature/native-comp ) 
 so emacs-git is the official development branch but it only includes native compile feature. 
 emacs-gcc-wayland-devel-bin and emacs-pgtk-native-comp-git seem to include native compile AND pgtk (pure gtk which is what is needed to run emacs as a native wayland app), so between these two, which should i pick? which one are people running for using emacs natively on wayland?

                              <span>I am fairly new to emacs and recently started customising it following the emacs from scratch video series from system crafters. But I am stuck at the line to set the font.
 First I thought maybe I haven&#x27;t installed the font so I installed it using pacman. It installed it in &quot;/usr/share/fonts/TTF/FiraCode-Retina&quot;.
 Now how do I use this font in emacs?
 (set-face-attribute &#x27;default nil :font &quot;?&quot;)
 What do I put in the position of ?. I have tried putting the font name. Font name along with its absolute path. And some other variations. But everytime it just says font not found!
 Thank you for your help.
 ...
 Ok, that was a stupid mistake on my part.
 I just used &quot;Fira Code Retina&quot; and it seems to work. Sorry for the trouble!

                              <span>Hi all. I am customizing a Nord theme. The problem is that the face for hl-line kinda looks too much like the face for when you try to select a text using evil visual mode (press V)/. If without evil mode, this same face can also be shown if you just drag select using mouse. This is what I meant on a Nord theme:
 ​
 Nothing selected, just hl-line highlighting current line
 ​
 You can barely see the word VISUAL under Visual mode in vim (pressing V)
 ​
 Again, here I drag and select the word VISUAL using the mouse. Hard to see
 To see things clearly, I use a different light theme:
 ​
 Normal with only hl-line face color
 ​
 Here you can see both the hl-line and the vim Visual/drag select very clearly.
 Question: What is that face name, he one you drag select/highlight using evil? I tried to do an M-x customize and type &quot;evil&quot; but I got are something like evil-ex-search
 Any input is greatly appreciated.

Orders are managed (buy / sell / replace / cancel) with Emacs. When there are a few seconds to spare, I navigate in Emacs to the order replace template (widget) and type in the new value to replace an existing order; e.g., 15.00 and C-u C-c C-c to send. [Absent a universal argument is used when I want to inspect the proposed order before sending.] Sometimes there are substantially less than a few seconds to spare, and a faster method is needed. I suppose I could use a keyboard shortcut such +/- and C-u C-c C-c to send when the value is correct.

                              <span>Lumi is looking for Haskell and PureScript engineers to grow our supply chain platform. Lumi helps manufacturers around the world make their capabilities available directly to ecommerce brands. We are open to remote candidates in the US and UK.
 https://www.lumi.com/jobs
 We are looking for a full-stack developers with skills in both backend and frontend development.
 We use PureScript and React on the frontend and Haskell and Postgres on the backend. On the PureScript side, we use our own purescript-react-basic bindings, and purescript-lumi-components, a UI component library that we built and open-sourced. We get a lot of utility from PureScript’s type system, leveraging the compiler in order to ensure that we don’t get IDs for different entities mixed up, that all API calls are type correct, and that all form data is appropriately validated before it is used. On the Haskell side, we primarily use Servant and Esqueleto. We don’t expect candidates to have experience with all these things. We’d like to find engineers who are interested in learning more about these, and we’ll be happy to teach you.
 Lumi was recently acquired by Narvar, where we are continuing to grow the team and leveraging Narvar’s experience building the software infrastructure that powers billions of e-commerce shipments for companies like Patagonia, Nike, GAP, Home Depot, etc.

                              <span>imo FRP is so so good. Its paradigm feels extremely natural in a way beyond the complexity of its encoding would suggest. eg looking at the implementation of reflex a few times, it seems to basically implement an entire runtime system on top of haskell&#x27;s runtime system.
 On one hand it&#x27;s very cool that haskell is flexible enough to implement a runtime system as a library, but I wonder if there&#x27;s gains to be made in something more wired in (eg in terms of optimization, simplifying compile times, simplifying types, etc.) - it always struck my as a bit hacky.
 I know elm used to have builtin FRP but dropped it (I don&#x27;t recall exactly why - any insight here would help!)
 Perhaps a proper &quot;dataflow&quot; language - though my (poorly informed) impression is that these are all way more special purpose and I&#x27;ve been spoiled by the full power of haskell.
 What do you think?
 EDIT: Looking into it more now - I redescovered this explanation of why Elm dropped FRP. It&#x27;s honestly pretty disappointing - I understand from a developer UX perspective this simplifies a lot of things, but I&#x27;m not a fan of the redux &quot;smash-everything-into-one-type&quot; pattern - and a big draw for FRP is having the control flow represent dependency locality rather than synchronizing everything on one monlithic state

                              <span>Title is kinda confusing, wasn&#x27;t sure how to phrase this.
 I have a type Contact defined as follows :
 type Contact &#x3D; (Person, State)
 I have a function in which I want to take some information about a Person to create a new Contact (with State &#x3D; Good), and add it to a list of contacts, which looks like this :
  addContact :: Person -&gt; [Contact] -&gt; [Contact] addContact p c &#x3D; c ++ (p, Good) 
 Compiler is complaining with the following message : Couldn&#x27;t match expected type [Contact] with actual type (Person, State)
 But given that I have defined that Contact is a tuple with (Person, State), how am I supposed to declare that it is indeed a Contact? I can&#x27;t seem to be able to create an instance of it because it&#x27;s not a data type, just a type.

                              <span>I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if this isn&#x27;t possible, but I&#x27;m trying to include parts of a code block in another and not the whole thing like you usually do. E.g. only line 1 to 5 or something, but not 6 through 10.
 From the docs, I see it&#x27;s possible to pass parameters, but I&#x27;m not sure if the same can be done for including a code block limited to certain line numbers. Couldn&#x27;t find much online and stack exchange is down for maintenance right now too.
 If I&#x27;m explaining it badly I basically want to do like:
 #+name: test #+start_src :noweb yes Line1 Line2 Line3 Line4 #+end_src #+start_src &gt; #+end_src 
 So I get:
 #+start_src Line1 Line2 #+end_src 
 I can live without it, but it&#x27;d be nice to not need to split up the code block when I&#x27;m doing cursed code additions.
 Also, I&#x27;m on my phone. Sorry if it looks horrible or the syntax is all wrong.

                              <span>Lumi is looking for Haskell and PureScript engineers to grow our supply chain platform. Lumi helps manufacturers around the world make their capabilities available directly to ecommerce brands. We are open to remote candidates in the US and UK.
 https://www.lumi.com/jobs
 We are looking for a full-stack developers with skills in both backend and frontend development.
 We use PureScript and React on the frontend and Haskell and Postgres on the backend. On the PureScript side, we use our own purescript-react-basic bindings, and purescript-lumi-components, a UI component library that we built and open-sourced. We get a lot of utility from PureScript’s type system, leveraging the compiler in order to ensure that we don’t get IDs for different entities mixed up, that all API calls are type correct, and that all form data is appropriately validated before it is used. On the Haskell side, we primarily use Servant and Esqueleto. We don’t expect candidates to have experience with all these things. We’d like to find engineers who are interested in learning more about these, and we’ll be happy to teach you.
 Lumi was recently acquired by Narvar, where we are continuing to grow the team and leveraging Narvar’s experience building the software infrastructure that powers billions of e-commerce shipments for companies like Patagonia, Nike, GAP, Home Depot, etc.

 Evidently that&#x27;s not right. It doesn&#x27;t work and the C-h v for the variable says something like

 Can someone explain the difference between a single quoted vaule and a double quoted value, and how to explicitly set the former in elisp? Thanks!

 emacs-mac only
 I&#x27;ve been trying to switch to Org-mode for note-taking, coming from Evernote, Notes.app, etc. I love the organizational power and security of plain text, but one thing I could never understand: why can&#x27;t I just directly paste image/PDF data into an org file?
 I use this literally all the time, accumulating graphs, formulae, small screenshots, images from papers, websites, manuscripts, etc. The other key feature I needed was that cropped PDF data remained exactly that: a PDF file on disk. This is because I may later use it in talks, white-papers, etc., where preserving the vector quality is crucial.
 So, after some time trying (and failing) to convince myself such functionality must already exist, I wrote up a small package. Note that it unfortunately works only with the excellent emacs-mac variant, which provides (some) information about image data on the clipboard. I&#x27;m hopeful similar more general functionality could come to emacs/org in the future.

 I am on a journey to tried my best to live inside Emacs. (Just a fun challenge.)
 It would be much easier to live inside Emacs if I give up on JavaScript and give up on graphical dependencies.
 Just an add salt to the wound, I am using wsl2 with Ubuntu distro + window terminal + window. At times, I need to learn PowerShell command just to communicate effectively with window from within Emacs which is launched inside wsl2 Ubuntu distro.
 The problem I have now, mostly because I use either wsl2 or window are the following.
  
Seamlessly browse internet: Nynx should solve my problem, but I can&#x27;t even install it in Ubuntu wsl2 currently. The problem is that I still want to stick with Chrome because ecosytem is more rich.

                              <span>Hi, 
 I was a long time emacs user (5+ years), but left a few years ago at the start of my PhD, my main reason for abandoning was to move to VS code simply for easier use of jupyter notebooks. 
 I need them to be easily sharable, so using ORG as a replacement isn&#x27;t viable for me. 
 Spell check, autocomplete and documentation are also very important to me. 
 Does anyone have a good setup for editing Jupyter notebooks directly, without converting between formats in emacs? 
 If so, could you share your workflow, I&#x27;d be very keen to get back into emacs. 
 Thanks,
 AH

 Hey org-mode lovers,
 Have you ever been in the following situation?
 You have tried to understand a specific aspect of org-mode (say a command) and you have done the following:
  
you have played with the command (writing your own examples),
 you have read all the parts in the manual dealing with this command,
 you have read the docstring of the command,
 you have looked for explanations on the web,
 you even have read the source code of the command,
  
but you still haven&#x27;t figured it out after all the efforts.
 I&#x27;ve been in that situation and I thought it would be easier if there were more examples.
 BUT THERE ARE MORE EXAMPLES.
 We just have to change our lenses to see them.
 What if we looked at org-mode tests as example…</span>

                              <span>Hi all. In my emacs, whenever I type &lt;s and press TAB I would get an auto expand block like this:
 #+begin_src #+end_src 
 How do I make these headers to be capitalized? I have checked all my configs and there are no lines that said something about making the headers lower case. Interestingly, the Org website section 1.5 said that the default behavior should be capitalized, not lower case: https://orgmode.org/org.html
 There is this answer here but to switch to lower case instead: https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/34931/org-source-block-in-lowercase
 So I decide to experiment with the &quot;accepted&quot; answer and tried with upcase
 (mapc (lambda (arg) (setcdr arg (list (upcase (cadr arg))))) org-structure-template-alist) 
 This yields error about wrong type argument listp, export ascii which is the list of argument/header to be inserted in the variable: org-structure-template-alist
 Any help is greatly appreciated. 
 Thanks

                              <span>I know that workspaces by default restrict X windows to a specific workspace, but I have always disabled that function anyway. I&#x27;m just using tab-bar-mode right now but is there any actual reason to use workspaces instead?

                              <span>Hi,
I am writing a book and would like some feedbacks and best practices from you, regarding the method and organization.
I use now The Archive app and Google Docs.
Here is my organization:
I have a master file (a structure note) containing the outline of the book, ie the different chapters. Each chapter is a link in the structure note.
In the structure note, I put also some misc notes, like research notes.
I put a special tag in the filename of the chapters (like @b1 for book number 1).
I can check the total number of words up to date with the shell command: wc -w *@b1*.md
The step I didn&#x27;t like very much is that I need to edit and compile the chapters in another tool. I use Google docs for that. Each time I find a mistake in my content, I need to modify the content in Google Docs and in The Archive app (source of my content). Not very efficient.
Please comment my workflow and share your practices :-)
Thanks</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;ll actually ask the archiving question first, since it&#x27;s simpler: Is there any way to break up the archive files by year, so that anything I archive this year goes to journal.org_archive2022 or similar? I&#x27;m concerned that archives may grow too big and wondered if this could be automatic or if it&#x27;s just something I should do manually.
  
The second question is harder (for me). I&#x27;m trying to set up my capture templates such that every day is the date in ISO format plus the day of the week, so a capture would make a subheading under 2022-03-11 FRIDAY. 
 This is probably not going to be super hard, but the org manual is.... vague on how I would do it. The &quot;hard&quot; one is, I&#x27;d like to have another template that puts the subheading underneath not only the date but another subheading. So you&#x27;d wind up with:
 * 2022-03-11 FRIDAY ** Log *** Entered Subheading Text, Text [Entered at [TIMESTAMP]] 
 I have no idea how to even begin to do this, because I&#x27;m not sure of several things. 
 1) How to make emacs give the initial heading as an ISO date rather than a datetree
 2) How to make it double up on headings so I get Log
 3) How to make this all respect my extend-day-until setting, because I go to bed WAY after midnight
 I&#x27;m meandering here but I&#x27;m hoping someone can point me in the right direction. Thank you in advance.

                              <span>Hi,
 So I am trying to find an easy way of summarizing what I did do on a particular day or week.
 I am mostly using Todos/Tasks that I mostly complete through the Agenda view, but I also log smaller tasks, questions, stuff that showed up within the journal (C-c c j).
 What I am looking for is a way to just summarize all Todos that were closed and journal entries made on a particular day in one output.
 I looked a bit at clock table, but as I am not looking for &quot;time spent&quot; but rather &quot;what did I do - what was closed and logged?&quot; it doesn&#x27;t seemt to be the right tool.

                              <span>So my partner is moving in with me soon and she&#x27;s a &quot;normie&quot; and therefore won&#x27;t be using Org any time soon. I anticipate that we&#x27;ll need to share several lists (groceries, home shopping, errands,...) and, naturally, I want my lists to live in Org. So I was wondering what kind of more user-friendly list managers are out there that have a 2-way interface (read and write) with Org? Here are some qualifications:
  
I&#x27;m aware of Orgzly and I use it on my own phone but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s simple enough for someone who&#x27;s not invested in making it work.
 I found a github repo for syncing with Wunderlist but learned that Wunderlist shut down 2 years ago.
 For some things (e.g. events), we can use a shared calendar and I already have such a setup going with org-caldav-sync. I was wondering if there&#x27;s something similar people use for to-do lists, shopping lists, etc...

 But how to install them for terminal?
 I tried brew and sdkman, no success. There was installed M1 java. Only way I have found so far is to ask IDEA to download intel java and use sbt shell there. But it works not good.

                              <span>Hi all :)
 I have 1 year of experience as a research engineer and, I am studying scala to switch my career to a distributed system(DS) engineer within this year.
 Currently, I am following the scala course of Coursera, but many posts in this subreddit mention various scala frameworks. I want to know that it is necessary to cover famous frameworks like akka, ZIO, spark.
 I am not afraid to learn, but I just want to set priorities.
 Are there some frameworks or packages, which are commonly used in scala?
 (Like node of javascript Or NumPy, scikit-learn in Python. )
 Sometimes I check a job description of scala keyword on Linkedin, but many of them do not mention what they want to an applicant (They just say like &quot;we prefer scala&quot; or &quot;we use scala&quot;)
 So I am wondering where I have to focus to be a distributed system engineer.
 I studied distributed systems in graduate school, so my goal is to implement some DS toy projects using scala.
 Could I ask for advice to be a DS engineer?
 Thank you for reading :)

                              <span>Quoting from a stackoverflow answer: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2346872/what-does-the-symbol-mean-in-haskell
  
(and similarly a &gt;&gt;&#x3D; (b &gt;&gt;&#x3D; (c &gt;&gt;&#x3D; d)) is equivalent to
  
do r1 &lt;- a r2 &lt;- b r1 r3 &lt;- c r2 d r3 
 The bind operator makes a functions input be wrapped in the same thing as the output by unwrapping the value before each chained function.
 E.G.

 Is this the reverse? It unwraps rather than wraps the output. And it only works for IO types? I&#x27;ve got the impression that IO is special is this unique to the io type?

Currently the only cases where I do not care about a functions return value are for ones with side-effects. Also Haskell has no mutable state so if you discard a value from a pure function it has no effects, right?
 Is there any other use case for this operator?

                              <span>Hello Haskell-ers!
 I&#x27;m looking to implement a JSON linter and would appreciate some library / architecture suggestions. Some examples of the kind issues i&#x27;m interested in detecting are:
  
The field &quot;base_path&quot;, if it exists, cannot use Windows paths, must be POSIX
 The field &quot;date_created&quot; must be in ISO8601
 etc.
  
I&#x27;m capable of writing the linter rules (i.e. detect date formats, path formats etc.), what I need help with is the IO / initial parsing phase. I&#x27;m familiar with parser-combinators (attoparsec has been my goto previously) but never before had a use case that cares about where the parsing failed. I&#x27;ve also used aeson a couple of times for handling JSON.
 The defining requirement is that, once an issue has been identified, the linter must report the location of the error including line number(s) and column numbers (start and end). It can be assumed that the data is valid JSON and conforms to the expected schema (i.e. if we expect a &quot;date_created&quot; field, it&#x27;ll be there. I&#x27;m interested in format/quality issues rather than validating structure / syntax.
 Otherwise, the only requirement is that it be quick / run in parallel - It must be able to run over thousands of files in a couple of minutes.
 My initial plan was to use something like pipes-aeson for IO (not used a streaming library before but seems straightforward enough) however it seems that aeson is based on attoparsec and the parse-error is just a plain string without source locations.
 So, finally, to some questions.
  
Anybody have recommendations for parsing JSON (quickly) while keeping track of the source-locations of each field / key / value / object etc.
 Can streaming libraries like pipes be used to process the loaded files in parallel? Pointers / articles etc. covering this would be much appreciated!

 You don’t have to have Elm or Haskell experience, but it will help :)
 You do need to have interest in functional programming, but you probably wouldn’t be in this subreddit if you didn’t, now would you?
 Our shared working hours are 10 AM to 3 PM Eastern, you do need to be available during those hours, though we&#x27;re flexible if something comes up.
 $100,000-$120,000 but do not quote me on the compensation, that is from memory for our associate level, it could be less or more by $10,000.
 The job description is for a mid-level, we don&#x27;t have an associate FP job description. But just the technologies and the level are different, everything else should be the same.

 Hello,
 I am learning Haskell as part of a comp-sci course at University and have come across a wierd error when I try to build a package using cabal. 
 When I run cabal install, the installation fails due to the package wai-logger-2.4.0 not being able to build due to the package cabal-doctest-1.0.9 being broken with the specific error: 
 &quot;Could not find module Distributive.Extra.Doctest&quot;
 How can I fix this error?
 I have tried the following: 1. Reinstall cabal-doctest 2. Reinstall distributive 3. Delete and reinstall all cabal packages after running cabal update 4. Reinstall ghc
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;m currently creating a project which I wanted to try using opaleye for DB access in. I have an M1 Mac with 16GB of RAM and use ghc-8.10.7 by stack-2.7.5, both installed through ghcup.
 Soon after starting to build product-profunctors, I get an error
 -- While building package product-profunctors-0.11.0.3 (scroll up to its section to see the error) using: /Users/mateusz/.stack/setup-exe-cache/aarch64-osx/Cabal-simple_mPHDZzAJ_3.2.1.0_ghc-8.10.7 --builddir&#x3D;.stack-work/dist/aarch64-osx/Cabal-3.2.1.0 build --ghc-options &quot; -fdiagnostics-color&#x3D;always&quot; Process exited with code: ExitFailure (-9) (THIS MAY INDICATE OUT OF MEMORY) 
 When I rerun, I get the same result in a few secs. It must be very quick, as I don&#x27;t see any visible spike in memory usage on monitor (it oscillates around 9-10GB). /usr/bin/time -l shows rss of 200MB, but I guess it&#x27;s stack&#x27;s usage, not ghc&#x27;s.
 That&#x27;s strange to me as I compile a 300+ deps project at my work in a similar amount of RAM without problems, and I have also compiled stack on my 4GB Raspberry Pi (which took a lot of time, but didn&#x27;t outofmemory either). Is this package really that heavy, or there&#x27;s something wrong with my installation?

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to write a type class that will convert one type of error into another, e.g. Exception e &#x3D;&gt; e -&gt; Error. I&#x27;d like it to work for &quot;wrapped&quot; errors as well for convenience, e.g. Exception e &#x3D;&gt; Either e a -&gt; Either Error a. But I can&#x27;t seem to get around the problem of conflicting instances.
 (if you prefer code in a gist: https://gist.github.com/evanrelf/f5773113b3a50e3aee7f44ba2cc05ea5)
 The error type&#x27;s implementation isn&#x27;t important, so we&#x27;ll use a trivial one here:
 data Error &#x3D; Error deriving stock Show deriving anyclass Exception 
 I tried using functional dependencies:
 class ToError i o | i -&gt; o where toError :: i -&gt; o instance Exception e &#x3D;&gt; ToError e Error where toError :: e -&gt; Error toError &#x3D; undefined instance Exception e &#x3D;&gt; ToError (Either e a) (Either Error a) where toError :: Either e a -&gt; Either Error a toError &#x3D; undefined 
 ...but I get an error:
 Functional dependencies conflict between instance declarations: instance Exception e &#x3D;&gt; ToError e Error instance Exception e &#x3D;&gt; ToError (Either e a) (Either Error a) 
 I also tried using associated type families:
 class ToError a where type Output a :: Type toError :: a -&gt; Output a instance Exception e &#x3D;&gt; ToError e where type Output e &#x3D; Error toError :: e -&gt; Error toError &#x3D; undefined instance Exception e &#x3D;&gt; ToError (Either e a) where type Output (Either e a) &#x3D; Either Error a toError :: Either e a -&gt; Either Error a toError &#x3D; undefined 
 ...but I get an error:
 Conflicting family instance declarations: Output e &#x3D; Error Output (Either e a) &#x3D; Either Error a 
 Adding {-# OVERLAPPING #-} pragmas doesn&#x27;t make a difference.
 I believe GHC selects instances based on the instance head, not the instance context, so nothing I do on the left side of the fat arrow will make a difference.
 Is there any other way I could formulate this to get my desired functionality, where the output type is determined by the input type?

                              <span>I have a list of strings, with each string having a mix of lowercase and uppercase characters. What I would like to do is sort the list from least amount of uppercase characters to most amount of uppercase characters. An example:
 caseSort [&quot;HI&quot;,&quot;hello&quot;,&quot;Heya&quot;] &#x3D;&#x3D; [&quot;hello&quot;,&quot;Heya&quot;,&quot;HI&quot;]
 The code that I have so far:
 qsortBy comp [] &#x3D; [] qsortBy comp (y:ys) &#x3D; qsortBy comp (filter (\x -&gt; x &#x60;comp&#x60; y) ys) ++ [y] ++ qsortBy comp (filter (\x -&gt; not (x &#x60;comp&#x60; y)) ys) countCap [] &#x3D; 0 countCap (x:xs) | x &#x3D;&#x3D; toUpper x &#x3D; 1 + countCap xs | otherwise &#x3D; countCap xs sortByCaseIn :: [String] -&gt; [String] sortByCaseIn [] &#x3D; [] sortByCaseIn (x:xs) &#x3D; qsortBy (&lt;&#x3D;) (countCap (x:xs)) 
 The errors I&#x27;m receiving:
 Couldn&#x27;t match type ‘[Char]’ with ‘Char’ Expected type: [Char] Actual type: [String] • In the first argument of ‘countCap’, namely ‘(x : xs)’ In the second argument of ‘qsortBy’, namely ‘(countCap (x : xs))’ In the expression: qsortBy (&lt;&#x3D;) (countCap (x : xs)) 
 I&#x27;ve been bashing my head against this for several hours now and I&#x27;m at a total loss.

 I&#x27;m not sure how to check that the entire input string is being consumed by the parser.

original introductory blog post blog post, I’ve written about why we, at
Tweag, are developing yet another configuration language. Our goal is to empower
people to write correct, programmable and maintainable configurations. Nickel
targets Nix, Infrastructure-as-Code, build systems, and more. We think such a
tool would greatly help taming the growing complexity of configuring systems.
Since the first blog post, we have made progress. We backed up and changed our
mind sometimes. We had a lot of discussions, and we also experimented quite a
bit. There is still a lot to do and there are many imperfect aspects of the language
to improve.
Still, I think we have reached a point where Nickel is consistent enough for people

                              <span>I am following up on this thread from a year ago and was curious what kind of Emacs to use on a Mac in early 2022. In the past, I used Aquamacs and the standard homebrew version of emacs but have stepped away from Emacs in the past 2 years for various reasons. 
 I now want to give Org-mode another try and thus want to get back at using Emacs. Other than Ord-mode I would mostly use Emacs to write Markdown and LaTeX files and potentially some R. 
 It appears Aquamacs is finally actively maintained again but there seem to be some advantages of sticking to a more &quot;classic&quot; Emacs port. Any recommendations are very much appreciated.

                              <span>I recently started working in a environment (windows OS) where Anti Virus and Endpoint protections are in place. Now I don’t really want to live without using emacs, but I’m kind of concerned that I would trigger some AV when starting up or using emacs.
 To my question: 
 If I only use the default config (no fancy packages, Melpa, Elpa and the like) would emacs do any network communications on its own as I start it?

Obviously C-h k and C-h f doesn&#x27;t work. C-h mouse-click to get docs about whatever element I click on would be nice to have :-).

                              <span>I have been on a quest to decrease my Emacs startup time and found something that I haven&#x27;t seen mentioned on any of the blogs I came across on the topic. I think it is fairly well known that if you use straight.el, deactivating package.el in your early-init.el will speed up your starting time. What I only just found out is that on launch, straight does a lot of checks to see if any of the packages installed have been altered. This process can be changed by modifying the straight-check-for-modifications variable. I don&#x27;t edit any of my straight packages by hand, so I have this set to nil, before bootstrapping straight. This brought my startup time from ~2 seconds to ~0.5 seconds, for loading over 200 packages. Maybe there are some reasons why one shouldn&#x27;t do this that I don&#x27;t know, but it seems to be a nice way to save some time!
 For more information, see this section of straight&#x27;s read-me: https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el#customizing-when-packages-are-built
 Hopefully this is of help to someone!

 lets you make minimaps in there own buffers that can be detached or moved. I made this so I could have a minimap in a separate frame then the one I&#x27;m editing in.

 C-&#x27; runs the command org-cycle-agenda-files (found in org-mode-map), 
 Here is what I think is the relevant section of my init.el, which comes after the org mode section: 
 (require &#x27;avy) ;; Integrate avy with iSearch ;; First enter iSearch, then whatever pattern to search, then C-&#x27; ;; C-s PATTERN C-&#x27; ;; Note that the C-&#x27; is bound here ONLY in the context of an interactive iSearch (avy-setup-default) ;; not sure what this does ;; (global-set-key (kbd &quot;C-c C-j&quot;) &#x27;avy-resume) ;; Suggested bindings from avy github docs (global-set-key (kbd &quot;C-:&quot;) &#x27;avy-goto-char) (global-set-key (kbd &quot;C-&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;avy-goto-char-2) (global-set-key (kbd &quot;M-g f&quot;) &#x27;avy-goto-line) (global-set-key (kbd &quot;M-g w&quot;) &#x27;avy-goto-word-1) (global-set-key (kbd &quot;M-g e&quot;) &#x27;avy-goto-word-0)

                              <span>When using metals, when the project I&#x27;m working on cannot be compiled due to an error, which is often as I&#x27;m working on features, nothing in metals works. I cannot use hover, go to definition, references, etc. Is there a workaround for this? That is when I need those features the most.

                              <span>I feel like I&#x27;m missing something obvious when trying to split my org-mode emacs config into multiple files.
 Suppose I have two files: full-config.org, which serves as an aggregator of various configurations and specific-config.org, which is a config for any single customization.
 full-config.org contains the following code:
 #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle ~/.emacs.d/init.el :noweb yes &gt; #+end_src 
 and specific-config.org contains the following:
 #+name: disable-indentation #+begin_src emacs-lisp (setq org-adapt-indentation nil) #+end_src 
 What I expect to see after tangling the full-config.org is (setq org-adapt-indentation nil) in ~/.emacs.d/init.el; however, the file is blank.
 I can tangle the evaluation results of disable-indentation by placing () at the end of noweb, but I cannot figure out how to tangle the code itself.
 Can anyone please tell me if it is possible, and if so, how to do it properly? If it is not possible, is there an alternative way to update code in one &quot;aggregator&quot; file from multiple files without using transclusion?
 Thank you for your help!

 I’m a relatively new org user, but I’m completely sold on using plain text for life.
 Has anyone got any tips for planning gardening/farming in org mode? I feel like I need a few dimensions, such as the physical layout, as well as the more obvious planting/growing/harvesting schedule (I’m crudely just using org agenda schedules for this, but any tips welcome)

                              <span>After finally getting tired enough of not having a good way to quickly export Org Mode tables to other programs, I did it myself. It&#x27;s terrible, but it&#x27;s functional enough.
 Put your cursor on the first pipe character of the table, run the function, and the table can be pasted into an external program from your clipboard, like LibreOffice or even Excel.
 This only works with tables aligned to the left margin, and you need to run the function when the cursor is on the upper-leftmost pipe (first character) of the table.
 (defun abc/org-table-to-tsv () (interactive) (let ((temp-buffer-name &quot;*abc-table*&quot;)) (org-mark-element) (kill-ring-save nil nil &#x27;t) (switch-to-buffer temp-buffer-name) (yank) (beginning-of-buffer) (delete-char 2) ;; remove leading pipe (perform-replace &quot; | &quot; &quot; &quot; nil nil nil nil nil (point-min) (point-max)) ;; remove trailing pipe (perform-replace &quot; | &quot; &quot; &quot; nil nil nil nil nil (point-min) (point-max)) ;; remove internal pipes (replace-regexp &quot; +| &quot; &quot; &quot; nil (point-min) (point-max)) ;; remove terminal pipe (replace-regexp &quot; +| &quot; &quot; &quot; nil (point-min) (point-max)) ;; remove separators (replace-regexp &quot;^|-+.* &quot; &quot;&quot; nil (point-min) (point-max)) (kill-ring-save (point-min) (point-max)) (kill-buffer temp-buffer-name)))

                              <span>imo Linear types is really cool and could revolutionize how haskell is written (eg alternatives to &quot;builder&quot; patterns, IO monad, bracket functions, &quot;move semantics&quot;, etc.)
 But! There&#x27;s a few factors that seem to make it unusable except for specific safety-centric code (I played with the ergonomics extensively last year by toying with a linear version of prim (eg https://github.com/daig/prim/blob/%E2%98%B8/class/Cmp.hs))
  
Basic quality of life stuff around linearity inference eg in let/where/case binding
 Lack of effective multiplicity polymorphism.
 Lack of sugar for Movable types (eg primitive numeric types, for which copy and move are identical - Ur is not a good solution for these basic types imo)
 Lack of linear primops.
 Lack of optimizations making use of linearity eg to shortcut garbage collection.
 Lack of support for automatic lifetime management (This isn&#x27;t really essential, but currently it&#x27;s akin to using manual new and delete with static guarantees - which is great but still cumbersome relative to C++ RAII or Rust&#x27;s lifetimes, and I believe could be inferred statically. Maybe it&#x27;s actually possible just with library support for something like a linear ResourceT monad but that still feels a bit unsatisfying)
 As far as I can tell, it&#x27;s solely the brainchild of Tweag - which is great to have industry support, but worrying in terms of robustness and longterm support as GHC develops. Linear types really needs fairly deep integration with the rest of GHC to be most useful.
  
1/2/3 are the only ones really stopping me from going all-in on linearity right now, but I expect all of them to get resolved eventually so long as 7 isn&#x27;t an issue.
 So my question is: What&#x27;s the latest developments on linear types in haskell / who is working on it / what&#x27;s the best place to keep updated?

                              <span>Idris has a nice construct for a sort of &quot;anonymous bind&quot;,
 main &#x3D; print (!readNumber + 5) 
 which is syntactic sugar for
 main &#x3D; do x &lt;- readNumber print (x + 5) 
 What&#x27;s nice about ! is that you can nest !s arbitrarily (and mix them with pure code) without needing to name any intermediate results; the desugaring does the sensible depth-first left-to-right evaluation you&#x27;d expect. (I&#x27;d note that ! is more powerful than the suggestion described here, since the applicative syntax doesn&#x27;t neatly support nesting; complex expressions end up in a join/pure soup.)
 Anyway, I was just wondering whether the GHC language design team had ever seriously considered porting this? There does seem to be demand for it: many mainstream imperative languages (even JavaScript!) have adopted ! - they just pronounce it await (and it&#x27;s only applicable in their &quot;promise&quot; monad).

                              <span>Something a bit special -- in a chat, I dug around reading recommendations to become a better reader and filtered for English sources.
Here&#x27;s one where I once found a list of signal words in text, e.g.: schema, model, allegory, analogy, hypothesis, metaphor, representation, simile, theory.
Source:
Writing as Thinking, Review of General Psychology 1, 2008, Vol. 12, S. 9--27.

This is but a piece of the overall Zettelkasten puzzle. Was nice to see English terms for a change back when I read this. Sascha and I practiced hunting for definitions and arguments etc. for a while but I just haven&#x27;t found any other English source at that time.
Notably absent from the Oatley/Djikic article: a reference to Luhmann  http://luhmann.surge.sh/learning-how-to-read
For trivia, here&#x27;re the titles of the notes I created that reference this book:

 e^{\lambda_{1}} or e^{x^{2}}.
 I know I can wrap it in $$ and convert to a latex snippet but its not as fast and then the font doesn&#x27;t match. Let me know if thats the only way, or if I can change the default latex font somehow.

 I&#x27;m using Doom Emacs, if that&#x27;s relevant.

                              <span>A while ago I wrote a mini API server in order to let me leave &quot;private comments&quot; on a codebase.
  
Imagine being dropped into a new codebase and having the freedom to leave whatever todo items and breadcrumbs you want without cluttering the codebase. Imagine working on a client’s codebase and not having to worry about what you say, or who sees it.
  
I fully documented what it&#x27;d take to write a plugin for your favorite editor and wrote an example plugin for vim ... and then I switched to emacs.
 My emacs lisp chops are NOT up to writing a plugin that speaks to this API and displays the private comments inline. I&#x27;m imagining something akin to how magit shows commit messages inline. 
 I&#x27;m tired of not having access to this in my main editor. 
 If you or someone you know would be interested in writing this for me (as a public open source package, which i&#x27;ll be happy to maintain) I&#x27;ll happily pay you, or maybe donate the equivalent amount to help folks in Ukraine if you&#x27;d prefer. DM me here (or @masukomi on twitter) with how much you&#x27;d want.

                              <span>I&#x27;m a long time vim user that converted (mostly to Emacs). I&#x27;m to the point where I only use vim in a few situations (quick edits, specific servers), and I&#x27;ve recreated my old vim config in emacs: 
  
Buffer management-ivy and fzf
 evil keys everywhere
 surround.vim-evil-surround
 vim commentary-evil-commentary
 persistent undo-undo-fu
 web-mode/php-mode
 lots of keybindings like 
  
(evil-define-key &#x27;normal &#x27;global (kbd &quot;&quot;) &#x27;ivy-switch-buffer) 
 (evil-define-key &#x27;normal &#x27;global (kbd &quot;e&quot;) (lambda() (interactive)(find-file &quot;~/.emacs.d/init.el&quot;))) 
 (evil-define-key &#x27;normal &#x27;global (kbd &quot;ww&quot;) (lambda() (interactive)(find-file &quot;~/notes.org&quot;))) 
 (evil-define-key &#x27;normal &#x27;global (kbd &quot;DEL&quot; ) #&#x27;switch-to-last-buffer) 
 I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with the workflow, but then I was satisfied with a pretty similar one in vim before. What stuff should I leverage that makes emacs superior to vim? Don&#x27;t get me wrong, elisp is a million times more pleasant than Vimscript and that alone makes a big difference. Oh, I do use magit and org already so maybe I have my answer. Curious if there are other vim converts out there who have words of wisdom on what else to try in emacs.

                              <span>I&#x27;m writing a cv in org mode and I want to make a list of publications. The way my cv class works, I use description lists with a date and a description in org mode like this:
 - 2018--2022 :: Job at company 
 which exports to:
 \begin{description} \item[2018--2022] Job at company \end{description} 
 This is then formatted exactly how I like. I really don&#x27;t want to massively change the way this works, because it took me a long time to get the class just right, I&#x27;ve tried a few approaches (e.g. tables and tabularx) and this was the best way overall (so far).
 I want to be able to write this:
 - [cite:@key_20] - [cite:@otherkey_22] 
 and have it export like this (or equivalent):
 \begin{description} \item[2020] \cite{key_20} \item[2022] \cite{otherkey_22} \end{description} 
 where the dates in the square brackets for the \item macros are automatically pulled from the bib data associated with the relevant @key. (I realise \cite is probably not the best citation command to use here. I use biblatex so I&#x27;ll probably pick something reasonable from that package. The point is the date thing).
 How would anyone approach this? I&#x27;ve fiddled about a bit and can&#x27;t find a way yet.

 I have been toying around with the idea of trying out emacs for quite a while now and I really wanna give it a go now. However, I am completely lost and need guidance about how to actually use it.
 Any recommendations are very welcome.
 Thank you all in advance!

                              <span>Been using this to find files system wide, mostly random org file notes on things but it&#x27;s great. Just wondering what everyone else is doing for a fuzzy file search, like ctrl-p in vim? The cool thing about this is you can select the folder before the search which means it&#x27;s not going to just crawl your entire user folder etc.
 Anyway what&#x27;s everyone else&#x27;s approach to this?

 This would be trivial if I just wanted to run org-agenda-list (a) but since the option I want is part of the org-agenda-custom-commands and has no direct function associated to it I don&#x27;t know how to do this.
 Any help is welcomed!

 Does anyone have a good way of getting org-mode&#x27;s clock tables to include the current time in?

                              <span>By &quot;something between&quot;, I mean something minimal, but a little bit of color, like just two or three font colors for levels. And this entire question could be broadened out to any other distinguishing font differences between levels.
 I&#x27;m asking this because I&#x27;m new and I&#x27;m wondering if I&#x27;m fooling myself that font colored levels does anything good. When I &quot;discovered&quot; themes and faces, I got pretty excited at the eye candy. At first, it looked really nice and seemed like a good idea. But now, idk.
 I&#x27;m curious, how many org mode level-colors (or other font attributes for levels) do you have? What does your different font attributes for levels mean?

                              <span>I use .emacs-custom.el to contain the customizations made by the interactive functions. However, I&#x27;d like to start moving some of that stuff out so I can manage it myself and make comments. I tried pulling some stuff out and putting into my init.el, but it didn&#x27;t work. Namely, I pulled out these:
 &#x27;(org-todo ((((class color) (min-colors 89)) (:weight normal :box (:line-width 1 :color &quot;#808080&quot;) :foreground &quot;#FF00FF&quot; :background &quot;#f0f0f0&quot;)))) &#x27;(org-upcoming-deadline ((t (:foreground &quot;#FF33FF&quot;)))) &#x27;(org-warning ((t (:background &quot;#ffffa0&quot; :foreground &quot;#ff33ff&quot; :weight normal)))) 
 Why don&#x27;t these work within my init.el? I tried them before and after my (load custom-file).
 EDIT: Ok I see I&#x27;m supposed to use set-face-attribute. So I tried wrapping the above, but this doesn&#x27;t work
 (set-face-attribute &#x27;org-todo ((((class color) (min-colors 89)) (:weight normal :box (:line-width 1 :color &quot;#808080&quot;) :foreground &quot;#FF00FF&quot; :background &quot;#f0f0f0&quot;)))) 
 EDIT 2: I figured out the answer. A correct, commonly used form for set-face-attribute is like this:
 (set-face-attribute &#x27;org-todo nil :box &#x27;(:line-width 1 :color &quot;#808080&quot;) :weight &#x27;normal :foreground &quot;#FF00FF&quot; :background &quot;#f0f0f0&quot;) 
 And it probably didn&#x27;t work with a straight copy because each of those first three lines, I think those are args to the function (custom-set-faces...). I don&#x27;t know what it does behind the scenes, but I guess it wants its args in a certain format.

 - Commit, rebase from master then force push to my own branch
 - Commit then squash the new commit with the previous commit, rebase from master, force push to my own branch
 I wonder if there is a way to automate these scenarios with magit to then use just one key combination?

 Edit my current strategy is: ~/Notes////
 For example ~/Notes/Spring_2022/MAT2440/week6/wednesday_march_9_2022.org
 and ~/Notes is a git repo so I can keep it in sync with my desktop at home (as I have some hybrid (online and in-person) classes and need to keep them in both places)

                              <span>and why SBT is one of the best building tools ever created but, also, one of the most terrible dependency management tools?
 i just cant understand why our sbt doesnt have this &quot;ordinary&quot; feature that gem, npm, yarn, poetry, etc have...
 why cant we just run something like &quot;sbt install github.path.to.package --save&quot;?

                              <span>I started to mature as a emacs users, so now I am trying to start developing things. 
 I notice that I encounter familiar name often. Once that comes to mind right now is /u/github-alphapapa and I also encounter this repo from /u/akirakom (https://github.com/akirak). 
 After looking into those repo, I figured out that these guys have solved problem that I had, am having, and don&#x27;t even know that I have. 
 So I am now trying to gather all repos from these &quot;emacs super developers&quot;, so I can study their code, understand problem that bother them, understand how they solve problem and one day be good enough to continuously contribute to the community. 
 Thank you in advance.

                              <span>So I don&#x27;t do a lot of heaving coding, but I do embedded code in C/C++, scripts in Python and play with Racket/Lisp when time permits. I&#x27;ve been using VS code for work, but in school we used a very basic setup for Java programming in Emacs and I enjoyed using Emacs (I don&#x27;t do Java programming though).
 I want to really learn Emacs and have gone through the basic tutorials. I want to start adding packages but it all seems so overwhelming to me. I&#x27;d like to add a package at a time to my basically blank configuration.
 Can anyone recommend just the basic packages I should have to do C/C++ and Python until I learn how to use those? I&#x27;d like the basic IDE stuff like syntax highlighting, autocomplete, file differences and a file tree. Recommendations? What else should I have?

                              <span>I use BetterBibTex and Zotero to export my bibliography + files + notes. Is there a quick way to extract the note field from the .bib file to a standalone orgmode file and convert its formatting to orgmode? Ideally with the file containing the citekey as well.
 I assume the simplest way would be to copy the content from the field, create a new buffer, paste the content to the new buffer, then export it to orgmode. But this also seems like a lot of work and I&#x27;d like to automate it if possible.
 Additional question for org-roam! I&#x27;d like to turn each reference into a node, so I can track each to what references I end up using more, which I tend to co-use, etc. Is there a good way to find every citekey in my bibliography, convert into something that org-ref, org-cite, citar, whatever can understand, and export them as nodes in one file with the citekey being in the :roam-refs: field?

                              <span>Does org-mode/emacs have a good to represent historical timelines.
 I am starting study on history and philosophy, and want to be able to easily keep track of dates, events, birth-to-death of individuals, birth-to-death of nations etc. 
 Wikipedia does it using multiple pages for different timescales
  
Timelines_of_world_history
 Timelines_of_modern_history
 Timeline_of_the_17th_century
 1630s
  
My goal is to have navigable timeline to quickly find items of relevance. Is the above Wikipedia method the best available. Is there a mode that would help manage this?
 Also I want to use something similar to time.graphics for visualisation. It&#x27;s quite expensive though. 
 Do you have any ideas, on how I should visualise timelines?

                              <span>I have enabled org-encrypt for my journal files to keep certain things private and this works well but I recently noticed that after saving the file and its contents encrypted and I undo the last change to the file, the entire contents of the file is revealed without being prompted for a password. This happens even after waiting for a long time. I would expect to be prompted for a password each time the encrypted contents is to be shown but this is not the case. Is this the expected behavior? If not, how do I prevent it from happening?

                              <span>Hi, 
 Trying to use &quot;assertThrows&quot; as I&#x27;m trying to learn about unit testing, but I&#x27;m stuck. I made a simple calculator and wrote some tests to test them, they are all fine, simply using assert, but as soon as I want to test that an exception is supposed to be thrown, the test fails with the following error message:
 type mismatch; found : org.scalatest.Assertion (which expands to) org.scalatest.compatible.Assertion required: Int assertThrows[ArithmeticException](calculator.divide(10, 0)) 
 Here is the code I&#x27;m using:
 import org.scalatest.flatspec.AnyFlatSpec import calctest.Calculator object ScalaTestingStyles class CalculatorSuite extends AnyFlatSpec { val calculator &#x3D; new Calculator &quot;Calculator&quot; should &quot;add two numbers&quot; in { assert( calculator.add(10, 5) &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; 15 ) } it should &quot;subtract two numbers&quot; in { assert( calculator.subtract(10, 5) &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; 5 ) } it should &quot;multiply two numbers&quot; in { assert( calculator.multiply(10, 5) &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; 50 ) } it should &quot;divide two numbers&quot; in { assert( calculator.divide(10, 5) &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; 2 ) } it should &quot;Throw an exception if denominator is zero&quot; { assertThrows[ArithmeticException](calculator.divide(10, 0)) } } 
 And here is my simple calculator:
 class Calculator { def add(a: Int, b: Int) &#x3D; a + b def subtract(a: Int, b: Int) &#x3D; a - b def multiply(a: Int, b: Int) &#x3D; a * b def divide(a: Int, b: Int) &#x3D; a / b } 
 It&#x27;s the last test that is failing, this was part of a rock the JVM tutorial, but instead of funspec I&#x27;m trying to learn flatspec. Why is this failing please?

 Map(&quot;a&quot; -&gt; 1, &quot;k&quot; -&gt;5, &quot;b&quot; -&gt; 5, &quot;t&quot;-&gt;5, &quot;d&quot;-&gt; 3) 
 to 
 TreeMap(5 -&gt; List(&quot;t&quot;, &quot;k&quot;, &quot;b&quot;), 3 -&gt; List(&quot;d&quot;), 1 -&gt; List(&quot;a&quot;))
 using the Map APIs like groupBy, groupMapReduce etc 
 ?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been studying FP for a while now in my spare time, mostly in Scala and TypeScript. I&#x27;ve gotten very deep into it. I feel I have a strong understanding of all the core concepts, as well as all the most common monads and other main design patterns. In short, I feel like I&#x27;ve got a very solid grasp of programming in FP.
 My problem lately just comes down to putting it all together at scale. Whenever I&#x27;ve tried to write a full app using purely FP design principles, it feels like it becomes a mess as I layer on more and more features. Because of this, I feel my main limitation is how to use functional composition for a larger system when dealing with network requests/responses, database operations, dependency injection, loose coupling, etc. I can write an application that does all these things, I just haven&#x27;t been really happy with the results.
 What I&#x27;m hoping to get is one of two things. The first would be an example codebase, something open on GitHub. Something using, maybe, http4s and cats? Something that I can look through and study how it&#x27;s been architected, maybe even transcribe it (I have found that re-writing code makes it stick in my head better than just reading it).
 On the other hand, maybe there are some tutorials/courses/etc out there which cover this kind of stuff. I really do NOT want one of those &quot;This is a functor&quot; type FP courses, I don&#x27;t need that at this point. Something that goes much deeper into full-scale application construction is what I&#x27;m after.
 Thanks in advance for any help and guidance you can provide.

                              <span>Hi everyone, is there an alternative formulation of monad transformers that allow removing any reference to the base monad inside the e.g. bind definition of the transformer ? 
 The reason I&#x27;m asking for that is I&#x27;m porting some Haskell transformers to Python, for which I would like to avoid chains of lift.lift.lift... 
 A good way I found is simply to make a custom subclass of each transformer in the stack, so that they can be looked up for their lift by &quot;tag&quot; (the specific subclass) rather than numerical position (aka number of lift nesting). That would make composition of function using different monads very easy, even if they have not been designed to work together specifically 
 This would still allows the user to use multiple transformers of the same type (e.g. StateT), since the user can create as many subclasses of StateT they want for each piece of state.
 The problem with that is that if the user uses e.g. SubclassofStateT.pure(42), the base monad is not known , and has to be &quot;resolved&quot; later (when looking up the index of this class in the stack to lift appropriately). Unfortunately automatic, lifting is not enough since the definition of e.g. pure() would require the knowledge of the base monad which we don&#x27;t have at this stage. Hence the need for an alternative formulation that allows delaying this knowledge to later.

 We built it to help all people living in oppressive regimes communicate freely with each other, without fear of persecution because of what they said and who they are connected with.
 During the terrible conflict between Russia and Ukraine, people of both countries – I have friends and family there – could be at risk when sharing their opinions or just from being connected to people who were prosecuted.
 Every messenger app that knows who you are can end up sharing all of your connections with undesirable third parties, either as a result of a court order or as a result of attack - so even Signal, which has strong encryption, cannot protect your connection graph.
 Huge &quot;thank you&quot; 🙏 to 137 people who helped us test and improve the apps and to u/angerman who helped a lot by compiling our Haskell code to mobile platforms and getting it accepted by app stores – and we have just submitted the release than makes the app working on iPhone 7.
 From our experience – building mobile apps with Haskell is non-trivial but doable – so if you have complex client-side logic that benefits from the advanced type system, then Haskell is a viable choice – we hope our project makes it a bit better for others too.
 Let us know what you think about the apps and we are looking forward to releasing the new features, e.g. e2e encrypted WebRTC audio/video calls – see the full release announcement here.

Does anyone have ideas or samples that I could follow?
In the instance I&#x27;m currently exploring, OPML files are the intermediary between the ZK and, in this case, iThoughtsX.
The trick will be to get correct OPML file formatting as an output via Marked 2, python, applescript or Keyboard Maestro.
Check this out for a first rough go. So far only one level thick. But this was easy. Each link on the central node is a child node on the mindmap. The full text of each child node is attached. Links within the text are not hot, but we&#x27;ll see. 
I&#x27;ve attached the file so you can download, review, and explore the ideas. Requires an app that will read iThoughtsX files. This type of download might be a way of sharing a specific idea thread from my ZK with the world.</span>

                              <span>Hello,
I would rather use a link-as-search to be as future proof and software agnostic as possible. I also prefer to use a UID internal to the body of the text instead of using a filename as I am very new to this and still changing my titles. To create an internal link, I copy the UID number of the filename (without the title) at the top of the body of my zettel. Then in my second zettel, I open a [[]] and inside I paste the UID number of the first zettel. The [[UID]] becomes green. When I hover on it it says that the file is not found. When I click on it, a search is launched and I have my two zettels that appear in the search bar but the target zettel does not open automatically. Is it normal? Should it only open in the search bar?
I saw that a &quot;#&quot; was sometimes set before the UID (in the body) of the zettel of origin. Is this necessary besides to denote that it is the zettel of origin?
Thank you and sorry if it is a bit messy (or very obvious), I am totally new with markdown and all of these softwares!</span>

                              <span>Hi all, I a newbie at haskell and I am trying to learn it using a book -&gt; learn haskell from first principles and in this book I came across a function
 addAndDrop &#x3D; const . (1+)
 Can anyone please explain how is this working
 Afaik (.) Operator takes two functions and compose them but the composition operator takes function that takes 1 input and one output but const take two inputs, then how is it working?

 As a user, I am quite thrilled about named routes, as well as another change in Servant 0.19 brought by our team at Tweag (this time driven by Andrea Condoluci): better error messages for faulty routes. Writing routes in a type-level DSL can be tricky because errors can get hairy, and you lose a lot of the benefits of interacting with GHC&#x27;s type checker. Both of these changes should help make Servant APIs more manageable, and more accessible to newcomers.

 What I want to do is to define a function insert that will run the appropriate version of insertXXX based on the type of the first argument, imagine something like the following:
 insert :: pair -&gt; [(a, b)] -&gt; [(a, b)] insert &#x3D; case typeOf pair of (a, b) -&gt; insertOrd (b, a) -&gt; insertFlipped _ -&gt; fail_during_compilation 
 Of course, that code is not valid Haskell, but I was wondering if I could achieve something like that using some type-level magic.
 Thanks in advance for any suggestion!

                              <span>I am pretty new to Haskell and learning it for fun, coming from Python. I recently tried to solve a problem using memoization, and I was surprised how hard it is in Haskell. I read up on a few things, for example
 https://en.m.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/Fix_and_recursion
 that provides the basic concepts. Naively, I had assumed that pure functional programming language should make memoization *easier* as there are no unintended side-effects. Instead, basically every approach I found requires me rewrite the function definition itself of the function I want to memoize. 
 Am I simply missing something? Are there some techniques for memoization that don&#x27;t require rewriting the function? Maybe some compiler settings?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hello!
 I&#x27;m reading &quot;Thinking functionally with Haskell&quot; chapter 2. I have questions about Exercise D in Chapter 2.
 The first part of the question was easy to understand. It is about comparing lazy vs strict evaluation about the expression
 head (map f xs) where xs is a list of length n.
 -&gt; With Strict evaluation the function f is applied to all elements in xs after which the first element of the list is retrieved. So function f is applied n times.
 -&gt; With lazy evaluation the expression is reduced to
 let p &#x3D; map f xs in head (p)
 which reduces to f applies to the first element in XS. i.e. f xs0 
 ​
 In the second part of the question, there is a function filter p which when applied to a list returns a list of elements that satisfies the boolean test p.
 filter :: (a -&gt; Bool) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [a]
 head . filter p xs returns the first element that satisfies the condition p. 
 In the question I&#x27;m having a hard time visualizing how lazy evaluation will work. With innermost reduction, the filter is applied to each element of the list and a list with elements that satisfies p is returned and head takes the first element of the list. 
 How will lazy evaluation work here? applying p to the input list might prune away elements from the output. 
 Is it that with lazy evaluation, filter p is applied only until the first element in the list meets the criteria as opposed to eager evaluation where filter p is applied to all elements in the input list?

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;ve fount solution for this issue here: https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/48719/keep-text-selection-after-indenting-with-evil 
 It works but I have couple of questions. 
 Whenever I use evil-mode and when I select some text and move/indent it with &quot;&quot; , in mini-buffer there is message Wrong type argument: wholenump, nil Should that concern me? 
 Currently, this fix is placed outside of mine use-package config of evil-mode. Could that be the reason of the message in mini-buffer? It would be nice if I could place this fix inside of my use-package evil-mode config.
 Here is chunk of code from my init.el : LINK
 Thanks in advance,

So for the sake of not having 3s startup time a few years down the road, what can I do? Should I install a different version of emacs?

 Btw, I am currently using emacs-plus@27, I think.

                              <span>Hi,
 A very strange situation here. When I launch the client from the terminal using emacsclient -c, the client launches with the terminal showing a message Waiting for Emacs.... However, when I use a .desktop file it fails to launch! Curiously, when I set Terminal&#x3D;true in the .desktop, it works. Any idea what&#x27;s going wrong? Thanks!
 EDIT: Terminal&#x3D;false -&gt; Terminal&#x3D;true

                              <span>Hi there,
 I was wondering whether anyone had experimented with a custom icalendar org template. I see that there is the gnus-icalendar-insinuate-org-templates function. I also notice there is a key that is used, but I don&#x27;t think changing the key to one that is linked to a custom template would work. 
 What is your setup with gnu-icalendar? 
 Best,
 Enrique.

 (add-hook &#x27;web-mode-hook &#x27;something) 
 Tracking back a bit, I was wondering why .dir.locals were not being read, and it was because of the hook failure - all later hooks were being halted as a result, so it was not reading .dir.locals. I was only able to notice that by going to the *Messages* buffer.
 Is there a way to configure Emacs to throw an error when a hook fails? That would be much better for debugging and for making any errors obvious. I don&#x27;t want to be lenient to hook failures.

                              <span>A very annoying issue with desktop-save and desktop-read that I&#x27;m encountering at the moment:
  
I&#x27;m starting Emacs in daemon-mode, and then open a client frame. I do &#x27;desktop-read&#x27; and my saved desktop opens with the 10 or so frames I had saved.
 
When I go to one of the frames with a buffer I&#x27;m no longer interested in, and do C-x C-c, I end up not just closing that particular frame, but all 10 or so of the frames that were open.
 
The Emacs daemon is still running, and opening another client frame shows that the buffers haven&#x27;t been killed, so nothing has been lost per se - it&#x27;s just that the arrangement of all the frames I had is just ruined.
 
 Any idea how to stop this behaviour (i.e. being able to just kill one frame from the saved configuration)? 
 I should add that I have also been using the minimal setup for desktop.el as shown in the EmacsWiki, but I /think/ (but am not sure) that the problem is independent of this.

                              <span>Hello ,
 I&#x27;m looking to write a function, for my role-playing games, allowing me to create random tables with elements that have weight.
 For example, consider the following list:
 1 - 20 : 2d6 kobold
 21 - 45 : 1 troll
 46 - 100 : 3d6 orcs
 Running the function I want to be able to pick 20% of the time the &quot;2d6 kobold&quot; etc.
 Ideally, the function would allow me to automatically execute the dice roll. I will have then, for example: 5 kobolds!
 Not being a programmer, all I can do is create a function to select an item from a &quot;flat&quot; list.
 Any idea?

But it doesn&#x27;t show up as an M-x command and it doesn&#x27;t show up in the help system.

 I would like help getting this to work, or at least understanding why &quot;it doesn&#x27;t work that way&quot;.
 (I know I can just call C-u C-RET to accomplish the same thing, but I&#x27;m learning elisp and I did the above work first, so I&#x27;d like to know why it doesn&#x27;t work.)

 I am just trying to see what other options for organisations/agenda are available in other approaches which I am not aware of.

 I&#x27;m genuinely curious, why is it that these features aren&#x27;t well performing if so many people use Emacs as a file browser too?
 EDIT: ISSUE HAS BEEN RESOLVED (mostly) My pdf-tools install didn&#x27;t seem to work properly, I have fixed it now and it is a lot better. Some things still are a bit clunky, but it definitely is a lot faster better now!

                              <span>Hi! I cannot figure out this bug, and do not know where I&#x27;d start. Whenever packages are installed I sometimes get autoloads that look sorta like this:
 (custom-autoload &#x27;async-bytecomp-package-mode &quot;async-bytecomp&quot; nil)
 (autoload &#x27;async-bytecomp-package-mode &quot;async-bytecomp&quot; &quot;\
 (&quot;Byte compile asynchronously packages installed with package.el.
 Async compilation of packages can be controlled by
 \async-bytecomp-allowed-packages&#x27;.&#x60;
 &#x60;If called interactively, enable Async-Bytecomp-Package&#x60; &#x60;mode if ARG is positive, and disable it if ARG is zero or&#x60; &#x60;negative. If called from Lisp, also enable the mode if&#x60; &#x60;ARG is omitted or nil, and toggle it if ARG is \&#x60;toggle&#x27;;&#x60; &#x60;disable the mode otherwise.&#x60; 
 \(fn &amp;optional ARG)&quot; 151 152 (face default) 207 208 (face default) 266 267 (face default) 323 324 (face default) 381 382 (face default)) t nil)
 The (&quot; starting on line 3 and the snippet
 151 152 (face default) 207 208 (face default) 266 267 (face default) 323 324 (face default) 381 382 (face default))
 break autoloads for all sorts of packages in a way that is hard to track down (paren/quote mismatch leads to invalid autoloads for rest of the file).
 The snippet does not always feature the same numbers. Example:
 34 35 (face default) 91 92 (face default) 148 149 (face default) 201 202 (face default) 260 261 (face default))
 ...any ideas on this? These snippets have appeared in a wide number of autoload files-- magit, org-roam, valign, some ivy rich packages, etc. They do not appear in the upstream git repositories.
 ​
 They also reappear on package update, breaking large swathes of functionality.

                              <span>Hi, just trying to learn how to do testing and stuck at the very first hurdle.

Last Week
Wrote a scientist profile using The Archive and Marked2
Created a Poetry of Zettelkasting video showing how I use The Archive and Marked2 in my writing
Studied and became more familiar with the writer tools in Marked2
Read The Secret to Superhuman Strength by Alison Bechdel, a graphic autobiography. ★★★★★
Didn&#x27;t re-engage with woodworking like I said I would last week. I&#x27;m trying again this week.
This Week
Refactoring Meditations on Self-Discipline 201901021303 from 90% quotes to 90% my assimilation of the quotes meaning. This book I onboarded at the beginning of my ZK journey. So I&#x27;ve spent about 10 hours over the last couple of weeks on this. It is a rewarding time spent refactoring this series of 30 notes—only a few more to go. &quot;Ferraiolo, William. Meditations on Self-Discipline and Failure: Stoic Exercise for Mental Fitness. O Books, 2017.&quot;
Reading and onboarding &quot;Paul, Annie Murphy. The Extended Mind: The Power of Thinking Outside the Brain. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2021.&quot;
Spring Break, so no JAMM328 assignments
Re-engage with woodworking. Maybe having a tie-in with my ZK might help motivate me. Thanks, @sfast, for the link to a beautiful ZK cabinet.</span>

                              <span>Sorry to ask this here, I couldn&#x27;t find the setting in the readme.
 When I finish typing any word in SLIME and go to push enter, it has already loaded the &quot;no matches, so here&#x27;s everything&quot; list of completions, so I need to move back a character and forward just to get rid of the list. It&#x27;s killing me.
 Here&#x27;s an example picture, me typing &#x27;foo, and the list loads for... some reason?

                              <span>Hi I am trying to bind multiple keys for a toggle of bookmarks, but I cant really figure out how to do that. What I want is M-b-b for toggle bookmarks.
 (global-set-key (kbd &quot;M-b-b&quot;) #&#x27;bm-toggle) but that doesnt work because: &quot;M- must prefix a single character, not b-b&quot;
 I tried multiple combinations, like &quot;M-b M-b&quot; but without any success. Is it possible to do this with global-set-key or even the :bind in use-package?
 M &#x3D; Meta key

 This is a package my alter-ego has been working on for a few months now. It is a package not quite ready for a full release yet, but I am announcing it here hoping to get some feedback.
  
Would something like this be useful to you?
 Is there already a better way to do what my implementation here is doing?
 If you think it could be useful to you, does it seem intuitive to use?
 What features do you wish it had, what could be improved?
 If you are kind enough to do a code review, have I made any obvious mistakes? (I am still new to Emacs Lisp).

 I was just wondering out of all the FRP libraries, which one is the most effective and up-to-date? My undergraduate thesis will likely be concerning FRP in Haskell to generate music.

                              <span>I think one of the massively underrated use cases of Haskell is as a tool for discussion. For example I recently was chatting to a friend about a particular chess analysis he was experimenting with and although he is a non-programmer we were able to explore the idea very deeply through a quick 2 hour XP style discussion. He was 100% able to follow the data types and basics, but most importantly able to follow and guide the algorithms that resulted (as much as I was encoding english to haskell, he was also able to map back from haskell to his own internal model easily). 
 Haskell might be difficult to write, high learning curve etc, but its simplicity to read and follow is an underrated super feature?
 I blogged about it here (if you are interested in more detail of our XP session and some code snips etc) https://www.tomwells.org/blog/haskell_for_prototyping

                              <span>Having previously worked with python, java, C and javascript I have developed some personal preferences for features/styles in programming languages that don&#x27;t seem to be supported in more modern popular and low-level languages (Go and Rust).
 I&#x27;m wondering if these patterns are incorrect or if I&#x27;m attempting to use an object-orientated or functional style in a procedural language where it doesn&#x27;t fit.
 The following are a few of my favourites that initially sprung to mind.
  
Chained operations on arrays/lists with functionally defined behaviour e.g. a.filter(a &#x3D;&gt; a &gt; 5).sort().slice(2).max()
 Wrapper alternatives to checking for null. e.g. extending the previous example ...2).max().else(0)
 Inline everything. e.g. if a is b then c() else d() and for 1..X as x do a +&#x3D; x
  
Am I a functional programmer in denial? The only thing keeping me from this conclusion is that I use a lot of oop techniques in tandem with the above.
 Or do I just want what&#x27;s bad for me? In support of this is the fact that all the languages that allow these patterns are very generic and mainstream and don&#x27;t have the careful direction of your Gos and rusts.

 This theme looks good, but I hate the fact that&#x27;s in white - burns my eyes
 ​
 I like [DT&#x27;s theme](https://gitlab.com/dwt1/distro.tube ) &#x27;s theme - but how do i get his particular dark theme? Sorry if this is a very specific question...
 ​
 ​
 If not, is there any other place where i can just get the link for the theme, and apply it , like the one in the pic?

                              <span>I code in Python (which demands perfect indentation).
 ​
 Why would the cursor go all the way there?
 ​
 This happens in certain code blocks - when i insert a code block NOT inside a bullet the indentation seems perfect though.
 ​
 I know there&#x27;s _probably_ a really simple config i have to tweak in my config.el ( I&#x27;m using Doom Emacs ), but forgive me , I just have no clue 😅
 ​
 Oh , and i use Arch btw 
 ​
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been mentioning here and there that I wanted to assemble a (book) outline or two since Christmas, but so far, no progress.
So to create more leverage through peer pressure, I&#x27;m going to share progress here.
The topic is an open source library I&#x27;m a co-maintainer of for a couple of years now. https://github.com/ReSwift/ReSwift
The general idea of the library may survive, but the library itself is likely about to become obsolete in 1--3 years because of technical changes. That&#x27;s why I want to do something with this, anything really, before it can only go straight to the trash. (Aka the sub-conscious of the Zettelkasten through forgetting about it.)

                              <span>Hey Emacsers,
 How are you doing?
 I&#x27;m getting excited about this post because when I understood how hl-line-mode works, it opened new horizons for me in the world of Elisp.
 I hope you will feel the same way after:
  
reading this post or,
 by directly reading the source code of hl-line-mode that can be found in the file lisp/hl-line.el (only 205 LOC skipping comments and empty lines).
  
You can get emacs&#x27;s source code by running the following command:
 git clone git://git.sv.gnu.org/emacs.git 
 (This post will soon be added in Org format to https://github.com/tonyaldon/posts).

                              <span>I use projectile and counsel-projectile regularly. Recently I was trying to use embark with counsel-projectile-find-file. Somehow embark is unable to determine the type of the selection. Is anyone using this combination successfully?
 Below function from embark library gets executed when I press embark-act after selecting a file
 (defun embark--ivy-selected () &quot;Target the currently selected item in Ivy. Return the category metadatum as the type of the target.&quot; ;; my favorite way of detecting Ivy (when (memq &#x27;ivy--queue-exhibit post-command-hook) (cons (completion-metadata-get (embark--metadata) &#x27;category) (ivy--expand-file-name (if (and (&gt; ivy--length 0) (stringp (ivy-state-current ivy-last))) (ivy-state-current ivy-last) ivy-text))))) 
 I debugged an found that the following expression is returning nil
 (completion-metadata-get (embark--metadata) &#x27;category) 
 Not sure what am I missing.

 After exporting an archive from Simplenote (Settings → Tools → Export Notes) and installing this package, run org-import-simplenote then select the downloaded archive. Every note (that isn&#x27;t trashed) will be imported as an Org heading, complete with the creation timestamp.
 The creation timestamp is used as the headline; I might add an option to use the first line of the note content instead, like how Simplenote itself displays notes.

                              <span>Last week, I released my new emacs package zetteldesk.el and made a post here for showcasing it. The idea was rather well accepted but I got a lot of feedback, that the README was too dense in information and it was hard for a new user to try it. I have tried fixing this, by integrating gifs for demonstrations instead of the raw info (which I moved to the wiki for anyone wanting it), adding a set of default bindings in the form of a hydra and a small sample config to get you started.
 ​
 I believe some people might have been set off by those problems, so I wanted to say thank you for pointing them out. I would love to hear what you think of it now, that I have tried to make it more explanative and if it is truly easier for someone to get started with it.
 ​
 As I said in the other post, I am very new to this, so I really appreciate and listen to feedback, as I feel the idea itself is good, but some parts of the implementation may be lacking, and who better to help me than the community.
 ​
 Thank you all for helping,
 Best regards,
 Vidianos

 I&#x27;m looking for a way to set a keybinding to switch the current active buffer to a specific one. In my case, it would be something like &quot;C-c p&quot; to switch to my Python run (*Python* buffer). Unfortunately I couldn&#x27;t find an example so far... Any help would be much appreciated! Thank you a lot in advance!

                              <span>I&#x27;ve noticed that if I have a curried function with generic parameters, all types must be inferred at the point of the first invocation. This makes generic parameters in the other calls of the curried function challenging if not impossible.
 Is there a solution to this in Scala 2.x? Thanks?

                              <span>TL;DR - I have ADHD...my desk is a mess, my emacs is a mess, my life is a mess. HEEEEELP!
 Let me start by apologizing for this long ass post. I&#x27;m having trouble articulating what I want. 
 I am using Doom Emacs.
 There are two things I have been trying to figure out how to do. They are probably very simple but I can&#x27;t seem to word them correctly in text so I am having trouble finding solutions. 
 I have ADHD, so things become very messy very quickly. If I don&#x27;t lay things out a certain way I can become distracted and/or lose interest. One way to prevent this is by adding some flair to whatever I am doing. Does anyone have an easy way to add some style to an org document? Some ideas I had was to change header colors, add images (which I have sort of figured out), and maybe add borders or something.
 Another issue caused by my constant mental blockages is organization. When I had seen projects in the Doom dashboard I thought this would work but it seems designed for coding projects. How does everyone organize their org files? I&#x27;d like to find a way to set up a notebook type thing and open a directory in a buffer to navigate between the different files. Like a table of contents for every projects, and maybe a master TOC for all of my org files.
 Again, sorry for the long winded post. I suck at Reddit, and don&#x27;t expect much response cuz long posts get ignored, but figured I&#x27;d shoot my shot.

                              <span>ssh-deploy is a way to do coding on local machine and deploy on remote machine. Essentially, it keeps a local directory and a remote directory in sync by doing rsync on file save. 
 magit probably needs no introduction.
 While I find ssh-deploy really really useful, I observed that making changes using magit, such as deleting a hunk in a file or changing a branch (thereby changing files or file contents), the changes are understandably not propagated to remote dir.
 I am no lisp expert, but took up the challenge to get something working with my setup for these usecases:

                              <span>EDIT: THIS QUESTION HAS BEEN ANSWERED. (github questions moved to the github subreddit in this post). 
  
I&#x27;m just trying to get &quot;my feet wet&quot; a bit in browsing elisp and github. I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s a local variable, being used only right there? That&#x27;s Question1.
 Question2: So also, why does my search on github not find the reference for &quot;ctf&quot; in org.el? On github, I&#x27;ve set the repository to 
  
emacs-mirror
 mirrored from git://git.sv.gnu.org/emacs.git
  
Then in the upper left search text box, I do a &quot;search in this repository&quot; for ctf. It only gives me two files:
 test/lisp/epg-resources/seckey.asc
 doc/misc/mh-e.texi
 Question3: Why doesn&#x27;t it also list org.el? Am I misunderstanding that search function? I was looking for any other references to &quot;ctf&quot; in the code base. 
 So that&#x27;s my final question (Question4), is how do I find all occurrences of something in a repository using github web interface?

 and add the following to my .doom.d/config.el
 (use-package all-the-icons-ivy
 :init (all-the-icons-ivy-setup)
 )
 I have tryed my variations of this but it just throws this error when i doom sync.:
 Warning (initialization): An error occurred while loading ‘/home//.emacs.d/init.el’:
 Error in private config: config.el, (void-function all-the-icons-ivy-setup)
 To ensure normal operation, you should investigate and remove the
 cause of the error in your initialization file. Start Emacs with
 the ‘--debug-init’ option to view a complete error backtrace.

                              <span>I do a lot of literate programming and I feel a little bit annoying the fact that I could not find an easy way of using imenu list for the language I&#x27;m developing in.
 I have a project in common lisp, and I wrote this function
 (defun imenu-literate (src-edit?) (interactive &quot;P&quot;) (let ((imenu-generic-expression lisp-imenu-generic-expression) (imenu-create-index-function #&#x27;imenu-default-create-index-function)) (imenu-list-update-safe) (imenu-list-refresh) (call-interactively #&#x27;imenu) (when src-edit? (org-edit-special)))) 
 which is fair enough to understand and works but it sure feels like a Hack. Moreover I&#x27;d like to use this for more languages and I&#x27;d like to set the underlying mode through org mode as a pragma.
 But since this would be so convenient I wanted to ask if there is already something like this and I don&#x27;t have to invent a new wheel.
 Cheers!

 Could you advice me a free or rarely used key to use as a prefix-key ?

                              <span>Hi, I encountered these two lines while reading Purcell&#x27;s config. My main problem is not knowing the differences between &quot;making packages available&quot;, &quot;loading packages&quot;, and &quot;activating packages&quot;.
  
 From the docs, (setq package-enable-at-startup nil) doesn&#x27;t &quot;make installed packages available when Emacs starts&quot;. So, does &quot;installed packages&quot; here refer to packages found in load-path? Also, what does it mean for a package to be &quot;available&quot;? Such that (require &#x27;package) will work?
  
 Then, (package-initialize) will &quot;load Emacs Lisp packages, and activate them&quot;. So what do &quot;loading&quot; and &quot;activating&quot; here mean? Does &quot;loading&quot; here mean the same thing as (load FILE)? Then &quot;activating&quot; means (provide FEATURE)?
  
 I&#x27;ve tried reading Elisp Packaging Section but still couldn&#x27;t understand

                              <span>Sometimes during casual writing I use slang, abbrevs, company names, etc that I don&#x27;t want added to the dictionary. But I don&#x27;t want to turn off flyspell completely and the red squiggles annoy and distract the hell out of me. So I wrote a total hack to make them transient. Enjoy. Or don&#x27;t.
 Just install and call flyspell-toggle-transient-squiggle
 (defvar flyspell-transient-squiggle nil) (defun flyspell-toggle-transient-squiggle () (interactive) (setq flyspell-transient-squiggle (not flyspell-transient-squiggle)) (message &quot;Flyspell transient squiggle: %S&quot; flyspell-transient-squiggle)) (defun nuke-flyspell-squiggles (buf) (with-current-buffer buf (flyspell-delete-all-overlays))) (defadvice make-flyspell-overlay (around transient-flyspell-squiggle activate) ad-do-it (when flyspell-transient-squiggle (run-at-time &quot;3 sec&quot; nil &#x27;nuke-flyspell-squiggles (current-buffer))))

 As the title implies, can you adjust Org to accept lower and upper case if you have &quot;TODO(a)&quot;, for example if org-use-fast-todo-selection &#x27;auto? Or adjust it to work like org-capture, so it doesn&#x27;t quit if A was pressed?

 When I type C-h k C-c C-o I verify that this function is bound.
 When my point is on a headline, the function generates a UUID in a new PROPERTIES drawer. The output at the bottom of the screen says &quot;running less /home//org/data//some-other-uuid&quot;
 The interactive documentation says that a list of links should be displayed so that I can choose the one I want.
 Any ideas?

 ​
 I plan to switch all of the files to org-mode and use org-babel-tangle&#x60; to generate the source files.
 ​
 I would like to clean it up a bit - make it look more professional. It&#x27;s missing a TOC and I have to specify the output file for every source code block. Any suggestions for improvement are appreciated.

                              <span>Since in my last Scala job we agreed that functions will be separate from data, I have often felt the urge to make many (most?) of those functions into extension methods. However, I felt it would introduce a bunch of boilerplate code that is not really necessary in any way.
 Now with syntax changes in Scala 3 generally, and also with the dedicated syntax for extension methods I don&#x27;t see any reason anymore to not write code this way. Feels like the best of both words.
 Can you think of any reason why that would be a bad idea. While I don&#x27;t have this problem right now, I can hardly imagine reviewers being content with such code in PRs, though I can&#x27;t see a reason for objections either.

                              <span>Hello again community! I&#x27;ve posted a few days before, some questions about diving into Scala.js, and thankfully I received great answers and I am continuing my research!
 Today I was trying to debug Scala.js within an IDE (both IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate and VSCode).
 I&#x27;ve read some posts/issues/jetbrains issues but all of them are older (2016-17 era), but the most they managed to get is in-browser debugging.
 As years passed, is there a way to properly debug through an IDE?
 Also afaik debugging depends on sourcemaps, so does error tracking libraries such as Sentry. Is it possible to properly error track Scala.js?

                              <span>So I&#x27;m new to Haskell and trying to wrap my head around it, coming from imperative languages it&#x27;s so different I might as well have never coded in my life. I find the syntax... strange, to say the least.
 I&#x27;m trying to understand a solution for a function that detects if a String is a pangram (contains every letter of the alphabet), here it is :
  isPangram text &#x3D; all (&#x60;elem&#x60; text) [&#x27;A&#x27;..&#x27;Z&#x27;] 
 What I don&#x27;t understand are those parentheses, they don&#x27;t make sense to me. 
 As far as I can tell, elem takes 2 arguments; a character then a string. So what does (elem text) even mean? It has to do something, because if I take those parentheses out, the function no longer works. Yet (elem text) doesn&#x27;t actually work on its own, so what is going on here?
 Also, all takes a list of booleans right? Assuming all is supposed to be applied to a list of booleans, I would think that (elem text) [&#x27;A&#x27;..&#x27;Z&#x27;] should get reduced to a list of booleans, but actually that code also doesn&#x27;t work on its own. Where is the list of booleans all is applied to coming from, then?

                              <span>One thing I realized today from reading Johannes Schmidt’s paper1 is this:
In Luhmann’s second ZK:
Luhmann had 67,000 Main Notes (aka, Permanent Notes)
And he had 15,000 Literature Notecards in his bibliography (usually with about 10-15 bullet points of thoughts and page numbers per book or article he read).
This means for each book or article he read, he only creates on average 4 to 5 main notes.
The other bullet points (like the other 10 bullet points) he would just make references to the book and page numbers.
He would go to a card about Ideology for instance and write “For more on Ideology, see Williamson p. 256” for instance.
I think there’s an assumption out there that one ought develop every bullet point literature note they take.
Any thoughts on this?

                              <span>Is there a package which automatically and intelligently rewrites variable-name to variableName or variable_name depending on the current major language mode? It should be intelligent enough to account for cases where you&#x27;re typing within the bounds of string quotes. The more I think about this problem the more difficult I think it would be to write such a package --- perhaps none exists.
 As an example, let&#x27;s suppose we&#x27;re writing Python (with | as the cursor):
 Basic:
  
variable-name|
 variable-name |
 variable_name | (conversion performed)
  
In quotes:
  
variable_name &#x27;foo-bar|
 variable_name &#x27;foo-bar |
 variable_name &#x27;foo-bar | (no conversion as the user is typing within quotes)
  
In f-string:
  
variable_name f&#x27;foo {bar-baz|
 variable_name f&#x27;foo {bar-baz |
 variable_name f&#x27;foo {bar_baz | (conversion performed)

                              <span>I often get overwhelmed at the number of things in my TODO list, and end up avoiding looking at it at all.
 I would like to be able to limit the number of TODO&#x27;s displayed there (say 5 TODO&#x27;s), and some way of moving to next/previous 5.
 Is it possible to do it in the regular org-todo-list view?
 Do I need a custom view? if so, how would I do it?

                              <span>Is there any way to separately define bindings for when the right alt/ctrl keys are used as qualifiers (ie treat them differently than the left ones)? google didn&#x27;t provide an obvious answer.
 I never use those keys. I would like to define at least one of them with a whole lot of bindings for entering unicode symbols (for instance, right-alt-A as the &quot;alpha&quot; symbol). I assume I&#x27;d want to set them up to act as &quot;super&quot; or &quot;hyper&quot; in emacs lingo.
 This is under windows, but I&#x27;m also interested in doing the same thing when I&#x27;m running emacs on an AWS linux box (via XMinG under windows).

Is there support for embedded images? (like markdown&#x27;s ![]() image links)
 Is there a reliable way to view/edit Org files on android? Viewing should be rendered, with embedded images, not as plain text.

                              <span>Been digging through documentation and searching the interwebs for the past couple days, looking for a solution but without much luck. The problem is this:
 I tend to have electric-quote-mode enabled when working with text and org files, for the sake of the typographic curly quotes, and I noticed that functions like forward-word and count-words-region are &quot;fooled&quot; into thinking that possessives and contractions are two words instead of one whenever the Right Single Quotation Mark (0x2019) appears inside a word as an apostrophe, becoming a &quot;separator&quot; rather than just part of the word itself.
 The straight-quote apostrophe (0x27) doesn&#x27;t seem to have this problem. I found out that it&#x27;s defined in the text-mode syntax table as a word constituent, so naturally I figured the easy fix would be …</span>

 I have a quick question regarding multiple selections with consult: Helm Buffer has a feature which allows selecting multiple buffers via C-SPC in order to kill those at once with M-D (see here). Does consult-buffer provide a comparable feature? If so, how could I access it? 
 Furthermore, I would like to generalize the question: Given any consult-* command, how can I select multiple items and act on those with the help of embark?
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>so I&#x27;ve seen the light and switched from vim/markdown to Doom emacs/org
 I was going to post there, but I think this is more of a general how to question.
 I have a shell script that I&#x27;ve been using as a template for my blog posts. I think, I could rework it to end up as an org file. But I recently watched a System Crafters video on org roam which talks about org-capture-template particularly the template in Org files bit
 if anyone cares about the script here&#x27;s the gist
 is there a way to make an org template for blog posts that would work like org-capture but store the file in path/to/jekyll/_posts
 TL;DR is there a way to make a chord to open an org template for blog posts?

                              <span>On behalf of maintainers I&#x27;m happy to announce that bytestring-0.11.3.0 has been released. It will be a part of upcoming GHC 9.2.2.
 The focus of this release is an extended API for ShortByteString, submitted by /u/maerwald as a part of Abstract FilePath Proposal. bytestring is proud to be a part of this initiative, aimed to provide much faster and more principled FilePath type. Huge thanks to /u/maerwald for spearheading it!
 Other highlights from the changelog:
  
UTF-8 support: add Data.ByteString.Short.isValidUtf8 and use safe FFI for large inputs.
 Improve performance and laziness of unlines.
 Improve performance of intercalate.
 Improve allocations of singleton.
  
Many people contributed their time and effort to make this release happen. Just to name a few in no particular order, mostly according to git log:

 askeblad
 Ben Gamari
 Dmitry Ivanov
 Jaro Reinders
 Johannes Waldmann
 Julian Ospald

On a personal note, it was not easy to work on this release with my family in a bomb shelter and friends in trenches. Stand with Ukraine, will you?

 Then I want to extract client using:  UsersRoutes { usersId &#x3D; fromServant @_ @(AsClientT ClientM) -&gt; UserIdRoutes {..}, ..} &#x3D; genericClient @_ @ClientM 
 GHC politely tells me that fromServant cannot be applied to the pattern, because type mismatches.
 How can I distribute captured id to UserIdRoutes in convenient way when I want to extract client from UsersRoutes using pattern matching?

 It is a pet project of mine written a couple of weeks ago; it was originally for a friend but I felt it would be interesting to get some feedback from the Haskell community, feature requests and, why not, new contributors -- assuming the project is deemed interesting!
 As always, all comments welcome.

                              <span>Sorry if this is a duplicate! I searched the‍ subreddit but didn&#x27;t peer the same question. Is it possible to cache dependency builds with stack or cabal? My use case is creating a docker image that contains a working executable of our project. The build takes forever because of dependencies, it would be great to have it cached as another layer. Thanks in advance!

                              <span>So years ago I did a project with Scala and really liked it, and now that I&#x27;m very into functional programming these days I&#x27;ve picked it up again through a course I&#x27;m taking on Akka. I&#x27;ve got a lot more experience with Java &amp; Kotlin than Scala, fyi.
 Anyway, while doing this Akka course I just decided to create a nice simple utility function within an object to abstract away all the boilerplate setup/teardown for actor systems during the course:
 package io.me.akka package io.me.akka.utils // BONUS: Not my main question, but why do we declare packages twice? import akka.actor.ActorSystem import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global object ActorSystemHandler { def useSimpleSystem(name: String, useSystem: ActorSystem &#x3D;&gt; Unit): Unit &#x3D; { val system &#x3D; ActorSystem(name) useSystem(system) system.terminate() .map(_ &#x3D;&gt; println(&quot;ActorSystem terminated&quot;)) } } 
 My issue is when i try to use this into one of my lesson objects, like so:
 package io.me.akka package io.me.akka.part2actors import io.me.akka.utils.ActorSystemHandler // This is the line for #2 import akka.actor.{Actor, ActorRef, Props} object ChangingActorBehavior extends App { ActorSystemHandler.useSimpleSystem(&quot;systemName&quot;, system &#x3D;&gt; { // Do stuff with the system }) } 
 There are two main issues that occur:
  
When I type the name ActorSystemHandler, I get the option to auto-import it like usual in IntelliJ. However, when I actually click that option, nothing happens. The IntelliJ auto-import fails to do anything.
 I go ahead and manually add the import statement, as can be seen above. However, &quot;io.me.akka&quot; part of the import is shaded in that grayish color that IntelliJ uses to indicate something is not necessary.
  
I&#x27;m hoping someone can clarify the above points for me. Manually adding the import results in code that will compile/run, but I feel like I&#x27;m doing something wrong. Thanks.

If...we seek communication with the second mind, we must seek internal possibilities for linkings which result in the unexpected (i.e. information).


In digging through the forums, it seems that some believe that Luhmann (and/or the community) overstates the importance of surprise in a Zettelkasten. If you are of this belief, can you enlighten me as to why you make this claim?</span>

                              <span>Hi,
I checked a lot of content on this topic and everyone seems to have his/her own idea on what a zettelkasten is and that makes things extremely confusing when trying to implement it.
I study a lot of computer science content and want to organise it but I am not sure exactly how many folders I should have(some people say two, some three, some four), for what purpose(fleeting notes, literature notes, permanent notes, hub)  and how the notes should be structured and linked.
I apologise if what I wrote above is vague but it&#x27;s extremely hard for me to phrase it.</span>

                              <span>I sometimes read papers and other PDFs on an Android tablet and I want to take notes, annotate or highlight etc.
 At the same time, I&#x27;m developing my note taking workflow using Org mode and Org Roam.
 What&#x27;s the best way to sync the two? I don&#x27;t have a preference for which Android app to use, as long as it allows me to take notes directly on the PDF in a way that can then easily be exported and integrated with the rest of my notes in Emacs.
 I don&#x27;t mind writing a little conversion script if necessary, e.g. to automatically insert some links to my org-roam nodes where possible.
 EDIT: should mention that the notes might also contain pictures

My name is David and for the past three months, Tweag has generously sponsored my work on criterion.rs1. Criterion.rs is a widely used (with nearly 1.4 million downloads in the last 90 days) benchmarking library for the Rust programming language which helps you measure the performance of your code and was inspired by its Haskell namesake2.
I’m a heavy user of criterion.rs as well as one of its maintainers, and three particular pain points have been sticking out like a sore thumb to me. These pain points affect a significant number of people while still being relatively easy to fix, making them, in my opinion, a great fit for Tweag’s Fellowship3 programme which aims to fund Open Source contributions.

                              <span>Since questions of the type “Emacs can&#x27;t find my language server” are quite frequent here, I would like to announce a package that helps with that.
 https://github.com/astoff/buffer-env
 The package works in a manner similar to the direnv program (and is mostly compatible with it). Moreover, it sets the environment variables buffer-locally, so once things are configured everything runs on autopilot and you don&#x27;t need to manually switch between different projects.

                              <span>I am trying to move away from spacemacs to my own config. But I want to have the packages that I have set up. I would like to move away from spacemacs for the sake of flexibility and control. Spacemacs is too late for some of the important items like native comp and their develop branch sometimes has bugs.
 I would like to minimize the changes in my workflow, if I cant keep them the same(keybindings et. al.). Replicating the same environment is proving to be cumbersome due to :
 - Spacemacs setup has too many packages, I am not even 1/4th of the way through and already the literate config is a couple of thousands of lines long.
 - I am used to the keybindings of spacemacs and replicating them is taking too much time. I have already built all the muscle memory and don&#x27;t want a different set of keys.
 - Going through all the documentation of the packages to get the exact setup as I had in spacemacs is very tricky. Sometimes spacemacs has some clever ways of handling things, which needs me to look into spacemacs code.
 - Going over spacemacs code is complex. I am now left with the feeling that I am replicating spacemacs code in my config.
 Has anyone felt the same? how have you dealt with this?

                              <span>Hi, I want to set up my personal development environment for C++ in emacs, and I have a few questions:
 I installed clangd and LSP, and if I open just one .cpp file it&#x27;s all good, but when I bring in multiple headers and files in different directories it doesn&#x27;t know where to find them (of course), how can I fix it? Also, I used to use makefiles, but I read that since clangd uses something called compile_commands.json and CMake can produce them, the latter would be a better option... the problem is that I don&#x27;t know how this whole interaction works and I can&#x27;t find a clear explanation about this on the internet. Lastly, is there a way to use only makefiles instead of CMake, or is it either impossible or impractical?

 When I export my markdown files, it&#x27;s plain text on markdown-mode but If I preview/export on VSCode, it colors everything including syntax highlighting with language aware colors. How do i achieve this on markdown-mode?
 Thanks

I think that I use to click on the error in it was put into *Messages* buffer, but it doesn&#x27;t work like this now.
 Do you know what I have to do to see the type error in a buffer that doesn&#x27;t disappear like with a mini buffer?

                              <span>In my opinion all 3 of those have a natural right to sit on the TAB key:
  
Indentation: It is the tabulator key after all
 Completion: As in TAB-completion in the terminal
 folding: like in orgmode, but most code that has blocks can be folded
  
I don&#x27;t have a good solution for all of them at once. ideally it would support different packages for Indentation/compilation/folding. 
 What do you use?

 As we&#x27;ve reached the end of February(ish), it&#x27;s time for another TMiO post; this time from a non-emacs part of the Org ecosystem (gasp).

 Enjoy!

 Notice that the first hline (horizontal line) is slightly thicker than the others, because it is interpreting the first hline as a column header. 
 Is there any way to stop this?

                              <span>Is there a way to rename links automatically based on the original headline?
 Example:
 * Headline 1 :PROPERTIES: :ID: some_id :END: * Headline 2 - Headline 1 // this is a link using an id * Headline 3 - Headline 1 // this is a link using an id 
 When creating a new internal link, org allows you to specify the text for that link. Is there a way to dynamically change that linking text based on the headline? If I change the text of Headline 1
 to Headline 4, I now want to be able to run a function that can change the text of all links to Headline 4
 Is that possible?
 ​
 I basically need to write a function that will:
 Loop over all internal links. For each link:
  
Get the text from the headline that is linked
 replace the text of the link

                              <span>Hi,
 I have an issue in the new Scala3 docs. Special characters in entities are not escaped when the scala doc is generated, which leads to some issue when hosting the scaladoc on some website like Github Pages. An example would be a class named &quot;~&quot; which generate a file called &quot;~.html&quot; which is not found by Github Pages
 However in previous Scala2 scaladoc the character was escaped with something like &quot;$tilde.html&quot;
 Any idea if it is possible to get this behavior in scala3 ? 
 Here are a working and a flawed example :

Thanks in advance :)

 As a caveat, there is a blockchain / web3 / decentralized layer to what we’re doing. We know that this is contentious for many in the community. So for those with reservations, we understand, however, we think this use-case is legit.

                              <span>https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/SmoothScrolling says:
  
The next release of Emacs, Emacs 29, will come with built-in support for pixel-based scrolling.
 You can enable it using pixel-scroll-precision-mode. 
  
I hadn&#x27;t heard of this. Has anyone used this? Are there any performance issues? In my 5-minute testing I haven&#x27;t noticed any.
 EDIT: According to Emacs&#x27; etc/NEWS, this is what the new mode actually improves in comparison to pixel-scroll-mode:
  ** New minor mode &#x27;pixel-scroll-precision-mode&#x27;. When enabled, and if your mouse supports it, you can scroll the display up or down at pixel resolution, according to what your mouse wheel reports. Unlike &#x27;pixel-scroll-mode&#x27;, this mode scrolls the display pixel-by-pixel, as opposed to only animating line-by-line scrolls.

                              <span>Hi there!
 Enrique here! The consult-project-extra package got recently accepted into MELPA. Nevertheless, expect to also find the package in GNU ELPA in the future, since it only requires packages either built into Emacs or on GNU ELPA (as is consult).
 Please, try the MELPA installation process, and test the functions out. I really appreciate any comments.
 Best,

 Motivation:
 I found the exwm built-in functionality for moving windows between workspaces pretty buggy. If I remember correctly, my major issue was that the built-in functionality only worked for windows displaying exwm buffers but I wanted all windows to be treated equally. I also threw in a completing-read interface that I though I would use but haven&#x27;t found much use for it. Instead I find the functionality to move windows to a specific workspace by number far more useful. 
 ​
 Anyways, feedback welcome. Happy to post to melpa if people find it useful.

 I found emacs-dashboard (dashboard.el) to be a bit to involved for my liking. I wanted a much more minmimalistic splash screen that achived the following goals:
  
Centered text (any arbitrary ascii banner) regardless of the current window size. 
 Used just a single buffer rather than requiring a bunch of duplicate buffers to achive requirement #1. 
 No flashy buttons or other things that I would never bother to click anyways. 
  
​
 Its probably not everyone&#x27;s taste but it does what I need it to. Perhaps others will find it useful. If people want I can put on melpa. 
 Feedback welcome.

                              <span>Following up on my last post about dired-registers, here is a package I recently took over maintenance of. I fixed a bug that was preventing copy and pasting of entire directories recursively. That said, main development was from Hidaka Uchida a number of years back. 
 https://github.com/jsilve24/dired-copy-paste
 ​
 This is just a really minimalistic (same theme as dired-registers) implementation of a copy-paste interface like Ranger or Ranger.el (just much more minimal). 
 ​
 See Readme on github for more details.

                              <span>Feedback appreciated. I am new to writing emacs packages for others. So far most of mine have just been written for my own use. If people find this useful, I will post to melpa. 
 ​
 https://github.com/jsilve24/dired-registers
 ​
 Motivation:
 I like emacs bookmarks but I rarely want to create something so permanent to just hold my place when moving between directories (e.g., when copying and pasting files between directories; see dired-copy-paste for more on copying and pasting in dired). This package lower the barrier to keeping your place by implementing registers storing a directory and making it easy to jump back later. Think of these registers like temporary bookmarks that don&#x27;t persist between sessions (just like evil registers).

The headlines are those where, in the agenda display, the text of the headline does not reach the beginning of the habit graph. I discovered that lengthening the heading sufficiently (just adding more text) and rebuilding the agenda makes the asterisks white. Removing the extra text and rebuilding again greys them out again.
 I noticed this happening a couple of days ago. What is going? Is this meant to happen, and if not, what can I do about it?

                              <span>I want to start using dotfiles in a bare repo, and commit/pull using magit. I have found the following code to use magit with a bare repo:
 ;; prepare the arguments (setq dotfiles-git-dir (concat &quot;--git-dir&#x3D;&quot; (expand-file-name &quot;~/.dotfiles&quot;))) (setq dotfiles-work-tree (concat &quot;--work-tree&#x3D;&quot; (expand-file-name &quot;~&quot;))) ;; function to start magit on dotfiles (defun dotfiles-magit-status () (interactive) (add-to-list &#x27;magit-git-global-arguments dotfiles-git-dir) (add-to-list &#x27;magit-git-global-arguments dotfiles-work-tree) (call-interactively &#x27;magit-status)) (global-set-key (kbd &quot;F5 d&quot;) &#x27;dotfiles-magit-status) ;; wrapper to remove additional args before starting magit (defun magit-status-with-removed-dotfiles-args () (interactive) (setq magit-git-global-arguments (remove dotfiles-git-dir magit-git-global-arguments)) (setq magit-git-global-arguments (remove dotfiles-work-tree magit-git-global-arguments)) (call-interactively &#x27;magit-status)) ;; redirect global magit hotkey to our wrapper (global-set-key (kbd &quot;C-x g&quot;) &#x27;magit-status-with-removed-dotfiles-args) (define-key magit-file-mode-map (kbd &quot;C-x g&quot;) &#x27;magit-status-with-removed-dotfiles-args) 
 It works great, however, I would like to automatically add/remove the magit-git-global-arguments automatically depending on what directory magit is opened from: adding the bare repo config when in home, and removing it for all others.
 How can I add a hook that detects when magit is about to get launched, and checks the directory, to then either add or remove the flags?

 (setq doom-font (font-spec :family &quot;Menlo&quot; :size 12) doom-variable-pitch-font (font-spec :family &quot;Monaco&quot;) ; inherits &#x60;doom-font&#x27;&#x27;s :size doom-unicode-font (font-spec :family &quot;Courier New&quot; :size 12) doom-big-font (font-spec :family &quot;monospace&quot; :size 19)) 
 Which is same setting as that of VSCode, but VSCode font size appears to be a bit smaller than Emacs (which I prefer). Any tips on how to make the font sizes same? I&#x27;m on Emacs 28.05 native on MacOS Monterey. Thanks in advance!

                              <span>... since I have started hiting things like C-c C-c and C-y in Google Docs and elsewhere, and then find myself surprised (and a little annoyed) that the right thing didn&#x27;t happen.
 It&#x27;s interesting that it has taken several years, or perhaps that it has taken me switching to mu4e as my email client (last few weeks), in addition to my GTD system which has been in org-mode for at least 2 years now.

                              <span>Please excuse the vague language, I&#x27;m really not sure what to search for!
 If I want to move the M-x &quot;popup&quot; to look more like the VSCode drop-down action menu, using Vanilla Emacs, how should I approach that? I&#x27;m using Counsel, if that makes a difference:
 ;; Replace default &quot;M-x&quot; and &quot;C-x C-f&quot; with Counsel version (global-set-key (kbd &quot;M-x&quot;) #&#x27;counsel-M-x) (global-set-key (kbd &quot;C-x C-f&quot;) #&#x27;counsel-find-file) 
 Sorry for the really dumb question :/
 My whole init.el if that helps, any constructive criticism welcome! https://gist.github.com/anthonyclarka2/d5e8005b8c5a10ce9ca8b0965f33554e

                              <span>I currently call lp from the terminal to print my pdfs. Is there a better way of doing this from emacs?
 As far as I understood, Emacs provides printing.el lpr.el, and ps-print.el to print text but not pdfs. I use pdf-tools which provides pdf-misc-print-document which I can use to print with lp by setting pdf-misc-print-program-executable and pdf-misc-print-program-args. However, I am looking for &quot;Print Dialog&quot; like package where I can select the (network) printer, the pages, the orientation and the double-sided vs not, etc... 
 I can write a lisp function to query for these, but I am wondering if there are better solutions out there.

                              <span>Hello reddit, its me again.
 I have switched to lsp-pyright and everything is fine except Python documentation functionalities. I wondered if anyone has the same problem as me and I hope that someone can give me some pointers on how to fix this.
 The problem I have is that lsp-doc-show and company-show-doc-buffer return incomplete results for many builtins and many numpy functions. Envoking these commands on list for example returns
 class list() 
 and nothing more.
 I have tried quite a lot and I am pretty confident that it has to do with LSP itself or my LSP setup because anaconda-mode-show-doc yields
 builtins list() list(iterable: Iterable[_T]) Built-in mutable sequence. If no argument is given, the constructor creates a new empty list. The argument must be an iterable if specified. 
 which is what I want from LSP.
 Any ideas?

 I might want to define some keys for a purpose, but it&#x27;s also possible that some future package I install could overwrite my definition, right? [EDIT: Or one package clobbering another package.]

                              <span>Hi,
 Would anyone have some recommendation for learning how to programmatically manipulate org-mode with elisp? 
 I don&#x27;t have much elisp knowledge but all the other 3rd party libraries I have found are read-only and could not find anything that allow manipulation of the file itself. 
 I have digged into the source of org-element api but I am left rather confused than anything. 
 I am trying to build an integration with gitlab and orgmode (full project description here) and while I wanted to go with either python or go, I haven&#x27;t found an easy way to modify org files with any of these libraries... 
 So I am trying to go with elisp, which would probably be the most native way to do it, I am just not sure where to start...
 any direction is welcome!

                              <span>This time, without question, I removed all doubt about my connection with reality. I&#x27;ve stuttered and stammered and forgotten the common names of things stumbling along for 20 mins. Confused zettel, note, and file and a PC and a MAC,  and mentioning sideways carrots?( what the hell are those) over and over again. I&#x27;m not getting any better at making videos. Watch this at your own risk. I can&#x27;t be responsible for damages to your DNA? You might get something out of this video that will help your writing.
This combo of the software The Archive and Marked2 are the absolute best writing software combo ever!
A part of the writing process that this video doesn&#x27;t show is the gathering and referencing of the entire ZK when making the zettel that makes up this essay. I habitually run The Archive in two-window mode and keep the right window focused on my work and the left window I use to search my ZK, view PDFs or live preview with Marked2.

Best view in full screen.
https://screencast-o-matic.com/watch/c3eV3qVbL9i
The two-window workflow allows you to write and research effectively. It is so efficient that it is fun. The most fun you can have writing!
Try this - for the win!

                              <span>Here&#x27;s a longer piece critiquing the mechanistic view of folgezettel.
&quot;Folgezettel is More than Mechanism&quot;
This article intends to:
Show that the current state of the FZ debate is one mired in a mechanistic reading of folgezettel
Add to the discussion the often overlooked experiential aspects of employing folgezettel
Show how the practice of folgezettel positively influences the note making process
Diversify and broaden the discussion in an effort to show that zettelkasten techniques are more compliments than competitors
From the article:

  
&quot;A mechanistic view is one that privileges the mechanics of a process over the experiential. It ignores the emotional. It tries to establish cohesion often through reductive arguments, determining value (more or less of it) by how parts function together as a system divorced from the subjective experience of the user. As it stands, the folgezettel debate is mired in this mechanistic systems thinking....&quot;</span>

What are your favorite tools adjacent to your Zettelkasten?
by &quot;adjacent&quot; I mean &quot;not your ZK but integral to your knowledge ecosystem&quot;
Broadly, I see three categories for these:
I&#x27;m mostly interested in 3, but any solid arguments for specific ways of handling 1 or 2 to work well with a ZK is welcome. For such arguments for example, why should I download Typora instead of writing in a more general editor like Atom?</span>

                              <span>Hi, I have this function which solves this problem: https://purdue.kattis.com/problems/trainsorting. solve is the naive recursive version and solve&#x27; is the DP version. I used the method shown on the Haskell wiki to construct the DP matrix. 
 The algorithm works, but its runtime scales with the bounds of the matrix, so it takes a prohibitively long time with bounds higher than 1000 or so. I don&#x27;t understand why though, since I can tell by the trace that it only calculates the required elements. My first thought is that it has to preallocate the array, but I tried it with a Data.Map as well for the same result.
 Any explanation is appreciated

                              <span>Using Haskell has made me think about imperative languages differently. An interesting thing to think about is that the “async/await” patterns of these languages mirror monad patterns in Haskell with do-notation. The “await” keyword with “var x &#x3D; await …” is just like “x &lt;- …” in Haskell. And Future is really just a monadic type! Perhaps one day we’ll see an imperative language implement true monads and do asynchrony in terms of them.

                              <span>Hey folks, how are u doing?
 So... I have a doubt related to the usage of for comprehension...
 Lets imagine that I have an User type that is the product of UserId, UserName and UserEmail and each of them contains its own validations, right?
 So lets imagine that my value called UserName looks like this:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;scala final case class ValidationError(message: String)
 final case class UserName private(name: String)
 type UserNameFactoryResult &#x3D; Either[ValidationError, UserName]
 object UserName { def fromString(rawName: String): UserNameFactoryResult &#x3D; ... // some validation blabla } &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Now I am trying to think about the factory for the User entity inside of my object companion.
 I want to use somekind of for-comprehension but I dont have any idea on how to mix the for-comprehension with my either results
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;scala case class User(id: UserId, name: UserName, email: UserEmail)
 type UserFactoryResult &#x3D; Either[List[ValidationError], User]
 object User { def createFromStrings(rawId: String, rawName: String, rawEmail: String): UserFactoryResult &#x3D; { val eitherUser &#x3D; for { id &lt;- UserId.fromString(rawId) // this can be Left or Right name &lt;- UserName.fromString(rawName) // this can be Left or Right email &lt;- UserEmail.fromString(rawEmail) // this can be Left or Right } yield new Right(User(id, name, email)) } } &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 well well... what I need to do with this code is to find a way to CORRECTLY returns EITHER a List with each error that happened in those type values EITHER my valid User with its correct values.
 what should I do? what is the cleanest way of doing this with pure scala 3? can I avoid nesting pattern match inside this for-comprehension? how to go on with this?

                              <span>Hello guys! I am a front-end web developer, tired of JS-TS.
 First of all, I am not familiar with Scala and its ecosystem, so, sorry about that.
 I own a startup which is close to make a deal with an organization for a serious project.
 I always search for viable JS alternatives and really like Scala as a language (even though I have no experience with it).
 For the last 2 days I am researching on how to embrace Scala-js. I managed to gather some information. 
 Concern no 1: interop with the JS ecosystem. Solution: scalably-typed
 Concern no 2: react bindings. Solution: Slinky
 Concern no 3: bundler. Solution: Not so sure, but I&#x27;ve found scalajs-bundler which works with webpack, but I am unsure about the integration with Concern no 4 bellow.
 Concern no 4: Monorepo setup-build system. 
 If anyone is familiar with JS ecosystem, there is the nx.dev monorepo managing tool which has the features I need for this project, which will be structured with a feature based folder structure.
 What I need:
  
apps folder containing 3 applications which will share many libraries-modules from the libs folder mention bellow 
  libs folder which will contain feature based modules, for reuse across the 3 apps
  
Something like this:
 apps/
 ├─ app-1/
 ├─ app-2/
 ├─ app-3/
 libs/
 ├─ feature-1/
 ├─ feature-3/
 ├─ feature-4/
 ├─ feature-2/
 ​
 How can I achieve this? Anyone with experience with something similar?
 As a reminder, those 3 apps and libs will target JS, and will need a bundler.
 Is it possible to only build the affected apps when changing some feature on libs folder?
 Even if it is possible, how maintainable will it be?
 Thank you for your answers!

 In particular, I&#x27;m looking for Scala 3 compatible ORM/RDBMS libraries, and JSON libraries that include macros for deriving codecs. Up until now I&#x27;ve been hand writing codecs for small scale Scala 3 projects and using Java based ORMs, but I feel it&#x27;s been long enough to give native libraries another look.

                              <span>I am experimenting with Doom Emacs but it feel like performance is at least as bad as it was with my hand-rolled config. I am running 28.0.91 with native comp on Mojave.
 The stated startup time on the splash screen is normally 2-3 seconds: &quot;Doom loaded 208 packages across 34 modules in 2.06 seconds&quot;. Restoring my previous workspace with 20-30 buffers takes 7-8 seconds. Opening a file in a project takes 1-2 seconds. At first I thought it was due to LSP mode, but it&#x27;s still slow even with it disabled.
 I have followed some of the recommendations in Doom&#x27;s README &quot;why is Doom slow?&quot;, but my situation seems a bit more pathological than what those try to address. 
 I tried profiling opening a single line file (took a second or two) and the CPU profile says that it spent 28% of its time in automatic GC and 51% of its time in vertico--advice. I&#x27;m assuming that was the file selection popup, so it appears that Emacs is really just spending all its time waiting for something. I&#x27;d be grateful for advice how to debug further.

                              <span>Hi
 I&#x27;m looking to enhance my writing experience by dragging text around.
 In Org-mode, dragging the current paragraph (or subtree, or list item) up and down is easy with M-up and M-down.
 I&#x27;m an Evil user, so for swapping two regions, there&#x27;s evil-exchange.
 Is there a package that would allow me to drag the current region up or down? Or perhaps right or left, along the same line? Or does anyone have any pointers on how to best write something that achieves this?
 Cheers

 I imagine, if this is even possible, I would need to bind my own key chord to a which-key command, something like this:
 (global-set-key (kbd &quot;C-M-\&#x60;&quot;) #&#x27;which-key-show-top-level) 
 But that only shows the top level commands (for the current major mode?). Or perhaps there&#x27;s another package that does this?

                              <span>tl;dr: Org-capture window closes in i3wm for no reason, how to debug or identify the problem?
 Hi! A beginner user, I use emacs-client 26.3 and Emacs 27.2 with org-capture on Ubuntu 20.4 running i3wm. (Could version mismatch be the problem?) I append text of an org-capture template to an org file. I probably misconfigured something and have these problems:
  
Launching a new window of org-capture from i3wm (triggered by a keystroke) works, but the window closes unexpectedly after some 10-50 seconds, often before I finish writing a note in the template and the work is lost. But if I type fast enough and complete C-c C-c before crash then all is good. What would be the log file I should look into? What could cause this?

                              <span>Hello,
 As the question asks, where is the variable global-map initially filled with values ? It is defined in subr.el as nil and many keys are defined in bindings.el. However, I seem to miss something because I can&#x27;t for instance find where letters are bound to self-insert-command.
 Thanks in advance

                              <span>Hi, all. Some of you might&#x27;ve seen my last post on Vertico, Marginalia, All-the-icons-completion, and Orderless last week.
 I present to you my small configuration for Corfu, Kind-icon, and Corfu-doc, which greatly complement the packages in that previous post by enhancing the built-in completion-at-point.
 Sometime in the near future, I&#x27;ll be trying to show my (messy) way of utilizing the cape package&#x27;s completion-at-point backends.
 Cheers!

                              <span>I have an intermediate level knowledge of bash scripting and use of the linux command line.I know given enough time i could eventually become a power user but my dilemma is this: im also falling deeper in love with emacs. The more i read about it the more i get the feeling that it would be much more time-efficient to just master emacs and forego going deeper down the rabbit holes of bash shell scripting and the various Gnu utilities and .etc. It seems to me that with emacs I pretty much get a entire environment in which all packages,commands,config files and etc are all written in one language(e lisp). So that being said, can I just go &quot;all in&quot; on learning emacs and e lisp and just more or less ignore bash scripting and learning more about the various linux terminal commands?

                              <span>I have Haskell installed via GHCup and it works just fine in the command prompt. The trouble is VSCode integration. It worked previously, but after updating to vscode version 1.64.2, HLS stopped working with error libHSghc-prim-0.7.0.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
 I&#x27;ve tried reinstalling/updating GHC and HLS but the issue remains. I couldn&#x27;t find any information about this issue and was hoping someone else could assist.
 GHC version - 8.10.7
 HLS version - 1.6.1.0

 What is your current favorite package for using free monads (either directly or in the spirit of) to implement EDSLs?

                              <span>Hello all! I&#x27;m currently implementing a source code formatter using prettyprinter and ran into a situation that I can&#x27;t get over.
 The assembly of the Doc is performed in the context of a state Monad, as I need to keep track of some state as I go on:
  type StateDoc &#x3D; State MyState (Doc ()) 
 This works fine, I have individual functions that assemble different parts of the document:
  fortmatPartA :: DataA -&gt; StateDoc fortmatPartB :: DataB -&gt; StateDoc fortmatPartC :: DataC -&gt; StateDoc  It the end when I put the document together, parts A, B and C are to be arranged on top of each other vertically:
 vsep  sequence [formatPartA dataA, formatPartB dataB, formatPartC dataC]
 Now the problem that I&#x27;m having is that formatPartB and formatPartC can return an emptyDoc, which can result in something like [PartADoc, emptyDoc, PartBDoc]. This is a problem because emptyDocs have a height of 1 and will introduce an unwanted newline in the final document. I would like to completely ignore the part of the document if it returns emptyDoc.
 Does someone have an idea of how I can achieve this?
 I thought about not using emptyDoc at all, but Maybe instead:
 formatPartB :: DataB -&gt; State MyState (Maybe (Doc ()))
 but how could I implement the &quot;excluding&quot; logic that ignores the Nothings? Is there something like a mapMaybe or catMaybe for Monads? Maybe I&#x27;m missing something obvious.
 Thanks a lot for your help and happy haskelling :)

                              <span>The PureScript team has launched the language&#x27;s first annual survey! This survey will help the core team learn more from the community about how we can improve the language and the ecosystem around it. If you&#x27;ve used PureScript before, please take the time to fill out this survey:
 https://surveyhero.com/c/wzajwjpd
 Even if you have never written PureScript, we want to hear from you! There&#x27;s a short section specifically for non-users.
 If you can share this survey with your peers and communities that would also be super helpful.
 Thanks for your time and we look forward to hearing your thoughts!

                              <span>I&#x27;m literally 10 minutes into my adventures with PureScript, so I know almost nothing and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m missing some very obvious things! But I&#x27;m working through the book at https://book.purescript.org/ and am wondering why the code and tests all produce a bunch of warnings?
 For example, one warning I see for the Chapter 2 code is:
  
No type declaration was provided for the top-level declaration of ns
  
I&#x27;m working in VSCode and have v0.14.7 of purs (and generally the latest versions of everything as far as I know). Maybe the book would prefer me to use an older version of the compiler?

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I am working on a software project which I am organizing my tasks in a hierarchical structure where a top level heading is a general feature and the sub headings are tasks that need to be done concerning that feature.
 This is very simple so far, what I would like to add now is a milestone tag so I can associate some features with a specific version, this is a very common approach in software development as far as I know. The problem is that when I write a tag containing dots, org-mode considers the dots as tag separators, so I cannot write a tag as the following :v1.0: because it would be replaced with :v1:0:.
 If anyone has any workaround for this let me know. Or if you have any other suggestions I would like to give them a try, I myself thought about some alternatives but I would first want to know if I can do it the way I want.

                              <span>I want to use org habits, so I add habits to org-modules in my init file. If I boot emacs and open the agenda, habit graphs don&#x27;t show up. If I then check the value of the variable with describe-variable (it _does_ includehabits) and refresh the agenda, the habit graphs show up! Similarly if I open emacs, check the variable, (again,habits&#x60; is present in the list) and then open the agenda the graphs display, but if I don&#x27;t check the variable they don&#x27;t.
 Am I doing something wrong or is this a report-worthy bug?

                              <span>I know any such statistics would be rough, just wondering if there&#x27;s a way to see something like this.
  
EDIT: Answered by /u/yyoncho: &quot;You can sort by downloads on melpa.org&quot;. So here&#x27;s an example of how I&#x27;m using it. As an emacs newbie, I&#x27;m interested in installing some package, let&#x27;s say ido mode, but I&#x27;m also interested in the dozen or so related packages (containing &quot;ido-&quot;). But it&#x27;s hard to get a sense of their popularity, age, etc. 
 So I downloaded the list of all packages from melpa.org, sorted by download count, and made it into a tab-delimited file: Here&#x27;s the gist link to my text file.. Then I grep that to get only the &quot;ido-&quot; packages:
 Download count Name Description Release Repository &quot;482,602&quot; smex M-x interface with Ido-style fuzzy matching. 20151212.2209 github &quot;290,389&quot; …</span>

                              <span>Given this structure (Example 1), if point is anywhere in the line Proj1 (Level 1) and I hit C-S-RET, it will create a new &quot;Level 1&quot; TODO heading just before Proj2 (Level 1)
  
Example 1
 * Proj1 (Level 1) &lt;-- IF POINT IS ANYWHERE HERE * Proj1 H1 (Level 2) * Proj1 H2 (Level 2) * Proj1 H2 Note (Level 3) blah blah * Another Note (Level 4) blah blah * Proj2 (Level 1) &lt;-- C-S-RET INSERTS &quot;* TODO&quot; JUST BEFORE HERE AT LEVEL 1 * Proj2 H1 (Level 2) 
 
 But if they are folded and point is after ellipses:
  
Example 2
 * PROJ1...x &lt;-- point at space marked x * Proj2... 
 
 When I hit C-S-RET I get this:
  
Example 3 
 * PROJ1... * TODO * Proj2... 
 
 That TODO has two invisible parents, which obscures it&#x27;s context, which is shown unfolded here:
  
Example 4 
 * Proj1 (Level 1) * Proj1 H1 (Level 2) * Proj1 H2 (Level 2) * Proj1 H2 Note (Level 3) blah blah * Another Note (Level 4) blah blah * TODO (Level 4) &lt;-- TODO ADDED HERE * Proj2 (Level 1) 
 
 Why does C-S-RET add a TODO exactly 3 levels deeper in this case? Why not any of the following alternatives: 
  
At level 1 (same as not folded)
 At level 2 (immediate child)
 At level 5 (depth first traversal of tree)
  
What is &quot;magical&quot; about 3 levels deeper? What are some ways for a typical beginner to deal with this? Maybe &quot;never use C-S-RET after ellipses&quot;? I certainly don&#x27;t want to memorize that rule. Or is there some control variable?
 I think that a sane default would be one of the following:
  
At level 1 (same as not folded)
 At level 2 (immediate child)
  
Any insight would be appreciated, thanks!

 The one issue I&#x27;m running into is that if I mark messages in my inbox with &quot;refile&quot; (&quot;r&quot; in evil mode) and then execute the command, it appears that the command executed correctly. However, when I then jump to my Archive folder, I don&#x27;t see any of the emails.
 Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve done so far to troubleshoot. If I manually look for the messages in a terminal by going into my mu maildir, I can see the archived messages. Additionally if I run &#x60;mu find some-message&#x60; I can see emails in the Archive directory. If I send my self a new email and then archive it, I can see it in emacs.

Informing clangd about the project sources for better finding include files
 Finding compilation toolkits for MSYS2 (Windows) and Unix variants (in progress)
 Configuration of the project via cmake
 Building (compiling) the project with highlighting of errors
 Installing
 Unit testing with ctest
  
As usual, this is provided with no guarantees. It seems to be working on my Windows machine (with native Emacs, no WSL), but your mileage may vary. Feedback and pull requests welcome. Also help in integrating MSVC compilers and other toolkits.

 Hello fellow emacsians. I am in the very happy position to announce to you, my first ever contribution to emacs (besides helping people with emacs here and in other forums), in the form of a new package for emacs called zetteldesk.el. It is by no means done, I have things I want to add, and I am certain its also not perfect, but its usable, and to an extent polished so I thought I would release it. I am just an engineer who loves to take his notes with org-roam, so forgive me if some code isn&#x27;t written in the best version.
 ​
 The name zetteldesk derives from a mix of the words zettelkasten and desktop. I shortened it because zettelkasten-desktop was too large. zetteldesk.el is a tool I made, built primarily on top of org-roam - b…</span>

                              <span>My needs are just to write or edit simple code in C++, Python and Rust; And to maintain a lot of markdown, xml and text files. 
 Trying to find the &quot;best&quot; ide and corresponding plugins for each programming language was just annoying to me. For eg. IntelliJ IDEA is great for Rust, but doesn&#x27;t have an easy C++ support. 
 Thus my decision to switch to something like emacs or vim, which would have all-round support. 
 I completed the tutorial and immediately felt how convenient it would be to navigate around without having to take your hands off the keyboard. 
 I want to now continue to set up Emacs so that I can conveniently use it for the above needs. I&#x27;m setting it up in Manjaro Linux. 
 Do you all have any tips?

                              <span>Hey folks, how are u doing?
 Im a converting a Try to Either but IDK how to pass my own Type Alias so I can compile.
 Example:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;scala
 type UserIdFactoryResult &#x3D; Either[ValidationError, UserId]
 object UserId { private def apply(id: String): UserId &#x3D; new UserId(id) ... def fromString(rawId: String): UserIdFactoryResult &#x3D; { ... case Some(rawId) &#x3D;&gt; { // I need to return UserIdFactoryResult here Try(UUID.fromString(rawId)) .transform( success &#x3D;&gt; Success(Right(this.apply(success.toString))), error &#x3D;&gt; Success(Left(error)) ).get .... } } } &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 But the problem is that this transformation returns an Either[Throwable, UserId] instead of UserIdFactoryResult...
 What should I do?

Please share what small or large ZK successes you had in the past week. Please share your plans are for this coming week. Use this as a public responsibility thread. Use it to hold yourself accountable. Use this as a way to start a conversation.

Last Week
Impermanence is all around me. Everything I see is a temporary arrangement of atoms soon dispersed and reassembled into new arrangements. My attention is also always temporary. Attention flitters from one object to another in a time frame that speeds up and slows just a little from the moment of awakening to after fully sleeping. Even then, dreams grab my attention.
I successfully integrated The Archive/Marked2/Zotero/Pandoc toolchain into my writing environment.

                              <span>Hi there, I&#x27;ve lurked around here on and off for a few years, and Zettelkasten was always in my head somewhere as a &#x27;will do that someday&#x27;. Well more and more I find myself knowing-but-not-quite some fact or info, or knowing that I know it, but not the full details that I knew at one point, or references or sources for looking it up.
So I decided to take the plunge and implement a zettelkasten system for myself. But as I investigated it I became intrigued by the simple yet powerful idea of notes and links, and decided to try to distill (my interpretation of) its essence into a new app. Yes, the cliche of the software dev who discovers zettelkasten and makes an app. However, I think mine has some advantages. For one thing I&#x27;m intentionally keeping it quite spartan–no endless customizability…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m brand new to Haskell. I&#x27;m not asking for you to do my assignment but I do need help figuring out how to use the language so I can complete my assignment. I might be going about this the absolute wrong way but I&#x27;ve never used a language like this before and I&#x27;m getting very lost. 
 Assignment:
 Write a Haskell program that generates the list of all the subsets of the set [1..n] that have as many elements as their complements.
 For the set [1,2,3,4] the output should look like this:
 [([1,2],[3,4]),
 ([1,3],[2,4]),
 ([1,4],[2,3]),
 ....] 
 I&#x27;m currently creating a list from 1-n where n is 6.
 I&#x27;m retrieving all of the subsequences of that list.
 let n &#x3D; 6 let set &#x3D; [1..n] let ordered &#x3D; sortWith length $ subsequences set 
 I don&#x27;t understand how to only get the list of the length of 3 out of this list of lists. What would be the best way to get the list of that length? Thank you for any input! I believe I can figure out the compliment on my own. I just don&#x27;t know how to get the certain lists I need.

                              <span>Suppose I start with this, with point on letter J:
  
Example 1
 * PROJECTS... * Inbox... 
 
 I want this
  
EXAMPLE 2 [EDIT: Actually, this is impossible with org-indent-mode on.]
 * PROJECTS... x &lt;--- point here at space marked x * Inbox... 
 
 What&#x27;s the standard way and/or the most efficient way to get there? Or alternatively, achieve this:
  
Example 3
 * PROJECTS... * x &lt;--- point here at space marked x * Inbox... 
 
 I know that if I start with Example 1 and I press C-S-RET, I&#x27;ll get this:
  
Example 4
 * PROJECTS... * TODO x &lt;--- point here at space marked x * Inbox... 
 
 That&#x27;s good enough for TODO&#x27;s, but I&#x27;d like to do something similar for the other cases. But it&#x27;s odd that it leaves a space there (why does it do that?). I&#x27;d rather it not, but I&#x27;ll accept this standard behavior, for now, if that&#x27;s just the way it works out-of-the-box. (I know I can change emacs to do whatever I want though.) Also, the C-S-RET behaves a little different if the point starts at the end of * Projects...x at space marked x. In that case, it creates something like this:
  
Example 5
 * PROJECTS... * TODO x &lt;--- point here at space marked x * Inbox... 
 
 In Example 5, it creates a new TODO item under the last child entry of * PROJECTS, but leaving * PROJECTS otherwise folded. Isn&#x27;t it a little odd to have an intermediate parent invisible? 
 Finally, does that last point position (marked x here:* Projects...x) have special meaning/purpose? Is there a name for that position?
 EDIT: I think some of my questions about the functionality of ellipses and spaces is probably related to this timely post: https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/t1r2wq/have_you_ever_wondered_how_orgmode_toggles_the/. Which, from a newbie perspective, is probably summed up as &quot;Because reasons.&quot;

 This mode gives the ability to execute the just recipies from within the editor itself.

 I have swtiched to using straight.el because org-mode was complaining about switching repos and I really enjoy the flexibility if offers in selecting pacakages from sources such as Github. Recently, however, I have noticed that when I load any file .org file I get the following message:
  File mode specification error: (error Autoloading file /home/thomas/.emacs.d/straight/build/org/org.elc failed to define function org) 
 This error occurs every time an org file is loaded. I have found I can suppress the error by simply commenting out the line (org-agenda-files &#x60;(&quot;~/Dropbox/gtd&quot;)) in my init.el file.
 This works well, however, my favorite feature of org-mode is the agenda and this essentially breaks that feature. I cannot for the life of me fi…</span>

 The first idea was to get the remainder of the window-width divided by the current line length,
 (- (window-width) (% (length (thing-at-point &#x27;line)) (window-width))) 
 It just doesn&#x27;t work, cause line break happened between spaces.

                              <span>Hi, some buffers can be deleted/hiddden using &quot;q&quot;, like help buffers etc (they probably have a name).
 xwidget seems to disapear (but its only hidden) and when its hidden it always shows another buffer instead. How can I configure this to actually quit the buffer and delete the window?
 This is my function for splitting and showing the browser on the right.
 (defun mk/browser-split-window (url &amp;optional new-window) &quot;Create a new browser window to the right of the current one.&quot; (interactive) (let* ((ignore-window-parameters t) (dedicated-p (window-dedicated-p))) (delete-other-windows) (split-window-horizontally) (other-window 1) (xwidget-webkit-browse-url url))) 
 Looks nice - now lets close it using \&quot;q\&quot;
 Hmm not really what I wanted.
 My complete config can be found here: https://github.com/konrad1977/emacs
 And as a bonus I have another question:
 How do I setup emacs to always set focus to (other-window 1) when a new window is created?
 Thanks!

                              <span>So I was playing around with diff-buffers and ediff-buffers. I had no idea what I was doing, and I ended up with my primary notes.org file containing highlighted sections, saved to disk. I didn&#x27;t know how to get rid of this formatting, so I restored it from the backup notes.org~, as I had only made a minor change (thank goodness). Here&#x27;s the two files, the original (restored), and the ediff highlighted file:
 https://i.imgur.com/K7340jK.png
 Now my questions are as follows:
  
I thought org files were visible text only files, editable in any other text editor. But it&#x27;s clearly saving the highlight features with the text. How is it doing that? What is the format?
 
If I end up with something like this on the right again, how can I strip all the highlight formatting, so I get back to what&#x27;s shown on the left?

                              <span>Have you ever wondered how org-mode toggles the visibility of headings?
 YES!!! me either!
 Let&#x27;s get into it ;)
 Table of content:
  
org-mode visibility of headings
 text properties
 Why are we talking about text properties if the mechanism of outline-mode uses overlays?
 overlays, invisible overlay property, buffer-invisibility-spec 
 buffer-invisibility-spec equal to t
 buffer-invisibility-spec equal to nil
 buffer-invisibility-spec equal to ((foo) t)
 
 ellipsis and buffer-invisibility-spec equal to ((foo . t) t) 
 default ellipsis ...
 custom ellipsis modifying the display table
 
  
org-mode visibility of headings
 org-mode is built on top of outline-mode that is responsible of the visibility changes of the headings.
 How does it work?
 outline-mode uses overlays, specifically the o…</span>

It organizes the APIs into categories nicely, so I can quickly find out the exact APIs that I want, and then I look up them inside Emacs using Help, Info, etc.
 But the page was gone last year (I can&#x27;t remember the exact date), the content was gone, although the URL was still reachable. What a pity!
 Do you know why it was gone? I didn&#x27;t find an alternative to it after that. If you know the maintainer or maintainers, would you like to tell him/her/them about the issue? Thanks!
 If you were also like me, the good news is that we can visit its backup on Wayback Machine, https://web.archive.org/web/20201202092534/https://wikemacs.org/wiki/Emacs_Lisp_Cheat_Sheet, thanks to the Internet Archive!

                              <span>So I&#x27;ve used Monoids in the fp-ts TypeScript library, which is where I learned most of my FP skills. I&#x27;m now diving into Scala and looking to re-use all the constructs I learned over there.
 Anyway, I installed Scalaz and now I&#x27;ve got a list to concatenate into a single value. Sounds easy enough, let&#x27;s just use a Monoid.
 Based on fp-ts, I was expecting the append() function of the Monoid to have a signature like this:
 override def append(f1: String, f2: String): String 
 When, as you already know, it actually has a signature like this:
 override def append(f1: String, f2: &#x3D;&gt; String): String 
 I&#x27;m not even sure what the type of the second argument is supposed to be, let alone how to use this to concatenate my list into a single value.
 Help would be appreciated. Thanks.

 I&#x27;ve been using it myself for a bit, and I felt it reached the stage where it&#x27;s as ready for public consumption as it&#x27;ll ever be. I&#x27;d be interested to know if there are other interested in data visualisation out of scala code... It&#x27;s young, and follows a different paradigm to some of the Prior Art. Feedback, observations and interest welcomed.

                              <span>I have next type for comparing two objects of type A:
 type Equivalence[A] &#x3D; A &#x3D;&gt; A &#x3D;&gt; Boolean 
 But I don&#x27;t understand which type of functor will fit such type here. Briefly, Equivalence looks like a contravariant function with a negative position in input, but in practice, I cannot assemble contravariant functor:
  val coFunctorForEq &#x3D; new ContravariantFunctor[Equivalence] { override def contraMap[A, B](fa: Equivalence[A])(f: B &#x3D;&gt; A): Equivalence[B] &#x3D; (b: B) &#x3D;&gt; b &#x3D;&gt; fa(f(b))(???) } 
 Do I understand correct, that I need invariant functor here?

I just upgraded to The Archive 1.7.6 (202) and noticed that we can now &quot;drag and drop&quot; images into a zettle.  The image will automatically be copied to the media sub-folder within your ZK folder, the reference will be inserted into your zettel, and the image will appear - presto!
That is so much easier than copying the image to your media file and then typing the reference in your zettel.
Thank you so much for this timesaver!!!  It is such a cool feature    (Sometimes little things make a big difference)</span>

                              <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;ve been using org-mode for writing articles for a while. And I recently tried RMarkdown. I am trying to decide which one to use in the future. 
 I really enjoy org-mode. The only problem for me is that since I do not do programming, I do not know any computer language. I have to copy and paste settings by other people for different purposes, such as spelling check, formatting, preview, etc. RMarkdown in RStudio sets up things for me and I can download some packages by others without any specific setup. 
 I also feel that I do not fully use amazing functions of org-mode. For example, while I really like the to-do list and agenda, I do not know how to seamlessly synchronize my calendar (Mac OS) and my org-mode agenda. Many of my meetings are scheduled by others sending me .ics files. I can just go to my calendar and click &quot;accept&quot; or &quot;decline&quot;. Is there a way to automatically make the item appear in my org-mode agenda when I add items on my apple calendar? 
 Anyway, maybe too much information here. Just curious to see others&#x27; experience of using org-mode for academic writing.

                              <span>At the moment, GHC has some machinery for tracking (annotating and inferring) the roles of parameters to type constructors. Roles and their machinery do not appear to be first class, in that it is not possible to discuss the roles of parameters to higher kinded type variables. This is a bit annoying, because in the absence of the ability to discuss such things one has to explicitly carry around coercion dictionary baggage.
 The &quot;role&quot; of a parameter roughly encodes the sort of &quot;equality functor&quot; the type-level function is. Specifically, the role of some type constructor&#x27;s parameter determines what kind of equivalence it needs as input in order to produce a representational equivalence as output. If it requires _, the parameter has a _:
  
definitional equality, nominal role
 representational equivalence, representational role
 codiscrete equivalence (any two things are equal), phantom role
  
So it seems to me that properly speaking, the role actually belongs to the -&gt; in the kind of the type constructor in question. Namely we have three different variations:
  
haskell type Nominal :: Type -{NOM}-&gt; Type data Nominal x where Nominal :: Nominal Int 
 haskell type Representational :: Type -{REP}-&gt; Type data Representation x &#x3D; Representational x 
 haskell type Phantom :: Type -{FAN}-&gt; Type data Phantom x &#x3D; Phantom 
  
Similar systems of inference, notation, &quot;subtyping&quot; etc. could be devised to the ones for linear function arrows (which occur at the type level), so that working with these things is not very painful. It might also make sense to think of &quot;role polymorphism&quot;, although I personally haven&#x27;t given this much thought.
 What do you folks think? Am I missing something obvious?
 EDIT: The Reddit editor ate half my post and I had to rewrite it, apologies to anyone who saw the truncated version.

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to create a PoC literately programmed python project and cannot for the life of me figure out how to have LSP-based completion inside noweb blocks. There is a sort of pseudocode block with a few references to chunks that come later, and I would like to have completion while writing these chunks somehow. Editing the :noweb yes chunk of code using C-c &#x27; does not seem to expand the noweb references at all, which is not ideal. The blocks themselves also don&#x27;t have completion when I tangle the :noweb yes block to a file and use lsp-org.
 Both of those solutions feel like they should work, so it is possible I&#x27;ve run into a bug because I&#x27;m running gccemacs. Is this the case? Is it normal for noweb and lsp-based completion for python to just work inside of your org file?
 I&#x27;m very much hoping I&#x27;m just doing something wrong, as the potential of this style when writing code for high-turnover teams with mixed capabilities seems very high to me. I&#x27;m afraid it won&#x27;t be possible to instigate such a culture change without code completion.

 In this screenshot, the color I&#x27;m talking about is the gray background of the first item in the list of choices:

                              <span>Hej Hej,
 This [https://gitlab.com/OlMon/consult-flyspell] is a small package to collect all misspelled words in a buffer and display it with consult.
 This package was born because I wanted to have a nice display of all my mistakes. I know kinda sadistic...
 I tried the great package flycheck-aspell/flymake-aspell [https://github.com/leotaku/flycheck-aspell]. It has almost everything I need, but for my 11 year old notebook it was a little bit to much. Additionally I was not sure if I would only use aspell and not switch to hunspell at some day.
 In the consult issue &quot;command wishlist&quot; it is stated:
 &quot;consult-flyspell, provided by see https://github.com/d12frosted/flyspell-correct, [...]&quot;
 That is correct, flyspell-correct displays the correction in the minibuffer, consult-flyspell displays the misspelled words in the minibuffer.
 I actually use both packages and set the variable consult-flyspell-correct-function to flyspell-correct-at-point to jump to a word and correct it.
 Maybe it helps someone, or maybe I did something that already existed, then please let me know.
 Cheers,
 OlMon

When writing my own functions, I&#x27;ve been doing two message calls, but sometimes those messages will appear one after the other even if nothing has appeared between them.
 Is there a function, macro, or some other pattern to keep in mind to copy the behavior with several built-in Emacs functions? Or is it some built-in magic that I&#x27;m not going to really be privvy to?

 How to prevent this behavior?

 for example i have a history entry that contains: defun and it is buried somewhere in minibuffer history, so when i type for example def and navigate the history, all history entries that begin with def should be the one to be navigated

 Thank you kindly for the help!

                              <span>If ssh-ed into a host, is it possible to access another host using ssh again? I was required to ssh from an intermediate machine.
 When I try C-x C-f /ssh:student@, Emacs just ether hangs or creates a new file with that name. While normal ssh CLI was doing just fine.

                              <span>At some point in I think 2021, read-extended-command-predicate was added, which lets you filter what M-x shows you. One of the intended use cases is to prevent commands for one major mode from showing up when working in another major mode. It&#x27;s nil by default, but you can (setq read-extended-command-predicate &#x27;command-completion-default-include-p)... except for the fact that basically no package I can find actually uses this, either by using
 (defun foo () (declare (modes . (lisp-mode))) (interactive) (message &quot;I only show up in some-mode&quot;)) 
 or by (put &#x27;foo &#x27;command-modes &#x27;(lisp-mode)). I&#x27;d like to go through all the commands whose names start with (say) python- and mark them as being python-mode commands. What&#x27;s the easiest way to do that?
 PS, is there any downside to package authors doing this? The declare variation warns on older versions of emacs, but the put variation should work no matter what. I&#x27;m really surprised this has almost no adoption/conversation that I could find. Out of all the packages I have cloned locally, only transient uses it, and only vertico and other packages by the same author use the related completion-predicate property.

                              <span>Hello. In a normal org source block for LaTex, I can view the source with org-edit-src-code. So the org headers are #+begin_src latex and #+end_src
 This will open a new window where my autocomplete package, in this case yassnippet, can autocomplete base on key words. For example, while inside the editting source code mode, I can type &quot;eq&quot; and TAB and automatically a LaTex snippet for equation is inserted. 
 For my case, sometimes I need to use an export block, so #+begin_export latex and #+end_export. How can I autocomplete in this case? Obviously, org-edit-src-code does not work because it is not an &quot;src&quot; block but an &quot;export&quot; block. 
 Any input is appreciated.

                              <span>Hi,
 I would like to use the dabbrev for every file where connected to our git project.
 I wrote it to use every buffer (just for testing):
 (defun my/dabbrev-select-buffer (other-buffer)
  &#x60;(eq 1 1))&#x60; &#x60;(setq dabbrev-friend-buffer-function #&#x27;my/dabbrev-select-buffer)&#x60; 
 But it isn&#x27;t working.
 How can I set it up well ?

                              <span>Some time ago I created a very simple sbt plugin to generate arbitrary configuration files. It&#x27;s pretty much a copy of sbt-github-actions. The only difference is that it is not limited to GitHub Actions configurations, but can generate all kinds of text files. The key feature is that the plugin is able to verify that the generated configs are up-to-date in CI (just like sbt-github-actions).
 Since I&#x27;ve noticed how incredibly useful this plugin has become for me, I thought I&#x27;d share it here to show it to a wider audience (:
 I tend to use it for deployment configs, generating dev environment Dockerfiles and unopinionated GitHub Actions configs.

                              <span>I use the logging functionality of todo state changes with todo keywords like
 +todo: [☛]TODO(t) [&gt;]Started(s!) [☀]Current(c) | [✔]DONE(d!) +todo: [⚑]WAITING(w!) | +todo: | [✘]CANCELED(x!) 
 However, I would like the time stamps being generated to be less verbose. Currently they are something like: - State &quot;[⚑]WAITING&quot; from &quot;[☛]TODO&quot; [2022-02-24 Thu 10:10]. However I don&#x27;t really care about the time part of it. I&#x27;d just like something with the year, month, and day like: - State &quot;[⚑]WAITING&quot; from &quot;[☛]TODO&quot; [2022-02-24 Thu]. Is this something that is configurable?

 I plan to organise an online meeting aiming to hunt performance issues with latest Org mode. If you are ready to share screen and do interactive debugging, feel free to join. I will post a jisti link in Org mode ML [1] 1 hour before the meeting.

                              <span>I have an org-mode file that I would like to publish some documentation with. I include code samples. When I execute those code samples I get the output rendered into the .org file. Ex
 #+BEGIN_SRC shell :results output cat LIKENESS.txt #+END_SRC #+RESULTS: : , , : (\____/) : (_oo_) : (O) : __||__ \) : []/______\[] / : / \______/ \/ : / /__\ : (\ /____\ #+BEGIN_QUOTE You can execute this previous code-block and, other code-blocks by pressing ~Ctrl-C Ctrl-C~ in a properly configured emacs&#x27; org-mode. If you are using emacs, execute the code-block(s) when it makes sense to you. You can use this document to set up a running AI robot dog on your /Computer/. #+END_QUOTE 
 I use spacemacs and perform an export with SPC e e H h (running Export to Hugo-compatible Markdown, file to Md file). This creates a file hugo/content/posts/README.md like I expect.
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;shell cat LIKENESS.txt &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; &gt; You can execute this previous code-block and, other code-blocks by pressing &#x60;Ctrl-C Ctrl-C&#x60; in a properly configured emacs&#x27; org-mode. &gt; &gt; If you are using emacs, execute the code-block(s) when it makes sense to you. &gt; &gt; You can use this document to set up a running AI robot dog on your _Computer_. 
 Infuriatingly, the actual RESULTS don&#x27;t make it into the final output. How can I get the #+RESULTS: rendered into a

                              <span>Out of the box, calling org-store-link when point is on a headline displayed on an agenda view behaves as you would expect: it does much what it would have done had you called org-store-link from an org-mode buffer visiting the relevant file with point on the same headline. But if you set org-agenda-sticky to t , calling org-store-link from an agenda buffer gives the following error:
 user-error: No method for storing a link from this buffer 
 After digging around a bit I think I found the culprit: for the agenda relevant behavior of org-store-link to be activated, you need to be in a buffer with the name specified in org-agenda-buffer-name. On my end, org-agenda-buffer-name is set to *Org Agenda*, but when org-agenda-sticky is set to t, agenda buffers have a different name of the form *Org Agenda(VIEW)*, where VIEW is the key to the relevant agenda view (so, e.g. *Org Agenda(a)*).
 Now, if I set org-agenda-buffer-name to e.g. *Org Agenda(a)*, I get org-store-link to work as expected when visiting an agenda buffer with that name. But I do not seem to be able to use org-agenda-buffer-name to get Emacs to recognize an agenda buffer when org-agenda-sticky is set to t.
 Any ideas?

 I know there is the whitespace-cleanup-mode which does a okay job with the option to only do cleanup when the file was already clean, but i would like to go further and only do whitespace cleanup on the lines i have modified.
 anyone would know how to replicate this feature?

 One my of emacs windows is showing that file, however, if I update the image again the image on the buffer will only update if I select the buffer. How to make it update itself?

                              <span>I am preparing deleting some buffers in buffer list.But when i move to some buffer, after a short time it automatically jumps to the beginning. I dont think i have set this behavior. Where should i start debugging? Thanks!
 it behaves like this, no key was pressed, the cursor automatically moved to the top

                              <span>I created the package clean-kill-ring.el which solves a problem that I have long been annoyed with which is controlling what is allowed in the kill-ring.
 This package provides a clean-kill-ring-mode minor mode, that when active prevents any killed text that satisfies a predicate in clean-kill-ring-filters from entering the kill ring. By default the only active filter is string-blank-p to keep whitespace out of the kill ring.
 You can automatically remove duplicate items if you set clean-kill-ring-prevent-duplicates to a non-nil value.
 Hopefully some people find this useful.

                              <span>The built-in bibtex-mode provides a function bibtex-next-field which does what you&#x27;d expect: if we use &quot;|&quot; to represent point, calling bibtex-next-field from the following configuration: 
  @article{key, author &#x3D; {D|oe, Jane}, title &#x3D; {A paper}, ... 
 will take you to this configuration:
  @article{key, author &#x3D; {D|oe, Jane}, title &#x3D; {A paper|}, ... 
 I&#x27;m trying to define a bibtex-previous-field function that does the reverse, so I decided to look into the definition of bibtex-next-field, which is this:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; (defun bibtex-next-field (begin &amp;optional comma) &quot;Move point to end of text of next BibTeX field or entry head. With prefix BEGIN non-nil, move point to its beginning. Optional arg COMMA is as inbibtex-enclosing-field&#x27;. It is t for interactive calls.&quot; (interactive (list current-prefix-arg t)) (let ((bounds (bibtex-find-text-internal t nil comma)) end-of-entry) (if (not bounds) (setq end-of-entry t) (goto-char (nth 3 bounds)) (if (assoc-string (car bounds) &#x27;(&quot;@String&quot; &quot;@Preamble&quot;) t) (setq end-of-entry t) ;; BibTeX key or field (if (looking-at &quot;,[ \t\n]&quot;) (goto-char (match-end 0))) ;; end of entry (if (looking-at &quot;[)}][ \t\n]&quot;) (setq end-of-entry t)))) (if (and end-of-entry (re-search-forward bibtex-any-entry-maybe-empty-head nil t)) (goto-char (match-beginning 0))) (bibtex-find-text begin nil bibtex-help-message)))
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Unfortunately, I&#x27;m having trouble parsing this. What is the expression end-of-entry doing? I thought let expressions would take the following form: 
  (let ((VAR-1 VALUE-1) (VAR-2 VALUE-2) ... (VAR-n VALUE-n)) BODY) 
 but the first argument of let in the definition of bibtex-next-field seems to have a different form: 
  ... (let ((bounds (bibtex-find-text-internal t nil comma)) end-of-entry) BODY ... 
 Any help making sense of this would be much appreciated.

Trying to explore the potential of the new features for DSL constructions.

Reading from Cache
 Adding to Cache (With Expiration TIme)
 Updating Cache
  
Has someone done this before? Can someone point me to good resource on implementing the same? I tried to do it with a node server and it worked like a charm but while trying to do the same with Scala Play, I am still not getting good enough resources. Can someone help me and give me tips how to approach this to be time and speed efficient?

                              <span>I&#x27;m experimenting with a new form of inlining. Not sure if it has been done yet. The basic idea is to try to interpret the scala code and specialize at comp time, instead of traditionally inlining and constant folding. The following code failed to compile in my machine, reporting as  Main.scala:6:19 Maximal number of successive inlines (32) exceeded, Maybe this is caused by a recursive inline method? You can use -Xmax-inlines to change the limit. val result &#x3D; fib(i) 
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;scala inline def fib(a: Int): Int &#x3D; if a &lt;&#x3D; 1 then a else fib(a - 1) + fib(a - 2)
 def timed_fib(i: Int): Unit &#x3D; val begin &#x3D; System.currentTimeMillis() val result &#x3D; fib(i) val tm &#x3D; System.currentTimeMillis() - begin println(s&quot;fib(${i})&#x3D;$result $tm ms&quot;)
 @main def main(): Unit &#x3D; timed_fib(2) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 If we take the interpreter and specializing approach, inline is not needed &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;scala def fib(a: Int): Int &#x3D; if a &lt;&#x3D; 1 then a else fib(a - 1) + fib(a - 2)
 def timed_fib(i: Int): Unit &#x3D; val begin &#x3D; System.currentTimeMillis() val result &#x3D; fib(i) val tm &#x3D; System.currentTimeMillis() - begin println(s&quot;fib(${i})&#x3D;$result $tm ms&quot;)
 @main def main(): Unit &#x3D; timed_fib(2)  will be optimized to scala def timed_fib_2: Uint &#x3D; val begin &#x3D; System.currentTimeMillis() val result &#x3D; 1 val tm &#x3D; System.currentTimeMillis() - begin println(s&quot;fib(${i})&#x3D;$result $tm ms&quot;)

                              <span>I hope you won&#x27;t mind this somewhat off-topic post. It is about the Haskell community, but not technical.
 I have been participating in the Haskell community since 2009. In that time I have learned a great deal from Haskellers around the world including Eastern Europe. I have the greatest wish for the safety of all Haskellers, from all parts of the world. You are all my friends, even though we have only met virtually.

                              <span>Greetings to you all from a future PhD student specializing in Artificial Intelligence. I&#x27;ve been using The Archive for about a year and a half and it has been a remarkable tool for me to organize my torrent of thoughts for a variety of projects. I especially love how I&#x27;m able to record my thoughts and surf through my notes without needing to take my fingers off the keyboard.
As I have gotten deeper into my research, I&#x27;ve found myself using LaTeX much more frequently, especially for mathematical purposes, and I&#x27;d imagine it will be necessary for other tasks as well. Does The Archive support LaTeX? If not, are there some workarounds for this to be possible? What other note-taking software is out there that has bi-directional linking and LaTeX support as well?
Have a good day everyone</span>

                              <span>Greetings to you all from a future PhD student specializing in Artificial Intelligence. I&#x27;ve been using The Archive for about a year and a half and it has been a remarkable tool for me to organize my torrent of thoughts for a variety of projects. I especially love how I&#x27;m able to record my thoughts and surf through my notes without needing to take my fingers off the keyboard.
As I have gotten deeper into my research, I&#x27;ve found myself using LaTeX much more frequently, especially for mathematical purposes, and I&#x27;d imagine it will be necessary for other tasks as well. Does The Archive support LaTeX? If not, are there some workarounds for this to be possible? What other note-taking software is out there that has bi-directional linking and LaTeX support as well?
Have a good day everyone</span>

                              <span>Servant 0.19 was
released
earlier this month. It features a new combinator, called NamedRoutes, which
allows you to structure your APIs with records. Concretely, instead of building
up a tree of anonymous routes with (:):
type API &#x3D;
       PublicRoutes
  : &quot;admin&quot; :&gt; Auth &#x27;[BasicAuth] User :&gt; AdminRoutes

type PublicRoutes &#x3D;
       &quot;version&quot; :&gt; Get &#x27;[JSON] Version
  : …

type AdminRoutes &#x3D;
       &quot;do_stuff&quot; :&gt; ReqBody &#x27;[JSON] Request :&gt; Post &#x27;[JSON] Response
  : …

We can now write:
type API &#x3D; NamedRoutes NamedAPI

data NamedAPI mode &#x3D; NamedAPI
  { publicRoutes :: mode :- NamedRoutes PublicRoutes
  , adminRoutes  :: mode :-  &quot;admin&quot; :&gt; Auth &#x27;[BasicAuth] User :&gt; NamedRoutes AdminRoutes

I can tell that they represent the same thing since they are isomorphic to each other, which is due to same cardinality. But other than this, i dont really see an advantage using TicTacToe2. 
 Is it a joke he proposed to make the book more enjoyable? I just dont get it.

                              <span>From TAPL by Pierce:
  
Kinds are built from a single atomic kind, written * and pronounced type, and a single constructor ?. They include, for example:
 * the kind of proper types (like Bool and Bool&#x3D;&gt;Bool)
 *&#x3D;&gt;* the kind of type operators (i.e., functions from proper types to proper types)
 *&#x3D;&gt;*&#x3D;&gt;* the kind of functions from proper types to type operators (i.e., two-argument operators)
 (*&#x3D;&gt;*)&#x3D;&gt;* the kind of functions from type operators to proper types
 Kinds, then, are the types of types. In essence, the system of kinds is a copy of the simply typed lambda-calculus, one level up.
  
If thinking of types as objects in a category, e.g. Hask in Haskell,
  
what is kind * in Haskell or in terms of category Hask? Is it exactly the set of all the types, i.e. the object set of Hask?
 
What is kind *&#x3D;&gt;* in Haskell or in terms of category Hask? Is it exactly the class Functor in Haskell?
 
What is kind *&#x3D;&gt;*&#x3D;&gt;* in Haskell or in terms of category Hask?
 
What is kind (*&#x3D;&gt;*)&#x3D;&gt;* in Haskell or in terms of category Hask? 
 
Are all the arrow kinds (*&#x3D;&gt;*, *&#x3D;&gt;*&#x3D;&gt;*, (*&#x3D;&gt;*)&#x3D;&gt;*, ...) exactly the classes defined by class in Haskell?
 
 Thanks.

                              <span>From Haskell&#x27;s specification,
  
Do expressions satisfy these identities, which may be used as a translation into the kernel, after eliminating empty stmts:
 do {e} &#x3D; e do {e;stmts} &#x3D; e &gt;&gt; do {stmts} do {p &gt;&#x3D; ok do {let decls; stmts} &#x3D; let decls in do {stmts} 
  
I often see that people wrote
 do {p &gt;&#x3D; (\p -&gt; do {stmts}) 
  
I was wondering when the shorten version works and when it doesn&#x27;t? (Does it work if and only if e is return(e&#x27;) for some e&#x27; that matches p?)
 
Can the one given in the specification be rewritten as a &gt;&gt;&#x3D; expression, for example, still by lambda expression? (The specification gives a let expression containing a &gt;&gt;&#x3D; expresssion, not exactly a &gt;&gt;&#x3D; expression itself)
 
 Thanks.

In the second one, is e required to have a type m a, and is stmts required to have a type m b, where the type constructor m has been derived as an instance of class Monad?
 
In the third one, is e required to have a type m a, and p a type a and stmts a type b (so that ok a type a -&gt; m b), where the type constructor m has been derived as an instance of class Monad?
 
 Conversely, can an expression e &gt;&gt;&#x3D; f, where e is an expression with type m a, andf is a function with type a -&gt; m b, be equivalently converted to an do expression?
 What does the kernel of Haskel consist of exactly? (For example, does it include class Monad, but not do expression?)

 (i) E has all finite limits; 
 (ii) E has a subobject classifier; 
 (iii) E is cartesian closed. 
 I heard Hask is cartesian closed. Is Hask also topos? Thanks.

                              <span>Hi everyone.
First off, in my brief stint being a member of this community, I must say how glad I am to have finally joined (after casually reading and lurking here from time to time, over the course of the past year).
I really love the editor and feel of writing on this forum. I like it better than Reddit. Shoutout to @ctietze
I just posted a new piece on my website. It&#x27;s titled, Who a Zettelkasten Is For (Especially an Analog One).
Here&#x27;s the link: https://scottscheper.com/letter/3/
I hope you enjoy it. Let me know any thoughts or comments you have on it.
I realize it&#x27;s my own opinion and some of you may have a different take. I&#x27;d love to hear your feedback or alternative take(s).
Best regards,
Scott</span>

 I plan to report on the success or failure of the initiative here.
 Has anybody got great mentoring experiences for Emacs? I would be interested to hear so that I could help best if anybody pings me to help them as a buddy!

                              <span>I am having a couple issues. I used to use mu4e for my gmail, and then switched away from mu4e to just using org-capture in the browser to capture the mails I need. This works well b/c the link to each email message is unique and persistent. However,
  
I recently started a job where we use an exchange server and access it online via outlook webmail. The org-capture browser function doesn&#x27;t work well for this because the link to the message is (1) not easily captured and (2) is not persistent, e.g., it changes when I move the message to a different folder
 So I started using mu4e again, but it appears that refiling does not seem to sync. When I refile messages in mu4e it somehow disappears and I can&#x27;t find it in outlook, even though the message is in the correct folder in my maildir. Why would this be? 
 I made a test folder in outlook to see if that would sync and it did sync, and the folder appeared in my maildir
 I then made that folder the location of my refile function, and same thing happened, the message disappeared and is no longer visible in outlook. 
 
  
Any thoughts on why refiling messages makes them disappear? Is it just some exchange server setting that I can&#x27;t get around, or is it an easy fix on my end? 
 Thank you!

                              <span>Hello all,
 I&#x27;m using vhdl-mode a lot and just decided that it would be a great idea to include compiler vhdl-mode option into my workflow with Emacs. I have to say that I set custom file location for &quot;Easy configuration&quot; on Emacs. 
 (setq custom-file &quot;~/.emacs.d/emacs-custom.el&quot;)
 (load custom-file)
 To select compiler in vhdl-mode there are two ways, and it is little bit confusing to me. I want to use Xilinx XST compiler. Let me explain.
 First, you can select compiler from drop-down menu. There are Compiler1 and Compiler2 options. If you tinker with these options, some text is saved to my emacs-custom.el file, but I can&#x27;t see that something is configured there. To me it seems like it copied just to whole compilers list into that emacs-custom.el. Maybe it saves some options in other place too and I&#x27;m not aware of it?
 Second, which works, but its value is not saved anywhere! It looks like this. I have tried to put (vhdl-set-compiler &quot;Xilinx XST&quot;)
 and it returned that error that function is void. If I do it manually by fallowing vhdl-mode drop-down menu, and then selecting &quot;Xilinx XST&quot; compiler, it works. But just in this emacs session. After the restart of emacs, I have to do it again manually :/ 
 my emacs-custom.el : https://pastebin.com/iaTQbK17
 my init.el : https://pastebin.com/4GNLJMQB
 Any help is appreciated :)

 However, I would like to swap ctrl and alt (meta) just in Emacs not in the whole OS.
 I usually trust my google-fu. However the last few days it did fail me. Help, please help.

 I&#x27;m trying to make lsp-pyright load pyrightconfig.json so I can have types from stubs using mypy for qtile. I&#x27;ve tried creating a pyrightconfig.json, a pyproject.toml, setting lsp-custom-settings and nothing worked. Since it is for qtile I can&#x27;t use virtualenvs too.
 Any idea what can I do?

How can I do this?

I performed the U command just to see what it would mark, and it did not mark &quot;org&quot; with an I. But my current org version is 9.4.4, and the latest one is 9.5.2. Why didn&#x27;t U mark my org for installation?

 I want to try out Emacs and I want to set it up as a python IDE and play around with some other features (DOOM, evil-mode etc., Tramp mode) so I look up how to configure something and I am presented with this:
  
Let&#x27;s start by configuring lsp-mode which is a client for LSP servers:
 (use-package lsp-mode :hook (prog-mode . lsp))
 (use-package lsp-ui)
  
Okay, great it&#x27;s a piece of code. but am I supposed to copy/paste that code somewhere? run it? bask in it&#x27;s glory? do I have to restart emacs?
 Also where in the Emacs for beginners tutorials does it explain what to do with such a configuration snippet? If you have a lot of configuration how do you organize it?
 If I need to find out what configuration options are available for a package (like tramp on windows, how do I tell it to use TortoiseGitPlink.exe instead of Plink.exe) how do I discover it?

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;d like to write an embark function for the consult-ripgrep.
 This function can add the current file name to the search prompt.
 What I mean:
 The consult ripgrep prompt is: #whatilookfor
 and after the embark action the prompt is: #whatilookfor -- -g filename*.differentextension
 I can image that if we add this &quot;-- -g filename*.differentextension&quot; to the consult-history and I can reach it with M-p maybe it can be a different good solution 
 I would like to use it to search the string in the files with same name but different extensions.
 It would be useful under the angular development for me ...
 If you can send me an example where an embark function modify the consult prompt could be enough for me 
 sorry for the question but I have no a lot of time to write code for emacs ... :(

                              <span>When exporting TODO items that have no timestamp to iCalendar format, org-mode for some reason pretends that the timestamp is today. This leaves a big blob of ‘events’ in my calendar for today’s date which is a bit annoying. Is there a way to stop it putting DTSTAMP and DTSTART entries into the .ics files when the item has no date?

 Any help much appreciated!

                              <span>Hi all,
 Sorry for the basic question. I was reading that both native compilation and pure gtk were both merged. I&#x27;m on fedora 35. What is the best way to install emacs with these features? Do I have to build it from source? And if so are there specific flags or options that need to be enabled for it to be compiled with those options enabled? or are they enabled by default now?
 Thanks!
 EDIT: I managed to build it from source using the following and it (mostly) works:
 Into a directory: git clone https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/emacs.git
 Then ran: ./autogen.sh in that directory
 Then ran: ./configure --with-pgtk --with-native-compilation --with-mailutils
 It kept failing until I installed all the following additional packages with sudo dnf install:
  
autoconf (to run the ./autogen.sh command)
 texinfo (for the makeinfo requirement)
 gtk3-devel (for the pgtk requirement)
 libgccjit-devel (for the native-comp requirement)
 gnutls-devel (because it needed gnutls-devel)
 ncurses-devel (it needed something in this package but I forget what)
  
Then ran make (took a while) then sudo make install in the directory and it installed! Emacs 29 I believe to /usr/local/bin

                              <span>Hi,
 Is there anybody who can use intellisense in the angular html files ?
 if I set the lsp-log-io then I see this:
 [Trace - 08:24:30 ] Sending request &#x27;textDocument/definition - (108)&#x27;.
 Params: {
 &quot;textDocument&quot;: {
 &quot;uri&quot;: &quot;file:///home/ ... .component.html&quot;
 },
 &quot;position&quot;: {
 &quot;line&quot;: 21,
 &quot;character&quot;: 21
 }
 }
 [Trace - 08:24:30 ] Received response &#x27;textDocument/definition - (108)&#x27; in 24ms.
 Result: null
 the html file is here:
 &lt;li *ngFor&#x3D;&quot;let courseType of category!.courseTypes&quot;
 ​
 for this configuration the vscode give normal intellisense here ...
 ​
 regards,

 Use case: There are some files I want to edit as another user in a remote server (is old laptop used as server and is in my living room), I wish to execute dired instead of visiting a file so I can see all of the contents of the folder holding the files, but I would like to do this as another user and wish to switch to this user using sudo as these files are owned by him. I log in as my user on the remote server using SSH keys.
 How do I do that with TRAMP?

                              <span>I&#x27;m new to Doom Emacs and I&#x27;ve been trying to get Latex equation preview working in emacs for a while now. When every I try to toggle latex preview with C-c C-x C-l it keeps giving me the error in the title. 
 I went to check and tested in the Terminal:
 orgtexgvRQwY.dvi wasn&#x27;t produced. but there was an orgtexgvRQwY.tex file
 Running Latex orgtexgvRQwY.tex creates a .dvi file of the same name
 Running dvipng ortexgvRQwY.dvi creates a .png file but with an extra [1] at the end. 
 I&#x27;ve looked around forums but the other solutions doesn&#x27;t seem to have worked. 
 Another problem is for some reason on every startup, i always get this warning

It opens up &#x27;projectile-files-errors&#x27; which is unexpected.
 It does not list the files in project.

                              <span>Org mode, of course. Here&#x27;s an example:
 * Level 1 Some text, two blank lines after some more text, two (or more) blank lines below! * Level 2 Some other text blah blah blah * Level 3 Some other text 
 When that&#x27;s folded up, it looks like this:
 * Level 1 * Level 2 * Level 3 
 I&#x27;d like all instances of two or more trailing blank lines to be condensed into one trailing blank line so I get a clean tree like this:
 * Level 1 * Level 2 * Level 3

                              <span>Hey folks, how are u doing?
 So, I&#x27;ve been exploring ways of implementing &quot;type-dependent&quot;(i think this is the name) validations! But I just stepped into a doubt that is related to &quot;scala-specific&quot; knowledge.
 Lets imagine that I have the following error trait:
 scala sealed trait DomainError trait ValidationError extends DomainError 
 and I want to specify a generic interface for a given Id type that wraps a primitive! This is what I thought on writing:
 scala trait Id[ValueType] type Value val value: ValueType 
 First question: - Is this the right way of writing a trait which defines something like a ProductId that is, basically, Id[UUID]?
 Second Question: - How can I define the interface for the apply method which I should return something like Either[ValidationError[ProductId], ProductId]]?

                              <span>In my work often it happens that I get a call to provide immediate support. Only after the call register it under my Support Headline with a full description of the issue and update my org clock time accordingly. 
 As such, I would like to create an org capture template (or function) that does the following: 
 - request how much time has pass since I receive the call 
 - with this time, clock out of my current task with the time of when I receive the call
 - create a new heading under my *Support* heading and include a clock drawer already with the time I spent on the task. Fill new headline as I want (title, description, etc.) 
 - (optional) clock in again to the task I was working
 I almost got everything done, however it seems that calling &#x3D;org-clock-out&#x3D; from within the capture template makes it so that the new heading is not in the right place. 
 If someone has any ideas on how to achieve this let me know. Below you can see my capture template and function:
  (&quot;cc&quot; &quot;Support&quot; entry (file+headline &quot;~/org/todos.org&quot; &quot;Support&quot;) &quot;%(call-interactively #&#x27;custom/quick-support)&quot; :empty-lines 1) (defun custom/quick-support (minutes-started) (interactive &quot;NMinutes:&quot;) (let ((support-start-time (encode-time (decoded-time-add (decode-time) (make-decoded-time :minute (- minutes-started)))))) ;; If clocked in a task, stopped it when support started (org-clock-out nil t support-start-time) (concat &quot;* %?\n :CLOCKING:\n CLOCK: &quot; (format-time-string &quot;[%Y-%m-%d %a %H:%M]&quot; support-start-time) &quot;--&quot; ;; Insert dummy &#x3D;&gt; and let Org calculate it afterwards (format-time-string &quot;[%Y-%m-%d %a %H:%M]&quot;) &quot; &#x3D;&gt; \n:END:\n&quot;)))

                              <span>As the title says, I have two unrelated questions. I have been assigned to do a task to cover for someone. This largely entails copying details out of a template and pasting it into an excel doc. Due to the variety of the email responses, I copy a block from Outlook to an org file and format, then paste into Excel. For example, a person&#x27;s name is two cells, I found it was quicker for me to put the first and last names on separate lines then copy, esp after I customized copy*.
 1- can I somehow copy the text, so if I copy multiple lines, it fills the cells correctly? Ex first name is column A, last in b.
 2- I have set up an org file, to dump this data, via capture, mostly so I can easily keep a log of when I enter due to an unrelated headache. I have a custom DONE keyword and associated it with a key, but more than often I accidentally have shift held, so org-todo quits. Is there a way to apply my keyword regardless if i press a or A for example? In org-capture, if I assigned a, but do A, we&#x27;re told to try again. I am aware that allowing this could cause issues if I assign lower and upper to keywords.
 my function
  (defun me/kill-ring-save () &quot;Adds to line to kill-ring if not marked, and puts a message in the minibuffer. If something is marked, that region is added.&quot; (interactive) (if (equal mark-active nil) (progn (kill-ring-save (point) (line-end-position)) (message &quot;Copied the line!&quot;) ) (progn (kill-ring-save (point) (mark)) (message &quot;Copied selected region!&quot;) ) ) )

What I want is an html (or pdf) that contains Header 1 and subtree only, with the file named &quot;Name I want&quot;. What I&#x27;m getting is a filename of &quot;Title&quot;.
 What I do is narrow-to-subtree so only Header 1 is showing, then C-c C-e h o.
 Files are easy enough to rename in dired or whatever, but I don&#x27;t understand why emacs isn&#x27;t producing what I want.

 I am currently using Doom emacs however I have tested this on Vanilla and Centaur emacs and the results were the same. When I open my org agenda file, Every org file (with the org agenda folder thing) is thrown open which makes my workspace very cluttered with org files. IS there a way to automagically close them after saving.

                              <span>EDIT: I&#x27;m running org 9.4.4 that was installed with emacs. This seems to be a bug that was fixed in the latest version of org, currently 9.5.2. It very likely fixed it, but I&#x27;ll update this post after I install and test for myself.
 The contents of the headline below is commented out. But it&#x27;s still showing up in my agenda. Is there a way to comment out example so it doesn&#x27;t get parsed by agenda?

                              <span>I am trying to get this to work to immediately activate a defun that I just added to my init.el (instead of closing and reopening emacs). I thought eval-defun should work. Alternatively, C-x C-e worked fine. So first question is why doesn&#x27;t this work, and a second question, I guess, is when should I use each version?
 I don&#x27;t know if it matters, but my init.el indicates it&#x27;s an &quot;(Emacs-Lisp Eldoc)&quot;. Here&#x27;s the function:
 ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; ;; help with parens (show-paren-mode t) ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; ;; emacs needs an unfill ;;; Stefan Monnier . It is the opposite of fill-paragraph (defun unfill-paragraph (&amp;optional region) &quot;Takes a multi-line paragraph and makes it into a single line of text.&quot; (interactive (progn (barf-if-buffer-read-only) &#x27;(t))) (let ((fill-column (point-max)) ;; This would override &#x60;fill-column&#x27; if it&#x27;s an integer. (emacs-lisp-docstring-fill-column t)) (fill-paragraph nil region))) ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; ;; Some font choices (setq myfont &quot;InputSerif&quot;) 
 With the point in or immediately after the defun, executing C-M-x aka M-x eval-defun prints &quot;InputSerif&quot; in the minibuffer.
 EDIT: Added extra context to my snippet, command above and below.

                              <span>Hello, I&#x27;m trying to understand how to get Emacs working to indent C++ code the way I want it to. Namely, I want to get rid of hanging braces in my code.
 I know you can select a region and auto indent it by pressing C-M-\, however that doesn&#x27;t seem to remove hanging braces even though my style is set to not have hanging braces.
 For example, if I highlight the following function and run auto indent
 test_function(void) { std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;This is a test&quot; &lt;&lt; std::endl; } 
 I would like it to become 
 test_function(void){ std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;This is a test&quot; &lt;&lt; std::endl; } 
 but it doesn&#x27;t. Anyone know how to make emacs do this?
 Thanks,

                              <span>I was looking at using Flycheck today with lsp-mode, and I got a warning from lsp-mode. A quick google lead me to a github issue for lsp-mode that said it&#x27;s a common problem and that Flycheck was going to release a new version that fixed it. There was linked issue from that one to a github issue on Flycheck&#x27;s repo about releasing said version from 2020, with no actual traction on finishing the release.
 There haven&#x27;t been any commits to master since August 2021, regardless of the fact that there are 45 open pull requests, and users requesting that a new release be cut for 2 years. Their CI jobs don&#x27;t run anymore because they&#x27;re linked to travis-ci.org which has been in read-only mode since July 2021 and no longer accepts new build jobs.
 Is Flycheck dead? Are people just using snapshots from the repo to make it work? Is there a forked version someone is actually mantaining?

I have experience with common lisp so I&#x27;m not too worried about the actual coding part of this (though the whole dynamic scope of it all sounds interesting) mainly what I&#x27;m missing is a guide to things like dependency management, package organization, basic things like that. If anyone here could help me out with these issues I would really appreciate it.

                              <span>Hi all, thought I&#x27;d share a way to control the volume of EMMS using MPV as a backend. I couldn&#x27;t find any solutions on the net, and this took quite a bit of trial and error so hopefully this will save you some pain. 
  (defvar emms-player-mpv-volume 100) (defun emms-player-mpv-get-volume () &quot;Sets &#x60;emms-player-mpv-volume&#x27; to the current volume value and sends a message of the current volume status.&quot; (emms-player-mpv-cmd &#x27;(get_property volume) #&#x27;(lambda (vol err) (unless err (let ((vol (truncate vol))) (setq emms-player-mpv-volume vol) (message &quot;Music volume: %s%%&quot; vol)))))) (defun emms-player-mpv-raise-volume (&amp;optional amount) (interactive) (let* ((amount (or amount 10)) (new-volume (+ emms-player-mpv-volume amount))) (if (&gt; new-volume 100) (emms-player-mpv-cmd &#x27;(set_property volume 100)) (emms-player-mpv-cmd &#x60;(add volume ,amount)))) (emms-player-mpv-get-volume)) (defun emms-player-mpv-lower-volume (&amp;optional amount) (interactive) (emms-player-mpv-cmd &#x60;(add volume ,(- (or amount &#x27;10)))) (emms-player-mpv-get-volume)) 
 For reference my emms-player-mpv-parameters is set to &#x27;(&quot;--quiet&quot; &quot;--really-quiet&quot; &quot;--no-audio-display&quot; &quot;--force-window&#x3D;no&quot; &quot;--vo&#x3D;null&quot; &quot;--no-resume-playback&quot;)

                              <span>I have posted my configuration for Vertico, Marginalia, Orderless. These packages are already well-documented and commonly discussed, but I&#x27;d thought I&#x27;d share my configuration anyway. 
 I think the most useful part for those already in the know-how will be my configuration of Vertico&#x27;s &quot;extensions,&quot; which I haven&#x27;t seen much coverage on.

                              <span>Well, I am certainly not a man of wealth (at least not financially); and taste? Well, possibly yes: I have a high taste for curiosity 
I have discovered zettelkasten(ing) a few weeks ago and it arrived at a perfect timing! I am reorganizing my whole “knowledge management” and my workflow.  As a dad of two small kids, the primary caretaker of a house and a phd candidate during pandemic times (I don’t know what went through my head to pursue that route), I highly need some effectivity.
I have started my own zettelkasten and I am trying at the same time to understand how the zettelkasten system works and most importantly how to make it most effective for me. And let’s be honest, I am really torn between analog and digital and see benefits in both. I like the tactile and sensory aspect of the analog, and I like the effectiveness of the digital, plus I learn a lot on software and programmes (thanks to you Forum, markdown has come to my knowledge and I am learning how to use it).
Cheers!</span>

                              <span>I was wondering how to understand in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applicative_functor
  
Applicative functors are the programming equivalent of lax monoidal functors with tensorial strength in category theory.
  
In Haskell&#x27;s, class Applicative is defined as
 class Functor f &#x3D;&gt; Applicative f where pure::a-&gt;fa ()::f(a-&gt;b)-&gt;fa-&gt;fb 
 A monoidal functor is defined in Mac Lane&#x27;s book Category Theory for Working Mathematicians, on p164 in VII.1. Monoidal Categories 
  
A (strict) morphism of monoidal categories 
 T: (B, *, e, alpha, lambda, rho)-&gt;(B&#x27;, *&#x27;, e&#x27;, alpha, lambda, rho), 
 is a functor T: B-B&#x27; such that, for all a, b, c, f, and g 
 T(a*b)&#x3D;Ta *&#x27; Tb, T(f*g) &#x3D; Tf *&#x27; Tg, Te&#x3D;e&#x27;, (10) T alpha_{a,b,c} &#x3D; alpha&#x27;_{Ta, Tb, Tc}, T lambda_a &#x3D; lambda&#x27;_{Ta}, T rho &#x3D; rho&#x27;_{Ta}. (11) 
  
How can an instance of class Applicative be viewed as a lax monoidal functor? 
 What is the underlying monoidal category (B, *, e, alpha, lambda, rho) for an instance of Applicative in Haskell?
 What is &quot;lax&quot; here?
 Thanks.

                              <span>Due to syntactic flexibility with do notation, I really can&#x27;t see a single language paradigm that Haskell can&#x27;t emulate. While Prelude gets a lot of shit, it&#x27;s so minimal and unopinionated that it really encourages creating language features as libraries. With QuasiQuoters you can take this to a logical extreme, convincing the compiler to compile whatever you want essentially. It seems to take very little convincing to get the language to do anything you want in the way you want as long as it&#x27;s logically well formed.
 Personally as someone who loves programming language design it&#x27;s really incredible, if there&#x27;s a feature in another language that I want to try, I don&#x27;t have to switch languages, I can find a package or just stub out an implementation in a weekend. I&#x27;ve heard this used as a point against Haskell however, because it lets you work with very bizzare computational models and can make a code base feel kind of disjointed. Personally, I don&#x27;t buy that, while Haskell does have modules that let you differ from the norm, the norm tends to be the easiest option. You CAN have Alan Kay style objects, you CAN have prolog style logic programming, but why would you when the language is still so effective without them. Of course, eDSLs are a thing too, tho they&#x27;re less hot pluggable language features and more an incredibly nice design pattern that arises naturally from the language design unless they&#x27;re designed to operate more generically.
 Anyway, Haskell is cool and I wanted to talk about it, but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m preaching to the choir here.

                              <span>I am making a Haskell application that uses a lot of libraries, mostly for things like parsing (megaparsec, aeson, etc) and eventually some RPC or other inter-process library. I have noticed that many of these libraries will return some kind of &quot;Result&quot; type for actions that can fail, often an Either String a or Maybe a or their own custom Result a type. I find it somewhat vexing how these different error types cannot mix because they carry different information, and I would like to be able to propagate them to a higher level in my program where the errors can be handled properly.
 To this end I have added a monadic Result type for my own application that is roughly data Result a &#x3D; Valid a | Invalid Error where Error is my own error sum type that can represent any external error that the program might have to handle. Result has the obvious Functor, Applicative, and Monad instances, and I use it to wrap most actions that can fail including reading and writing files, parsing, validating user input, and so on.
 Is this a good approach? It seems a little unwieldy to set up so many wrapper functions, but it pays off when I can handle the errors so much more smoothly at the top level. Is there some better method I am missing?

 I am having trouble with my org-mode. Whenever I have a heading, like &quot;* This is a heading&quot; and press RET, I used to be brought to a newline, and moved inwards 3 characters. However, when I press RET currently, under a heading such as in this example, point is not moved, and remains at 0 instead of being moved to 3. Interestingly, when I am in auto-fill-mode, when the text begins to wrap around, it will indent appropriately. I have also found that C-o also does not indent, and is effectively the same as C-j
 I am not sure what has changed, but I am in wayland currently, and I don&#x27;t think that should have and impact on expected performance, but I would never know.
 I tried org-indent-mode to see if that is what I was missing, but that seems to be doing something else entirely.
 ​
 EDIT: fixed, i had to set org-adapt-indentation
 https://orgmode.org/manual/Hard-indentation.html#DOCF150
 ​
 EDIT2: This change does not seem to be working out, actually. I thought it would, but I still get put at 0 instead of 3 spaces when I use RET under a headline.

                              <span>Hey everyone,
 I&#x27;m curious to see how you plan your long term goals with org-mode. I&#x27;m interested in workflows and your thoughts.
 In general, I&#x27;m pretty successful managing my day to day with org-mode:
  
I have a project list 
 each project is divided into subtasks
  
I push the projects along by executing tasks and reviewing my projects relatively regularly. It&#x27;s a functional system. In general things don&#x27;t fall through the cracks.
 However, I feel like most of my planning is short term. This is where &quot;tactical vs strategic&quot; in the title comes from. I&#x27;m having trouble elaborating on what I really mean, here.
 Do you have long term goals, if so how do you work with them in org mode?

                              <span>As an imperative programmer working with Kotlin most of the time i now want to expand my horizon with Haskell. 
 From my one semester of Haskell in university I know the basic concepts, but I now want to write a full backend in Haskell.
 I have been using Kotlins Flows for quite a while, and I am looking for something similar in Haskell. Specifically I want to be able to notify other threads about changes, so they can react to them, but not in an active waiting way. In Kotlin I would use a StateFlow or a SharedFlow for this. I&#x27;ve seen the pipes library which looks very similar, but I couldn&#x27;t figure out to use it in a way, where I have to update a value in one place and all threads are notified about it.
 Probably I am still thinking too much in an imperative way, but maybe you can help me go into the right direction. Thank you for your help.

But it seems to me that even if I replaced f with g :: (a,b) then g is still ambiguous (again, if I have multiple instances). So why is there that restriction?
 I am aware of FunctionalDependencies, but it seems to me that it shouldn&#x27;t be required that b is uniquely determined by a. Am I missing something?

                              <span>When you have a high level language it seams easier to desugar it to a small core language when type checking. However I don&#x27;t understand how type errors can then be reversed back to the original syntax. What are known strategies for doing this? It seems like you would have to litter your core AST with annotations of some kind, is this what most people do?
 I remember reading somewhere that haskell implements the typechecker closer to the original syntax because then it is easier to relate errors to the original source. However there is still some desugaring that occurs, and I&#x27;m wondering if there is a sweet spot in balancing desugaring vs tracking original source?

                              <span>Since GHC 8.10 you can use -Wunused-packages to find deps in your package.yaml which you&#x27;ve stopped using!
 Removing them might reduce build times and also reduce potential future problems with version bounds.

 So I have a haskell code here and Whenever i compile it, it gives me a warning for no implementation for fromInteger. However, I tried to Implement fromInteger but i don&#x27;t know how to apply it to the two integers as arguments as fromInteger is of type Num a&#x3D;&gt; Integer -&gt; a

In addition to outlining with ease, it was so much fun to be able to also think of TODO items and write them down, knowing that they&#x27;ll eventually get caught in my agenda!

 Anyway, that’s beside the point. I wanted to write the degree Celsius symbol and so I did C-X 8 Ret 2103, and lo and behold, there it was. 
 But after that whenever I wrote, emacs just wrote very slowly. This got fixed when I removed the Celsius symbol. The encoding is and always has been utf-8. 
 This is not pogchamp.

 I set (global-linum-mode 1) in my init.el file, but it creates problems when viewing pdfs. Scrolling through them becomes sluggish. Removing the line numbering altogether fixes the problem. But I do want line numbering for when writing code/latex.
 I tried setting (add-hook &#x27;pdf-view-mode-hook (lambda() (linum-mode -1))), which I found here. But it doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything.
 Can someone help me and if possible explain to me(noob) why it doesn&#x27;t work.

                              <span>I installed csharp-mode from Melpa. 
 I don&#x27;t have csharp-mode hooks enabled in my dot emacs, so I load a &quot;.cs&quot; file, and then type &quot;M-x csharp-mode&quot;. I get this error:
 Symbol’s chain of function indirections contains a loop: R-mode 
 Syntax highlighting does NOT occur (except for strings and comments, for some reason). However, the mode line does say that csharp-mode IS activated for the file. 
 I don&#x27;t understand why R-mode is involved with this process at all. I do have ESS installed.
 Here is the information for the package:
 csharp-mode is an installed package. Status: Installed in ‘csharp-mode-20210105.1950/’ (unsigned).

                              <span>TopSpace is useful when using Emacs in full-screen on large monitors, now available in MELPA. It lets you scroll above the top line like having a scroll-able top margin/padding.

Suggested web browsers? Browser Extensions? Emacs packages? Especially, of course, systems or workflows that somehow integrate with emacs/org-mode, either directly or indirectly.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been spending hours trying to figure this out, but was unable to find anything online with any working examples of what I&#x27;m looking for.
 ​
 What I want to do is have one of my Akka-HTTP routes return a response like this:
 [ { name: &quot;test&quot;, age: 24 }, { name: &quot;test 2&quot;, age: 21 } ] 
 The issue is that the spray-json and akka tutorials only show you how to return a response like this:
 { users: [ { name: &quot;test&quot;, age: 24 }, { name: &quot;test 2&quot;, age: 21 } ] } 
 While messing around, I tried creating a simple route an an immutable sequence of users like so
 case class User(name: String, age: Int) // ... val usersTest &#x3D; Seq(User(&quot;test, 24), User(&quot;test 2&quot;, 21)) val routes: Route &#x3D; { ... route code get { // Should return an array of the users complete(usersTest) } } 
 But the above code throws the following error:
 type mismatch; found : Seq[User] required: akka.http.scaladsl.marshalling.ToResponseMarshallable 
 I&#x27;m having a hard time following why that error is being thrown when I have my jsonFormats defined already:
 implicit val userJsonFormat &#x3D; jsonFormat2(User) 
 ​
 How can I make the route respond with a simple JSON array of the users? I don&#x27;t want to respond with an object containing a users array, I want the endpoint to respond with an array of the users.
 ​
 Any help is much appreciated!
 Edit: I feel dumb. Thanks for the help!

                              <span>We have just released new versions of both Indigo (game engine) and Tyrian (Elm-like web framework). They&#x27;ve been release together because they now work together!
 As well as lots of other improvements, you are now able to build a web app in Tyrian that natively launches and communicates with Indigo web games as first class citizens, from within the same Scala codebase.
 The motivating use case was for people who wanted to use Indigo to render their games, but who also wanted a slick, responsive HTML5 based UI to drive it.
 Please note that both minor releases follow an unannounced major release a week ago, so do check out the release notes for both. 
 Indigo 0.12.1 - https://indigoengine.io/
 https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/indigo/releases/tag/v0.12.0
 https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/indigo/releases/tag/v0.12.1
 Tyrian 0.3.1 - http://tyrian.indigoengine.io/
 https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/tyrian/releases/tag/v0.3.0
 https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/tyrian/releases/tag/v0.3.1
 ​
 A massive thank you to all the wonderful people who have sponsored us, contributed code, reviewed PR&#x27;s, written/proof read docs, raised issues, discussed solutions, or bravely shared their work in progress games and apps! You make it all worth while. 😊

                              <span>Hi!
 I attempt to gather all ideas/approaches that were in usage to manage app dependencies. As far as I see there are two survivors nowadays: - mix of constructors/implicits in Tagless Final world - &quot;Reader on steroids&quot; represented by ZIO (Reader channel, Has[T], and ZLayer) and cats-mtl (Ask[F, T] feature) (thanks to u/LuciaDenniard for bringing the second option)
 I want to write a note with a review of which things were in usage but were washed out.
 The roster I have:
  
Dependency rejection. Just an idea to push any IO to the edges and not mix with logic.
 Dependency injection frameworks (Guice-like)
 Cake pattern.
 Dependency parameterization (dependencies as function parameters).
 Reader monad (as is)
 
 Resources I found useful: - &quot;Readers vs Constructors: Dependency Injection showdown&quot; and &quot;Reader &amp; Constructor-based Dependency Injection - friend or foe?&quot; by u/adamw1pl - &quot;Dependency Injection in Functional Programming&quot; Gist by Gabriel Volpe - Cake antipattern by Mateusz Kubuszok - &quot;Six approaches to dependency injection&quot; from &quot;F# for Fun and Profit&quot; - &quot;Dependency rejection&quot; and &quot;Partial application is dependency injection&quot; by Mark Seemann
 I&#x27;ll be grateful for any additional resources and/or points I&#x27;ve missed.
 Thank you!

                              <span>Hello,
 I am new to Org, so I may have missed something obvious but, reading the Quick start guide or the documentation, I am not sure to understand how export is supposed to work in regards to headings. Quoting the Quick start Guide:
  
Lines that start with an asterisk * are headings. 
 A single * denotes a 1st-level heading, ** denotes a 2nd-level heading, etc.
  
So far, everything is clear. We have headings, with levels. Fine. Where I stop following is when I export, say to a html buffer (C-c C-e h H) every heading level has been decreased: one star headings are tagged as h2 and two stars as h3. Here, on a very basic test file: 
 https://preview.redd.it/p9pbaypvm8j81.png?width&#x3D;1165&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;23832603cda8cec5ff07bd711f661d8fe71f2902
 Since I am rather new to Org and to Emacs, I imagined I had some issue with my Org configuration or that I screwed up something elsewhere in Emacs, as I so often do. So I tried on a clean install (no ~/.emacs.d, no init.el) and got the same result, on a Debian 11 machine btw. 
 What&#x27;s bugging me is that I can&#x27;t find mention of this in the doc. 
 Could you tell me if it is the expected behavior? And if so, is there a way to tell Org to preserve the original heading levels?
 Thank you :)

                              <span>Apologies if this had been asked before (if it has I was not able to find it): since the latest changes in the repos I realized that my emacs (27.1) runs Org 9.4.4 as its installed version but also counts Org 9.5.2. I have three questions:
  
Is this the expected behaviour?
 Can I trim this down to one Org version, preferably the 9.5.2 and the generally speaking the most recent one?
 If this is the expected behaviour what is the purpose of each Org version? I find it strange that I cannot use the most recent stable version but still need it for dependencies.

The inclusion of the zettelkasten into the lexicon of contemporary productivity scenes, many of which view note-taking systems through the lens of task and project management, has led to confusion as to what a zettelkasten is and for what it can be used. This confusion becomes particularly apparent when comparing zettelkasten to other note-taking methodologies, where the zettelkasten is seen as an advanced (and sometimes outdated) way to store and retrieve notes. I&#x27;d like to argue that the zettelkasten should not be considered within the lineage of agnostic note-storing systems and apps, but rather as something else entirely: a note-making and note-linking me…</span>

Last Week
Completed the initial processing of notes from the biography of John Cage Where The Heart Beats 202107261132.
Spent too much time fretting about the Science Profile assignment interview that never happened.
Looked again at Zettlr then settled back into The Archive.
This Week
I&#x27;ll add deep links and atomize Where The Heart Beats 202107261132. I&#x27;ll start a second refactoring.
Attack Style: Toward Clarity And Grace 202111181949
Work in Keyboard Maestro, which just released version 10!
I plan to develop my workflow with The Archive as a poor man&#x27;s Scrivener.</span>

 I imagine different semigroups have different implementations of append. However, while the compiler can know it&#x27;ll have to deal with some manner of semigroup, it cannot know ahead of time what each member may be. How is the correct function ultimately determined? Is there some runtime check with the equivalent of typeof/instanceof which decides the correct function?
 I guess a related question is what happens in practice if data don&#x27;t match their type? For example, if I ask a database for data, expecting a sequence of integers, but a cosmic ray conspires to ruin my day, and I end up getting garbage. Obviously this is a runtime error, but how can I reason about it or deal with it?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve used them infrequently enough and used different ones every time. And then when I ask people about it, I get 10x different answers. 
 I just want a simple (synchronous) HTTP client and JSON parser (where I can make case classes to extract what I need). Now when I look I try one out and the example doesn&#x27;t compile in 2.11, or I try another one out and the client is overkill, etc. 
 I have interviews next week, and I just want the simplest go-to HTTP Client/json parser that I don&#x27;t have to think too hard about. There are so many options that this becomes a really frustrating exercise. 
 Kind of a rant, but also a cry for help.

                              <span>Hello all,
I recently discovered the Zettelkasten system and thought it seemed a disciplinary and constructive tool for someone who makes connections between ideas all day long but doesn&#x27;t write them down (like me). I&#x27;ve gotten as far as downloading Obsidian, reading the first chapter of a book called &quot;The Bitcoin Standard,&quot; writing fleeting notes, and then polishing the relevant ones into literature notes. What repeatedly evades my understanding, however, is the nature of links.
I do not know when or how to use links. For example, if I have a note that defines the economic term &quot;coincidence of wants,&quot; and I have another note discussing how &quot;indirect exchange enables coincidence of wants in a diverse economy,&quot; should I: reference &quot;coincidence&quot; inside &quot;indirect exchange&quot;; reference &quot;indirect exchange&quot; in &quot;coincidence&quot;; do both of those; not link them at all but tag both notes with &quot;coincidence of wants&quot; and find them when I do the color-coded tag search?
And then there&#x27;s the matter of linking two (seemingly) unrelated ideas. Do they get linked to each other, and then to a third note of the new idea they inspire? Both notes separately linked to the third?
Help is appreciated.</span>

                              <span>As a novice Zettler introduced to the method via the Cortex podcast, I’ve been taking the last year or so to build up the foundations of a useful archive. I’ve come to an inflection point in the management of my archive, as I’ve done a lot of collecting and not a lot of assimilating, linking, etc. Of course, at this new stage, it’s only natural that I’ve stumbled upon the Great Folgezettel Debate. After going on a deep dive in the forums for the past week, I’ve come to the point where I’d like to start weighing the tradeoffs between the two most prevalent organizational techniques I see discussed here: Folgezettel and Structure Zettel (Structure Notes? Can someone disambiguate the proper terminology for me?).
While I think I have a feel for where I’ll land at the end of this, I want to flo…</span>

I’ve looked around online but haven’t found anything that definitely addresses how to setup something up for a personal programming language.
 Does anyone here know what I should do, or where I should go look?

                              <span>I am really sorry to ask this question, as there are already a lot of answers given, but I feel that none of them are definite and give the whole answer (in a clear and easy to follow way)
 I am looking for setting up auto-complete capabilities and code checking in emacs. I mostly want this for Python and C++, although having the capability to easily add other languages in the future would be much appreciated.
 What packages do you recommend for setting up emacs as an ide?

                              <span>I would like to bind C-h/j/k/l to move emacs windows (evil normal mode). 
 Binding globally, every one of these works except C-k. It will NOT move to the upper window in either Eshell or term, normal mode or no. I tried to use bind* from use-package, I tried general, I tried so many things I&#x27;ve lost count, but I can&#x27;t use C-k for the real shell or the Eshell. Why is this, and is there a sane way around it? For now I&#x27;ve settled down on using arrows:
  (general-define-key :states &#x27;normal &quot;&quot; &#x27;windmove-left &quot;&quot; &#x27;windmove-right &quot;&quot; &#x27;windmove-down &quot;&quot; &#x27;windmove-up) 
 But I am not happy about it. Doubly so because I just don&#x27;t understand why no override works.

But I don&#x27;t want to have to ⌘-TAB (or ALT-TAB in Windows) over to emacs and then C-c c to org-capture. That takes too much time and breaks my flow. I just want to press some magic MacOS (or Windows) key that will automagically switch me to emacs AND do the org-capture command.
 Bonus points if doing the above can also automatically carry over the URL that I&#x27;m currently on.
 I assume I&#x27;d need to use some kind of &quot;macro&quot; software.

                              <span>Cross post from https://fillian.me/code/bongo-retag/
 ​
 bongo is a package for listening to music within Emacs.
 I keep all my music on my computer with filenames readable by bongo like this:
 Artist - Album - Track Num - Song Name.mp3
 ​
 I like having all the metadata stored in the filename instead of in internal ID3 tags for a few reasons:
  
filenames are easy to change
 everything is visible at a glance
 it stops me from spending too much time re-tagging and organizing my library
  
​
 The problem is that when I sync my music library to my phone using Syncthing, the music app I use doesn&#x27;t read the metadata from the filename - it uses the standard ID3 tags.
 ​
 My solution was to write a small script which reads metadata from the filename and overwrites the internal ID3 tags to match.
 Whenever I add new music to my library, I&#x27;ll run this script and then I&#x27;ll be able to browse easily on my phone. The source of truth for metadata will always be the filename.
 ​
 The script is written in Python and requires a library called eyeD3
 You can find the it here
 Pass the script a directory and it will re-tag all the .mp3 files inside and in any sub-directories.
 ​
 It&#x27;s nice to have album cover images when listening on my phone, so the script will overwrite a cover image if there is a file that matches Artist - Album.jpg in the same directory as the mp3.

 1. a backend (lsp-mode in his case)
 2. a frontend (typescript-mode in his case)
 3. a language server (ts-ls in his case)
 So I was wondering if this scheme holds true even for c/c++, if so, what packages for these three &quot;categories&quot; do I need?

 recently I&#x27;ve been playing with org-element and org-export.
 Specifically, I was interested in the mechanism of the org exporter system and its flexibility.
 The goal of this post is to get you started with the creation of org backends.
 To do so, we build an org backend that:
  
keeps only bold elements,
 surrounds bold elements with *** before and after,
 surrounds paragraph elements with :: before and after,
 surrounds section elements with  after (removing the last newline).
  
We call it onlybold.
 Before, we start, if you are interested, I recommend you to read in org-mode&#x27;s source code the following files:
  
lisp/ox.el,
 lisp/ox-html.el,
 lisp/ox-md.el,
 lisp/ox-org.el,
 testing/lisp/test-ox.el (AMAZING).
  
You can get org-mode&#x27;s source code by runn…</span>

 I want to have 2 (vertical) buffers open with the same file, with the right buffer containing what comes just after the bottom of left buffer.
 Then when I scroll in either buffer, the other will move too, so that I&#x27;m always seeing one long(er) continuous portion of the file on my laptop&#x27;s unrotatable wide-ass screen.
 Does that even make sense? Thanks for reading!

 Is there a way to do a generic path? I&#x27;m using nix to install my emacs packages, so, I need a generic way to do this that will work whenever the path changes, nix uses new hashes for unique identities for packages.
 Thanks in advance for the help.

 Basically, I wanted ibuffer &amp; projectile to generate a list of projects on startup that I could combine with my own list of filters so that stuff inside a project gets grouped together, and all the stuff not in a project is grouped in ways that&#x27;s useful to me instead of all just ending up under Default.
 Oh, and before I share the code I should say that I am by no means a lisp or elisp expert; this is just the result of an afternoon&#x27;s worth of hacking on lisp to try and get it to do what I want.

                              <span>https://github.com/xl666/avy-conf/blob/main/avy.org
 Some months ago I read the excellent article &quot;Avy can do anything (https://karthinks.com/software/avy-can-do-anything/), which changed the way I use Avy and Emacs in general. The article basically explains what are Avy actions and how to create new ones. This got me inspired to create my own Avy actions, which I&#x27;d like to share with the community in the form of a literate config.
 The shared config, extends some notions and creates new ones (some left as a kind-of challenge in the mentioned article):
 ​
 - Region actions: actions that act in an arbitrary not visible region created with avy selections (copy, yank, kill, teleport). First you mark the initial point of the region with an action, then you execute a region action on the other end of the region.
 - Quick char commands: skip the initial filtering step of an Avy command pre-filtering a character. For example I use this in emacs-lisp mode to auto filter open parenthesis with a key binding, this is very useful as actions act on Sexp.
 - Auto actions: enable the automatic execution of an avy action on a selected candidate
 - Compound actions and commands: link several avy interactions in a single command or action using auto actions. This is useful for example for region actions, instead of executing two Avy commands to first mark the start of the region with a command and then select and act on the end of the region; you only execute a command that integrates two Avy interactions, the first one auto applies the mark action, then you select the action and element at the end of the region. I also use this for creating a replace action, combining kill and yank actions in one action.
 ​
 I hope this results useful for someone.

                              <span>Hi there,
 After jumping into org-roam rabbit holes few month ago, i&#x27;m now starting using org-mode to manage my system ansible playbook. Actually i&#x27;m surprised, i search on different places on the net and i don&#x27;t found lot of devops style tangled org-mode ansible playbook.
 If you have some repository / dotfile online with playbook examples made with org (devops style), i&#x27;m interested.

                              <span>I have a code block with flag :async:

 +begin_src bash :async t
 for i in $(seq 10); do echo $i &amp;&amp; sleep 0.1 done
 +end_src
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 I have a pretty basic need to view the stdout of this process (i.e. view numbers from 1 to 10 printed out to an external buffer, much like async-shell-command), not only the final result.
 Is this feasible to do this? If this were feasible it would be convenient to view the process of my long-running command. And I can totally live free from the terminal.

                              <span>I&#x27;m writing a program that transcodes financial statements into a ledger. In that program I have types representing different activities:
 haskell data Withdrawal &#x3D; Withdrawal { wTarget :: !Text, wAmount :: !Cash, wBalance :: !Cash } data Fee &#x3D; { fFee :: !Cash, fBalance :: !Cash } -- many more 
 I use those types, because I have functions that are transaction-type specific.
 I also wanted to write an activity parser that translates CSV records into those types, so I created an Activity sum type:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;haskell data Activity &#x3D; ActivityFee Fee | ActivityWithdrawal Withdrawal | -- ...
 parseActivity :: CsvRecord -&gt; Activity &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 That Activity is quite boilerplate&#x27;y. Having to have a new Activity* constructor for a new activity type is slightly cumbersome.
 Is there a more idiomatic or better design pattern for this problem? Was it C++, std::variant would be convenient, because adding a new activity type wouldn&#x27;t entail adding a new boilerplate constructor.
 I&#x27;ve considered type-classes, but the problem with them is that they are not closed and I can&#x27;t pattern match to create a function like applyActivity :: Activity -&gt; Wallet -&gt; Wallet. I see that I could make applyActivity into a function of an Activity class, but then problem is that this solution is only straightforward if only one argument is using this pattern. If we had two arguments like foo :: (ClassOne a, ClassTwo b) &#x3D;&gt; a -&gt; b -&gt; c, then it&#x27;s not clear to which class foo should belong.

 I&#x27;m trying to teach someone what a function is conceptually beyond just (a -&gt; b), so that they can recognize it when they see it in any context, regardless of language. I have been trying to come up with a type, or a diagram, to explain it.
 The essential pieces I see for a function are a parameter assignment, a computation, and a return. The type at the top is meant to capture these and the diagram for this would be a square.
 I also think that this can be used to define an arrow, except the first argument would be an identity on the input, the second the arrow, and the third argument would be an identity on the output.
 This is how I sketch functions and arrows when I imagine them but I don&#x27;t know if anyone else&#x27;s imagination agrees.

 Since my last post in this Reddit, it has got some new features, of which probably the most interesting is to remove read-only status, but still keep org markup hidden. It is meant for simple edits like fix a spelling mistake or add/remove a word or two. For bigger edits, drop back into org-mode. There are some other minor additions, hiding some agenda keywords and ellipses. The last one is not really recommended, but it can be useful only in some very special cases.
 For the usage info, check the README file in the Github repository.

                              <span>Dear community,
 I&#x27;m looking for a comparison of the various note-taking-packages implementing the Zettelkasten-method. I don&#x27;t want to build a second brain or create a personal wiki, instead I want to capture and link ideas for researching and writing.
 Using org, I&#x27;m naturally drawn to org-roam, however, I dislike the bulk of dependencies and its complexity stemming. Furthermore, I dislike, that I can&#x27;t get a textual overview of a subset of notes belonging together (using a webserver-solution like org-roam-ui is not what I want here). Looking at the new zk-package, I want to note that I like its simple and clean approach, but I dislike, certain design decisions, like using spaces in file names and the fact, that it doesn&#x27;t integrate deeply in the org-ecosystem, e.g. not utilizizing org-IDs. The last point is the biggest downside imho. While one could hack on the codebase to change this, another drawback seems to be that it is not really mature and doesn&#x27;t seem to have a large userbase. 
 Currently, I&#x27;m try out both of these very different options, but I can&#x27;t really decide for on or the other, since both have different strengths and downsides. Therefore, I want ask for your opinions and experience with implementing the Zettelkasten-method (or a personalized derivation of it). Which horse should I put?
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I have come to the conclusion that despite its excellent keystroke and plug-in customizations, vim still requires a lot of work to get simple development tools working inside of it. 
 Anyway, are there any good starting resources to help me learn more about emacs and also smoothen my transition?
 What have I tried so far? - emacs tutorial - have looked at evil, but haven’t tried it. Is it good?
 Any other help is welcome. Also, you can delete this if it is a repost. 
 Thanks!

                              <span>My setup usually has two side by side buffers open. When I invoke embark-act it takes over the other buffer to show its suggestions. It would make more sense to open as an (extended) minibuffer instead. I looked at the documentation but haven&#x27;t found a setting.

 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 After a recent update(?), this function no longer works. I have tried taking SVG out of the list of inline image formats in ox-html, but it just inlines the file with a tags. The transclusion of the full source is not happening.
 Any ideas?

                              <span>I use ivy-postframe and it works great 99% of the time. There is an issue, however, when I have two windows side-by-side in i3-gaps and open a search (for example for a file). When I start typing, emacs for some reason starts putting what I type at the beginning of the line _ (1/79) Find file: ~/ instead of the end of the line. This is super annoying. The issue goes away if I put emacs on full screen mode.
 Does anyone know of a solution or why this is happening?

                              <span>EDIT: THIS HAS BEEN ANSWERED, THANKS!
 I&#x27;m a newbie. From: https://orgmode.org/manual/Literal-Examples.html
 It says the following:
 You must insert a comma right before lines starting with either ‘*’, ‘,*’, ‘#+’ or ‘,#+’ 
 Is this a mistake in the text? Why would I need to put a comma before a line starting with ,*? I&#x27;d end up with ,,*.
 Then they give the following example:
 #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE ,* I am no real headline #+END_EXAMPLE 
 But wouldn&#x27;t it be sufficient without the begin end?
 ;; This will work too ,* I am no real headline 
 For that matter, wouldn&#x27;t it be sufficient to have just about any character there, including a space? 
 ;; This will work too * I am no real headline 
 EDIT: It just occurred to me that I&#x27;m thinking mainly in terms of how emacs is parsing and presenting the information within the editor as I type, but there might be other issues with the system processing the text, such as for agendas, exporting, etc.

                              <span>Hi there,
 This is a screen shot from part of my FastMail IMAP email inbox in Mu4e.
 Lots of inbox email headers, each crossed out, but still listed in the inbox.
 All of these emails have been archived or moved via the MacOS Mail program, or iOS Mail app but they show up like this here, which means that they have been trashed from Mu4e&#x27;s perspective.
 I&#x27;m trying to work out how to make my Mu4e display consistent with what iPhone or Mac Mail shows me. I.E. If I archive an email in iOS Mail, the reference to it is no longer displayed in Mu4e so that I don&#x27;t have to do everything twice.
 I have followed this setup pretty much exactly but applied to FastMail.
 Can somebody point in the right direction please?

I just made a video on the process of creating knowledge using an analog Zettelkasten.

                              <span>Hey guys.
 I&#x27;m trying to get started with Reflex/Obelisk as we have a few quite simple UI use-cases that would benefit highly from sharing code between the front-end and back-end.
 However, struggling to get one thing working - HLS.
 Setting up an Obelisk project was actually remarkably easy.
 ob shell, ob run and ob watch work perfectly.
 However, when I open up VS code from within the nix-shell hls is failing with some very weird errors.
  Unexpected usage error can&#x27;t load .so/.DLL for: /nix/store/jc9zqp241vz5ziwh0smls0sl1sf6h7np-ghc-8.6.5/lib/ghc-8.6.5/ghc-prim-0.5.3/libHSghc-prim-0.5.3-ghc8.6.5.so (/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libm.so.6: version &#x60;GLIBC_2.29&#x27; not found (required by /nix/store/jc9zqp241vz5ziwh0smls0sl1sf6h7np-ghc-8.6.5/lib/ghc-8.6.5/ghc-prim-0.5.3/libHSghc-prim-0.5.3-ghc8.6.5.so)) typecheck 
 I assume this is because it&#x27;s reaching for my local installation of haskell-language-server (it&#x27;s pointed to the 8.6.5 version, so that&#x27;s not the issue), but absolutely no idea how to approach this.
 Is there some working repository example or a tutorial for IDE integration that doesn&#x27;t require you to know Nix in order to make any sense of it?

                              <span>I am interested to get Haskell onto PowerPC. From what I understand the last version existing as ready-made binary is 6.10.x. Is it possible to build recent GHC for ppc somehow?
 I have gcc11 working on ppc, latest cmake and most of other tools. (What does not work on ppc is clang.)
 Any suggestions will be greatly appreciated. Ideally I wanna get GHC for ppc into Macports, but if I manage to build it locally, I can open a PR.
 UPD. In fact, there is a binary on GHC 7.0.1 for PowerPC: https://www.haskell.org/ghc/download_ghc_7_0_1.html#macosxppc

                              <span>Hello, I need to create a document that uses the tex-metrix package and I was wondering if Org mode can be used for that. I mean to type LaTeX code in the Org document https://www.ctan.org/pkg/metrix
 Or should I use the TeXstudio Editor instead? Thank you.

                              <span>So, I am back with my persistent request to you fellow Scala users to &quot;Star&quot; some projects on Github.
 Why ? 
 Because the &quot;Github Stars&quot; have somehow evolved into the easiest available indicator of popularity and trustworthyness of a project.
 And yes, I know that &quot;Github Stars&quot; are not really a good indicator of quality and trust. And they were just meant to be like a bookmark.
 But probably even the Github guys did not foresee the open-source explosion which took place in last 5-6 years and Github became the de-facto home for opensource community. With the rise of &quot;the like/subscribe culture&quot; of Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn during these times, our community was also craving for that &quot;like/follow/subscribe&quot; button, and they found the &quot;Star button&quot;.
 Yes, it is a bad indicator but an indicator none the less.
 ​
 So, please take few seconds of your time to hit that &quot;like/follow/subscribe&quot;. It might just help in giving outsiders more confidence in our excellant ecosystem.

                              <span>Hi,
 I think Persistent-odbc is the only version that can work with MSSQL, but persistent-odbc doesn&#x27;t pair with newer versions of Persistent as Persistent updated its datatypes. I thought selda was neat, but its DB language metatypes (I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s the right name) are in a closed data type rather than an open typeclass declaration. MSSQL has many database column types so having type class declarations of the translation DB language metatype would allow for more flexibility for the ORM to handle multiple databases.
 I&#x27;m going to try to rewrite selda&#x27;s types to handle extensible column definitions.

                              <span>Hi, I was reading through Category Theory for Programmers, and I was wondering if the monadic bind &gt;&gt;&#x3D; :: m a -&gt; (a -&gt; m b) -&gt; m b can be defined in terms of the kleisli arrows: &gt;&#x3D;&gt; :: (a -&gt; m b) -&gt; (b -&gt; m c) -&gt; (a -&gt; m c) . After a bit, I came up with:  (&gt;&#x3D;&gt;) :: (a -&gt; m b) -&gt; (b -&gt; m c) -&gt; (a -&gt; m c) (&gt;&gt;&#x3D;) :: m a -&gt; (a -&gt; m b) -&gt; m b ma &gt;&gt;&#x3D; f &#x3D; ((\_ -&gt; ma) &gt;&#x3D;&gt; f) id -- apply to it a junk value 
 Since the result of applying &gt;&#x3D;&gt; returns a function, I need to call the function with a junk value to make it return just m b . Was I correct in my approach? Thank you.

                              <span>I am trying to implement a BST in Haskell, but I can&#x27;t figure out how lists work in Haskell. So the algorithm would add a node and for each node two empty lists that denote it&#x27;s two subtrees. However, I am stuck at initializing a BST in the first place. So when I insert a number into an empty BST:
 insert 5 [] 
 it would return a list like so:
 [5, [], []] 
 This is what I have:
 insert x lis &#x3D; if null lis then [x, [], []] else undefined --for now 
 I thought the function declaration would have to be:
 insert :: Integer -&gt; [Integer] -&gt; [Integer] 
 But that doesn&#x27;t work. If you know how to solve this, I would also appreciate reference material where these things are covered. I am struggling to find relevant documentation.

                              <span>I know stack doesn&#x27;t love M1 macs, but it seems to work fine as long as I run it in a Rosetta terminal with the --arch x86_64 flag.
 Today, though, I&#x27;m trying to install the yesod bin following the Yesod quickstart guide, and not having any luck. (I&#x27;m in a Rosetta terminal and adding --arch x86_64 to stack commands.)
 The error occurs at the step of installing the yesod command line tool (step 3); this fails with:
 : can&#x27;t load framework: Cocoa (not found) 
 Is it even possible to work with the yesod command line tool on an M1? If so, am I just making some boneheaded mistake?
 EDIT: Problem kinda solved! See comment for what I did.

                              <span>I am trying to residence up my resume as per this example: https://github.com/aidanscannell/my-org-resume Everything seems to be working (yay!) except for ignoring headline during export while still including the tree&#x27;s contents. In addition to the part included in the example, I found this: https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/38184/org-mode-ignore-heading-when-exporting-to-latex and added this to my config: (require &#x27;ox-extra) (ox-extras-activate &#x27;(ignore-headlines)) and I added titletoc to my default packages as well. This indicates ‏‏‎ that titletoc has to be included before the hyperref package. This is what my packages setup looks like: (setq org-latex-default-packages-alist &#x27;((&quot;rm&quot; &quot;roboto&quot; t) (&quot;defaultsans&quot; &quot;lato&quot; t) (&quot;&quot; &quot;paracol&quot; t) (&quot;&quot; &quot;titletoc&quot; t))) There&#x27;s no reference to the hyperref package anywhere in the file, but the output file indicates that package hyperref has indeed been loaded. Could the issue be that titletoc is not loading before hyperref, and if so, how can I make it do that? If that is not the issue, any ideas on what troubleshooting I can try next? Thanks all!

                              <span>Hello everybody! I wrote my first emacs extension: csharpto.el
 Basically it introduces Evil text objects for functions (and now generic &quot;scopes&quot;) of the CSharp language. They still don&#x27;t support the count argument and the current region, but they work fine for the trivial cases and are already saving me lots of keystrokes. Hope they are useful to someone else!
 Oh, and as I was learning and doing at the same time, I&#x27;m pretty sure lots of things can be improved. I&#x27;m open for your feedback and suggestions! Thanks.
 A bit of background
 About 2.5y ago I was using C# and Visual Studio at work, and after playing around with Vim for a few months I got to know this Evil mode thing and decided to give Emacs a try (or more specifically, Spacemacs). Since then, I&#x27;ve been learning how to, and using …</span>

 (use-package vertico :straight t :custom (vertico-resize nil) (vertico-cycle t) :init (vertico-mode) :config (add-to-list &#x27;load-path &quot;~/.emacs.d/straight/repos/vertico/extensions&quot;) (require &#x27;vertico-mouse) (vertico-mouse-mode) ) 
 Note that vertico-mouse-mode isn&#x27;t available in vertico.el, but requires vertico-mouse.el.
 I&#x27;m using straight.el (btw), so I don&#x27;t like at all the require statement here. Is there any other way I could load the package?

                              <span>This is a general question but my specific problem is actually a Rust related one. 
 By default rustic mode provides a function rustic-cargo-run which calls cargo run without any arguments. I am testing a CLI I created and would like to provide arguments to my run command. I found a function called rustic-run-cargo-command, which has this as it&#x27;s description: &quot;Start compilation process for &#x27;cargo run&#x27; with optional RUN-ARGS&quot;. 
 But i cannot seem to find a way to provide these optional arguments. Can anyone guide me on this issue? For example If I want to run &#x27;cargo run -n test&#x27;, I would try calling M-x rustic-run-cargo-command -n test but this will not work. 
 The function definition can be found here.
 Thank you for your help.

 I tried Udemy, but there doesn&#x27;t seem to be anything useful on there.
 I am rather limited in terms of free time, having young children and a busy career.
 Can someone on here please recommend a way for me to make progress with learning eLisp from nearly scratch?
 I have a few years of Java experience, so am well familiar with basic concepts.

                              <span>I&#x27;m a pycharm/visual studio user, but recently vim caught my eye. While figuring out of vim was what I wanted I kept seeing these &quot;vim vs emacs&quot; yt videos and articles, which got me to check out emacs, which at the time looked very similar to vim (to my &quot;mouse focused gui&quot;-using eyes). After some digging i found distro tubes video on doom emacs which really sold me, but here&#x27;s the issue: although it&#x27;s relatively easy to find content telling you why to use emacs, there really doesn&#x27;t seem to be any content telling you how to use emacs. 
 I really feel like I&#x27;ve walked into a car showroom, been shown this cool, futuristic car with no visible doors or windows. But as soon as I said &quot;cool, how do I get into it, so I can test drive it?&quot; The salesman just started starting blankly at me as if I&#x27;m the weirdo for not already knowing. 
 This post was mainly to express my woes, but I am very open to being directed to resources on how to get started, especially seeing it up for c# and python.

                              <span>Hey there,
 So Command + V in iTerm2 is the paste action.
 However, I tried looking in the settings but am unaware of how to remap the default paste option since I swap a few keys on my Emacs setup on MacOS.
 Related swaps:
 Caps --&gt; Control
 Option --&gt; Control
 Is it possible to nuke the default Command + V &#x27;paste&#x27; keybinding in iTerm2 for Emacs?
 This interferes with normal Emacs keybindings since Command + V on my setup on normal Emacs on MacOS usually advances the screen by 1 screenful.

Also i installed omnisharp, dotnet and mono, so my flycheck, popup&#x27;s and other works good with C# System.*. But any of UnityEngine doesn&#x27;t works, like it doesn&#x27;t exist. LSP server(omnisharp) asked me to choose root directory after i opened .cs, but even if i choose /Unity root directory, nothing changes. Can you help me?

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m writing some functionality in elisp which only works when I step through the expressions using Edebug and &quot;space&quot; but it fails when running in a regular manner. I know where the script fails in terms of a specific line, I just don&#x27;t know of a mechanism in which the outcome is different due to stepping vs. regular run. Here is the code:
 (defun df/cite () (interactive) (defvar df/cite-title &quot;&quot;) (defvar df/cite-buffer (current-buffer)) (org-ref-insert-cite-link) (org-ref-open-citation-at-point) (setq df/cite-title (bibtex-autokey-get-field &quot;title&quot; bibtex-autokey-titleword-change-strings)) (switch-to-buffer df/cite-buffer) (end-of-visual-line) (backward-char) (insert (format &quot;[%s]&quot; df/cite-title)) (end-of-visual-line)) 
 The code lets you insert an org-ref citation and uses the article&#x27;s title (from the bibtex) entry as the org link description. The script works line by line in edebug but fails as a whole on the line running &quot;open-citation-at-point&quot;. Not sure why.

                              <span>I would like a way to shorten/abbreviate filenames in the Emacs mini-buffer when copying/moving files in Dired. For e.g. if I mark a file in Dired to be moved, its name appears in the minibuffer asking me to choose a destination. The filename is sometimes long and I have to press the up arrow several times. I would like to shorten it so that the name all fits on one line.

 I can edit it just fine, but it&#x27;s bugging me. Oh I also just now tried finding a new non-existent file abc.org, and it does the same thing.

                              <span>Currently, I got python/jupyter working nicely in emacs with Emacs-Ipython-Notebook and Elpy(things like matplotlib render nicely in emacs/ein), but 1 thing that I haven&#x27;t figured out yet, is does emacs/ein currently suppport pywidgets/ipythonwidgets(browser widgets)? I can get ipywidgets to run, but instead of it displaying a browser widget in emacs/ein, it only displays a variable&#x3D;value of the widget hat I&#x27;m trying to render?
 Any tips to fix this browser widget issue in emacs/emacs-ipython-notbook(or jupyter-emacs as well)?
  
I&#x27;m very happy with using emacs-ipython-notebook and and jupyter-emacs in emacs, but, the last thing that I need to get working is browser widgets, then I should be good to go with python/jupyter projects in emacs.

                              <span>Magit has a philosophy of making everything explorable. You don&#x27;t just see a diff; you can jump to the file from the diff. You don&#x27;t just see filenames; you can jump to the file from the name. The view is transformable. Etc, etc.
 I learned today about running grep from within emacs. I tried it out, and the results were spoiled by the inclusion of files from my mypy folder, which aren&#x27;t of interest. I could modify the grep command to excplude that folder, but I&#x27;m lazy. I&#x27;d prefer to be able to click on the output and say &quot;hide this and anything else from the same folder&quot;.
 I&#x27;d also like to be able to interactively toggle the -h option, to hide the filenames on the left side.
 Is this possible? I see that I can jump to the file, and the line in question, which is great. Other than that, though, the output does not seem to be very interactive.

                            <span class="media-object__text">
                              <span>When testing the basic functionality of my actors, my receiveMessage() event on my test probe is timing out, because the probe isn&#x27;t listening for messages on the actor that I&#x27;ve spawned.
 ​
 For some context, I have 2 actors
  
A TaskManager actor
 A Session actor
  
My TaskManager actor has 2 commands:
  
CreateSession(id) - This spawns a new Session actor
 SessionCreated(id, ref) - When a Session actor is spawned, it sends the SessionCreated message back to the TaskManager so that I can store the ref of the session (and perform other stuff)
  
Here&#x27;s where I&#x27;m running into the issue. I can&#x27;t seem to figure out how to write a test to listen for messages coming back to the TaskManager actor that I spawned. When running the test, it times out waiting for the receiveMessage() event.
 Here&#x27;s my test code:
  &quot;Task Manager&quot; must { &quot;be able to create sessions and receive a reply from the session when its created&quot; in { val taskManager &#x3D; spawn(TaskManager()) val sessionProbe &#x3D; createTestProbe[SessionCreated]() taskManager ! CreateSession(&quot;session1&quot;) val reply &#x3D; sessionProbe.receiveMessage() // ^^ times out } } 
 I&#x27;ve been searching the docs and Googling everywhere, but I can&#x27;t seem to find any documentation on how to listen for a message that should come back to an Actor that was spawned in the test.
 ​
 I&#x27;ve tried adding a new parameter to the CreateSession message to supply the probe ref, but then the probe receives the message instead of the taskManager actor, and thus the taskManager won&#x27;t complete the changes that I need to test subsequently. I do know that the taskManager value does have a ref, but it doesn&#x27;t have a receiveMessage method, so I&#x27;m stumped here.
 ​
 Any help is appreciated! Sorry for the noob question :-)

#Zettelkasten-method #cognitive-overload #quick-revision
I am relatively new to Zettelkasten (but have come across it earlier) and have just begun using Zettlr. I was trying to figure out whether for my use case, the method of Zettelkasten (which fascinates me) would be a good idea.
Previous experience suggests it is risky. I got hooked on Org-mode and Spacemacs spending time on setting it up when I had a deadline approaching.

 doom-lighttable-theme
 I created a theme for Doom based on the default Lighttable theme
  
Grab a copy from here
 Copy the theme file to ~/.doom.d/themes/doom-lighttable-theme.el
 Update your ~/.doom.d/config.el with: (setq doom-theme &#x27;doom-lighttable)
 reload.
  
It is still a WIP but I use it every day with no issues. I plan on creating a merge request to the main doom themes repo once I find time. Any feedback would be cool :)

 In short, I&#x27;d like the function to do this: whenever I switch buffers, Emacs runs this function which should take the underlying filename of the buffer, open an org file arranged as a datetree, create a (or go to an already existing) heading based on the filename, and clock in. If that heading is the currently-clocked item, don&#x27;t clock out and in again. Use the top-level directory name of the project as the file tag (for later filtering).
 This seems to work if I&#x27;ve already opened the org file and org-mode has been run. It fails on the first run when opening Emacs (beca…</span>

 Prettify-symbols enabled

 but this didn&#x27;t disable this mode.

 I am using following code to make org- tables collapsible. Works great appart from styling - in hidden state tables occupies 2 lines with 3 dots below:
 #+NAME: mytbl ... 
 How to make dots appear one same line right after table name?

                              <span>Hi,
 I use Debian 11 with KDE. So far, I was on KDE X11 and I ran the emacs daemon as a service (debian configures this for you ootb, so you simply need to enable it).
 However, I moved to a KDE wayland setup today, and I cannot launch the client after boot. I think it is launching before wayland can set things up (I have no idea what that means though...).
 journalctl --user -u emacs.service | tail -n 10 gives me
 Feb 17 15:39:39 xxx emacs[1302]: Loaded /home/x/.emacs.d/config/settings.el Feb 17 15:39:40 xxx emacs[1302]: Turning on magit-auto-revert-mode... Feb 17 15:39:40 xxx emacs[1302]: Turning on magit-auto-revert-mode...done (0.330s, 90 buffers checked) Feb 17 15:39:40 xxx emacs[1302]: Starting Emacs daemon. Feb 17 15:39:41 xxx systemd[1282]: Started Emacs text editor. Feb 17 15:39:41 xxx emacs[1302]: Package cl is deprecated Feb 17 15:39:41 xxx systemd[1282]: emacs.service: Got notification message from PID 3258, but reception only permitted for main PID 1302 Feb 17 15:41:51 xxx emacs[1302]: No protocol specified Feb 17 15:45:53 xxx emacs[1302]: No protocol specified 
 So I am guessing the daemon loads properly and then encounters some problems after the Package cl is deprecated message. If I try to run the client with emacsclient -c I get
 Waiting for Emacs... *ERROR*: Display :1 can’t be opened 
 Which is very strange since systemctl status --user emacs.service shows that the service is indeed active. Any help/suggestions/comments?
 Cheers

When I process all of those numbers, the *Calc Trail* buffer doesn&#x27;t scroll down automatically, so I have to do it to see what my most recent calculations were.
 Demonstration: https://gfycat.com/windingcanineivorybackedwoodswallow 
 For reference, here&#x27;s what I do in the GIF:
  
Input the numbers 1 - 0
 Sum them all
 Scroll the *Calc Trail* buffer, then do M-S-&gt;
 Repeat the same process another time
  
I really enjoy calc-mode, but it&#x27;s frustrating to use for long equations due to this. Anyone have similar issues?

                              <span>I&#x27;m considering getting a new keyboard and don&#x27;t know which one to buy. ATM I&#x27;m using my regular keyboard with kmonad to evaluate home row mods, and I find it suiting and comfortable. 
 Recently I&#x27;ve been looking for a new keyboard and I sort of settled on the Moonlander or Planck. Moonlander is a full fledged ergonomic keyboard and Planck is a smaller (40%) keyboard. I will often have the keyboard with me as I&#x27;m working at home and a couple of different locations at work, therefore the small planck is tempting. Anyone that uses Planck with Emacs? Will it be better to buy a larger ergonomic keyboard? 
 Any input will be greatly appreciated.

                              <span>Ok, due to the latest Arch update of latest gcc &amp; gcc-libs (they package it so), libgccjit was broken. I had to uninstall it so I could upgrade rest of the system, and my Emacs didn&#x27;t start due to missing libgccjit.so. So I quickly recompiled Emacs without native compiler, and surprise. I don&#x27;t even miss native compiler. 
 I used to see a difference in Helm and some other places like a year ago when native comp was in its early stages. I don&#x27;t have benchmarks, but my Emacs seems like even smoother without native comp for some reason. There are no hiccups, no waiting for completions to pop up. What happened? I run current master, re-compiled like 2 days ago.
 I now even wonder if I will enable native comp again. Is it just me, or do other people experience similar?

 I&#x27;ve global-visual-line-mode 1 in my init.el which works everywhere except in eww buffers :/
 I currently manually run toggle-truncate-lines in eww buffers in order to wrap the long lines.
 Anyone knows how to set eww-mode buffers to auto wrap the long lines?

                              <span>Quick question, I recently started using lsp-mode with ccls as a language server and my buffers are cluttered with a counter for each variable showing how many time it&#x27;s referenced in the code base.
 Is there a way to disable it? they&#x27;re a bit annoying as every time I delete a line they don&#x27;t go away instantly and clutter the buffer for a couple of seconds making it almost unusable.
 Screenshot for reference.
 Thanks!

                              <span>Preamble
  
I&#x27;ve tried google, but I don&#x27;t know/understand emacs terms enough to know what to search. 
 I&#x27;m not asking for a config, or &quot;edit some-variable-name&quot; I want to learn and the best way for me is by doing
 I&#x27;m a prose writer and have converted my markdown novel into org.
 The meat
  
Since I don&#x27;t use text editors for code, I&#x27;d like to have emacs &quot;know&quot; to use helvetica when I open an *.org file. I&#x27;d done something similar in vim where markdown files would word wrap at 100 characters and a few other things I&#x27;ve since forgotten. (I haven&#x27;t written in over a year and it&#x27;s been longer than that since I edited init.vim
 I&#x27;ve been playing around with prelude-emacs … distro? I&#x27;d like to use vanilla emacs but add whatever package pops up a mini-buffer? With hints after chording C-c or M-x
 TLDR
  
What variable should I look at to have org mode use helvetica font? What package gives hints after typing C-c , M-x etc

                              <span>First, Install OpenBangla for your distro following the official guide. (OpenBanlga include avro and many more feature.)
 Next, configure the input method for your Window Manager according to the guide above. After you do that, you can now change input method using s+SPACE So now you can have a workflow.
 - Go to emacs
 - Open a file and type some bangla texts.
 - If you need to type commands, do s+SPACE to move back to English.
 Its fairly obvious but I thought it might be helpful for some beginners who searched for similar feature, like me. And also, its not nearly as seamless as M-x set-input-method bengali-itrans which automatically handles all of these for you and gives you an amazing writing experience. Sadly, it does not yet provide avro-style input-method and the existing itrans,probhat are really unorthodox input method that very few uses and hard to master. I hope someday I will have enough knowledge to contribute that.

                              <span>I know plenty of people come to emacs from Vim, so it makes sense to use evil, spacemacs, etc, but I rarely if ever see the other way around. I&#x27;ve been doing vanilla emacs for a bit, and while I&#x27;m used to it, I definitely don&#x27;t love the navigation shortcuts, and I&#x27;ve always been very interested in how Vim works.
 Anyone here was already used to and comfortable with regular emacs bindings and decided to learn Vim keybindings?
 Did you think it was worth it? Did you keep it or went back to vanilla emacs? Do you use it only in certain contexts? Any tips for how to pursue it?

                              <span>I started using orgmode two months ago after I learnt about it from videos from thoughtbot. Never having used emacs before and not knowing lisp it took me while to ramp up on it. I found the way you can have neatly nested lists and have math equations quite nice. I set up org roam as well . Everything on doom emacs. But after 2 months of using it I find myself in a situation where it has turned out to be not all I expected it to be. * The org roam promise of becoming a second brain didn&#x27;t really work for me. Maybe I&#x27;m not using it correctly but having backlink info in the buffer I didn&#x27;t find that useful. It&#x27;s not easy to find things unless you remember the name or keywords in the title.
  
Writing long documents feels clunky in orgmode. Maybe it&#x27;s more adapted to short todos. I don&#x27;t know how to explain it
 
Export options : I can export to pdf but the output often doesn&#x27;t look good with the weird section numbering. Having nested items looks good inside orgmode but not in an exported pdf. There&#x27;s no option to export to doc that I&#x27;m aware of. It makes collaboration with others difficult
 
It doesn&#x27;t work well with tools my team uses with slack and google docs. 
 
And many others
 
 Has anyone else felt like this? What am I doing wrong? I&#x27;m planning to go back to vs code and mark down files because emacs looks like a big investment. But I really like the idea of a macro enabled editor.
 Edit: I didn&#x27;t expect such useful and positive feedback from everyone. You guys are the best. I found some promising stuff . I&#x27;m going to give it another try. Thanks!

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to implement a Convolutional Neural Network in Haskell. I have previously built a normal artificial network using hmatrix for linear algebra operations (BLAS, etc.) but now that I need to do convolutions, I have to somehow parallelise my code. I looked into the obvious packages for parallel arrays such as repa arrays and the accelerate package. accelerate is an embedded DSL which I think would make the code quite unelegant and I want to stay as close to Haskell as possible. Further, I am working on a Windows PC with a CUDA capable GPU but also a MacBook Pro 2021 so I&#x27;d have to implement both accelerate and some other package for non-CUDA PCs as well.
 So that brings me to Repa, which seems perfect for my purposes:

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I would much appreciate some help. Haskell is acting really weird with infinite lists and I would like to figure out, what is happening.
 So, I have a type BitString, which is a wrapper around Data.ByteString.Lazy and allows me to construct a bytestring from single bits. It works fine, but I would like to be able to work with infinite bitstrings.
 Here is part of the code relevant to this problem:
 import qualified Data.ByteString.Lazy as BL import qualified Data.ByteString.Lazy.Internals as BLI data BitString &#x3D; BitString Word8 Word8 BL.ByteString -- head, size of the head, tail #define EMPTY (BitString 0 0 BLI.Empty) -- for simpler pattern matching empty :: BitString empty &#x3D; EMPTY cons :: Word8 -&gt; BitString -&gt; BitString cons b (BitString h l t) | l &#x3D;&#x3D; 7 &#x3D; BitString 0 0 (push…</span>

                              <span>I was quite excited to discover how to use The Archive in two windows properly. I&quot;m sure many people here know this, but I thought I&#x27;d share it here as it wasn&#x27;t obvious to me at first.
If you open a new window (from the Window menu), it opens a second copy of The Archive. Normally, this window operates independently of the first window.
But what I hadn&#x27;t realized is that, if you have the second window open and highlighted, you can right click on links in the (unhighlighted) first window. If you hover over a link, right click and select Open Link in that window, it leaves the first window on its current page, and opens the link in the second window. Very cool. This is really useful for copying material between documents that are part of the same &quot;tree&quot; of documents, without losing your place or leaving the current document.</span>

MultiMarkdown Composer has a feature called elastic tabstops which allows indented text to be correctly aligned even when using a proportional font:

  
Rather than assigning a fixed number of spaces to a tab character, or a fixed width, tabs represent “columns” of text. Contiguous lines of text are examined to ensure that the columns are wide enough to contain the text in each line.


Why does it matter? My theme uses a monospaced font for all markdown syntax (-, *, &gt;, etc.), but a proportional font for everything else. (I stole this idea from the brillant folks at Cultured Code.) As it right now however, when mixing proportional and monospaced fonts, The Archive doesn&#x27;t align lists correctly.</span>

 The relevant directories exist, some aspects have been changed to protect the identities of those involved :) Any help would be much appreciated. (If parens don&#x27;t match here, it&#x27;s because of bad copy-pasta, not because that&#x27;s how it is in my config -- I&#x27;ve checked for paren-matching in the actual config)

  * Lord of the Rings My favorite scenes are (in this order) 1. The attack of the Rohirrim 2. Eowyn&#x27;s fight with the witch king + this was already my favorite scene in the book + I really like Miranda Otto. Important actors in this film are: - Elijah Wood :: He plays Frodo - Sean Astin :: He plays Sam, Frodo&#x27;s friend. 
 Elijah Wood and Sean Astin do not render when you type C-c e t A

                              <span>I am trying to write a function for a org-capture template that uses on the value of a template expansion. So for example, when reading emails, depending on the %:from value, the string used in the template is different. The only way I found it to work was to do something like this:
  (&quot;mt&quot; &quot;Task&quot; entry (file+olp &quot;~/org/todos.org&quot; &quot;My todos&quot;) &quot;%(custom/task-email \&quot;%:from\&quot; \&quot;%:subject\&quot;)&quot; :empty-lines 1) 
 Is it possible to use the value %:from within the custom/task-email? I just want to avoid having multiple lines with \&quot;%:from\&quot; \&quot;%:subject\&quot;
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Hey @all,
 TL;DR: Would appreciate some feedback about my WIP Emacs theme. Link: https://github.com/qhga/shanty-theme
 Last week I finally had the time to do one thing that was on my bucket list for quite some time: Write my own Emacs color theme.
 It is not available on MELPA yet, because I first wanted to ask some fellow Emacs users about their opinion. So far, the one person that also uses Emacs and I know irl thinks it is quite pleasant. But I would appreciate a bit more feedback, so here I am.
 It is still a WIP so every feedback is very welcome (: For now, I only included packages I use on a regular basis, but I&#x27;ll try to slowly but surely add dedicated support for more packages (requests welcome). Most of the other packages I know have sane inheritance and could still be usable right now. I am by far not an elisp-pro but I tried my best to provide a dark and a light version without too much duplicate code.
 If you wanna check it out, here is the link: https://github.com/qhga/shanty-theme
 Thanks &lt;3

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to get GNUS to show article fullscreen after select on summary screen. I found out about gnus-buffer-configuration variable where is configuration of how screen should by displayed. I also found gnus-add-configuration function to modify. I tried to set article settings to:
 (article (vertical 1.0 (article 1.0 point))) 
 But when I try to open article I get gnus-summary-show-thread: Args out of range: 0 and empty buffer is open in fullscreen. I also tried without point:
 (article (vertical 1.0 (article 1.0))) 
 since I got same error when I tried to reset to default and I forgot to delete points from behind the article:
 (gnus-add-configuration &#x27;(article (vertical 1.0 (summary 0.25 point) (article 1.0 point)))) 
 I also tried to get (summary 0) but that was some other error and I thing it also does not make much sense.
 Anybody tried similar thing? How to setup GNUS to open article fullscreen?
 EDIT: I tried to debug gnus a little bit and I find out that responsible function for shoving thread is gnus-summary-show-thread, but can&#x27;t understand what exactly it is doing, from mi point of view I see only some tinkering with cursor position and something called overlays:
 (defun gnus-summary-show-thread () &quot;Show thread subtrees. Returns nil if no thread was there to be shown.&quot; (interactive nil gnus-summary-mode) (let* ((orig (point)) (end (point-at-eol)) (end (or (gnus-summary--inv end) (gnus-summary--inv (1- end)))) ;; Leave point at bol (beg (progn (beginning-of-line) (if (bobp) (point) (1- (point))))) (eoi (and end (next-single-char-property-change end &#x27;invisible)))) (when eoi (remove-overlays beg eoi &#x27;invisible &#x27;gnus-sum) (goto-char orig) (gnus-summary-position-point) eoi)))

                              <span>That&#x27;s a bit of a strange post, but I hope it may spark some positive discussion: Emacs recently get tab support. First AFAIK from Centaur Emacs and then upstream. Tabs are common UI elements since years, however IMVHO in most cases are a very bad idea as they are normally: modern monitor are 16:9 and most people use them straight, not 90° rotated, so plenty of horizontal space, very little vertical one and tabs eat some of it while still being unable to scale well...
 On contrary &quot;experiments&quot; like Tab Center Redux (it&#x27;s successor Tab Center Reborn) Firefox extension show that vertical tabs can scale well, they might be &quot;hard to choose&quot; at first, but actually work pretty well. They remain easy to read even when they are many, they might be scrollable if needed, integrated with switch-buffer search&amp;narrow packages, they might co-exist with a sidebar (like those popular in IDEs), even on one and another side of the screen and potentially spark new UI ideas to extend them further. 
 What do you think about that?

                              <span>When I view PDFs in Emacs using DocView, they appear much darker than they should:
 ​
 Emacs and Preview displaying the same PDF, where it is much darker in Emacs
 I am not sure why this happens -- I haven&#x27;t changed any settings related to DocView or enabled any minor modes that would cause this. Disabling my current emacs config (by moving .emacs.d) does not resolve this. I am using the mituharu emacs-mac port from this Homebrew formula, but the issue also exists with the build from https://emacsformacosx.com. My .emacs.d is on GitHub here.
 Has anyone encountered a similar issue before? How would I go about resolving this?
 UPDATE:
 I found out that the issue is caused by GhostScript, as expressed in this comment. I&#x27;ve resolved it by installing mupdf (brew install mupdf), which should cause docview to use mudraw to convert PDFs to temporary PNGs instead of GhostScript. After installing mupdf, opening a PDF in DocView and running doc-view-clear-cache should resolve the issue.

                              <span>I hope one of you fine folk can help. I&#x27;m trying to set up mu4e and integrate it with my org-mode based GTD system.
 I already have org capture templates set up to make next action entries.
 What I want to do now, is make the next action entry have a link to the email that the action is about (i.e. the one I was reading when I invoked the capture template)... but if I invoke the capture template from someplace other than an email, I don&#x27;t want there to be a link in it.
 So if I&#x27;m in an email, I want C-c c a w to open this template:
 (&quot;aw&quot; &quot;Work Related&quot; entry (file+headline &quot;~/mygtd.org&quot; &quot;Work&quot;) &quot;* TODO %? %a %u \n\n &quot;) 
 But if I&#x27;m someplace other than an email, I want the same key combination C-c c a w to open this template:
 (&quot;aw&quot; &quot;Work Related&quot; entry (file+headline &quot;~/mygtd.org&quot; &quot;Work&quot;) &quot;* TODO %? %u \n\n &quot;) 
 Which is exactly the same, except it has no %a in it.
 How would I do that?

                              <span>Hi all,
 seems I am too stupid to customize modes for my text file editing, either via manually changing the .emacs or via M-x customize or via Easy Customize menu. Have read all online doc, internet search, &quot;Learning GNU Emacs&quot; book. Have tested dozens of variants given in these sources for manual changes in .emacs, but regardless which variant, when I open my file, none is active and shown in mode line. Only I managed to set fill-column via Easy Customize dialog ad the adwaita look.
 I simply want to have text-mode, enriched-mode, auto-fill-mode, flyspell-mode set as standard for working buffer. 
 Here is my latest .emacs: 
 (custom-set-variables
 ;; custom-set-variables was added by Custom.
 ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful.
 ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance.
 ;; If there is more than one, they won&#x27;t work right.
 &#x27;(add-hook &#x27;text-mode-hook t)
 &#x27;(ansi-color-faces-vector
 [default default default italic underline success warning error])
 &#x27;(ansi-color-names-vector
 [&quot;black&quot; &quot;red3&quot; &quot;ForestGreen&quot; &quot;yellow3&quot; &quot;blue&quot; &quot;magenta3&quot; &quot;DeepSkyBlue&quot; &quot;gray50&quot;])
 &#x27;(custom-enabled-themes &#x27;(adwaita))
 &#x27;(display-fill-column-indicator t)
 &#x27;(fill-column 75)
 &#x27;(add-hook &#x27;text-mode-hook &#x27;auto-fill-mode)
 &#x27;(add-hook &#x27;text-mode-hook &#x27;enriched-mode)
 &#x27;(add-hook &#x27;text-mode-hook &#x27;flyspell-mode))
 (custom-set-faces
 ;; custom-set-faces was added by Custom.
 ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful.
 ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance.
 ;; If there is more than one, they won&#x27;t work right.
 ) 
 If anyone could advise, I would be happy!

                              <span>I&#x27;m having trouble customizing emacs.
 I have learned how to use hooks to switch things on and off, e.g.:
  (add-hook &#x27;text-mode-hook &#x27;visual-line-mode) 
 So that text files will open with word wrap on.
 What I&#x27;ve not been able to do is to pass a value in on starting a mode, e.g.:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; doesn&#x27;t work
 (add-hook &#x27;text-mode-hook &#x27;text-scale-adjust 3))
 or
 (add-hook &#x27;text-mode-hook &#x27;text-scale-adjust &amp;eval (&#x27;text-scale-adjust 3))
 doesn&#x27;t work
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 I&#x27;m sure you can see what I&#x27;m trying to do -- when in text mode, automatically enlarge the text so that I can read it.
 I have read the manual -- but unfortunately that part of the manual (23.1.1 Running Hooks) doesn&#x27;t give any examples.
 I think the bit that reads: &quot;If a hook variable has a non-nil value, that value should be a list of functions. run-hooks calls all the functions, one by one, with no arguments.&quot; refers to what I&#x27;m trying to do, but how I write a list of functions that evaluates to &quot;3&quot; I&#x27;ve no idea.
 Any help appreciated.

                              <span>Just curious for a quick n dirty read, so sorry if I missed your favorite distro or bundled yours with one you dislike; I&#x27;m no linux guru, I&#x27;m in the middle of a distro hopping soul searching journey right now.
 Lemme know how good your OS is at integrating with emacs, bonus points if you suggest a window manager too.
 EDIT: I&#x27;m sorry that people are upset with me for the way I&#x27;ve set up the poll, I am close to a total newcomer to Linux, and I&#x27;ve just seen these groupings of distros around (usually referring to difficulty/level of customization) so I figured it was a fine enough compromise since I couldn&#x27;t add them all as poll options. As for why I didn&#x27;t include various distros like BSDs, as some commenters guessed, I just had never heard of them before.
 Also sorry that it&#x27;s single choice, it slipped my mind and I can&#x27;t change it now

                              <span>I&#x27;m interested in using a python library in elisp for a quick hacki project and found this https://github.com/pinard/Pymacs Is there any modern versions or will this still work? If not would wrapping stuff in calls to elpy be the best option or should I just write the python commands I want to use as individual scripts then call them through the shell command functions? In case it&#x27;s relevant the library is https://pypi.org/project/FlightRadarAPI/

I&#x27;d like to bind evil-mode&#x27;s &quot;K&quot; key (originally &quot;evil-lookup&quot;) to be &quot;lsp-ui-doc-glance&quot; whenever I am in a lsp-ui-mode enabled buffer. My idea is to run a condition check whenever I&#x27;m entering a new buffer, with the buffer-list-update-hook. My code snippet below seems to be working (having tested thoroughly though), but I wonder if there is a more elegant way to achieve this:
 (add-hook &#x27;buffer-list-update-hook #&#x27;(lambda () (when (bound-and-true-p lsp-ui-mode) (define-key evil-motion-state-local-map (kbd &quot;K&quot;) #&#x27;lsp-ui-doc-glance))))

                              <span>Hi to everyone! I&#x27;m an undergraduate Mathematics student with also a great interest in Computer Science. In order to complete my degree, I have to write and discuss a small thesis (roughly 40 to 60 pages long) about a topic of my interest. I&#x27;d like to talk about an overview of the use of Category Theory in Functional Programming, therefore I stumbled upon Haskell and the book &quot;Category Theory for Programmars&quot;. Since there is a lot of material to know about, I&#x27;d kindly ask you, if possible, what you think are the most fundamental or important topics which are worth covering in such a small format. Thanks!

 -- test do let n0 :: N IO n0 &#x3D; N { childrenM &#x3D; pure mempty , propsM &#x3D; M.fromList [(&quot;a&quot;,&quot;A&quot;)] } let n1 :: N IO n1 &#x3D; N { childrenM &#x3D; pure [n0] , propsM &#x3D; M.fromList [(&quot;a&quot;,&quot;A&quot;),(&quot;c&quot;,&quot;C&quot;)] } let n2 ... let n3 ...
 n &lt;- breadthSearch &quot;a&quot; &quot;A&quot; n3 n shouldReference n1 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

 I&#x27;m trying to get flyspell to play nice with electric-quote-mode. Basically, especially in org-mode, I want to be able to use &#x27;smart&#x27; quotes without each instance of e.g. isn’t being marked as a spelling error.
 Aspell only seems to like straight quotes
 I&#x27;ve looked around the customization options for flyspell but haven&#x27;t found anything that looks relevant. And it occurred to me that I cannot be the only person dealing with this problem. So I come here asking for help. Anyone?
 (I found a post by Artur Malabarba offering a solution to this problem but I&#x27;m wondering if others have other fixes.)

 Fountain was originally made for Screenplays, but I&#x27;d love to be able to type something like 
 FX:
 And then have the following words underscored and in all caps until a manual line-break.
 Does anybopdy know how I can write that function into the mode? Is there an elisp-way to do it?

 Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve tried since use-package failed.
  
package-refresh-contents
 package-install  lsp-mode -- this fails.
  
package-compute-transaction: Package ‘spinner-1.7.3’ is unavailable
 package-archives is a variable defined in ‘package.el’. Its value is ((&quot;melpa&quot; . &quot;https://melpa.org/packages/&quot;) (&quot;org&quot; . &quot;https://orgmode.org/elpa/&quot;)) 
 I&#x27;ve confirmed that both lsp-mode and lsp-pyright exist on Melpa unstable. Package-refresh-contents works fine. I just keep getting the same message about spinner-1.7.3 not being available. I can&#x27;t even think how I would debug this further. :(

                              <span>So, to understand my problem, let me explain my situation.
 I am Greek and naturally a lot of my files are in greek. To make org export to a latex pdf properly, if it has greek characters, you need to add some packages to it. I have those in my org-latex-packages-alist and everything exports just fine. 
 However, when we get to exporting org-roam files (or any file that contains file links for that matter), there is a problem. The org latex export backend typically exports a link like \href{file_name}{description}. If the file name is in greek (which odds are it is), latex starts to freak out a bit. Org will export perfectly to latex, but latex won&#x27;t export to pdf. To my understanding, it doesn&#x27;t understand the greek characters in the file name (which it should as it understands them everywhere else) and it chooses not to export.
 After a lot of searching, I did manage to find a solution to this in this post. Basically, if the link is of the form \href{\detokenize{file_name}}{description}, it exports perfectly. From what I understand, that command just makes it recognize any unicode character for file names. 
 So my question is, can you configure the org latex export backend to export links in the form \href{\detokenize{file_name}}{description} and not \href{file_name}{description} as it does by default. I couldn&#x27;t find any option that changes how hyperref makes its links in the hyperref manual, nor could I find how org exports its links to latex in the org-export manual, so if anyone here knows, it would help me greatly.
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I have slowly transitioned from PyCharm to Emacs for my coding development and It&#x27;s been about 6 months now and in general am very happy with my workflow in Emacs. There is just one thing that is still pulling me back to PyCharm and it is something that others might not find too useful but I constantly use. 
 It is the tree-like structure overview for your code that PyCharm has that you can toggle on the left and it looks like this. 
 Now I know I can get a directory overview with the treemacs package and I also know about the iMenu command which is very nice but not exactly a static tree-like structure you can look at. I was wondering if there exists a package to show the class/functions/ structure of a file on the side as you can see on the picture above. 
 Thank you for your help.

 ​
 Example with two entries having a #Bib tag.
 I am not sure which component is responsible for such search results. Is it ivy, ivy-rich or counsel. I am using all of them in my init.el.
 After an update of all packages via M-x list-packages + U + x the tag column is gone. In which package should I look into to find the correct setting/variable or open a ticket for it.

                              <span>Consult-project defines an endpoint for accessing different sources related to the common project workflow. Using Consult&#x27;s narrowing system, the user is able to access the current project&#x27;s buffers, project files and all the known projects, in case they want to change projects quickly. Consult-project provides an extension to the default Consult functionality, using the built-in package project.el, defining the functions consult-project and consult-project-other-window. Furthermore, Consult-project only depends on consult, resulting in a lean and simple to maintain functionality.
 ⚠️ NOTE: This package has come to life adapting the great package consult-projectile by OlMon. Most if not all credit should go to him, I have been using his package for months now. What inspired me to create this package is my recent effort to avoid most third party packages, specially if they prefer a newly defined interface over the built-in Emacs interface.
 Also special shutout to Daniel Mendler for making such a great package!
 I would appreciate any feedback, I&#x27;ll try to submit the package to MELPA next.

 I have been trying to set up a vscode like debug experience and I feel like I am close but not there yet. 
 I want to be able to debug JS, TS, C/C++, Rust and Go.
 This is my config https://github.com/andrerogers/dotfiles/blob/master/.cfg/emacs/emacs.el
 Any help in modifying this to ensure I&#x27;m using lsp and dap correctly for the above languages, and to the best of its current ability, would be much appreciated.
 Thank you.

                              <span>Does anyone know how to auto generate variable type for Rust in emacs. 
 For example, when you type out the variable 
 let msg &#x3D; &quot;something&quot;; 
 it will auto populate
 let msg: &amp;str &#x3D; &quot;something&quot;; 
 Similar to the way that VS code does it.

                              <span>I want to write:
 class PrettyOrShow a where prettyOrShow :: a -&gt; String instance Pretty a &#x3D;&gt; PrettyOrShow a where prettyOrShow &#x3D; show . pretty instance Show a &#x3D;&gt; PrettyOrShow a where prettyOrShow a &#x3D; show 
 Now the behavior I want is: if my type is known (at compile-time) to be Show, then use show, but if I know Pretty, then use pretty OVER the show instance (subsequent instances might take further precedence, but I don&#x27;t need more instances to be possible). The part of resolution order makes sense to me (with some configuration of OVERLAPS/OVERLAPPABLE).
 But I know why I can&#x27;t write this - the a in the instance definitions match all types! And the instance resolution simply does not use the constraints to resolve the instances. My understanding of the reasoning for this design is that Haskell would become internally inconsistent, because in different contexts, prettyOrShow could have different behavior for the same types in different contexts. Great - I love that - super safe. But in this case I DONT CARE. I want to write this out of convenience - so I don&#x27;t care about safety here - if the behavior is inconsistent I will still sleep deeply and peacefully . If we had dependent constraints or something similar, perhaps this would be easy - but as it stands - this is not...
 Is there a way to do what I want to do? Make it as grimy as you like. Use reflection if you must but bonus points if its raw GHC Haskell: we will all bask in the ugliness.

                              <span>I&#x27;m interested in Google summer of code event but missed it last year. I want to attend the event this year and notice that Haskell.org was one of the organizations. It sounds really exciting, I hope Haskell.org will participate in GSoC this year as well. But I have little experience with Haskell, I&#x27;m worried about how to write an expressive proposal when I don&#x27;t even know which projects they will focus on. Can anyone give me so resources or suggestions about the following question?
  
How can I predict the projects this year? (Where can I find out some clues?)
 Which materials should I go through to master required basic skills, including reading books, articles (both blogs and papers), open-source project code, and any other resource? I can only finish some 1-3 kyu problems on CodeWars now. (My CodeWars Profile)
 How to write an attractive proposal in GSoC for working with Haskell.org? I can find very few accepted GSoC proposals on the Internet, many of which were even written several years ago. I have almost no idea about how to write the proposal, especially for Haskell.org, can you provide me with some examples for references?
  
Thanks a lot.

 I have two questions, and both of them are about this commit: https://github.com/sekunho/swapi/tree/59277e41bd12b6f390600c78f12742f5da335aea.
 Static binary
 Currently I&#x27;m not really aware of exactly what libs I need to build a static binary with cabal build; locally in nix develop. 
  
Output
 Packages in flake.nix
 swoogle&#x27;s ghc-options in swapi.cabal
  
It does work fine in the CI (I think) since I&#x27;m using the ghc-musl image, but I&#x27;m not sure how that translates to a Nix environment, unfortunately. Building it with dynamic linking does work though (by removing the ghc-options under the swoogle executable), but I&#x27;d like for it to be consistent between CI and the dev environment, for the most part. 
 Discrepancies in CI and dev
  
Dockerfile
 GitHub Actions file
 cabal.project.freeze
 swapi.cabal
  
This has more to do with how cabal resolves the dependencies. So this is the result of the most recent job: (GitHub Actions, PasteBin).
 My question here is, despite freezing the dependencies (and committing it), why does cabal resolve them differently? Locally it all builds, and runs just fine. But in the CI it seems to be complaining about conflicting versions of base, for example. At one point it also complained about req, and some other libraries. I think I&#x27;m missing something obvious to make it consistent between both environments. I don&#x27;t understand where it pulled that new base version from.
 I&#x27;ll try to provide more information if ever what I&#x27;ve provided so far is insufficient. Thanks.

                              <span>Ok, I&#x27;ve been learning akka, and I&#x27;m trying to wrap my head around thread safety. Let&#x27;s recap
 JAVA THREAD MEMORY MODEL
 All threads have their own little slice of memory exclusive to that thread. Periodically the JVM will sync the thread memory values to main memory, but it&#x27;s not guaranteed when that will happen. This is why different threads can see different values of a variable.
 Volatile of course bypasses this by making a given variable always be read/written from/to main memory. Synchronized enforced the other piece of this, ensuring that only one thread at a time can interact with it to prevent race conditions.
 AKKA ACTOR THREAD MEMORY MODEL
 So I do not totally understand this, but here is what I do understand. AKKA has its own thread pool, and is purely message based. A given actor is executed on any available thread when a message is present for that actor.
 The first thing that trips me up is that Akka only executes a message on a given actor one at a time. Ie, a given actor will process messages synchronously. I could be wrong about this, please tell me if I am. This just seems like a bad model for concurrency vs a more traditional approach like the thread-per-request model of a traditional webapp like Spring.
 The second thing is that while this kind of message processing rule would prevent race conditions, it feels like memory consistency would still be an issue. If an actor can be operated on by multiple threads, even if those threads can&#x27;t touch it concurrently, how do all the threads see the same state value? Wouldn&#x27;t there be a risk of memory consistency issues? Are actors somehow made entirely volatile?
 CONCLUSION
 I clearly do not understand some key stuff here. Guidance would be appreciated. Thanks.

 I tried to export it with C-c C-e m m:
 # Table of Contents 1. [Test](#org358707a)  # Test ![img](./img/test.jpg &quot;test&quot;) 
 Which is almost perfect but the #+ATTR_ORG: :width 400px wasn&#x27;t exported.
 I then tried with pandoc C-c C-e p g (and in CLI with pandoc -i reddit.org -o reddit.md):
 @:t ::t |:t ^:{} \_:{} \*:t TeX:t LaTeX:t # Test ![](./img/test.jpg) 
 Looks like pandoc doesn&#x27;t care about my options and even wrote some of them as plain text and the size for my image is still not here.
 Is there a way to achieve it (other than writing 
 #+html:  
 Because I tried:
 * Test #+CAPTION: test #+NAME: fig:test #+PROPERTY: header-args :eval never-export #+ATTR_HTML: :width 400px #+ATTR_ORG: :width 400xp [[./img/test.jpg]] #+html:  
 But the image is still exported.
 And why does pandoc export my options as plain text?

Org-journal seems like what I want/need, but the formatting is just weird. Perhaps I&#x27;m trying to use it in a way that&#x27;s not intended. Below is an example:
 * Tuesday, 02/15/2022
 ** 09:20 Is this supposed to be a header? I&#x27;d rather be notes here instead of having a header.
 This is the start of the next paragraph. I think it would look better if it started such that all text lines up, so &quot;This&quot; would start under the previous paragraphs &quot;Is&quot;.

 EDIT/NOTES: this is not about making a file read-only or about making backups or versioning. It is about the actual process of a human CONFIRMING himself that it wants to change stuff.

                              <span>Hi all!
I&#x27;m new to zettelkasten. I&#x27;ve been playing with it for just a few days now, and I&#x27;ve already found some of the KMs very helpful.
Thanks, @Will, for many of them!
I was wondering if anyone had ever created a KM for inserting a link to a structure note on a zettel.
For me, I put my links to the structure note and other zettels at the very bottom of each zettel. I&#x27;ve used the naming convention for structure notes that includes the • between the UID and the text title.
I was thinking if there was a way to set it up so it worked something like this:
I place my cursor in the appropriate location in my zettel.
I enter the key combination for the KM to insert my structure note link.
It then gives me a prompt, asking me which structure note I want to link to (it would limit it to those zettels with the • in the title).
I select the appropriate structure note.
It automatically enters that structure note as a link in the format of UID and text title of the structure note.
Is this possible? Is it unnecessary?
The reverse of this would be a time saver too. For me, I often add a link to my newest zettel to my structure note immediately after I create the zettel. So, if there was a way to go back to my structure note and use a KM to create a link to the most recently created zettel (of even a prompt to choose from one of the more recently created zettels) that would save time too.
Or, have you guys found ways to save time and do this without a KM macro?</span>

                              <span>SimpleX Chat – private and secure chat app – is now available as public beta for iOS 15 – you can install it from TestFlight via this link.
 SimpleX Chat for terminal is built in Haskell, and with a lot of help from u/angerman - thank you! - we made the same core work both on iOS and Android platforms.
 To exchange messages privately you can connect either via the invitation link you can share from the app or by scanning QR code from the app on their phone (e.g., during video call or in person).
 More information about SimpleX and iOS app is in this post: https://github.com/simplex-chat/simplex-chat/blob/stable/blog/20220214-simplex-chat-ios-public-beta.md
 We really look forward to your feedback – you can connect to the team from the app settings (it will be myself or somebody else replying to you:)
 Please star the repo on GitHub (thanks a lot if you did already!) and share iOS app beta with your friends – Android app is coming in a few weeks too!

                              <span>It seems like the visibility property on a parent heading overrides the visibility property on a child heading - is this expected? e.g. when I have the raw text:
 * Foo :PROPERTIES: :VISIBILITY: content :END: ** Bar :PROPERTIES: :VISIBILITY: folded :END: *** Baz 
 ... I would expect (and would like) to see
 * Foo... * Bar... 
 e.g. where Foo shows only the content below it, and Bar has all of its children folded. Instead, I get
 * Foo... * Bar... * Baz... 
 e.g., behavior like if Foo and Bar both &quot;had their visibility&quot; set to &quot;content&quot; (I&#x27;m aware that&#x27;s not how the internals work but I&#x27;m not sure how else to articulate what I mean). Is there a way to prevent this and get the behavior I&#x27;d expect?

                              <span>I&#x27;m working on a little package to integrate tab-bar, project.el, and buffer-isolation. This seems to be a thing lots of people want so I thought I&#x27;d share it here. I&#x27;m not a programmer, so this code is almost certainly worse than it could be (though I&#x27;ve been helped by looking at lots of other people&#x27;s code). It works for my use-case and I&#x27;ve done some basic unit-testing, but am happy to hear of things that need fixing.
 https://github.com/mclear-tools/emacs-workspaces
 Note that this doesn&#x27;t affect one&#x27;s tab-bar, tab-line, or project.el config in any way. It just adds a few convenience functions to set things up for isolated buffers and for creating or opening workspaces.

                              <span>Apparently there is a package called python. It&#x27;s built-in, and also distributed through GNU ELPA: https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/python.html
 And there is different one called python-mode in MELPA: https://melpa.org/#/python-mode, with upstream at https://gitlab.com/python-mode-devs/python-mode/
 What is the difference between them?
 The background of my question is that I tried to setup my Emacs 27 as a python environment with a language server like David Wilson (aka SystemCrafter) described in his tutorial. This is a codesnippet of it.
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;lisp (use-package lsp-mode :commands (lsp lsp-deferred) :init (setq lsp-keymap-prefix &quot;C-l&quot;) :config (lsp-enable-which-key-integration t) )
 (use-package python-mode :ensure t :hook (python-mode . lsp-deferred) :custom (python-shell-interpreter &quot;python3&quot;) ) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 I am not sure but it looks like that the python-mode here cause the use of the MELPA version of python-mode. How can I setup the inbuild python mode of Emacs include the use of the language server?

 EmacsWiki: https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/HowmMode
 I was looking for alternatives to org-mode, not because there is anything wrong with it, but because I use it only for note taking and sometimes TODO and was wondering what else is there.
 Another thing with org is that sometimes the ecosystem, for someone not doing GTD or writing a paper etc. can feel a bit overwhelming. 
 I didn&#x27;t find a lot of info about howm, except a couple posts here, including a 15 year old link that is dead (thank heavens to the Wayback Machine). But I can infer there are some active users between this subreddit and the Emacs Wiki.
 I like the way it links info with &gt;&gt;&gt; and the schedules with special sorting for TODO vs deadline vs reminder seems interesting.

                              <span>Hey guys,
 I am a new convert to emacs. I tried in the past to get my head around it for simple plain text editing, but it never really clicked. Recently I got back into it (mainly via vim -&gt; evilmode) and I am currently hacking away on my own config. (The stream series &quot;Emacs from Scratch&quot; by System Crafters was insanely helpful.)
 I am a physics postgrad and use R for data analysis and yihui&#x27;s suite of R packages for any type of write-up/publishing.
  
RMarkdown: Simple Markdown syntax to write documents with R code blocks mainly to avoid writing LaTeX directly and for reproducibility.
 bookdown: Write scientific reports in RMarkdown and export them to html (Github Pages) and pdf with references and citations.
 blogdown: Publish my personal website via a simple RMarkdown syntax and easy to use R-functions. (Not thaaaat important to me, I don&#x27;t blog regularly)
  
I have realised that I can do most of those things also using orgmode. Is someone here who made a similar switch from the RMarkdown ecosystem to orgmode, who could point me in the right direction regarding workflows, packages or tutorials etc? I am slowly getting paralysed by the amount of possibilities I have with emacs and now orgmode....
 ​
 edit: I mainly want to switch to emacs with orgmode to get away from RStudio. I feel it can be quite limiting.

                              <span>I switched from PhpStorm to Emacs for my Php editing and it feels amazing, I feel much more comfortable and productive using all my familiar keybindings, tools and modes.
 I&#x27;m using lsp-mode with intelephense as the back-end. Code completion works great, but I&#x27;m missing the usual alerts that I got with PhpStorm which showed, in the method signature, which exceptions where thrown but not catched.
 What do you guys use for that? Should I use another specific tool for it or maybe should I switch to another LSP back-end, ...?
 Thanks a lot in advance!
 EDIT: as a front-end for linting, I&#x27;m using the built-in flymake-mode.

                              <span>Hello everyone, I&#x27;m trying to get my head around sbt, I have a little issue now to read files from src/main/resources.
 If I build the jar with sbt package the resource is in the jar, if I run the class I can read the file with getResourceAsStream, but not when doing sbt run.
 How do I make them part of the classpath of sbt run? 
 Example code:
 ----- build.sbt ----- mainClass :&#x3D; Some(&quot;App&quot;) ----- src/main/resources/file.txt ----- content ----- src/main/scala/App.scala ----- object App { def main(args : Array[String]) { println(classOf[App].getResourceAsStream(&quot;/file.txt&quot;)) } } ----- output of sbt run ----- [... omissis ...] null ----- output of scala -classpath target/scala-2.12/test_2.12-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar App ----- sun.net.www.protocol.jar.JarURLConnection$JarURLInputStream@453da22c

                              <span>Hi,
I&#x27;m working on some notes and I&#x27;m a bit confused on the process I should use.
I have note which is about &quot;Transform information into knowledge&quot; where I talk about the differences between the two.
It comes from the Zettelkasten method, and it gave me ideas on many other subjects, like therapy, coaching and marketing.
I also already have a note that says &quot;It&#x27;s not about what you know, it&#x27;s about what you do with what you know&quot;, talking about the ideas that knowledge is not enough, and that it&#x27;s acting on knowledge that builds and create things. That note is also connected to coaching and therapeutic ideas.
I had some epiphanies and good concepts while working on those notes, and that created 2 other notes.
At first, I was writing everything in the first note &quot;Transform information into knowledge&quot; which was becoming almost like the start of an article. The &quot;flow&quot; got to me and I wrote some good ideas and made some good connections.
I&#x27;m new to Zettelkasten but I remember the Permanent / Evergreen notes should be atomic and if possible, quite short.
So I splited my &quot;Transform information into knowledge&quot; note into 5 different notes.
I now have 5 different notes, linked together, talking about the same idea.
In a MOC about Therapeutic Changes, I added all those 5 notes.
It&#x27;s a bit confusing to me because naturally I would have kept &quot;Transform information into knowledge&quot; and let that note because a bit longer and like an &quot;index&quot; of all the others ideas, and put that note into my Therapeutic MOC.
And when I see examples here and there I feel like permanent notes are not &quot;that short&quot; and even sometimes, not that atomic.
What&#x27;s the best method here in your opinion ? What&#x27;s your take on this ?
Thanks a lot</span>
