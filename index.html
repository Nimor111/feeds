                    <span>Hi Emacs friends,
 been trying to solve this issue for quite a while now (google, posts). I swear, I did everything short of asking it here.
 Different terminal emulators as well (Terminal, iTerm2, kitty). I am on macOS.
 I would love to use my arrow keys in the non gui version of Emacs but they seem to be weirdly mapped:
 ​
 UP:
 esc-map O
 global-map C-t f F
 global-map M-O
 and then A
 (GUI Emacs: evil-previous-line)
 
 Down:
 esc-map O
 global-map C-t f F
 global-map M-O
 and then B
 (GUI Emacs: evil-next-line)
 
 Right:
 esc-map O
 global-map C-t f F
 global-map M-O
 and then C
 (GUI Emacs: evil-forward-char)
 
 Left:
 esc-map O
 global-map C-t f F
 global-map M-O
 and then C
 (GUI Emacs: evil-backward-char)
 ​
 ​
 I have tried few remapping by suggestions that do not work at all – currently:
 ​
 (unless (display-graphic-p)
 (progn
 (defvar arrow-keys-map (make-sparse-keymap) &quot;Keymap for arrow keys&quot;)
 (define-key esc-map &quot;O&quot; arrow-keys-map)
 (define-key arrow-keys-map &quot;A&quot; &#x27;previous-line)
 (define-key arrow-keys-map &quot;B&quot; &#x27;next-line)
 (define-key arrow-keys-map &quot;C&quot; &#x27;forward-char)
 (define-key arrow-keys-map &quot;D&quot; &#x27;backward-char)))
 ​
 Nope. Doesn&#x27;t work.
 HELP.

                    <span>Hello everyone, I&#x27;m trying to switch (once again, 2nd try) from my tmux, vim setup, to emacs. Mostly because I do common lisp development, but I have 2 relative big issues regarding my workflow. First, on every project I have a script that builds tmux session with corresponding services running (redis, postgresdb, vim, custom services, etc) I guess I can simulate this using a elisp file on each project? Is that possible? . Second, I use a lot M-x compile command, but my root keeps moving on each window. It&#x27;s different than vim, that the root is where I executed vim. On the other hand, SLIME is really cool, and I&#x27;m really eager to use org-mode more when I solve this 2 issues. Thank you!

                    <span>When writing Emacs Lisp programs, is it possible to automatically insert require forms?
 If not, is there an easy way to find out which ones you need to add? I have caught a bunch using elint-current-buffer, and compilation helps, but these are a bit clumsy.

                    <span>Did anyone else notice high cpu usage of emacs compiled with pgtk runing in native wayland?
 I am running it under -Q and the process go up and down at around 30/40% of a single core on a non beefy laptop even idled with no buffer open.
 I am guessing this is inherent on how wayland protocol works where emacs+pgtk spend its time doing the redrawing?

                    <span>Inspired by recent, well-known articles on Embark and on Avy, I&#x27;ve started testing Embark over the past few days - and it&#x27;s already turning into the interface I always wanted and only sort of knew I needed. While it&#x27;s extremely useful out-of-the-box, I&#x27;ve already found a few cases where I would want to use it but can&#x27;t, because it doesn&#x27;t understand the construct at point. Examples:
  
Org mode timestamps - to provide operations like activate/inactivate, change, pop calendar to that date, bump by repeater, etc.
 
Org mode headlines - pretty much everything you can do on those, that Org mode has bound to countless weird keys. Including &quot;speed commands&quot;, most of which could work without quitting the Embark &quot;prompter&quot;, the way e.g. navigating to next/prev symbol works.
 
Org mode tables - embark-cycle could be able to switch between cell, row, column, whole table (perhaps also stopping at &quot;rowgroup&quot;, &quot;column group&quot; and &quot;subtable&quot;, which would be rectangular areas that are bound by hlines and column group markers) - each of those would have its own contextual commands available. For example, &quot;eval formula&quot;, so one doesn&#x27;t have to remember reference syntax and how many times to press C-u before pressing C-c &#x3D;.
 
Syntactic elements and expressions in programming language modes, allowing for e.g. language-specific actions.
 
 From the looks of it, it&#x27;s not that hard to write any - the tricky bit being target classifiers. I&#x27;m going to take a stab at adding some classifiers and action keymaps for things I commonly interact with - but I&#x27;d like to avoid repeating work that might already be done better. Hence my question: are there any &quot;extension packages&quot; that enable Embark to recognize more target types? Or, are any of you already using hand-written ones (and if yes, can you share them)?

                    <span>We have all seen Emacs be described as so many different things: a text editor, not just a text editor, an operating system, a Lisp interpreter, and a *million other things.
 Describing what Emacs is can be super difficult, as it is different things to different people. Some use it for programming or general writing, some for organisation, project management, email, web browsing, controlling media, and a **million more things. Basically, people use Emacs for whatever they want, which is fantastic! 
 This makes it difficult to describe what exactly Emacs is to people outside our friendly little circle. Other editors can be described nearly completely with a short familiar phrase. Vim is an efficient text editor, VSCode is a powerful modern IDE, Vi is a last resort. But Emacs doesn&#x27;t have a consistent and universally agreeable short description. 
 My question is, what is Emacs to you? How would you describe it succinctly to someone who has heard about it, but not sure what all the fuss is about? 
 My humble submission would be: &quot;the whatever you want text interface.&quot;
 *Mild exaggeration, but you get the picture
 ** Under exaggeration :)

                    <span>NOTE: I usually use emacs in the CLI, not in the GUI.
 I found out about emacs some months back. When I initially tried out emacs; it felt complicated to use. After I practiced emacs over time; I started to like emacs.
  
I could use lynx inside emacs to form a psuedomultitab browser. Eventually I learned that emacs has a built-in browser eww. I favored that browser over lynx.
 
It was nice to be able to containerize workspaces, like for programming, school work, miscellaneous stuff, and just general browsing without having to deal with floating windows.
 
 I have Autism and ADHD; emacs helps with dealing with Autism, because it does not give much lack of sensory information; emacs is hyperresponsive, unlike VSCode, so it does not hurt my eyes when I try to do heavy-load tasks.
 emacs also helps with ADHD, since I can easily organize stuff with org-mode. I can also easily navigate buffers without a pointing device; I am uncomfortable with pointing devices (mouses and touchpads), despite using them for 11 years. Pointing devices seem to really mess with me and I can&#x27;t control them as well (as I can with a keyboard).
 EDIT: My only complaint is that I wish I could display images in CLI emacs, like running viu on links to images after eww finishes loading. That complaint is not a criticism on emacs itself though.

                    <span>Initially, I thought using hex values like #042e3a would grant me more freedom to choose the color but it turns out that apparently emacs will try to find the closest color it has when you supply a color that is not in its own color set.

                    <span>Hello there,
 I&#x27;m doing Python web development in emacs using lsp-mode(I want to switch over to eglot-mode eventually when the pull-requests get pushed and html/css/js work automatically with elgot-mode, so keep this in mind) as the IDE for the Python and HTML files, which is working great. But when doing Jinja/Django specific syntax(for example in an HTML file), the auto-completion does not work? Is there an lsp-mode/eglot-mode for this to be used with use-package?
 If not then is there a way to declare web-mode in a use-package, where this functionality can be set, in which the corresponding Jinja/Django engine is activated based on a corresponding hook?
 I&#x27;d prefer to stick with the .py and .html extensions, but if that&#x27;s not possible, the I could try out extensions like .djhtml to be used in the web-mode hook in the declared use-package.
 Thanks in advance for the help!

                    <span>File links break all the time, for instance after reorganize your directory structure. This can take many time to fix broken link manually. I need a solution to prevent all file reference in my org-agenda-files are broken.
 My current solution to prevent the issue is to use hardlink in org-agenda-files &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 assume I want add /a/b/c.org into emacs variable org-agenda-files
 mkdir ~/.emacs.d/org-agenda-files
 create hardlink of c.org in dir org-agenda-files
 ln /a/b/c.org ~/.emacs.d/org-agenda-files/c.org 
 add ~/.emacs.d/org-agenda-files/c.org to emacs variable org-agenda-files
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 However, this solution has some limit. For instance, - the absolute path of &quot;c.org&quot; become ~/.emacs.d/org-agenda-files/c.org. So its relative link are broken.
 LinkTek propose a much better solution: https://linktek.com/do-this-one-trick-and-never-worry-about-broken-file-links-again/
  
LinkTek creates an additional association between the parent file and each of its child files. LinkFixer Advanced uses that secondary association to quickly and automatically fix all the links that get broken by whatever changes someone makes to your files.
  
What solution you use for the problem of broken link? Exist an implementation of solution proposed by LinkTek for org mode?

                    <span>I use ebib and citar. Both are awesome, but have different defaults when creating notes files for bibliographic entries. I wanted to unify them (so that my notes would always be of the same format). So I defined a wrapper function:
 (defun my/citar-ebib-notes-format-wrapper (key _entry _filepath) &quot;Wrapper so that citar&#x27;s notes function can inherit from ebib&#x27;s. 
 Passes KEY to ebib--notes-fill-template&#x27;, along with the value ofebib--cur-db&#x27; if defined, or the first item of &#x60;ebib-preload-bib-files&#x27; if not. _ENTRY and _FILEPATH are ignored.&quot; (require &#x27;ebib-notes) (if-let ((cell (ebib--notes-create-new-note key (or ebib--cur-db (car ebib-preload-bib-files))))) (progn (display-buffer (car cell)) (goto-char (cdr cell)))))
 This only works while ebib is running. While it&#x27;s not running I get an error message format-spec: Invalid format character: ‘%T, which is strange, because the formatting seems to rely on ebib-notes-template-specifiers, which I don&#x27;t change, and which is initialised in ebib-notes.el (so should be available when the body of the function runs). Changing the notes template variable so that it doesn&#x27;t include %T helps, and iterating on this reveals that the formatter errors for all specifiers except %K, which it handles fine. I&#x27;m very confused.
 I&#x27;ve tried everything I can think of to get this to work, to no avail. What&#x27;s going on? Any help greatly appreciated!

                    <span>Just today I startted getting the following errors after using straight to pull the most recent version of org.
 Error (use-package): org/:config: Symbol’s function definition is void: org-element-cache-reset [2 times]
 Error (use-package): evil-embrace/:catch: Symbol’s value as variable is void: org-org-menu
 WARNING: No org-loaddefs.el file could be found from where org.el is loaded.
 You need to run &quot;make&quot; or &quot;make autoloads&quot; from Org lisp directory
 The only notable parts of my config related to installing org are as follows:
 (require &#x27;package) (setq package-archives &#x27;((&quot;gnu&quot; . &quot;https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/&quot;) (&quot;melpa&quot; . &quot;https://melpa.org/packages/&quot;) (&quot;nongnu&quot; . &quot;https://elpa.nongnu.org/nongnu/&quot;))) 
 and
 (straight-use-package &#x27;org) (straight-use-package &#x27;(org-contrib :type git :host github :repo &quot;emacsmirror/org-contrib&quot;)) 
 I Know there have been some recent changes with org mode installation and I have seen some posts here but I have gotten confused and can&#x27;t seem to figure out what I am doing wrong. Notably, I have not changed anything in my config lately that I would imaging would have anything to do with installing org....
 ​
 EDIT: I take it back. 
 I did recently add 
 :hook (org-mode . turn-on-org-cdlatex)
 and removing that line does seem to fix things but I have no idea why. 
 Any help would be most appreciated.

                    <span>In NixOS, I have installed emacs:
 $ emacs --version GNU Emacs 27.2 Copyright (C) 2021 Free Software Foundation, Inc. GNU Emacs comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY. You may redistribute copies of GNU Emacs under the terms of the GNU General Public License. For more information about these matters, see the file named COPYING. 
 What does it mean when I start its daemon:
 $ emacs --daemon Warning: due to a long standing Gtk+ bug https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk/issues/221 Emacs might crash when run in daemon mode and the X11 connection is unexpectedly lost. Using an Emacs configured with --with-x-toolkit&#x3D;lucid does not have this problem. Warning (initialization): An error occurred while loading ‘/home/t/.emacs.d/init.el’: File is missing: Cannot open load file, No such file or directory, go-mode-autoloads To ensure normal operation, you should investigate and remove the cause of the error in your initialization file. Start Emacs with the ‘--debug-init’ option to view a complete error backtrace. Starting Emacs daemon. 
 ?
 I also feel that ~/.emacs.d/init.el isn&#x27;t executed when I start the emacs, because I added (desktop-save-mode 1) in it, and when I exit and start emacs daemon again, it doesn&#x27;t reopen the files that were opened when I exited it.
 Thanks.

 These are a few small scripts I use related to Emacs and Org-mode. I recently added some descriptions for each. I hope they are also useful for someone out there.

 Please advise me if you have a better suggestion for any of them!

                    <span>Hi,
 I am a still new to emacs, and so I am not really sure what this error means.
 &#x60;forge-db: BUG: The Forge database scheme changed and there is no upgrade path&#x60;
 ​
 But I get it every time I start an application such as magit or I try to use dired for the first time.

                    <span>I use dired with the variable delete-by-moving-to-trash set to t. But sometimes I want to delete a file (or directory) without sending it to trash. Here is how I modified the dired-deletion-commands to toggle their trashing-behavior when called with a prefix.
 (defun my/dired-do-flagged-delete (&amp;optional arg) (interactive &quot;P&quot;) (let ((delete-by-moving-to-trash (xor arg delete-by-moving-to-trash))) (dired-do-flagged-delete))) (defun my/dired-do-delete (&amp;optional arg) (interactive &quot;P&quot;) (let ((delete-by-moving-to-trash (xor arg delete-by-moving-to-trash))) (dired-do-delete))) 
 All I have to do now is bind these functions to x and D in dired-mode-map
 Of course after that, the default reaction to prefixes is lost. Personally I don&#x27;t care, because I never used it. Others might think differently about that.

                    <span>I am unable to get show-trailing-whitespace to work. Here is a test I did,
 emacs -q foo.txt 
 In Emacs I typed these commands,
 M-: (setq show-trailing-whitespace t) RET M-: (setq-default show-trailing-whitespace t) RET 
 Then typed 3 lines in the .txt buffer where every line contains a trailing whitespace. The trailing whitespaces do not get highlighted.
 I also checked C-h o trailing-whitespace RET and it shows that this face is set to black foreground on red background. Still I don&#x27;t see the trailing spaces highlighted in this manner.
 What is going on and how to fix it?

 And now we are at 1.1.0, there are some minor fixs, but for the most important
  
We have M-x meow-tutor
 
We have a WIP doom module for meow
 
 Great jobs from the contributors, we also enabled discussions.

 I have defined succ so that it can be applied to all permutation of [Letters] with a ordered sequence like this:
 succ [A,A,A] &#x3D; [A,A,B] succ [A,A,B] &#x3D; [A,A,C] succ [A,A,C] &#x3D; [A,B,A] ... succ [C,C,B] &#x3D; [C,C,C] -- succ [C,C,C] is not defined 
 build in Buildable is given the start and end value, it builds a ordered list of every element in the set including start and end:
 build A B &#x3D; [A,B] build B C &#x3D; [B,C] build A C &#x3D; [A,B,C] 
 ​
 How do I apply Buildable on [Letters] such that I can call build like this:
 build [A] [B] &#x3D; [[A],[B]] build [A,A] [B,B] &#x3D; [[A,A],[A,B],[B,A],[B,B]] build [A,A,A] [A,A,C] &#x3D; [[A,A,A],[A,A,B],[A,A,C]] build [B,B,C] [B,C,C] &#x3D; [[B,B,C],[B,C,A],[B,C,B],[B,C,C]] 
 It seems like I have to define what maxBound and minBound is for [Letters] if I do instance Buildable [a]. How do I do that?

                    <span>I want to get back into Haskell. I used it a lot a few years ago. I just installed haskell-platform on Ubuntu which seems to be the recommended download. 
 Should I be using stack to make Haskell projects? stack wasn&#x27;t included in the haskell-platform download so is there a different workflow I should be using? I have some projects on github that I made with stack.
 Any help or other new advice would be nice

                    <span>I&#x27;m trying to make a macro that creates Encoders and Decoders for union types, all well and good except for the part where I try to constrain a type to be a union type in the given declaration:
 Scala inline given unionEncoder[U]: Encoder[U] &#x3D; myMacro 
 Having the type constraint be A, B, U &lt;: A | B seems to result in any type being allowed since for any T, you can say it&#x27;s T | T. Also, yes, I can check if the type is a union in the macro, but that doesn&#x27;t stop the implicit resolution to land on unionEncoder in the first place. Any ideas?

 Endless bridges the gap between Cats Effect and Akka Cluster Sharding. It makes it possible to define abstract repository and entity algebras in tagless-final style to describe distributed event sourced domains seamlessly within functional codebases. I&#x27;m exited about it, let me know what you think!

                    <span>I’m not very familiar with scala and it’s ecosystem. Here’s the solution I envision with rust-like pseudocode.

 How do I do the same in scala? Preferably with the help of finagle infrastructure.

 jsonrpc.el looks like a useful library for this task but I can&#x27;t seem to find any examples of it&#x27;s usage in a real world application.
 There is documentation in the official manual but it isn&#x27;t particularly useful.
 If anyone could point me in the right direction or provide me a good example the would be very helpful :)

                    <span>Hi everyone,
 I&#x27;m having an issue where emacs seems to freeze randomly on me (with no error message viewable from the GUI). It doesn&#x27;t seem to be related to a particular command (most recently it happened while I was just navigating the cursor around a buffer). Is there anything I can do / try to get a more helpful error message?
 Sorry if that&#x27;s a silly question, I&#x27;m new here.
 Some info about my setup in case it&#x27;s relevant:

                    <span>I love org-mode, but there is one thing I have always wondered: why are the default keybinds so weird? org-do-promote and its friends are by default all bound to something plus an arrow key, which completely breaks your workflow as your hand leaves the home row. I use these commands quite often, and if I had not rebound them, they would be literally the only reason I ever hit the arrow keys.
 Is there a rationale behind this?

                    <span>I have the following groceries.org: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 +STARTUP: nologdone
 +FILETAGS: SHOPPING_LIST
  
Groceries :PROPERTIES: :LOGGING: nologdone :END: ** Produce *** NEXT Tomatoes &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  
But only the LOGGING property in the Groceries headline works. If I remove it, the &quot;nologdone&quot; in the startup doesn&#x27;t prevent logging. 
 In a bunch of similar files I don&#x27;t need a root headline and would like to just rely on the STARTUP.
 What am I missing?

                    <span>Hi everyone,
 I am a PhD student in Earth Sciences currently trying to switch all my Python programming from Spyder to emacs (because emacs is just all I need). 
 I am pretty sure more people than enough tried to make emacs as close as Spyder for me to find somewhere an el file ready to use with the Spyder theme and just the few useful things I need (basically an iPython console in another window, autocompletion, black formatting on save, cell highlighting and few other things)... However I can&#x27;t find anything. Thefore I&#x27;m pretty sure I am not looking at the right places. Do you know where I could find such a file? Or at least part of it (like the spyder theme)?
 Thank you a lot in advance for your help!

                    <span>TL;DR:
  
Download here: https://github.com/jimeh/emacs-builds/releases/tag/Emacs-28.0.90-pretest
 System Requirements: 
 macOS 10.15.x or later (uses Rosetta2 on Apple Silicon machines).
 Xcode Command Line Tools (macOS will prompt to install them on first use of native compilation).
 
 All dependencies, including libgccjit, are bundled into Emacs.app, and have been tested to work with native compilation on fresh macOS VMs with nothing installed except Xcode Command Line Tools.
 Native Apple Silicon builds are not yet available, and depend on GitHub-hosted Action runners adding Apple Silicon hardware. See Issue #4 for details. But the Intel-based builds have been reported to work fine on Apple Silicon via Rosetta2.

                    <span>I am currently using lsp-mode with Haskell in Doom Emacs. Unfortunately, when I try to open my Xmonad config in Emacs, my memory usage spikes due to the Haskell language server(takes apprx. 1.8GB) and my screen is filled with recommendations as in the image. 
 I wish to remove the gray inline requests and only keep the light-bulb requests on the right. I have looked through this page: https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/tutorials/how-to-turn-off/ but I cannot find out how to remove the inline requests. Any help with this is greatly appreciated. I have also noticed that the inline requests are actually duplicated, which is even more confusing. 
 For the high memory usage, I don&#x27;t even know where to begin with reducing it. It&#x27;s so high that it completely eclipses the memory usage of the rest of Emacs. 
 Thanks in advance for any help

                    <span>I am a data scientist, I work in python with pandas for manipulating data on a daily basis. I love emacs but there is one feature that makes me open up Pycharm every day instead and that is its “sciview”, which displays dataframes in a “spreadsheet” manner which really helps when debugging/exploring.
 EIN has a function to do exactly this and visualize the dataframe in SES mode: https://github.com/tkf/emacs-ipython-notebook/blob/d62dc59869d436385efa940ba20a737bb8b9e5fd/lisp/ein-pytools.el#L222 . It relies on a jupyter kernel to retrieve the data, I would like to adapt that to dap-mode (or any standard python process accessible through a REPL) but my elisp-fu is way too poor.
 Has anybody here solved this problem before?

 ELISP&gt; (cider-sync-request:complete &quot;re-frame&quot; (cider-completion-get-context) ) *** Eval error *** No linked CIDER sessions 
 in the context of this comment https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider-nrepl/issues/732#issuecomment-986043891 from the same ticket.
 So then, my question would be, how would link a cider session? My guess is that the (cider-completion-get-context) value isn&#x27;t returning the cider session.

                    <span>Comming to Haskell has made me feel like I&#x27;m learning to program all over again. How would you suggest is the best way to unlearn all of the habits and design patterns from imperative programming? For example whenever I work with lists I want to instinctively loop through them which of course you cannot do with Haskell.

                    <span>I&#x27;m reading through Retrocomputing with Clash. The example projects use stack to build. I&#x27;m trying to use iohk&#x27;s haskell.nix with it. For the one example project clash-calculator, when I run nix develop and it builds clash-ghc I get the following warning
 Warning: This package indirectly depends on multiple versions of the same package. This is very likely to cause a compile failure. package ghc (ghc-8.10.7) requires ghci-8.10.7 package clash-ghc (clash-ghc-1.4.6) requires ghci-8.10.7-G6m9jPL8HBD2MenaVWt4To 
 Then later there are a few errors that indicate that this warning is indeed the problem.
 How can I fix this? I could give up on the nixification of the project and just use stack, but I&#x27;d prefer not to.

                    <span>The title may not be the appropriate way of solving this issue but I feel it may be a way to the solution.
 I have a function that takes in something and returns a list of that something changed in multiple ways.
 The way it is changed is by checking the input against many if statements, the if statements only differ by the fact the values within them increment up and down. However, I don&#x27;t think this is a good solution to this.
 The way that it is changed shows a pattern so I think I should be able to solve it recursively but I can&#x27;t figure out how.
 I will give an example of a situation similar to mine, this function is useless and is just an arbitrary example of my situation:
 function :: Shape -&gt; [Shape]
 function shape@(Triangle sidea sideb sidec) &#x3D;
  [if length sidec &lt;&#x3D; (7) &amp;&amp; sidecChangeable sideb sidea (2) then changeSideC shape (2) else Triangle [][][],
 if length sidec &lt;&#x3D; (6) &amp;&amp; sidecChangeable sideb sidea (3) then changeSideC shape(3) else Triangle [][][],
 if length sidec &lt;&#x3D; (5) &amp;&amp; sidecChangeable sideb sidea (4) then changeSideC shape (4) else Triangle [][][],
 if length sidec &lt;&#x3D; (4) &amp;&amp; sidecChangeable sideb sidea (5) then changeSideC shape (5) else Triangle [][][],
 if length sidec &lt;&#x3D; (3) &amp;&amp; sidecChangeable sideb sidea (6) then changeSideC shape (6) else Triangle [][][],
 if length sidec &lt;&#x3D; (2) &amp;&amp; sidecChangeable sideb sidea (7) then changeSideC shape (7) else Triangle [][][],
 if length sidec &lt;&#x3D; (1) &amp;&amp; sidecChangeable sideb sidea (8) then changeSideC shape (8) else Triangle [][][]]
 I have put the recurring pattern in brackets so you can see what I am talking about. How would I reduce this function down so that it would work even if you made the numbers much larger? Is there a recursive way of doing this?
 I feel that this is possible but I am at a loss on how to implement this.
 This is my first post so go easy on me if I&#x27;m missing something.

I just learned these new functions, map, filter, foldr and foldl, but i cant seem to understand when to use fold and what both of them do, in which way i want to apply them, specially with more complex functions associated, i can understand the fold (+) for example. 
 Can anyone elucidate me about these functions, im kind of stuck here.

                    <span>Hi, I am trying to convert a list to a map and back to a list, but I&#x27;m getting an error could anyone help?
 Also if I wanted to get an average test score from a list of tuples which had a name and their score but a person could appear more than once, how would I do that?
 Lastly, if I had a list of players and the teams they have played for, and I wanted to get a list of players that have played for every team how would I do that?

                    <span>Hi,
 I need to shim &#x60;UTCTime&#x60; using the &#x60;time-compat&#x60; package for older versions of GHC.
 But I don&#x27;t really want to add a new dependency for everyone else.
 Is there a way, in &#x60;stack.yaml&#x60; or &#x60;package.yaml&#x60;, that I gate a dependency for a specific GHC version?

 I do not know where to look. I am not used to asking questions here, so sorry if the format is wrong, but believe me I took my time before posting and read whatever resources I thought could be helpful.
 (I use a standard configuration, nothing fancy)

                    <span>Currently all my methods for parsing Terms are declared within the master macro, and usable only there, like so:
 def masterMacro[T:Type](quoted: Expr[T])(using Quotes) &#x3D; import quotes.reflect._ // helpers for Term level parsing object Extractors: object OnTerm: def unapply(expr: Expr[_]): Option[Term] &#x3D; Some(expr.asTerm) // etc // main macro logic 
 How do I move Extractors out of the macro? One would like something like
 // top level object Extractors(using Quotes): import quotes.reflect._ object OnTerm: def unapply(expr: Expr[_]): Option[Term] &#x3D; Some(expr.asTerm) 
 But this fails to parse with objects cannot have parameters. Dotty compiler quotes module has constructions like
 val reflect: reflectModule trait reflectModule { self: reflect.type &#x3D;&gt; 
 but I don&#x27;t understand the syntax nor whether it can be applied to what I need. Thanks in advance!

                    <span>When I&#x27;m programming in C using lsp-mode and clangd as my language server, lsp-ui-doc displays documentation like this, which is what I prefer, but it only does this if the function is defined in the file that I&#x27;m currently viewing. If I move to a different file and #include the file containing the definition, and then call the function, lsp-ui-doc ignores the docstring, which is not ideal.
 Is there a way to make lsp-ui-doc display documentation in the same way it does in the first case, everywhere? Sorry if this has been asked before, I couldn&#x27;t find anything about it while googling. Here is my settings file.

                    <span>I&#x27;d like to know what you people do in these situations.
 Namely, I&#x27;d like to have coherent and consistent keybindings accross different modes, and I&#x27;d like to have this information quite visible in one place so that I can generally decide for all prog-modes or text modes what are the best keybindings for me.
 Right now I have defined a macro that kind of does this for me, a minimal example for markup languages would be
 emacs-lisp (defcustom ale-markup-mode-maps &#x27;(:org org-mode-map :latex latex-mode-map :tex TeX-mode-map :md markdown-mode-map) &quot;Maps to be added to the markup ale mode&quot; :group &#x27;ale) 
 Here I define in a plist the maps that I am interested in and the keyword is important. Later I can define the keybindings and I can override the functions for different maps according to the keywords I defined in the plist above.
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;emacs-lisp (ale-define-key normal ale-markup-mode-maps &quot;C-i&quot; (:md markdown-cycle :all org-cycle) ;; images &quot;C-c C-i C-l&quot; org-latex-preview &quot;C-c C-i C-t&quot; (:all org-toggle-inline-images :md markdown-toggle-inline-images) &quot;C-c C-i C-i&quot; #&#x27;org-redisplay-inline-images
 ;; references &quot;C-c C-r C-d&quot; papis-extract-citations-into-dblock &quot;C-c C-r C-i&quot; papis-org-ref-insert-citation-from-query &quot;C-c C-r C-o&quot; (:all org-ref-insert-cite-link :tex reftex-citation :latex reftex-citation) &quot;C-c C-r C-r&quot; (:all org-ref-insert-ref-link :tex reftex-label :latex reftex-label)) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 How would you do this, is there a canonical way of doing this that I am missing out?
 Just to be clear, I don&#x27;t mean defining a minor mode where to have a set of keybindings, because the keybinding will be different depending on the mode that I&#x27;m in, but if I&#x27;m in org or markdown I want semantically &#x3D;C-i&#x3D; to mean cycling, but the function is different.
 Thanks people!

                    <span>So I decided to try and use org-agenda after using it on and off for a while, and on my new setup it never seems to work. To be more elaborate, I have files added to my .emacs config, but every time I try to pull up any org-agenda view, it gives me the following error: Invalid function (date date)
 I&#x27;ve done a bit of googling and I can&#x27;t seem to find an exact answer on what this is, or what&#x27;s causing it. For reference, here&#x27;s my exact setup:
 Emacs: Version 26.3 
 Org: Version 9.5
 OS: Ubuntu 20.04
 .emacs file: https://pastebin.com/ju2sfadG
 If anyone could help or even just point me in the right direction that would be great, thanks in advanced.

                    <span>Hi all -- I&#x27;ve put a repo on github for building emacs on macos. There are several other such scripts available, but I&#x27;ve tried to make mine as simple to understand (I&#x27;m not a programmer) as possible (or as possible for me...). It currently works well for me but YMMV. Of course, I realize that there are a million ways to shave this yak, so I&#x27;d be curious if anyone has suggestions for improvement (though I&#x27;m also looking to keep things as simple as possible). I hope this might be of some use to people.

                    <span>Hello,
 Like I&#x27;ve written in another post about Omnisharp and LSP, I&#x27;m back to trying to use Emacs as my main GUI. This is for notes, coding, etc. The reason I want to use Emacs is that I haven&#x27;t found a good GUI for nvim for Windows and I sadly have to be on Windows for my daily work. This is where Emacs comes in. I&#x27;m setting up Emacs to be close to VIM (but not using SpaceMacs or DoomEmacs since they are incredibly slow on Windows, especially compared to &quot;Vanilla Emacs&quot;), with EVIL and some other helping functions. I have some beginner questions I&#x27;d love to get help with to be happy inside of Emacs. 
 1. How can I make my .emacs file a bit cleaner instead of doing this:
 (unless (package-installed-p &#x27;tree-sitter) (package-install &#x27;tree-sitter)) (unless (package-installed-p &#x27;smartparens) …</span>

                    <span>When I did my own research, I found that lsp-mode seemed to have eclipsed eglot and that it was close to the de facto LSP client for emacs. Recently, however, I have met quite a few developers that I respect who are using eglot and say that it is less buggy than lsp-mode.
 I have found that many of the bugs I have encountered while using emacs have been root caused to lsp-mode and lsp-ui. I am wondering if more experienced emacs users have an opinion on these two different packages (or sets of packages in the case of lsp-mode, dap-mode, lsp-ui). I am interested to hear about feature parity and stabability - and also using eglot when editing remote files with tramp.
 Also as an aside, it would be great to have an LSP client package added in the standard distribution of emacs.

                    <span>Hello, 
 I&#x27;m again (tried this before but ended up leaving this since I couldn&#x27;t get it working) trying to use Emacs as my &quot;IDE&quot;. I&#x27;m a evil user, but I don&#x27;t believe that has anything to do with my current problem. 
 I&#x27;m trying to get LSP working in emacs. Specifically Omnisharp with Unity3D. 
 I have installed lsp-mode and the Omnisharp server through the lsp-install command. When I look for the installed servers it also states that it is installed. However, when I try to use Emacs with my Unity project I get no auto-completion for anything related to Unity things (e.g. GameObject, Transform, etc.). I only get auto-completion for my own variables and such within my script. 
 I get this error message: 
 &quot;Warning (lsp-mode): Unable to calculate the languageId for buffer ‘acPlMovement.cs’. Take a look at ‘lsp-language-id-configuration’. The ‘major-mode’ is fundamental-mode&quot;
 It also says something about &quot;(Special LSP[Disconnected] company)&quot;. 
 I did read this page, but didn&#x27;t find that I should need any special setup for the omnisharp server. - https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/page/installation/
 I assume I&#x27;m missing something in my setup, but I haven&#x27;t been able to google what I&#x27;m missing or what the problem could be. 
 Could anyone here help me with this? 
 Thanks in advance

                    <span>I find Haskell an amazing language but I have difficulties integrating it into my daily workflow. I work as a professional programmer and do Python all day long.
 I started the &quot;Learn you a Haskell&quot; book to tease my brain and learn to approach problems from a different angle. And I have learned a lot and I think my Python code has benefited from it.
 But I got stuck at the Monad chapter and lost interest. But it&#x27;s still in the back of my mind to get back to it.
 However, the biggest roadblock I am facing is that I can&#x27;t seem to find something useful to do with Haskell. Probably due to the lack of my knowledge/experience in that language.
 But I can&#x27;t bring myself to write Haskell at work as I would be the only one being able to maintain the code (no other Haskellers around).
 So I am turning to you folks: Do you have any ideas of writing something that will end up being something useful? Maybe some starters for implementing a HTTP/REST layer between a JS-Frontend and a database? Or something else I would love to play around with (but I&#x27;m not sure whether it&#x27;s even possible): Writing a Python extension in Haskell, or, if that&#x27;s not doable, a .so shared library which could be called from other code so I could use Python&#x27;s ctypes module (not sure if that is even possible either).
 Any ideas? Tips?

                    <span>Hey all. I&#x27;m a Haskell dev, but I use Kotlin in my day job. 
 For those not familiar, Jetpack Compose is a compiler plugin for Kotlin which allows for a declarative React/VDOM style of UI programming by composing so-called &quot;composable functions&quot; (which is funny to me as a Haskell dev, because what is a function if not composable?) to build up the UI.
 The kicker is, at compile-time, these composable functions are eliminated -- and (as I understand it) compiled to some imperative code that updates the UI appropriately in a reactive manner as it&#x27;s inputs change.
 Svelte works similarly, but for JavaScript.
 So in other words, you get something that looks a lot like a VDOM/React style UI -- but without the overhead of an actual VDOM!
 This is a fascinating idea to me, and I&#x27;d love to learn more about how such approaches work -- but at least in terms of compiler/DSL/PL-type features (basically anything that manipulates an AST), I find Haskell far easier to understand and read. So I was wondering if anyone has implemented anything similar in Haskell (or even a related language like Purescript).
 I know there&#x27;s gi-gtk-declarative and Halogen (on the Purescript side) -- and while these are both excellent libraries for declarative UI programming, as far as I know, both of them are implemented via a VDOM -- not with a compilation step.
 Does anyone know of anyone who&#x27;s attempted such a compile-time approach to declarative UIs in Haskell?

                    <span>Every year I use AoC in order to learn myself a new language, and this year I decided to land on Haskell.
 In order to have a nice user interface for myself, I used optparse-applicative in order to parse the following argument format: aoc --file  | --download .
 So far so good, but then I faced the following problem. The following snippet, which should work, returns a 400 error code and indicates that my access failed:
 readFromUrl :: String -&gt; IO String readFromUrl session -&gt; do now &lt;- getCurrentTime let expires &#x3D; addUTCTime (days 30) now cookie &#x3D; Cookie &quot;session&quot; session expires &quot;.adventofcode.com&quot; &quot;/&quot; now now False False True True jar &#x3D; createCookieJar [cookie] opts &#x3D; defaults &amp; cookies ?~ jar response &lt;- getWith opts &quot;https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/1/input&quot; return $ Char8.unpack $ response ^. responseBody 
 I am kind of in a loss about why this doesn&#x27;t work, and the internet or documentation doesn&#x27;t seem to give me a clue about why (or what part of) my way is wrong. Could youp lease point me in the direction of a documentation that would help me?

                    <span>Excuse me, I don&#x27;t have any experience with Haskell, but I have experience with Scala and ZIO.
 Recently, there was a discussion about functional programming, and I wanted to know how I do that differs from Haskell&#x27;s.

                    <span>Is there a way to set this variable in the properties or options of the file header?
 I know I can set it in file-local variables, with:
 # -*- mode: org; org-confirm-babel-evaluate: nil -*- 
 Or in a .dir-locals.el. However, when opening the file, I get prompted whether to allow setting the variable, which I don&#x27;t want. If I press ! at that prompt, to allow setting it in the future, too, it allows any file to set the variable without prompting, not just the one I opened (or others in the dame directory).
 Is there some way to set this in the file&#x27;s Org headers instead?

                    <span>Hi everyone!
I’ve been lurking for a while now but thought it was time to post and say hello. I’m a PhD student in Archaeology, and I stumbled upon the world of Zettelkasten while trying to find a better way to make notes at the start of my PhD.
I’ve jumped around quite a few different tools over the past year but there’s always been something that’s got in the way - apps were either too bloated or complicated or too buggy, or in some cases had awful font rendering.
My most recent favourite was iA Writer, and I think I was so attracted to it because I’ve learnt that I want something simple, minimal and distraction free.
For me, most options people seem to be using have too many bells and whistles and I want something that just gets out the way and leaves me with my text. iA Writer fit this bill perfectly but I found moving between notes and linking too cumbersome.
SO I’ve purchased The Archive this week and I absolutely love it! Just as minimal and “clean” but with ease of navigation built in.
I’m still in the process of getting familiar with The Archive but it seems to do everything I want it to. Before I was using subfolders but I’m thinking that I’m happy to lean in and just put all my notes in a single folder, and use tools like structure notes and other forms of hypertext to maintain connections and groupings where necessary.
The only thing I’m currently unsure of is how much to keep in my Zettelkasten. For example, my primary use case is academic writing, but I also want to keep notes relating to more personal topics of interest, e.g. notes about personal development, note taking, language-learning, etc. I’m not sure whether to combine everything or whether to keep my other interests separate.
Anyways, looking forward to learning more from you all and getting to grips with the method and The Archive in greater depth. Thanks for all the wisdom I’ve already gained from the forums!</span>

                    <span>if you build a v28 or v29 emacs using &quot;--with-native-compilation&quot;, and you load an elisp library, it is magically compiled &amp; hot-loaded into your editor (which i find *amazing*). but what about the elisp that is loaded into temacs before dumping?

                    <span>Hi, 
 I have been trying to get lsp-julia to work for a couple of days now. No go. I there anyone who has been able to make it work with the latest julia (1.7), languageserver and symbolserver installed?
 It cannot index the files. It starts up, and then crashes. I thought this is just because julia first-run is so slow. I tried vscode and lo and behold, the language server spun up instantly :( 
 Any help/tips/suggestions?

                    <span>Hi, I&#x27;m new to emacs and lots of the terminology and understanding for it is nooby.
 I was wondering if someone could in baby terms guide me how I can do the following:
 ​
 a) Write and save a text file
 b) Open an application
 c) Open a .mp3
 d) Open a folder
 e) Set a macro on my keyboard to open a specified application
 ​
 Thank-you in advance

                    <span>I&#x27;d like the grep buffer not to scroll/move the current line to the top of the buffer/screen when i press enter. I&#x27;ve tracked the issue down to &#x60;compile-goto-error&#x60; and then &#x60;next-error-internal&#x60; in simple.el, but I can&#x27;t seem to find the relevant code. I&#x27;ve tried a few configuration options, including &#x60;next-error-recenter&#x60; (which seems to just stop recentering/scrolling on the destination buffer) but can&#x27;t seem to figure it out.
 Any advice would be much appreciated, thanks!

                    <span>I have been mostly happy keeping no emacs custom-file using Drew Adams&#x27; cus-edit+. This means that all my customization is kept in my use-package statements, so it is fully reproducible. The only downside in my year+ of doing this has been that sometimes I get warnings or &quot;buttons&quot; in messages that pop up, such as &quot;disable showing&quot; in a pop-up warning, and I don&#x27;t know how to &quot;disable&quot; it permanently. Normally it would put a line into my custom file and I could use that to update my :custom sections in my init.el. Now, though, it saves it in running &quot;state&quot; if I click the (eg) &quot;Disable showing&quot; button, but I have no idea what I should write to make it permanently remember not to show that thing.
 Any solutions? How can maintain no custom file, but still capture the code that would be written by interface interactions like errors &quot;disable showing&quot;, or certain customizer settings, etc?

                    <span>Hi, I was recently playin with the docker package from this page - https://github.com/Silex/docker.el Which I think is using docker tramp. But i am unable to work around a very annoying problem. When i try to trigger the exec command, it constantly throws a warning or error. Attached shots below. I am quite confused and was unable to find any solution online, actually noone seems to have had this problem ?

 docker exec -it keycloak sh &amp;&amp; extit || exit the input device is not a TTy. If you are using mintty try prefixing the command with &#x60;winpty&#x60; helm-M-x-execute-command: Tramp failed to connect. If this happens repeatedly, try &#x60;M-x tramp-cleanup-this-connection&#x60;

                    <span>having trouble with org-journal and org-agenda - 
 I configured org-journal-carryover-items to carry over all except those marked DONE . This carryover happens at file-creation time for the next day. 
 If I schedule something in an org-journal entry for a date in the future, the file is created. But there are no carryover items at the time. 
 When items do carry over, the file is already created, so they don’t get added to the existing file.
 ​
 How do I fix this?
 ​
 Doom emacs

 I use Conan package manager for manage my external libraries which locate in &#x60;~/.conan/data&#x60;. I am currently using Spacesmacs and wonder how I can add that folder to to syntax checking. I added this hook to the user-config:
 (add-hook &#x27;c++-mode-hook (lambda () (setq flycheck-clang-include-path (list (expand-file-name &quot;~/.conan/data/&quot;))))) 
 But it doesn&#x27;t seem to work... Can you advice me how to include certain dir to path?
 Also I use &#x60;lsp-clangd&#x60; backend.. Maybe something to be set there?

 Is there a way to configure notmuch to have this gnus functionality?

 Per the documentation for format-time-string that says that %n is a newline, I tried adding %n to org-agenda-format-date-aligned as well as to org-super-agenda-date-format, but that doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing the trick. Any ideas? Much appreciated!

                    <span>You&#x27;ve almost certainly all heard this sentence before. As a new Emacs user and someone who does want to really get to know Emacs, I want to hear about all the pros and cons I have heard so far, from you guys. I&#x27;m really surprised how friendly this community is. I&#x27;ve never seen a more friendly online group ever. 
 I am the guy that asked about &quot;Emacs-Lisp functions beneath the surface&quot; a few days ago. 
 Anyway, I was watching this video and there is something that caught my attention more than anything else. And that is the sentence at 14:00 : 
  
&quot; Emacs is 12 MB, core with none of the Lisp extensions.&quot; 
  
Is this really true? Why is Emacs considered a bloat Software, in some communities, then? 12 MB doesn&#x27;t seem much. 
 And what do people mean when they say that Emacs is bloat or memory intensive? Is the core bloated?
 There are definitely people that are more for debating than actually addressing problems or having a discussion. So I&#x27;m really curious, is it that there is actually a real reason they are saying it, or is it just that it&#x27;s a common &quot;saying&quot; of Vim users and users who find Emacs &quot;too difficult&quot;? 
 Or is it that an average user uses so many packages that Emacs becomes CPU and/or memory intensive? 
 What do you consider a bloat software?
 Also, even the guy in the video said that at 18:20: 
  
&quot;All these things that people have said about Emacs having a big footprint and being memory intensive blah blah blah it&#x27;s all true&quot; 
  
I would love to hear your perspective on this commonly brought up &quot;contention&quot;.

                    <span>Hi there. I&#x27;m a recent Emacs convert using Spacemacs. I was wondering if anyone else is using Emacs to write Python 3.10 code, specifically using the new match and case keywords. When I try to use them, Emacs doesn&#x27;t recognize them as keywords, and so doesn&#x27;t understand that it should indent the following lines.
 If I understand correctly, this is handled by python.el. Has there been any movement on adding support for the new keywords? And where could I go to find out, follow progress, or possibly contribute?
 For reference, I&#x27;m using Emacs 27.2 and the built-in python.el. Thank you!

                    <span>I find Emacs&#x27; scroll down C-v and up M-v a little jarring. I duckduckgoed (went?) around and found golden-ratio-scroll-screen but it didn&#x27;t scroll 62% of the screen, as the README claims it to do -- in fact it overshot by a bit. As I don&#x27;t have the time to debug it right now, what recommendations do you have to scroll half a page up or down on Emacs?

                    <span>My ultimate goal is to parse function and class/type signatures and add comment documentation stubs, think doxygen. I am starting with Python and hopefully implement it for other languages when I successfully implement this. The parser part is easy, but the problem is that most of the file is not relevant and I want to ignore it. Is there way to jump to the part of the file/text that is potentially parseable or is relevant to the task.
  There is some text that I don&#x27;t care about... ...  ... Maybe more irrelevant text. 
 I tried using getPosition and setPosition but it didn&#x27;t behave like I expected, maybe I am using them wrong?
 Any advice would be appreciated.
  
EDIT: I am using parsec for parsing.

                    <span>I know this code is garbage, but basically I&#x27;m trying to implement a safe (maybe) Int division function. I have to use both recursion &amp; guards, so this is what I came up with. The problem now is that somehow the just (negate count) in the test&#x27; function doesn&#x27;t work (it always returns the result as positive, eg dividedBy&#x27;&#x27; (-100) 10 is always Just 10) - and I can&#x27;t for the life of me figure out why. I checked that the test&#x27; function does indeed get called, I triple checked my guards etc. Any help would be much appreciated :)
 dividedBy&#x27;&#x27; :: Int -&gt; Int -&gt; Maybe Int dividedBy&#x27;&#x27; num denom | denom &#x3D;&#x3D; 0 &#x3D; Nothing | num  0 &#x3D; test&#x27; (negate num) denom 0 | num &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; denom  0 &amp;&amp; denom &gt; 0 &#x3D; go num denom 0 where go n d count | n &lt; d &#x3D; Just count | otherwise &#x3D; go (n - d) d (count + 1) test&#x27; n d count | n &lt; d &#x3D; Just (negate count) -- why does this not work?? ffs | otherwise &#x3D; go (n - d) d (count + 1)

                    <span>A question about ghcup. I&#x27;ve used that to install a recent version of GHC (9.0.1), alongside the one from the Ubuntu repos (8.8.something). Ghcup also installed Cabal 3.6 for me.
 How do I persude my OS and/or Cabal to use the version of GHC installed by ghcup, and not one from Ubuntu? 
 I resorted to added some manual links into ~/.ghcup/bin, pointing to the GHC binaries I want, but that can&#x27;t be the way to do it properly.

                    <span>Dear all
 We are thrilled to announce the release of Ogma, a new open-source NASA tool, written in Haskell, to generate hard-realtime C runtime monitoring applications from high-level specifications.
 Ogma takes the output of existing tools, like NASA&#x27;s requirements elicitation tool FRET [2], and produces monitors in Copilot [3], a runtime verification language that can be compiled to hard-realtime C99.
 Ogma is also able to produce monitoring applications for NASA&#x27;s Core Flight System (cFS), which can be compiled alongside existing applications to flag requirement violations. 
 FRET requirement being monitored inside the XPlane flight simulator by taking the code generated by Ogma and making it accessible to the simualtor via a custom on-screen plugin
 Ogma takes high-level specifications produced from requirements by NASA&#x27;s FRET tool and converts them into Copilot runtime monitors that can be converted into hard-realtime C99 code.
 This is research software (Class E) and it has not been certified for use in aircraft or UAVs. We are currently using it for upcoming experiments at NASA Langley.
 We&#x27;d like to also take this opportunity to publicly thank the team that creates BNFC, for their tool, their response to technical questions during the development of Ogma, and for accommodations made to help us speed up our release process.
 If you have any issues, feel free to open a ticket in the github repo directly.
 Happy haskelling,

                    <span>I re-registered for a masters of CS program because my BCS was completed at a relatively unknown Canadian school so I am always wondering if &quot;I know less&quot; than others in important areas like distributed computing on which I have almost no knowledge. I know the masters program uses languages like C, C++, Java, Python, etc so I&#x27;m wondering how much of a gap I&#x27;ll be left with to transfer the knowledge I gain to implementing in Haskell. Is there a better roadmap to learning more advanced topics and applying them in Haskell or other pure functional languages than enrolling in a masters program? It&#x27;s fully online so courses only, no thesis. Should I get a job doing something within reach and self-study these concepts and trying to implement in Haskell? I&#x27;m still a novice in Hasekll but feel as though I&#x27;m falling behind already as the trend towards pure functional languages seems to be accelerating. Should I try to enroll in a graduate program that is focused on functional languages like the one at Tsukuba University?

                    <span>One of the biggest problem is the difficulty using programming tool on the code, because the code is wrapped in org file, programming tools can&#x27;t access to code.
 In order to integrate org babel code to programming tools ecosystem. 2 possible solutions: - import/export solution, like myuhe/org-gcal.el. For instance, we compile org file to .java, and recompile .java to .org. But this solution has a lot of drawbacks. When recompile .java to .org, a new org file is generated by the compiler, we lose the data organization, and all the info that are not exported of original org file. - bi-directional synchronisation solution like dengste/org-caldav. For instance, only code block of org file is exported to .java file, and all modification on java file will repercut on org code block. This is the best solution for the problem.
 However, I don&#x27;t see either of the 2 solutions used in the org mode literary programming tutorials. But they are used to integrate org agenda to another calendar ecosystem. Is there a reason?

                    <span>I&#x27;m using the new org-cite engine to write my dissertation. It works well except that when exporting to ODT or even Org-mode with chicago-fullnote-bibliography.csl as the CSL style I get a reference without date. So for citation [cite:@fabianTimeOtherHow2014 p. 7;] I get:
 For ODT 
  
[1]Johannes Fabian, Time and the Other: How Anthropology Makes Its Object (Columbia University Press, n.d.), 7
  
for Org-mode
  
[fn::Johannes Fabian, /Time and the Other: How Anthropology Makes Its Object/ (Columbia University Press, n.d.), 7]
  
As you can see, in both cases the date is missing. As per this reply to this issue on citeproc-org&#x27;s Github it seems that the date field is not a recognized bibtex field. If I change manually in my .bib file a particular entry from date to year then I do get the correct reference.
 My question is: how can I solve this issue without changing the date field of all the entries in my .bib file to year?
 This is what I have at the top of my org file:
 #+CSL_STYLE: ~/Zotero/styles/chicago-fullnote-bibliography.csl #+BIBLIOGRAPHY: /Users/name/Documents/dissertation/zotero_full.bib

                    <span>I read https://docs.scala-lang.org/scala3/reference/contextual/conversions.html and I&#x27;m left with some questions. In Scala 2, we create a companion object, e.g.,
 object Fraction { def IntToFraction(n: Int): Fraction &#x3D; Fraction(n) } class Fraction(numer: Int, demon: Int &#x3D; 1) { private val gcd &#x3D; // TODO: Calculate GCD(numer, denom) val numerator &#x3D; numer / gcd val denominator &#x3D; denom / gcd def apply def +(addend:Fraction) // etc. } 
 Is a companion object unnecessary in Scala 3?
 I could just try it on my other computer as I have Scala 3 on that one, but I would still appreciate some pointers on this.

                    <span>Hi, I&#x27;m a Java and Groovy dev and I picked a Scala2/Spark position for my next job as I was very attracted to all I heard about the language. I figured it would be a great way for me to generally become a better programmer, fast.
 Now though, I need to kick things into high gear. I have roughly three months of afterwork evenings and weekends to really get going with Scala before I have to code in front of my peers.
 Would any of you have pointers as to where to start? Books, online lectures, exercise websites? I&#x27;ll take anything!
 Thanks in advance!

                    <span>I am the guy wants to be a professional programmer of scala and I really hope that many people use scala. I know scala came out with a like motto that covers both oop and fp paradigm. Yeap functional programming is really good and that is the target to achieve to scala learners. Functional programming style sounds good. So can all of you know zio? Except for beginners anyone who like functional programming style have to know zio. Why? This library is main stream these days. Many people really like zio. I agree zio is a great library. So what? If you decided you became a scala programmer you have to learn elementary grammar and functional programming style and library like zio. Why does the guy wants to use scala like me have to know all of those? Is this language for someone who is smart and for elite?

                    <span>I have a method A calling method B.
 A { Try{ calling B } match { case Success(_) ... case Failure(e) ... }
 B is returning Failure (exception) like
 def B: Try[Unit] &#x3D;&gt; { Failure(exception) }
 This is going inside the Success block of A, any idea why?

Assessing Haskell by Nyeogmi
I considered trying to assess Haskell without mentioning my own opinions at all. I don’t think that’s fair or possible, nor do I think that would lead people to an accurate assessment of Haskell.
Fallback of actions by Magnus Therning
In a tool I’m writing I want to load a file that may reside on the local disk, but if it isn’t there I want to fetch it from the web. Basically it’s very similar to having a cache and dealing with a miss, except in my case I don’t populate the cache.

                    <span>Evaluating (window-text-width) for a fullscreen window returns 238, which indicates that 238 columns of characters should be able to be displayed on one line. However, using count-words-region, I can see that I can actually only fit 234 characters on a line without it causing wrapping (I&#x27;m using global-visual-line-mode, although this problem persists when it&#x27;s off). This causes problems with any functionality that tries to right align content - for instance, org-agenda will try to align content so that the last character in a heading&#x27;s tags is on column 238 (i.e. on the right side of the screen), but since column 238 is actually beyond the right side of the screen, the tags end up on the following visual line. Instead of
 * TODO my task a :@home: * TODO my task b :@work: 
 I end up with
 * TODO my task a :@home: * TODO my task b :@work: 
 ...which is significantly less information dense and generally uglier. I was content to set org-agenda-tags-column to 0, but I&#x27;ve recently picked up ledger, and this issue has also started messing up the formatting in its reports. This also happens regardless of how I split windows - if I split vertically, window-text-width reports a width of 118, but I can actually only fit 114 columns. Has anyone run into this before, or have tips for where to start looking? This seems like such a finicky, low-level thing I don&#x27;t have much hope - especially since I haven&#x27;t futzed around with any obvious culprits like font settings.

                    <span>Hi, On my work ( windows)laptop. Due to needing service desk to install most software. I find it easier just ssh’ing into a Linux cloud vm in that this allows me to install whatever I need. So thats good but then I’m in emacs (spacemacs ) terminal not GUI. 
 The reason I ask is that terminal only , there are problems displaying graphics e.g. matplotlib plots. So my workaround for this is Jupyter lab: jupyter lab --ip&#x3D;0.0.0.0 --port&#x3D;9090. My question is… is there any way to view plots in emacs given my setup? I’d prefer to have freedom to use emacs org mode and render plots than be forced to use Jupiter lab notebooks .
 Does anybody know, if possible, how I can display images in emacs using cloud vm?
 Thanks

                    <span>I am unable to successfully utilize the pdf-tools package.
 Environment:
  
macOS Monterey 12.0.1
 Emacs 27.2
  
To the best of my understanding, I have followed the installation instructions as outline on https://github.com/politza/pdf-tools:
  
I&#x27;ve installed and confirmed that the installations of poppler and automak are up-to-date
 Though it doesn&#x27;t seem to be required for the MacOS install, I&#x27;ve installed and confirmed that the installations of gcc and glib are up-to-date.
 I&#x27;ve set the PKG_CONFIG_PATH in the init.el file using setenv and confirmed its settings using getenv
  
​
 (setenv &quot;PKG_CONFIG_PATH&quot; &quot;/usr/local/Cellar/zlib/1.2.8/lib/pkgconfig:/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig:/opt/X11/lib/pkgconfig&quot;) 
 When I try to execute pdf-tools-install and select y in response to the question &quot;Need to (re)build the epdfinfo program, do it now?&quot; I get a compilation error which reads:
 ​

 To build project I run : sudo docker .... make -f Makefile.custom
 Can I use that flycheck or any other code checker to see my mistakes while coding?

 I use some commands that have a habit of splitting my windows, like magit or C-x p s to open a shell. I find this annoying and would prefer the default behaviour to open the command in the currently active window instead.
 Does anyone know how to do that?

                    <span>New emacs user here, I&#x27;m having trouble with color themes. I use M-x to install via package-installer and M-x to load theme. 
 Spacemacs dark and light look fine but everything else results in some weird mixing of themes:

 https://i.postimg.cc/FRRfrjLM/Screen-Shot-2021-12-02-at-1-16-38-AM.png
 What is the proper procedure to install themes? A post on stackoverflow mentions the need to disable themes before applying a new theme. Trying this sometimes works and sometimes does not. It does change the mixing but there is still mixing
 A similar thing happens when I tried to use powerline smart mode line.
 Here&#x27;s my init.el. Running emacs 27.2 (9.0) on MacOS Catalina 10.15.4

 All I have added is the Melpa package installer snippet. Any help is much appreciated!

 I ran across context.vim https://github.com/wellle/context.vim, which is basically a sticky header, where your cursor is.
 I&#x27;m wondering if anybody knows, if there is a package for Emacs as well, which has the same, or similar behavior.

                    <span>As in the title, I wonder if I can check if the running emacs has the one with xwidget compiled.
 ​
 I want to put a condition in my .emacs to check if it is xwidget compiled emacs, I want to use a certain package like mu4e-views. Otherwise, I want to skip it.

                    <span>So i have been researching Cardano for a few months and was curious about the haskell programming that it uses for Dapps.
 What do you think about Cardano using haskell programming?
 What do you think about Cardano the project itself?
 Any intresting projects you working on?
 Thanks for the read!

                    <span>Given this program, main.hs  import System.IO main :: IO () main &#x3D; do let xs &#x3D; [getLine] head xs &gt;&gt;&#x3D; putStrLn head xs &gt;&gt;&#x3D; putStrLn  I was surprised to find this output:

 Does this happen because IO String is a monad around a reader handle (stdin in this case), and so multiple binds on the same value cause successive reads on the handle?

                    <span>What to call these? Patterns like Ap themselves follow a meta-pattern which specifies applicative lifting where the operations all have the form opn &#x3D; liftAn opn.. give or take lifting constants. Assume simplified classes and liftA0 &#x3D; pure
 instance (Applicative f, Semigroup a) &#x3D;&gt; Semigroup (Ap f a) where () &#x3D; liftA2 () instance (Applicative f, Monoid a) &#x3D;&gt; Monoid (Ap f a) where mempty &#x3D; liftA0 mempty instance (Applicative f, Bounded a) &#x3D;&gt; Bounded (Ap f a) where minBound &#x3D; liftA0 minBound maxBound &#x3D; liftA0 maxBound instance (Applicative f, Num a) &#x3D;&gt; Num (Ap f a) where (+) &#x3D; liftA2 (+) (-) &#x3D; liftA2 (-) (*) &#x3D; liftA2 (*) abs &#x3D; liftA abs .. fromInteger &#x3D; liftA0 . fromInteger 
 The pattern is somewhat simple but with no way to capture it, except by repeating it for every algebra. The instance head cannot be a type variable
 instance (Applicative f, cls a) &#x3D;&gt; cls (Ap f a) where ?? 
 What would such a solution even look like? I don&#x27;t want to get distracted by if the instance are all lawful, just capturing this meta-pattern the emerges. 
  
A generic representation for type classes to parallel Generic for datatypes. 
 It can be implemented as a GHC plugin, like Evoke (blog, reddit, reddit)
 
Or created on the fly by GHC, which is privy to the internal structure of type classes
 instance (Applicative f, cls a) &#x3D;&gt; cls (Stocking1 Ap f a)

 so I tried putting &#x60;or&#x60; there instead but I just get another error.
 Am I missing an import?
 At the top of my file I have
 import Data.List import qualified Data.Map as M import Data.Maybe 
 and I swear I have been following the book line by line so did not miss any other imports.

                    <span>Morning org-fans,
 I have been asked for the PDF of my org-reveal presentation.
 I&#x27;m aware I can use the:
 ?print-pdf 
 and
 Ctrl+P 
 Method in my browser to generate a PDF, but that doesn&#x27;t do what I need.
 It doesn&#x27;t retain the formatting of the presentation. It simply displays a small amount of black text on a white blank page. This looks unprofessional and is hard to read.
 Am I missing something obvious here?

                    <span>Hi all, is anyone using org-ql with a big number of files, probably in combination with org-roam, instead of say deft? How well does it scale to thousands of files? I know that org-agenda can get pretty sluggish around a thousand files, but it&#x27;s my understanding that org-ql is faster, although maybe not that faster. Any experience? Thanks!
 NOTE: this is not for TODOs but for general search, I&#x27;ve seen workarounds that exclude files not containing tasks nor projects from the search, but that&#x27;s not what I&#x27;m interested in, I want to search every file and ideally using more structured queries like those of org-ql (vs deft).
 EDIT: I&#x27;ve been experimenting a bit with this:
  
I cloned this big nonsense ZK which is designed to stress-test note-taking apps.
 I converted all notes from md to org using pandoc: for f in *; do pandoc --to org &quot;$f&quot; &gt; &quot;${f%%.md}.org&quot;; done. Not really necessary for what it follows, except for the file extension part, but anyway.
 Now, searching for some text with ripgrep is very fast, as expected, for example with 56/10000 matches:
  
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  
time rg -c &quot;to queer noises&quot; *.org | wc -l 56
  
real 0m0.317s user 0m0.195s sys 0m0.316s &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  
Now with org-ql the same search setting org-directory to be the ZK folder, requiring no grouping and just random order, and doing a (regexp &quot;to queer noises&quot;) freezes, at least I&#x27;ve been waiting for minutes now for it to end. Repeating the search in a subset of that ZK with just a few hundred notes, it ends after some seconds, but it&#x27;s still borderline usable.
  
So I guess the answer is a sound NO, org-ql can&#x27;t be reasonably used in a setup like this one. u/github-alphapapa do you have any objection to my methodology here? Thanks!
 EDIT: deft has also been terribly sluggish with this same ZK, both in generating the deft buffer and in searching through it, so the best option seems to be something like consult-ripgrep.

                    <span>So most of my work, I have used hell lot of JavaScript and Python and a littlebit of TypeScript. In my new Job, I am supposed to learn Scala and I already had a hard time understanding Generics and all such concepts. Additionally the functional way of Scala, stuff like accumulator based recursion and tail recursion, lazy variables also got my head spinning.
 I am planning to Dive even deeper into this but I wanted to know from all of you that should I rather go and learn Java or TypeScript in depth before going to Scala? Actually I don&#x27;t have a lot of time grasping all of the concepts and so I began with basics of Scala and till now my experience is neither too good nor too bad.
 ​
 As of 2021 (or we can say almost 2022), what would be your advise for a beginer with statically typed language and how should I go about learning Scala so that I get a good grip in it?
 ​
 Additionally, when we say Java there are two things: 1. Pure Programming Side of Java, 2. JVM and of-course here I am not referring to the JVM side as I understand, since Scala anyways runs on JVM, that&#x27;s a necessary thing. What I need to know is that do you need to go through Java Programming or any such language before getting Scala really well?

                    <span>Although the feature is still marked as experimental, the release of Nix 2.4 marks the entry of content-addressed derivations in a released Nix version.
This is something to celebrate, but also an occasion to look back and see what this addition means, implementation wise.
This new feature required indeed some deep changes both in the high-level algorithm describing the build loop (and also as a consequence in its low-level details) as well as in the “plumbing” code around it.
Note: Because it touches the implementation, this post will be more technical than the others, and will also assume that you’re somewhat familiar with what content-addressed derivations means, and how it works. If you haven’t done it already, I invite you to read the previous blog articles on the topic (1, 2 and 3), …</span>

                    <span>For those using emacs, this will mimic an interesting Scrivener feature. The Keyboard Maestro macro will change the desktop image from a list and, if Emacs is running at the front, it will (optionally) also set a corresponding theme at your choice.
You can configure the list using the following format:
Full path:Some description:spacemacs-theme

The image above displays text in olivetti-mode, using the great iA Writer Duospace font.
And this is the macro (I bind it to ^⌘J D):

If you need to Hide/Show Desktop Icons, you may use this script:
try
    set CurSet to do shell script &quot;defaults read com.apple.finder CreateDesktop&quot;
    on error
    set CurSet to &quot;1&quot;
 end try
 if CurSet is &quot;1&quot; then
    set NewSet to false
else
    set NewSet to true
end if
do shell script &quot;defaults write com.apple.finder CreateDesktop -bool &quot; &amp; NewSet
tell application &quot;Finder&quot;
    quit
    try

What do you do when your Zettelkasten is a mess ? I started building a Zettelkasten in Obisidan  a couple of months ago and finally ended up with a confusing web of notes.
Do you start from scratch, or do you continue with what you have, while refining your approach to Luhmann&#x27;s method ?</span>

Zettel Crafting Checklist v.3
If surgeons and airline pilots can benefit from checklists, they probably will help me. 1
It is essential to keep any formal checklist flexible and straightforward. 
There is a difference between the structure of a zettel and its content. A checklist supports the completion of the physical form of the zettel. A checklist can only provide prompts to complete the knowledge assimilation. This knowledge assimilation comes from contextual deep thinking that focuses on the second-order meanings exposed by the idea in the zettel.
My idea of a zettel-making-checklist is that it focuses on the structure, thereby freeing up cognitive cycles so I can focus on the zettel content. And heaven knows I need all the cognitive cycles I can muster.
New Note Checklist
YAML Frontmatter [[202003231450]]
Body
Actual zettel (may include one or more of the following)
Argument
Counterarguments
Factual claim
Reference (to other text)
Quotation (only the pithiest)
Metaphor (a figurative comparison)
Summary of idea
Definition
Question posed by the author
Questioning the author
An idea #2do
Mentally elaborate on the concept. Elaborate on both the text you are reading and on your understanding. Use these elaborations as the search query for exploring the zettelkasten and not just the keywords and phrases in the body of the text. You&#x27;ll be rewarded with connections that sparkle, these connections are the macronutrients of knowledge.
[ ] Connect to an existing structure note or make this the first zettel connection in a new structure note?

                    <span>Here is a screenshot of two editor windows, the left shows padding on the left and the right. The lines in this window will resize appropriately when the window is resized. On the right shows the same note open in the same sized window and there is no padding on the right. Some of the letters/words are cut off. They remain cut off when resizing the window until the window size can accommodate the &quot;Line width&quot; setting.

Steps to reproduce.</span>

 Stumbled upon interesting blog post about avy with examples / screenshots. Thought it will be useful to some of your guys.
 Link to article.
 tldr:
 To perform task we 1 Filter &gt; 2 Select &gt; 3 Act
 The stated purpose of Avy, jumping to things, makes it sound like a (contextually) faster Isearch. But jumping is only one of many possibilities. Avy&#x27;s &quot;Act&quot; part (“dispatch list”, a collection of actions you can perform on a candidate) is where it truly shines.

                    <span>Curious about people&#x27;s use of Org agenda. I initially was really enamored by the idea of using one system for notes, writing, and task, time, and project management, but found Org-agenda a bit too clunky and requiring too much thinking about how to set it up rather than using it. 
 I&#x27;m interested in developing some more Org-centric apps in the future, and was wondering whether a note-focused Org app would be used at all if people heavily relied on TODOs and such sprinkled within their notes. Personally I think a separate application (possibly also utilizing Org-mode) for such things would be better, but that&#x27;s just me!
 Let me know your workflows!

                    <span>I just randomly did &quot;M-x notes&quot; and the auto completes showed something called org-add-notes! I thought this is something similar to remember-notes, and immediately decided to write a note using this. I did that a few more times and stored them with C-c C-c.
 Now the problem is I don&#x27;t know where to get them! Where are they stored? I have not set this up in any way in my init.el. I didn&#x27;t even know about the existence of this command a few minutes ago.
 The documentation of this command does not give me any hints. Also, directly searching through org-mode info command index does not give anything. I can see the code for this in org.el but I am not a pro in elisp code reading and cannot figure out where exactly my notes are being saved.
 I do have the feeling from the code that this is actually not similar to remember-notes but perhaps has something to do with adding comments/notes to any org file item... but I may have understood wrong.

                    <span>Hello All *** TL:DR my experience*** I have been a part time emacs user for a decade now, with only 2/3 packages + maybe 30 lines of configuration added over the years.
 Lately i have been furstrated my my c++ IDE at work. I tried rtags a few years back but it crashed frequently. When checking the state of things recently I noticed LSP was getting big so I decided to give it a try to switch full time. I installed a few more packages like lsp, helm (love it). I even read the beginner&#x27;s elisp intro to understand its syntax.
 That&#x27;s when the rabbit hole started and i read about spacemacs and doom emacs
 *** doom/spacemacs : an overwhelming layer *** I get the reason for those distributions : having a curated set of packages preconfigured to work together + load time optimisations for an out of the box working experience. (+vim like experience for those who like it) 
 My issue was that after installing i did not know where to start. These 100+ packages must be worth learning right ? I expected a kind of interactive walkthrough like emacs&#x27;s own tutorial but ended up on the web documentation instead, which was also overwhelming.
 I wonder how people who have never used emacs/vim can get started easily on this. Do they use only 1% of the available features ? Is there a master tutorial somewhere that i missed ? 
 And for people who like tinkering/debugging with their config to have exactly what they want, i find it much easier on a minimalistic example than when 100+ plugins are involved.
 ** who are those distributions for ? *** I have the feeling that beginners would be better off with a simple config with discoverability improvements like which-key/helm
 And for seasoned user who like tinkering with the defaults, i find that building your config helps you understand how to use the plugin you&#x27;re using
 So fellow doom/space users, what made you jump on that train ? How did you get to &quot;master&quot; this complex environment ? 
 Cheers

                    <span>Hi,
 I recently discovered power of literate devops concept and for many cases it works great but I have problem with completion if I am connected to remote server over SSH (but not TRAMP but in Org babel session).
 E.g.:
 #+begin_src sh :session server ssh server1 #+end_src 
 C-c C-c to evaluate code block to establish SSH connection with server1 creates a shell buffer with the same name. Now C-x b, switch to that buffer in shell major mode and bash completion doesn&#x27;t work properly. It means if I want to cd /etc/ and the press TAB twice it doesn&#x27;t prompts content of /etc directory of my remote machine but my local. If I want correct completion of remote shell I have to use TRAMP session. Does anyone fix that problem and found workaround? Babel shell sessions are more comfortable for me.

                    <span>I think I have my terminology correct. I&#x27;m using Spacemacs but I don&#x27;t think that matters.
 When I invoke dired, helm wants to know which directory I want. It shows the current directory as a starting point. My question is how to edit this input. C-a takes me to the beginning of the line. C-S backspace clears the line, but how would I delete a word at a time? I&#x27;m currently backspacing a character at a time and that&#x27;s just annoying.

                    <span>Hi, I want to make two customizations to lsp-ui-imenu, when using python + pyright. First, running lsp-ui-imenu returns function names as well as all variables. I want it to return only function name so that I can jump to the top easily when using consult-imenu. I have looked into filtering this list in the source code but haven&#x27;t found how to do it. Second, is there a way for lsp-ui-imenu to show entries from the entire git-repo? It would be amazing if I could use this to jump between files, rather than having to first open the correct file then searching for the function name.
 Any help or pointers appreciated!

                    <span>Thought to write a post here before asking in the ivy github repo.
 I use ivy-switch-buffer bound to C-x b to switch to another buffer. Is it possible to assign numbers to the buffers so that pressing a number from the buffer list will automatically switch to that buffer? This will save a few keystrokes compared to moving up and down / fuzzy search for the buffer name and then press Enter.

I use Overleaf to write LaTeX documents online and even though I already selected in the menu of Overleaf to use Emacs keybindings, every time I press Ctrl+n Firefox or Chrome is opening a new browsing window, very annoying.
 Any workarounds on this?

                    <span>Ok, so, today I decided to learn abbrev. After wrestling a couple of minutes with the abbrev file because I&#x27;m using chemacs2, I finally defined an abbrev, and it worked. Well, kinda worked.
 It seems that if I type out the abbrev really quickly and press M-&#x27;, then it works, but inserts a dash after the needed expansion. If I type it out slowly, and then press M-&#x27;, it just places the dash after the thing that I need to expand. Then, if I quickly typed the thing and expanded it with M-&#x27;, I can expand it second time if I type it out and press C-x &#x27;. If I JUST type it out and press C-x &#x27;, nothing happens. I also tried doing it using hippie-expand, and it works, on the second time, printing &quot;Using try-expand-all-abbrevs&quot; in the echo area.
 I tried doing the same thing with completely clean emacs config (emacs -Q), and the results are the same. My version of emacs is 28.0.50. What am I doing wrong?

 It now works only with one private leaderboard, user ID and session ID must be set before running major mode.
 Things like global leaderboard, multiple private leaderboards, viewing tasks, fetching task inputs and posting results are planned.

                    <span>Hello, I have just started using lsp and i find it difficult to customize some aspects of it. One of it being lsp sideline, which quite annoyingly i cant force to hide from the buffer, but retain the option to still invoke the actions in the context of the curent symbol. 
 I wanted to disable the hideous wall of text next to the code that was showing actions and diagnostics, and simply use lsp-ui-sideline-apply-code-actions to see them in the minibuffer or a side display buffer/window. I was able to hide the text but not able to make list of available actions for a symbol show, with the config below, lsp-ui-sideline-apply-code-actions says - No code actions on the current line. While using lsp-execute-code-action shows the list of all actions not just the ones available for the symbol (in the context of the current symbol, while it works fine when lsp-ui-sideline-show-code-actions t) which is quite bad. I just can&#x27;t understand why there is no way to hide just the actions as text in the work buffer while retaining the ability to fetch the relevant actions on demand only. 
 lsp-ui-sideline-enable t lsp-ui-sideline-show-hover nil lsp-ui-sideline-show-symbol nil lsp-ui-sideline-show-diagnostics nil lsp-ui-sideline-show-code-actions nil

                    <span>I hear only good things about Rust from Haskell related social media places I follow, including this subreddit.
 I&#x27;ve been curious how Haskell devs write Rust code. Do they try to make Rust look &amp; feel more like Haskell by using certain libraries? How do they cope with lack of monads, type classes, HKTs and such?
 Edit Additional question(s): - How do you handle effects? The imperative way?

                    <span>I followed the discussion in a recent thread about people handling effects in Haskell. Many people seem to rely on a combination of some environment and IO, in one way or another (RIO, ReaderT env IO, IO + explicitly passing some environment, Handle Pattern, record-of-functions in the environment, ...).
 I am currently experimenting with a slightly different approach and I am quite happy with the results so far. More concretely, instead of combining an environment with IO, we can combine it with a continuation-based version of IO (aka ContT/Codensity/Managed) like ...
 newtype Program e a &#x3D; Program (e -&gt; forall b. (a -&gt; IO b) -&gt; IO b) 
 ... with instances for Applicative, Functor, Monad, MonadIO, etc. One can read the type as &quot;a program running with an environment of type e and producing a…</span>

                    <span>Say we have a recursive data structure where the sub-trees are labeled by some functor f :
 ​
 data Tree f a &#x3D; Leaf a | Branch (f (Tree f a)) (f (Tree f a))
 ​
 What&#x27;s the name of the transformation that lets us relabel the branches using information from the respective whole subtree? by &quot;information&quot; I mean a summary, e.g. the result of a fold, and the signature of this transformation would be something like
 ​

                    <span>I can&#x27;t quite work out how to get polymorphic Has* typeclasses working. I think I&#x27;m missing something obvious.
 Starting with a non-polymorphic version
 data Child &#x3D; Child { _cVal1 :: !Bool , _cVal2 :: !Text } data Parent &#x3D; Parent { _pChild :: !Child , _pX :: !Int } data Env &#x3D; Env { _eParent :: !Parent , _eName :: !Text } class HasParent a where getParent :: a -&gt; Parent instance HasParent Env where getParent &#x3D; _eParent runTest :: forall env m. (MonadIO m, MonadReader env m, HasParent env) &#x3D;&gt; m () runTest &#x3D; do p &lt;- asks getParent print $ _pX p 
 runReaderT runTest env works as expected
 But if want to make Child polymorphic (Child m) then I can&#x27;t seem to get the types correct. I get close with type families, but not quite there. 
 Here is the full polymorphic test

                    <span>To me, this seems like an oversight, as it means that many potential compile-time errors become runtime errors instead. What is the justification for it? Are there plans to make missing methods an error by default?

 As a backup, is there any way to disable preview for undefined commands (i.e. show the LaTeX code), instead of just showing a blank?

                    <span>Hello. I&#x27;ve posted this on r/functionalprogramming. In short: I&#x27;m not smart enough for Haskell, so I&#x27;m looking for other alternatives where immutability and pure functions are, if not mandatory, at least encouraged.
 In just a few days I hopped to Elm, Ocaml, back to Typescript and, finally, there and back again to Javascript(is programming-language hopping a thing?), after this book got me excited to give it a try. After reaching to chapter 8 with a certain hopelessness regarding (lack of) types, I ended up to this article with quite strong arguments against using JS if you want strong typing and functional proogramming facilities (&quot;Functional programming. Types. JavaScript. Pick two&quot;). The article mentioned PureScript and here I am. From Haskell syntax to strong typing, the language seems to have everything I&#x27;m looking for mentioned right at its home page.
 While learning Haskell, I liked pretty much almost everything. I really, really liked its syntax, the ways we can define types and type classes, its simplicity, and I think it was relatively easy to learn that. What got me really overburdened was how to &quot;change states&quot; and IO. From that point of view, is there something along the way that disapoint me?
 EDIT: this is being helpful: https://github.com/purescript/documentation/blob/master/language/Differences-from-Haskell.md

                    <span>Hi! I have the following, combining inline match and default argument:
 inline def func(myArg: (Int | String) &#x3D; 0) &#x3D; inline myArg match case i: Int &#x3D;&gt; () case s: String &#x3D;&gt; () 
 It works fine when called so that the default value is not used:
 // works fine func(1) 
 However, when the value is used, it fails to compile:
 // fails func() 
 with
 [error] |cannot reduce inline match with [error] | scrutinee: myArg$proxy1 : (myArg$proxy1 : (Int | String) @uncheckedVariance) [error] | patterns : case i @ _:Int [error] | case s @ _:String 
 Apparently the default value is a method that is not inlined. Is there a way around this?

 #+NAME:mypythoncode #+begin_src python :results value raw :output :return tabulate(df, headers&#x3D;df.columns, tablefmt&#x3D;&#x27;orgtbl&#x27;) import numpy as np import pandas as pd from tabulate import tabulate df &#x3D; pd.DataFrame(np.random.randint(0,10,size&#x3D;(10, 4)), columns&#x3D;list(&#x27;ABCD&#x27;)) #+end_src #+RESULTS: mypythoncode | | A | B | C | D | |---+---+---+---+---| | 0 | 0 | 9 | 6 | 0 | | 1 | 2 | 9 | 0 | 4 | | 2 | 9 | 6 | 0 | 1 | | 3 | 6 | 1 | 8 | 1 | | 4 | 4 | 2 | 1 | 4 | | 5 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 1 | | 6 | 4 | 8 | 9 | 0 | | 7 | 1 | 4 | 8 | 7 | | 8 | 9 | 3 | 2 | 5 | | 9 | 5 | 0 | 7 | 3 | #+NAME:lib-R #+HEADER: :var code&#x3D;mypythoncode #+begin_src R :results output library(ggplot2) library(dplyr) library(lubridate) str(code) #+end_src #+RESULTS: lib-R : chr &quot;| | A | B | C | D |\n|----+-----+-----+-----+-----|\n| 0 | 8 | 0 | 5 | 2 |\n| 1 | 2 | &quot;| __truncated__ 
 As you see, the org table is not recognized as a dataframe by R. 
 If i replace by a basic org table : 
 ​
 #+NAME: any_data | | parameter | value | |---+-----------+-------| | 0 | heats | 30 | | 1 | heats | 30 | #+NAME:lib-R #+HEADER: :var code&#x3D;any_data #+begin_src R :results output library(ggplot2) library(dplyr) library(lubridate) str(code) #+end_src #+RESULTS: lib-R : &#x27;data.frame&#x27;: 2 obs. of 3 variables: : $ X : int 0 1 : $ parameter: chr &quot;heats&quot; &quot;heats&quot; : $ value : int 30 30 
 That works...
 Any help appreciated to understand how i will resolve that ...

                    <span>Hello to everyone. I have a little problem, I have used Neovim Coc while learning Javascript and I want to know is if there is a way for lsp-mode to behave like Coc. For example, when typing the next in Neovim:
 button.addEventListener(&quot;click&quot;, (e) &#x3D;&gt; { alert(&quot;THIS IS A BUTTON!!!!&quot;); e.target.style.background &#x3D; &quot;blue&quot;; }); 
 If I ask for completion for e.target.... in Coc, I get style option and background, etc. When I want to do this in lsp-mode in Emacs, I don&#x27;t get any candidate.
 Another example is if I select an HTML element by putting their class or id:
 let test &#x3D; document.querySelector(&quot;.this-is-a-class&quot;);
 let test2 &#x3D; document.querySelector(&quot;#this-is-an-id&quot;);
 when I ask for property completion in Coc for test and test2, I get candidates corresponding to the HTML element. In lsp-mode I don&#x27;t get any of these.
 I don&#x27;t know if Coc works like this or if lsp-mode doesn&#x27;t have this feature. Sorry but English is not my first language.

                    <span>Hi, I just followed the install instructions
 nix-env -iA cachix -f https://cachix.org/api/v1/install cachix use emacs-osx nix-env -iA emacsOsxNative -f https://github.com/sagittaros/emacs-osx/archive/refs/tags/built.tar.gz 
 But the application frame is light and not using the system dark mode. Am I missing a flag or option? https://emacsformacos.com, railwaycat emacs-port and d12frosted/emacs-plus all support this.

                    <span>I&#x27;m trying to make a custom org-mode agenda view that shows not only all tasks in the waiting state, but also the message I entered when changing state. Relevant Lisp from init.el:
 (setq org-agenda-custom-commands &#x27;((&quot;c&quot; &quot;My custom agenda&quot; ((todo &quot;WAITING|HOLD&quot; ((org-agenda-overriding-header &quot;Waiting and postponed tasks&quot;) (org-agenda-sorting-strategy &#x27;(category-keep))))))) org-log-into-drawers &quot;LOGBOOK&quot; org-todo-keywords &#x27;((sequence &quot;TODO(t)&quot; &quot;WORK(w)&quot; &quot;|&quot; &quot;DONE(d)&quot;) (sequence &quot;HOLD(h@/!)&quot; &quot;WAITING(W@/!)&quot; &quot;|&quot; &quot;CANCELLED(c@/!)&quot;))) 
 Example snippet from job.org:
 * WAITING Replace failing 2TB drive in Wrath :LOGBOOK: - State &quot;WAITING&quot; from &quot;TODO&quot; [2021-11-30 Tue 13:33] \\ Spare parts ordered :END: 
 How it looks now:
 Waiting and postponed tasks job: WAITING Replace failing 2TB drive in Wrath 
 What I want:
 Waiting and postponed tasks job: WAITING Replace failing 2TB drive in Wrath Spare parts ordered 
 Anyone done anything similar before, or have any pointers for how I can achieve something similar?

                    <span>Is there any mobile (iPhone) tool I can use to edit org files, specifically for todos and using a git remote (github, gitlab, etc.)? I&#x27;d like to be able to add a couple of todos to my todo file and immediately have them version controlled. It doesn&#x27;t seem like there is a way to do this through the Github app, and the app only renders org docs as plain text anyways.

                    <span>Hey guys! So I killed my mid-2011 MBA yesterday (sigh..RIP), and had to replace it asap with another MBA, so I now have an M1 running Big Sur. Don&#x27;t get me started on all of the things I hate about this..BUT, one of the things I am disliking intensely the most is that I can no longer just type &quot;emacs filename&quot; at the command line, and invoke plain old non-GUI emacs. I&#x27;ve installed the GUI emacs from emacsformacsosx, and I have an alias so I can invoke it by typing &quot;emacs filename&quot;, but of course it still invokes the efmo GUI version. I&#x27;m competent enough to sudo and follow clear step-by-step instructions (yeah, I&#x27;m one of those users that every sysadmin dreads..I know *just* enough to f everything up), but everything I&#x27;ve found assumes that you already have &#x27;brew&#x27; or some other one (I forget the name)...and that&#x27;s where I&#x27;m stymied. Does anybody have pointers to step-by-step directions for getting regular emacs back on my computer? (There are a lot of sites that say &quot;emacs comes already installed but it&#x27;s not the best version&quot; but if that is true for Big Sur out of the box, for the life of me I can&#x27;t find it (lots of files with emacs in the name do turn up when I do a &#x27;locate&#x27; but none that seem to be actually executable).
 Thank you in advance!
 Annie

                    <span>Hi!
 First post here, long time emacs user, I hope I understood the rules correctly.
 I&#x27;m trying to use pkcs11 client authentication from within emacs (the new way if possible, i.e. without disabling the internal gnutls support).
 On the command line it&#x27;s possible to use client certificates from a hardware token via e.g --provider /usr/lib64/libeTPkcs11.so and by passing the appropriate strings for --x509certfile&#x3D; and --x509keyfile (obtained via p11tool).
 From https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/auth.html#Help-for-users I gather that it should be possible to set those strings in ~/.authinfo.gpg but I guess the only thing that&#x27;s missing would be the --provider switch. Any idea how to add that one?
 Thanks in advance for any kind of suggestion!

                    <span>Hi! I&#x27;ve been using emacs doom for 2 years coming from spacemacs, the only thing I&#x27;m missing from spacemacs is the SPC K R shortcut to access the kill-ring. The kill ring allows to access all killed strings of character like a clipboard which is very useful. Can you help me to achieve this on doom?
 EDITED: fixed the keybinding and add a quick description.

                    <span>I&#x27;m using vterm a lot, and really like entering vterm-copy-mode. However, sometimes (I haven&#x27;t figured out under what circumstances) the following sequence of commands leads to weird behavior:
  
I enter copy mode
 
select a word in the middle of a line using the normal emacs commands
 
yank that word
 
exit copy mode
 
paste that word
 
 For instance, I use ps to enumerate processes, select a process ID using copy mode, then try to kill $my-selected-id.
 What happens is the whole line is pasted instead of the single word.
 Anyone experienced this and has a way to fix this?

But how do I submit my comments to GitHub. I have tried a number of M-x calls but non of them is working for me. How do I submit my comment replies? I really like the package by the way, It&#x27;s great to be able to do code reviews from inside Emacs.

                    <span>Hey guys. I made an ilambda tutorial, which I demo&#x27;d at emacsconf. You just need an OpenAI key to try this out, for which there is no waitlist.
 You can run it without the full bloat of pen.el. I&#x27;m going to try to put this into melpa soon!
 This is what I&#x27;ve spent the last day on. This is a library that lets you interface with language models through programming. It separates the peas and carrots of real and imaginary, through lisp function and macro syntax.

                    <span>im using doom emacs and dired. i dont like how new buffer is open when selecting a folder. i want to use tab to show subtree. i have found this:
 (use-package dired-subtree :ensure t :after dired :bind (:map dired-mode-map (&quot;TAB&quot; . dired-subtree-toggle))) 
 i know doom doesnt use use-package, how to do this?

                    <span>I&#x27;m running EMACS in a git bash window (intentionally, so I have access to the mingw tools &amp; ecosystem), but I frequently encounter crashes. I would say it could happen up to 3 times in a 2 hour coding session.
 Mostly I develop using Common Lips connected through SLIME -- but I&#x27;m not sure if the crash is related to this.
 Has anyone else here encountered this? Any tips for debugging next time this happens?

                    <span>Hello! So I&#x27;ve been interested in Haskell for quite a while now: I know how to use monads, transformers, some type level programming too... However I have no idea when to use these. For example, I once wrote a twitch chat bot in Haskell. How do I decide whether to do sendMsg :: TwitchBot -&gt; Text -&gt; IO () Or sendMsg :: Text -&gt; TwitchBotM () ? The latter seemed tempting, but in practice I rarely chained anything, and I mostly worked in MonadIO, so it just bloated the code as I had to do runTwitchBotM twitchBot (...) everywhere.
 How can I learn to make these kinds of decisions beforehand?
 Thanks :)

                    <span>We have a microservices architecture where each service is in its own git repo. We&#x27;d like each git repo to use the same hlint.yaml. We could use submodules, subrepos, etc. But it would be simpler for us if we could point hlint to a link like so
 # .hlint.yaml https://github.com/OurCompany/hlint/hlint.yaml 
 But assuming that&#x27;s not possible, how have you solved this problem? Should we just use subrepo or submodules?

                    <span>Hey, long time lurker here. I already tried to solve last years advent of code in Haskell, but struggled a bit with the tooling (Mostly a me-problem, but I didn&#x27;t have the time to both solve the AoC problems and learn enough about stack to solve my problems).
 Now, for rust, there is cargo-aoc which minimizes friction to a great extend.
 Is there something similar for Haskell available, too? Or at least a decent project template where I can focus on solving the tasks without fighting the tooling?
 EDIT: Searching for one brought up this thread, but one of them is down and I can&#x27;t judge the quality of the other one in there.

                    <span>I am fairly new to org-mode publishing and am trying to move the table of contents from the top to after an abstract statement. My approach is to initialize the file with #+OPTIONS: toc:nil... (among other settings) and then later define #+TOC: headlines 2 where I want the table of contents to appear.
 My problem is that with the above approach, I get two tables of contents - one at the beginning of the file and another where I declared the #+TOC:... Is there something else in org-mode with precedence over the #+OPTIONS: statement? Is there a way to &quot;force&quot; the suppression of the top-of-file toc?

                    <span>Where I work, we use a lot of Markdown and Confluence pages for documentation. I have wanted to introduce org-mode, but am always met with some (justified) resistance. We&#x27;re talking about introducing a programming editor to mid-senior level programmers. That is a very tough sell. I&#x27;ve been keeping my eyes open for possible alternatives, like org-mode for VS Code and org-mode for Vim. I think this presentation given at the Emacs Conference a couple of days ago captures the &quot;spirit&quot; of what would be needed to get others who insist on using the &quot;lesser editors&quot; to use org-mode. https://emacsconf.org/2021/talks/org-outside/

                    <span>I&#x27;d like to work more in Scala. It&#x27;s pretty close to the ideal language for me to use. However, I&#x27;ve been struggling to find a setup that &#x27;just works&#x27;, especially in Scala 3. 
 I&#x27;d like to hear what does work for people, so I could get a nudge in the right direction. I&#x27;m sorry if I should just &#x27;read the docs&#x27;, but I&#x27;ve been scratching my head for a while, so I could use some tips.
 Any input is appreciated!

                    <span>I&#x27;m not a coder, but I&#x27;d like to able to &quot;comment out&quot; sections of a file (like a part of a video script I decided not to use but don&#x27;t want to delete).
I see that I can open with !-- and close with -- in The Archive. I read somewhere that sometimes markdown wants three dashes at the beginning. What say you?
If I want to comment out a paragraph, is this a good way to do it?
!-- THIS PART SUCKS
EDIT: I had to remove the &quot;&quot; because it commented out most of my post 😂</span>

                    <span>This bug occurs with v1.7.5 Beta (2021-11-17)
I&#x27;m restarting a writing project and using the symbol ✔︎ as an indicator for completing a section of the outline.
The ✔︎ symbol is placed in a note, then the editor is switched to a different zettel, and the symbol disappears until some edit is made. Weird and hard to isolate and reproduce. 

Here is a better example but a little different.  When I add a checkmark (any edit will invoke this behavior), all the others disappear until the editor&#x27;s focus is refreshed by looking at a different zettel. If an edit is made to the line with the invisible checkmark, the checkmark on that line only will reappear.</span>

                    <span>Some time ago I was looking for an s-expression to latex converter library to write latex equations in lisp and have them appear seamlessly in src blocks in org mode.
 I did not really find was I was looking for so I did this while watching the conference this weekend ;)
 Maybe this is useful for someone else too, plus I&#x27;d appreciate comments. I&#x27;m still figuring out how I really want it to be like and to use it, but it should be ready to go for most purposes.

 PS: I&#x27;m still writing documentation and so on, maybe go ahead and look at the examples

                    <span>Hi guys, I&#x27;m new to emacs, and am an ex-vimmer. I used to use doom emacs, but I now have decided to use vanilla emacs (gccemacs 28). I have almost everything setup, with lsp. Evil is giving me slight problems. My problem is that for certain minor modes like view-mode, I can&#x27;t use my space bar as the leader key anymore, since it is remapped by view-mode to scroll. I also can&#x27;t use my space bar in dired. The major info mode also doesn&#x27;t integrate very well with evil. If someone could tell me a solution or share their configs, that would be great ! :)

                    <span>Hello everyone!
 Often i see navigation pattern similar to following:
  
- Word/Line movement (backward-word, forward-word, move-beginning-of-line, move-end-of-line) 
 - Bigger Jumps (isearch-forward, isearch-backward, ace-jump-mode, avy-goto-char-timer) 
 - Fine-tuning (previous-line, next-line, left-char, right-char)
  
Does this also apply for org-mode or are you using more org orientated commands like org-shifttab (S-TAB), org-next-visible-heading (C-c C-n), etc to move around?

                    <span>I personally wish emacs had native treesitter, lsp, and dap support as well as better graphical abilities. The editing lag (doom) is also much worse than my neovim config, especially as files grow. 
 What do you think emacs needs to stay competent?

 EMSAllure SVG font rendered in Gerber format
 Do you want fancy fonts on your PCB silkscreen? You can use a Hershey font or stroke font in SVG format to achieve the desired result. A small collection of these fonts are available at https://gitlab.com/oskay/svg-fonts .

 Hi, I&#x27;ve recently been red pilled into Linux and currently am running Fedora.
 I find navigating my computer via a &#x27;Terminal&#x27; (if that&#x27;s the correct terminology) to be the ultimate way to use a computer for my use case of simplicity and productivity.
 Being new to Linux, how would I go about having a similar &#x27;setup&#x27; as shown in this video, being able to navigate my computer via this &#x27;terminal&#x27; with a file directory and have multiple windows etc?
 (I&#x27;ve found I&#x27;ll like to settle on using emacs if that helps/is relevant)
 Thank-you in advance

                    <span>So, I&#x27;m new to emacs but longtime vim user. I wanted to see what all the rage is about -- the only thing stopping me from using emacs is well.. I have nooooooooo idea where to start...
 I want setup emacs to do the same thing my vim does or close:
  
Have typescript/javascript support
 Have HTML, CSS, SCSS etc support - I think this is webmode?
 Fuzzy finder
 Indent guides
 Sexy colorschemes :) (non-negotiable lol)
 I prefer to work in the terminal so if I can get icon support in terminal that would amazing. I know this is possible... if vim can do it then emacs can.
 Vim keybinds.. again, non-negotiable.
  
I feel like this might be a bit too much lol.. but primarily would like to have really solid support for web development.

                    <span>Hello! I recently hopped to Arch from Ubuntu. I was using mu4e and I had a working configuration, but I can&#x27;t make it work on Arch. It&#x27;s strange because it almost works, until it doesn&#x27;t. Offlineimap works fine pulling down all my email from 3 accounts, my .emacs config loads without any erros, everything seems ok up to the point where I see &quot;[mu4e] Select context: (list my 3 contexts)&quot;, but when I do it just does nothing. It doesn&#x27;t throw an error. Just stays in the buffer I was. C-x C-b doesn&#x27;t list mu4e. I have no idea where I should start in terms of troubleshooting. I would appreciate any thoughts.

For all his faults, RMS has given us something very, VERY special and I for one will be forever grateful to him and the community. Yeah, I know this post is a bit of a slap on the back, but hey... we deserve it. Emacs and Emacs users rock! Happy Christmas everone!

                    <span>This is a bug fix release for two regressions found after releasing 1.5.0:
 ​
 - [#2365](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/issue/2365): hs-boot files not handled correctly, discovered in the ghc codebase and fixed with [#2377](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/pull/2377)
 - [#2379](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/issue/2379): &#x60;tried to look at linkable for GetModIfaceWithoutLinkable for NormalizedFilePath...&#x60; error handling template haskell, fixed with [#2380](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/pull/2380)
 ​
 Both quick fixes thanks to u/pepeiborra
 ​
 Also it fixes some long standing bugs in the hlint plugin due to comments being ignored (see [#2366](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/pull/2366))

                    <span>I started a thread on Twitter asking people how do they handle effects (IO, RIO, mtl, free, polysemy, etc..?) in their industrial codebases: https://twitter.com/availablegreen/status/1465295477071622148.
 Would be happy if r/haskell could contribute as well — preferably in the Twitter thread, but comments here would also work.
 Thanks!

                    <span>I am currently trying to implement surreal numbers (using Conways definition) in Haskell.For this, I would like to filter a data type to create a new type.e.G. I have defined some data that can be filtereddata Raw &#x3D; ...isValid :: Raw -&gt; Bool
 and I would like to produce a new type consisting of x :: Raw such that isValid x &#x3D;&#x3D; True .
 My current method has the unfiltered type where I need to function isValid to recurse through the object instead of having it neatly inside the data definiton.
 module Surreal where
 -- unlike Conways definition, the arguments may be invalid Numbers
 -- use isValid to recurse through arguments
 data Number &#x3D; Pair [Number] [Number]
 deriving (Show,Eq)
 -- Examples of Numbers
 zero &#x3D; Pair [] []
 one &#x3D; Pair [zero] []
 minusone &#x3D; Pair [] [zero]
 star &#x3D; Pair [zero] [zero]
 -- x &#x3D; (l1,r1) &gt;&#x3D; y &#x3D; (l2,r2) if
 -- ! exists r in r1 : r  Number -&gt; Bool
 geq (Pair l1 r1) (Pair l2 r2) &#x3D; (first ++ second &#x3D;&#x3D; [])
 where
 first &#x3D; [ r | r  Number -&gt; Bool
 leq x y &#x3D; geq y x
 -- x &#x3D; (l,r) is valid if
 -- ! exists s in l, t in r : s &gt;&#x3D; t
 isValid&#x27; (Pair l r) &#x3D; (invalids &#x3D;&#x3D; [])
 where
 invalids &#x3D; [(s,t) | s &lt;- l, t &lt;- r, geq s t]
 -- to ensure that the subobjects are valid themselves
 isValid (Pair l r) &#x3D; isValid&#x27; (Pair l r) &amp;&amp; foldr1 (&amp;&amp;) childrenValid
 where
 childrenValid &#x3D; map isValid (l ++ r)

                    <span>For example, suppose we had a relation on records where A ≤ B exactly when B has all the fields that A has and possibly some extra fields. That is to say, let the relation on records be induced by the subset relation on the sets of field labels.
 Example:
 data A &#x3D; A {x, y: Int} data B &#x3D; B {x, y, z: Int} 
 Here, B has an extra field z, so we are justified in saying that A ≤ B.
 Now:
  
A function that takes A can also take B (and ignore all the extra fields).
 In other words, if f ∷ A → Y and b ∷ B, then f b ∷ Y is well-typed.
 
A function that gives B can also give A (and forget all the extra fields).
 In other words, if f ∷ X → B and x ∷ X, then f x ∷ B is well-typed.
 
 This can currently be done by writing boring code, so having it as a feature would reduce the amount of boring code, which is good. In real life, records tend to be big, so the reduction is substantial.
 A dual construction can be offered for sum types: for example, a function that can take A + B can handle an A or a B as well.
 Is this less than ideal? What are the problems? In a dream world of infinite possibilities, where you can add subtyping to Haskell, how would you go about it?
  
I imagine there are some people here that know everything there is to know about type systems, some people that have no idea of what a type system with subtyping looks like (me — I only know C and Haskell), and many people somewhere in between. So hopefully this conversation can be a common ground. I realize that the presentation above is already too technical for some and unbearably naïve to others. Please ask questions, and please correct my errors, thank you!

                    <span>I felt like telling my experiences of using org-mode for school as a new emacs user.
 So to begin, I am a long-time vim user, but not a power user. I used vim to edit smaller files (like config files, etc.). I primarily used a graphical IDE for my &quot;real&quot; work (JetBrains tools specifically). After watching some videos on emacs (shout-out DistroTube), I decided to give emacs a try. I went for doom emacs since it seemed to be the most popular, and it had vim-like keybindings (evil mode). Once I learned the basics of org-mode, I decided that this would be amazing for taking notes in class. 
 After a few weeks of taking notes in class, I am very happy with org-mode for taking notes. I really like the customizability of emacs (not org-mode specifically). 
 Some of the features I use the most are:
  
Inserting LaTeX snippets for complex math/comp. sci notes.
 Folding headers to keep my notes clean
 Adding TODO tags (with org agenda) to log assignments/exams
 Exporting org files to other formats (especially HTML) to share with classmates
  
What other features do you guys like to use for this purpose? And is there any feedback you can give me to make my experience even better?

                    <span>Hello everyone!
 Often i see navigation pattern similar to following:
  
- Word/Line movement (backward-word, forward-word, move-beginning-of-line, move-end-of-line) 
 - Bigger Jumps (isearch-forward, isearch-backward, ace-jump-mode, avy-goto-char-timer) 
 - Fine-tuning (previous-line, next-line, left-char, right-char)
  
Does this also apply for org-mode or are you using more org orientated commands like org-shifttab (S-TAB), org-next-visible-heading (C-c C-n), etc to move around?

                    <span>I tried to post this as a comment but it wouldn&#x27;t let me post screenshots.
 The local Scala 3.0 REPL does have a command line option for no colors. It only applies for the ensuing session.
 In a few cases, the colors do really help things pop, like for example, error messages:
 More \&quot;arrows\&quot; make it easier to spot the mistake.
 It also does make tab completion a little more obvious:
 https://preview.redd.it/0h2h3egg0l281.png?width&#x3D;364&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;a6e88766d297a9cbdf7eeec7fa5e4e0fc7a25d8e
 Still, it&#x27;s good to know I can turn the colors off if I think they&#x27;ll be too distracting for a particular session.
 As for the thing with val and var, it seems to depend only on how you declared that particular item, without regard for whether the class itself is mutable or immutable.

                    <span>Hi Org-mode community,
 At this year&#x27;s EmascsConf, I had a 12 minute video where I explain why we do need a different name for the syntax of Org-mode in contrast to the Elisp implementation of GNU/Emacs Org-mode.
 I would like you to read my rationale and motivate you to use the term &quot;Orgdown&quot; for the syntax and &quot;Orgdown1&quot; for the first (very basic) level of Orgdown syntax elements.

                    <span>Right, some help here.
 I&#x27;m getting the annoying org-mode migration notice, and 5 second delay that other people are experiencing. 
 All the solutions in that thread appear to boil down to: delete org from .emacs.d/elpa, and install it from elpa next time.
 But I don&#x27;t have a &quot;org&quot;, or a &quot;org-contrib&quot;. I have &quot;org-plus-contrib&quot;, but that seems to only be available from Org&#x27;s ELPA?
 Here&#x27;s my init.el (yes, it&#x27;s awful and brittle), I don&#x27;t know what would be the pain point. To aid, here&#x27;s a tree of the directory.

                    <span>Many have suggested adding a lambda reader construct to Emacs Lisp: something like #(princ $1), which would be translated to (lambda (x) (princ x)).
 Well, it turns out that you can (ab)use the existing reader constructs for this purpose. Specifically, ,x and ,@x are translated to (\, x) and (\,@ x), which are without meaning outside of a backquoted list.
 That means that it is legal to define and use \, as a function or macro:
 (defmacro \, (body) &quot;Return an anonymous function. In BODY, symbols of the type $N, where N is a non-zero, positive number, represent positional arguments. $* represents a list of optional remaining arguments. ,(+ $1 $2) expands to (lambda ($1 $2) (+ $1 $2)). See &#x60;lambda&#x27;.&quot; (let ((total 0) rest) (cl-labels ((search (form) (if (consp form) (progn (search (car form)) (search (cdr form))) (if (eq form &#x27;$*) (setq rest t) (let ((s (prin1-to-string form))) (if (string-match &quot;^\\$\\([1-9][0-9]*\\)$&quot; s) (let ((n (string-to-number (match-string 1 s)))) (setq total (max total n))))))))) (search body)) &#x60;(lambda ,(append (cl-loop for n from 1 upto total collect (intern (format &quot;$%d&quot; n))) (and rest &#x27;(&amp;rest $*))) ,body))) 
 With this macro, you can replace
 (mapcar (lambda (x) (with-output-to-string (princ x))) objects) 
 with
 (mapcar ,(with-output-to-string (princ $1)) objects) 
 If you want your lambda to accept an unlimited number of arguments, use &#x60;$*&#x27;:
 (advice-add &#x27;some-function :before ,(dolist (x $*) (message &quot;%s&quot; x))) 
 What are the downsides? Strictly, there is only one. The docstring for the macro above will not be displayed in Emacs&#x27; help system, which will always display the built-in information about ,.

                    <span>Hi, you wonderful Emacs users, I am struggling to get my org-latex-preview works on my windows box. It worked perfectly on Linux, but no success yet on Windows. Here is my configuration:
 (org-latex-create-formula-image-program &#x27;dvipng)
 (org-preview-latex-image-directory (concat temporary-file-directory &quot;ltximg/&quot;))
 On Windows, I have MikTex installed and they are in the PATH, I got this error message when I tried to use org-latex-preview though
 c:/Users/my-user-name/AppData/Local/Temp/orgtexD2Xyuq.div wasn&#x27;t produced. Please adjust dvipng part of &#x60;org-preview-latex-process-alist&#x60;. And I just check, orgtexD2Xyuq.div indeed not produced, the orgtexD2Xyuq.tex was produced under the temp folder.
 Anyone experienced the same before?

                    <span>Hello all,
 I just discovered this sub, and have no Emacs experience. I hope my question makes sense. 
 I regularly use remote Debian machines at work, interacting exclusively via SSH sessions. I was curious about using Emacspeak on them, as I’m visually impaired. Everything I’m reading is about setting up Emacspeak locally, though. I’ve found mention of a remote speech server, but haven’t found any guides on exactly how to get it to work. I use Windows as my primary OS at work. 
 In summary, my usual workflow is: on Windows, SSH into Debian, and use a Windows screen reader to interact with the remote machine that way. If I can, I’d like to have Emacspeak running on the remote machine, with speech and sound output coming from my local Windows computer. The lag may make this unusable, I don’t know. I’d at least like to give it a shot, just to see what happens. Again, I’ve also never used Emacs in any way. I’m comfortable in Bash, though. Thanks for any suggestions.

                    <span>I have tried basic keymapping hackery on vanilla emacs and ergo-mode. Seems that C-x is used in half the keybindings - remapping them all ain&#x27;t possible. Ergo-mode uses M-x. Frankly I&#x27;d rather deal with vanilla emacs than try to understand the &#x27;magic&#x27; in ergo-mode. 
 So am I right? We have to disavow C-x for cut and C-c for paste? - My daughter says it won&#x27;t take too long to relearn. Is she right?

                    <span>In every other text editor I&#x27;ve used, I&#x27;ve never had to think about indents. In emacs, on the other hand, it is a constant battle. For example, right now i&#x27;m editing a solidity file with a two space indent, emacs of course tries to ident to four spaces, and i have no idea how to change this. This is always made even worse by electric ident mode&#x27;s insane &quot;reindent the current line when you press enter&quot; behavior - I literally cannot imagine thinking that was a good idea.

 Why is emacs so shitty?

                    <span>I am trying to set up pylsp and have a key shortcut to create dedicated shells in python. The code for the dedicated shell looks like this:
 (defun my-python-start-or-switch-repl (&amp;optional msg) &quot;Start and/or switch to the REPL.&quot; (interactive &quot;p&quot;) (if (python-shell-get-process) (python-shell-switch-to-shell) (progn (run-python (python-shell-calculate-command) t t) (python-shell-switch-to-shell) ) ) ) 
 The code that binds the key to that is
 (add-hook &#x27;python-mode-hook (lambda () (define-key python-mode-map (kbd &quot;C-c !&quot;) &#x27;my-python-start-or-switch-repl)) ) 
 which I got all from here 
 The code to setup pylsp I got it from this video (29:51) and he also shares his github page and it looks like this (1):
 (use-package python-mode :ensure t :hook (python-mode . lsp-deferred) :custom (python-shell-interpreter &quot;python&quot;)) 
 It all works nicely: I get autocomplete and the other features and can run C-c ! to have dedicated shells. However, once I close emacs with M-x kill-emacs and open it again, and then I run C-c ! to have the dedicated shell I get the error: Symbol&#x27;s function definition is void: python-shell-get-process 
 I tested not defining (1) and just the code that gives the dedicated shells and it does not have that behavior, namely, I can close emacs, open it again and the dedicated shells can still be launched with C-c ! . That tells me, the problem is generated when I introduce (1), but I am not sure why and more importantly how to fix it. I&#x27;d appreciate any help.

 Is this correct? is this trailing comma normal, or something in my OS is misconfigured.

                    <span>I&#x27;m wanting to create a monad transformer using the mtl way. What do I need to derive in order to access getInputLine :: a Function of the inputT monad. It isn&#x27;t MonadInput.
 type Mon a &#x3D; StateT Int (InputT IO) a
 newtype MyMon a &#x3D; Mymon {unMon :: Mon a}

 Jet is a structural editor for JSON.
 That is, it&#x27;s an editor which is aware of the structure of JSON and allows you to manipulate it directly. As a result, the document is always in a valid state. 
 $ cabal update &amp;&amp; cabal install jet $ jet my.json 
 Hit &#x27;?&#x27; for the key bindings. Maybe back up any important files first. 
 Give it a go and let me know what you think https://github.com/ChrisPenner/jet
 ​
 The implementation uses a zipper over a Cofree tree, which should be pretty adaptable to most recursive structures (e.g. ASTs). You can find the Cofree Zipper here: https://github.com/ChrisPenner/recursive-zipper#readme
 ​
 To head off the &quot;just use a text-editor&quot; comments; yes, you should probably just use a text editor. This was mainly written as a research exercise for more complex structural editors, and also because I couldn&#x27;t find many good resources on writing structural editors and wanted to see what the abstractions might look like. Hopefully you enjoy the experiment as much as I enjoyed writing it 😄
 ​
 Cheers!

                    <span>I have two questions one involves type inference and the other involves reflection.
  
1. Template Haskell vs type inference
 I&#x27;m using refinement types from the refined library and template haskell refinement refineTH. For example I have these following definitions, the unrefined type: 
 data UnrefinedStandardCurveDef a &#x3D; UnrefinedStandardCurveDef { prime_s :: a, aCoeff_s :: a, bCoeff_s :: a, generator_s :: (a, a), order_s :: NN.Integer, cofactor_s :: NN.Integer } deriving Lift 
 the refinement types:
 data StandardCurveDefValidator instance (Typeable a, Integral a) &#x3D;&gt; Predicate StandardCurveDefValidator (UnrefinedStandardCurveDef a) where validate pred def &#x3D; ... type RefinedStandardCurveDef&#x27; a &#x3D; Refined StandardCurveDefValidator (UnrefinedStandardCurveDef a) newtype RefinedStandardCurveD…</span>

                    <span>Hello, I come here to ask for help after about 8 frustrating hours trying to solve this exercise, so please help me figure this out.
 I am trying to recursively look in a list of pairs where one element of the pair is a product and the second element is 2 numbers representing its position on the shelves [ (meat,(4,5)) , (soap,(6,7)) , (wine,(4.3)) ] and verify if in any situation I end up with 2 products on the same spot on the shelf.
 ​
 Basically I dont care what the product is, my only concern is that 2 things dont end up trying to be restocked on the same position on the shelves.
 ​
 I have the shelves and the products set has data types so for example I know that Products can only be Milk, Wine, Soap, Eggs, Butter....like 10 more, and That ShelfPos is (Int,Int).
 ​
 What I have been trying to do is has requested on the exercise.
 ​
 positionIsFree :: [(Products, ShelfPos)] -&gt; Bool
 ​
 positionIsFree [ ] &#x3D; True
 positionIsFree (( products, shelfpos) : [ ] ) &#x3D; True
 positionIsFree (( p, (x,y)) : ( p2, (x2,y2)) : t) | x &#x3D;&#x3D; x2 &amp;&amp; y &#x3D;&#x3D; y2 &#x3D; False
 --------(reddit formating is hard)---------------| otherwise &#x3D; positionIsFree ((p, (x,y)) : t )
 ​
 This works for the first pair, it runs the list and sees if it causes any conflict. If it doesnt Id like to restart the process with the second pair. The problem I am runing in is whenever I finish doing this I cant restart again since I trew away all my list on the otherwise step.
 I tried to do this backwards, like always comparing the last element, but I end up runing into a types problem where it says it expects a Bool and is getting a list.
 ​
 Thank you for your time reading this.

                    <span>I am quite new to Emacs and orgmode.
 When I use org-insert-link I am asked for a link and a description. I want to past the link or the description in there from my clipboard because I simply copied the URL from my browser window.
 But how can I do that? By default I use evil-mode. But the evil keybindings not working in that org-insert-link buffer. What would be a good and emacsoid solution here?

                    <span>Hello! Can anyone recommend research paper websites like pubmed but just for computer science? (I am mostly interested in functional programming in Scala, but I guess a general computer science database is good enough). I already know Google Scholar, but I am looking for the official ones.

                    <span>I like programing in scala and I am the guy who wants to become an expert in scala even if I am not this moment. Since my job has been related to data I have started getting a focus to machine learning. Of course I know python is epic but I also know scala can do this like python. I found out spark and smile are good libraries for big data and machine learning, but I couldn&#x27;t find proper libraries for data visualization. Yeap. smile has good visualization libraries based on swing and vega lite. At this moment I wonder other scala programmers how to work and which library you like. Is it impossible for scala to overcome python in this fields?

                    <span>Currently I use prettify-symbol-mode to replace TODO, DONE and some other key words in org modes with symbols from all-the-icons.
 This way has some limitations, like it allows the symbols are one-character. For some key words like BEGIN_SRC and END_SRC, I want a line so that the SRC block is singled out. 
 The package https://github.com/rougier/svg-lib can generate good svg icons. Is there a way to use those svg icons to replace the key words? Or there is some performance issue and it is not recommended?
 Thank you.

                    <span>Hello all!
 I cut a new release in Code Review including basic Gitlab support, a table with feature parity between Github and Gitlab is available here. I am not a Gitlab user myself therefore I appreciate all the feedback from actual users on how we can improve this going forward.
 This first week I received good feedbacks on features and was able to deliver some bug fixes, thanks for all the reporters.
 More details in the CHANGELOG.

 Next, bitbucket...

 I see the function dired-other-window, but this opens dired in a horizontal split (dired window below open file). I suspect this has to do with these two variables:
 (setq split-height-threshold 0)
 (setq split-width-threshold nil)
 I can&#x27;t for the life of me understand how these work. C-h v on either variable is just unparseable to my simple mind.

 When i use vterm for docker build (or yarn build) vterm can correct handle animation inside stdout (by removing previous symbols and insert a new one). But when i run &#x60;dockerfile-build-buffer&#x60; or precommit hook inside magit i see a lot of new lines and symbols
 (only time should be changed, but i see new output)
 dockerfile-build-buffer
 Same build inside vterm

 I tried to figure out if it possible to redirect this output to the vterm handler, but i without any luck. Its not a big deal, but its a bit annoying

                    <span>Hello
 I&#x27;ve been using ncmpcpp and mpd for a while now after I figured out how to configure them (i even wrote a blogpost about it), but since I am always in emacs I find inconvenient to have to always quit emacs to control my music. so I am looking for an mpd client on emacs.
 now there are a few solutions that come to mind:
  
use vterm and open ncmpcpp from that: too much work + vterm is slower than a regular terminal
 use the mpc client that comes with emacs : the mpc client is sooo bad there doesnt seem to be a way to even stop the music (I am talking about the mpc gui inside of emacs, not the seperate commands like mpc-stop, mpc-pause etc..)
 use something else entriely like emms: emms is too slow and I generally want to stay within mpd 
  
so what I want is, an mpd client that has a usubl interface and that is made specifically for emacs (i.e not running from vterm or something else) and just to clarify I don&#x27;t want a 1 to 1 clone, I just want something that works.
 thanks in advance

                    <span>Hello,I have been using Emacs on Windows for a while, and I really liked the audible bell effect (when you press C-g, or when you press undefined keys / unknown commands).Recently, I switched to GNU/Linux (Debian 11 to be exact) and installed Emacs there (I have not included my customization yet, it is a fresh install), but there was no sound at all, even though the system has no problems playing sounds in other applications.
 visible-bell is nil, beep does not produce sound, play-sound does not work.
 I also tested Emacs on Ubuntu 20.04, NixOS 21.05 and Debian 11 in a VM. The Emacs on the Ubuntu machine worked perfectly, but Emacs on the NixOS and Debian 11 machines did not have sound.
 On all 3 machines, lspci | grep -i audio gives the same output:
 00:1b.0 Audio device: Intel Corporation 82801I (ICH9 Family) HD Audio Controller (rev 03) 
 Also, aplay -l gives the same output:
 **** List of PLAYBACK Hardware Devices **** card 0: Intel [HDA Intel], device 0: Generic Analog [Generic Analog] Subdevices: 1/1 Subdevice #0: subdevice #0 
 Just like the host machine, other applications&#x27; sound works fine on all 3 VMs, it is just Emacs without sound, so I don&#x27;t really think it is a driver issue that only Ubuntu solved (but this is just my guess, I could be wrong). 
 I did not find this issue online, have you encountered this problem before? The closest thing I found was this post but I don&#x27;t think it is applicable to my case.
 What can I do? Thanks for any info you can provide!

                    <span>I&#x27;d like to use ffap (to open files/dirs) in windows I select with ace-window (https://github.com/abo-abo/ace-window). Similar to what aw-switch-buffer-in-window and aw-switch-buffer-other-window do, but with find-file-at-point instead of buffer selection. Crucially, point means point when the function is called.
 I made a minor modification to ffap-other-window and it works:
  (defun my-ffap-ace-window (filename) &quot;Like &#x60;ffap-other-window&#x27;, window selected via ace window.&quot; (interactive (list (ffap-prompter nil &quot; other window&quot;))) (pcase (save-window-excursion (find-file-at-point filename)) ((or (and (pred bufferp) b) &#x60;(,(and (pred bufferp) b) . ,_)) (ace-select-window) (switch-to-buffer b) ))) 
 However, this function first does the ffap selection and then asks for the window. For consistency with the other ace- and aw- functions I&#x27;d like it to first select the window and then do the ffap thing.
 I&#x27;ve tried hacking this with several approaches (saving excursion first, then selecting the window with aw-select and then finding the file; trying to modify this find-file-ace-window, https://stackoverflow.com/a/47624310 , which makes dired&#x27;s open in other window use ace-window; modifying aw-switch-buffer-other-window) but my elisp ignorance is getting me nowhere.
 Is this easily doable?

                    <span>To start with, I&#x27;ve done a bit of looking around and have found a bunch of places where similar questions have been asked (namely here, here, and here) and I still have not found a solution for this. Yes I&#x27;m using evil.
 ​
 TL;DR...
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 I would like to emulate vim&#x27;s relative line numbers where with folded text the line numbers don&#x27;t skip numbers (as is the case in visual line numbers), word wrapping doesn&#x27;t create &quot;fake&quot; line numbers for the wrapped text (as is the case with relative/normal line numbers), and the numbers for lines are presented in a relative manner where your current line number is shown on the current line and the numbers count up from one both above and below the…</span>

                    <span>I am new to Emacs and I am running it on macOS. I use the GUI app, but I frequently want to launch it from the command line. With VS Code, if I ran code {filename} it would launch VS Code (or use the existing copy running) and open the file I want to edit. It would then exit the code command so I could continue to use the terminal.
 If I run emacs {filename}, a new instance of the Emacs GUI is launched (even if there is an existing instance) and the command does not exit until I quit the GUI instance that is spawned. That isn&#x27;t the largest problem - I can always open a new tab, but I would prefer it to not do so. I would also like it if the file I opened was added as a buffer to the existing instance of the GUI if one is already open.
 Is this possible to do? I tried to do some searching on my own first, but I&#x27;m not even sure what terms to use for the searches and I (obviously) not been successful so far.
 Thanks for any help :)

                    <span>new doom emacs user coming from vim here. so ive been having trouble with php files. did some looking and figured i use web-mode. looking at documentation for this plugin, instructions for installation: 
  
Install 
 First drop the file web-mode.el in a directory defined in your load-path.
 Then, add in your .emacs:
  
(require &#x27;web-mode) (add-to-list &#x27;auto-mode-alist &#x27;(&quot;\\.phtml\\&#x27;&quot; . web-mode)) (add-to-list &#x27;auto-mode-alist &#x27;(&quot;\\.tpl\\.php\\&#x27;&quot; . web-mode)) (add-to-list &#x27;auto-mode-alist &#x27;(&quot;\\.[agj]sp\\&#x27;&quot; . web-mode)) (add-to-list &#x27;auto-mode-alist &#x27;(&quot;\\.as[cp]x\\&#x27;&quot; . web-mode)) (add-to-list &#x27;auto-mode-alist &#x27;(&quot;\\.erb\\&#x27;&quot; . web-mode)) (add-to-list &#x27;auto-mode-alist &#x27;(&quot;\\.mustache\\&#x27;&quot; . web-mode)) (add-to-list &#x27;auto-mode-alist &#x27;(&quot;\\.djhtml\\&#x27;&quot; . web-mode)) 
  
where is my load-path located?
 this insturction is not doom specific, so i think i have to add above lines to some file, not .emacs. where?

                    <span>I am trying to set up pyright with pyvenv. This is what I am doing:
 I am running on fedora 35 with python 3.10 and emacs 27.2.
 I install emacs with sudo dnf install emacs. Then I paste this into the .emacs file:
 (require &#x27;package)(add-to-list &#x27;package-archives&#x27;(&quot;melpa-stable&quot; . &quot;https://stable.melpa.org/packages/&quot;))
 Then I install elpy and pyvenv (I don&#x27;t think elpy is necessary) with M-x package-install RET elpy RET ,then I create a virtual environment with M-x pyvenv-create that I activate and work on, which is literally M-x pyvenv-activate and M-x pyvenv-workon I also install use-package with M-x package-install RET use-package RET . Finally I install lsp-mode using: M-x package install RET lsp-mode RET Then I include this to the .emacs file:
 (use-package lsp-pyright:ensure t:hook (python-mode . (lambda()(require &#x27;lsp-pyright)(lsp))))
 But when I eval the buffer, I get the error:
 Error (use-package): Failed to install lsp-pyright: Package &#x27;lsp-pyright&#x27; is unavailable
 Error (use-package): Cannot load lsp-pyright
 I am not sure why I get that error or what I am doing wrong. Could it be because I am using python 3.10? I had some issues with elpy because I was using python 3.10. And more importantly, how to resolve that? I&#x27;d appreciate if anyone has a tutorial on this.
 ​
 Edit: The code formatting looks awful. Sorry about that. In the .emacs file that formatting (indexing) is fine.

                    <span>I’ve tried looking into this question, and so far I understand that using overloaded strings and strictness are good ways to improve performance. However, I don’t understand how fast Haskell is relative to other languages. Some claim that it is slower than Python; others claim that it can be as fast as or faster than C. The programming language benchmark game suggests that Haskell is roughly as fast as Java and C#, but this is complicated by the extensive use of foreign libraries in those languages. 
 What does this subreddit think?

                    <span>So don&#x27;t know how to make this function, i&#x27;v been trying a few days but nothing works, (the funtion is into run, the asign type). There are also other function which i don&#x27;t know how to do them, but first i want to figure out how to do the run -&gt; Asig funtion, thanks anyone trying to help

                    <span>For most people (myself included), creating and maintaining a zettelkasten involves a significant amount of unlearning with regards to how we think captured information should be stored and categorized (going from so-called &quot;top-down&quot; to &quot;bottom-up,&quot; etc).
Because this is a process, and few things are ever complete or &quot;perfect,&quot; I&#x27;m curious to know in what ways you&#x27;ve found yourself catering to or reinforcing old beliefs about information mgmt when creating and maintaining your zettelkasten. Places where you&#x27;ve &quot;bent the rules,&quot; or just felt it was OK to keep some old praxis in place.
I&#x27;d also be curious to know what you feel you&#x27;ve successfully unlearned, that is, what about your ZK practice you feel comes out of having successfully unlearned &quot;the old ways&quot; (so to speak).</span>

                    <span>Occasionally, when I call org-capture, the template selection screen will be launched but then fail to respond to any further keypresses until I C-g, locking up Emacs (and making my desktop fans spin up!) in the meantime. This seems to happen randomly, and doesn&#x27;t correlate with any changes in my init.el, so I&#x27;m at a loss for how to diagnose it. I&#x27;ve profiled org-capture with edebug after this behavior started, but I haven&#x27;t been able to get it to hang while stepping through it yet - I&#x27;m not sure whether that&#x27;s due to the fact I&#x27;m walking through it instead of using bytecode (although I&#x27;ve rebuilt everything recently so I know it&#x27;s not stale) or just because I haven&#x27;t gotten lucky enough to provoke the weird behavior.
 Any tips for how to profile what&#x27;s causing a command to hang?

                    <span>I&#x27;m in the process of migrating back to emacs (for org-mode, especially org-roam) from vim land and want to recreate my workflow. I have a work-issued MacBook that&#x27;s performance is less than optimal, especially for docker stuff. To remedy that, I have a beefy VM on my personal workstation that I ssh into then do all my work in nvim with tmux and it all works quite nicely.
 I&#x27;m trying to recreate that workflow with the Emacs GUI. I&#x27;ve found a few blog posts that talk about SSH forwarding the emacs server socket allowing you to open remote files in your GUI using TRAMP mode. This is not really what I want since I want pretty much all compute, (running makes tasks, using the lang server, etc) to be on my workstation VM and just have a window into it via the emacs GUI on my Mac.
 What I&#x27;m looking at doing now is running an emacs server in TCP mode on my VM, then connecting to that on my mac. What I&#x27;ve read so far is that it wasn&#x27;t made for what I want, just because Windows doesn&#x27;t support Unix sockets, and there are massive security concerns, which is not a concern for me since my VM is only accessible through a VPN.
 I guess my questions boil down to:
  
Is anyone using emacs server TCP mode to work on a remote machine with good or bad experience?
 Is there a better way to do what I want?
 Am I being a moron trying to use the GUI and should just use emacs in terminal mode like I was with nvim?
  
Thanks for any info you can provide!

                    <span>C-s is I-search. The cursor jumps to next matching when you press C-s again.
  
If the cursor jump 3 matching down(e.g in line 100) then I want to keep my cursor in the current position(in line 100).
 I have to press ESC to cancel it. I&#x27;m wondering what is the shortcut key to cancel the I-search without using the ESC key?

                    <span>After playing a little bit with Starter kits, I decided to shape my init.el from scratch and it&#x27;s definitely worth it. TRAMP with sshx is not hanging anymore, and I am now finally appreciating eshell-mode; simple, yet powerful.
 What are some eshell tips/packages that you can share with a 1-month converted emacsian?
 I incorporated eshell-z in my workflow and It seems very useful.

                    <span>So, I was working in an org file with tables that needed to reference tables from different files. According to the org manual, you can do this with remote(, ). This is problematic for a couple of reasons. First, it is very fragile. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn&#x27;t. Maybe I was doing something wrong with the IDs, but it was very unstable for me. Second, it means that, if you sync your org files in multiple machines, you&#x27;ll also have to sync the id. Finally, and this is the big one, accoring to the org manual, you assing an ID to a heading and the remote call will look for the first table under that heading. But what if you need the second table?
 Instead of fighting with the IDs problem, I decided to do some elisp magic to see if I could grab a table range from a remote table with file path and #:name. To my surpirse, it was very easy to do. All you need is this function somewhere in your init file:
 (defun j/remote-table-range (path name range) (with-current-buffer (find-file-noselect path) (org-table-get-remote-range name range))) 
 Then, you have to add the #:name tag to the remote table:
 ;; Contents of ~/table-test/remote.org #+name: remote-t1 | C1 | C2 | | 1 | 2 | 
 Then, from another table, you can call it like this:
 ;; Contents of ~/table-test/main.org | C1 | C2 | | | | #+tblfm: @1$1&#x3D;&#x27;(j/remote-table-range &quot;./remote.org&quot; &quot;remote-t1&quot; (string ?@ ?1 ?$ ?1)) 
 The path can be absolute or relative, and you can reference any table in that file using the name argument. The wierd string call is explained here.
 And that&#x27;s it. IMO, while it makes for longer formulas, it is way more convenient than the current remote function with IDs and have less limitations. 
 I was amazed with how little code was needed for this. Man, do I love emacs...

                    <span>Hi
 do you use it ?
 Can I use it with windows authentication ?
 I haven&#x27;t seen about it in the documentation but maybe somebody knows a trick ... :)

                    <span>Hey there, I&#x27;ve turned on recentf and savehist mode in my init.el but it didn&#x27;t seem to work. I&#x27;m using server mode, everytime I opens a new client, recent file shows nothing on dashboard neither vertico shows last completions. I even tried consult-recentf, it just says, recentf-mode and shows nothing.

                    <span>im really new to emacs. using doom emacs. i need some help customizing a couple things for the first time.
 so emac&#x27;s default for moving to beginning/end of line is &#x60;C-a&#x60; and &#x60;C-e&#x60;. and emac&#x27;s default for skipping to previous/next word is &#x60;C-left&#x60; and &#x60;C-right&#x60;. i want &#x60;C-left&#x60; and &#x60;C-right&#x60; to move to beginning of line and end of line. i also want &#x60;Shift-left&#x60; and &#x60;Shift-right&#x60; to skip to previous/next word (so same thing as default &#x60;C-left/right&#x60;)
 also im using evil so &#x60;o&#x60; in normal mode will create and go to next line, and enter insert mode. i want to remap this to &#x60;c&#x60;. in vim this would be &#x60;nnoremap c o&#x60;.
 how i can do this?
 thanks

                    <span>In some cases it would be nice to have some syntax highlighting in result blocks.
 Is it possible to specify the type of the result block?
 e.g. this src block will output yaml:
 #+begin_src sh kubectl create deployment web --image nginx -o yaml --dry-run #+end_src 
 When running this with C-c C-c a results block will look like (i&#x27;ve omitted the content)
 #+RESULTS: #+begin_example ... #+end_example 
 Is it possible to have it output
 #+RESULTS: #+begin_example yaml ... #+end\_example 
 We can have it do a lot of fancy stuff even output files according to https://orgmode.org/manual/Results-of-Evaluation.html

                    <span>Dear Colleagues,
 I&#x27;m writing right now NES JIT compiler for fast emulation. I want to interact with SDL interface and other emulated devices such as graphics, sound or game input, so I guess I need to do some foreign calls to Haskell from LLVM. 
 How to do that properly?

                    <span>I’m preparing for this year’s Advent of Code by working on last year’s problems. I am very new to Cabal, having learnt it this week, and am practising problem solving and project organisation on day 4’s problem. You’ll find my Cabal project for day 4 here.
 Here’s the issue. I discovered that HLS no longer flags erroneous code in VS Code. However, it still gives me suggestions on what to do.
 In my Main.hs there is a deliberately-incorrect function called test. I used it to see what was going on with HLS.
 test :: Int -&gt; Int test x &#x3D; show x 
 In my Cabal project, HLS only suggested that I refactor the definition using eta reduction. It did not say anything about a mismatched return type. When I created a random Haskell file outside Cabal, HLS worked as expected and showed me both messages.
 Here are further details in case they are useful:
  
macOS 12.0.1 Monterey
 VS Code 1.62 (with Haskell extension 1.7.1)
 GHC 8.10.7 (installed using ghcup)
 Cabal 3.6.2.0 (installed using ghcup)
 HLS 1.5.0 (installed using ghcup)
  
How might I resolve this?

                    <span>Hello all! As part of my preparation for doing Advent of Code this Christmas, I&#x27;ve decided that I want to approach it more as a project than as a pile of disconnected one-off solutions. In this vein, I am curious as to what the current best practices are around Haskell software packages. Is it stack? Is it nix? Is it ... something else?
 I&#x27;ll be working on macOS, and I&#x27;ve been writing software a long time, but I consistently bounce off of Haskell and I&#x27;d love to be more conversant in it, as there is a lot about Haskell that I really enjoy.
 Anyway, TIA!

 I tried org-ref, but I hardly can make it work again any time I need it.
 Now I&#x27;m trying with basic latex, and I still can&#x27;t make it work correctly. (I&#x27;ve heard about the new citation system but it&#x27;s not released yet and I&#x27;m really not trying to experiment a lot of things and change my whole completing-read backend right now)
 I am down to this situation: at the end of my org file I specify the bibliography file, style, and nocite everything with a * (because I really don&#x27;t want to manually add every ref, that&#x27;s the whole point)

                    <span>If you derive a typeclass using the derives keyword, the typeclass companion must have a derived[T] method, my question is, why even use a def derived[T]: Typeclass[T] &#x3D; ... and mark data as deriving it instead of just having given [T]: Typeclass[T] &#x3D; ... so then it&#x27;s available for all types that would be eligible automatically?
 Same constraints can be applied to both, maybe I&#x27;m missing something? If derives was able to take parameters, I would understand, but I just don&#x27;t see the point.

                    <span>Hi guys I&#x27;m currently working as a data analyst in London, I am an entry level noob but love what I do. I&#x27;m working for a consulting company where I go to other companies and provide my expertise for a few months before moving onto the next company. The tools I mostly use are SQL, Python pandas, and tableau on a daily basis.
 Today my manager came and said if I choose to I can be part of a new training programme for the engineering(my manager said it&#x27;s for software engineering but my research tells me this is more towards big data) said its for department learning spark and scala, and also do a project with a company called quantexa that are in partnership with deloitte that would last around 7-12 weeks, and then be assigned to deloitte to work in the fraud prevention unit.
 I&#x27;ve been told…</span>

                    <span>The local Scala 3 REPL has some improvements over the local Scala 2 REPL, but I&#x27;m not sure I would count syntax highlighting as an improvement. Here&#x27;s a screenshot from a local Scala 2 REPL session:
 Screenshot from local Scala 2 REPL
 Not pretty, but clear enough. Now here&#x27;s a similar session in the local Scala 3 REPL (I have Scala 3 on a different Windows computer)
 Screenshot from a local Scala 3 REPL session
 I should have taken the screenshot to include the definition of f().
 Prior to my most recent eye exam, I had quite a bit of trouble reading unstaged changes in Git. This reminds me of that. But I&#x27;m not getting new glasses again so soon.
 That thing with the val or the var that might be an improvement. I&#x27;ll have to remember to play around with import java.awt._ or something like that in my next Scala 3 REPL session.

                    <span>I am about to do a research project, which I want to do about Purely Functional Scala or very related topics. But I am a bit lost on keywords or ideas that are interesting. The only thing I have done in this field is read the &quot;Functional Programming in Scala&quot; (red book) as part of my &quot;Advanced Programming&quot; course in my graduate degree. 
 So I am just interested in any project ideas or theories you guys have heard about as inspiration for my topic?
 The research project could be described as:
 &quot;The research project is an ordinary 7.5 ECTS project intended to bridge the gap between your specialization and your graduate thesis. You use it to make sure you have done the legwork necessary to get a running start on your thesis. The Research Project very often takes the form of narrowly focused literature study or a prototype implementation or use of particular software tools.&quot; 
 Requirements for the research project:
  
It must use tools, languages, techniques, and theories that you find interesting. 
 It must advance “what we know” in some way, although not necessarily by much. 
 It must be a topic within Computer Science or applications of Computer Science. 
  
Some topics I heard about as inspiration
  
Analyse cats, cats-effect or cats-parse - explain their design 
 Parser combinators
 Getting familiar with &quot;programs as values&quot; and comparing the way of writing programs in that style with Futures or even just plain Scala. 
  
But I am looking for other topics too as an inspiration. Any help will be much appreciated!

                    <span>As the title suggests, our microservices use Scala 2.12. Moreover, we as a team would like to upgrade all of the microservices&#x27; Scala version to 3.0. However, our boss has the last word, and he said that we need to convince him of upgrading the Scala version by giving him arguments (advantages). 
 If we could convince him in the upcoming weeks, we might start the upgrading processes in early 2022 (probably in January).
 We would be very grateful for any arguments that would convince our boss.

 Is there a way to make org-tabl-sort-lines fix the formulas?

                    <span>Hi there. I am a new Emacs user, trying it after using Vim for a year or so.I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s ambitious, but I&#x27;ve started from scratch. I didn&#x27;t want to go with Spacemacs or Doom Emacs. 
 Configuring init.el file got me thinking - What are all those functions? I know that ELisp is a dialect of a programming language called LISP, but knowing many languages ELisp seems so strange. It&#x27;s absolutely peculiar. 
 You all know that Python has been considered a &quot;pseudo code&quot; language in which you almost tell in human English what do you want to achieve.I actually believe that ELisp falls under that description much better. 
 I don&#x27;t understand what all those functions are doing below the surface. It seems to me that if I&#x27;d want to make a AI Chess game by my own rules, that the only thing I&#x27;d need to write in ELisp, would be: 
  
(setq AI-chess-my-own-rules t) 
  
And that would be it.
 Can I see the implementation of each function I have put in my init.el?How does, for example: 
  
(load theme &#x27;doom-gruvbox) 
  
work? 
 Can I see the implementation? Or (scroll-bar-mode -1)? How does that work? Does that tells the X to stop drawing the scroll-bar in Emacs? What is the language that those functions are written in, and where could I see, inside or outside of Emacs, the implementation of it? 
 And how is it possible that I can type a name of any function written in ELisp and it will just work? Aren&#x27;t there any libraries? How does that work? 
 I believe these are trivial questions for you, but I am really new in this. I fell in love with the Org mode, but Emacs seems so strange. I got used to parenthesis, I get it - That&#x27;s the syntax. Fine. I don&#x27;t have a problem with it. But it&#x27;s absolutely different than any other language I&#x27;ve ever used. 
 Thanks in advance for replies. :)

                    <span>I&#x27;m trying to use tcl mode to program tcl Scripts for vivado. It would be handy to eval tcl code directly usign vivado tcl mode as an inferior process. However if I start vivado with the proper flags it fails
 if I write
 $ vivado -mode tcl
 Vivado behaves as a tcl interactive shell. If I modify the tcl process to vivado and the switches to -mode tcl I get the following error:
 process inferior-tcl exited abnormally with code 1
 ERROR: [Common 17-170] Unknown option &#x27;-mode tcl&#x27;, please type &#x27;vivado -help&#x27; for usage info.
 I don&#x27;t know what is happenning, but obviously arguments are formed incorrectly 
 How I can pass arguments properly?

 If you have properly modeled footprints (XY plane of the 3D model on the PCB and origin at the center of the bounding box), then you can easily generate 3D view of the assembly. In this screenshot, you can see the generated model being rendered by view3dscene.

                    <span>Hello friends!
 I&#x27;ve been using Doom Emacs for awhile, and I&#x27;ve been slowly building up my own config.
 It&#x27;s almost there, but I&#x27;m having an issue and wanting to add something in that I think would be helpful.
 Info
 I&#x27;m using the Chaotic AUR emacs-pgtk-native-comp-git package, the most recent update. 
 Here&#x27;s my config.
 The issues seem to be with something in early-init.el, init.el and lisp/packing.el.
 Frozen frame
 So with Emacs natively compiling packages, it seems to work just fine. However after it appears to be done, the Emacs frame is just...stuck. It&#x27;s a blank frame. No *scratch* buffer, just a blank GTK frame. I&#x27;m running Emacs with emacs --debug-init for now, and calling kill -USR2 [the emacs pid] will bring it back. Sort of. The GTK frame is still blank, but if I press a key, the scratch buffer appears. Granted, it just freezes up again. My best guess is that it&#x27;s related to garbage collection, but I wouldn&#x27;t be sure how to tell.
 Native compilation
 So while I was using Doom Emacs, native compilation did make Emacs perform a bit better. However having moved away from Doom, I don&#x27;t have the benefit of the compilation process being printed out anywhere when packages are update. Doom has a bunch of functions to have a CLI program, but all I really want is to be able to see if and when there&#x27;s a problem in the native compilation process. I&#x27;m wondering if there&#x27;s a simple way to go about this.
 Thanks, and have a Happy Thanksgiving to my fellow Americans!

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been working on a Haskell Gemini server framework. Everything seems to be working fine, except that I&#x27;m having trouble reading the client certificate when it&#x27;s sent. I had to do some admittedly janky things to get it in the first place.
 If anyone is familiar with the tls or tcp-streams packages and can tell me what I&#x27;m doing wrong, that would be appreciated.
 My code is located on Codeberg, and the most likely relevant functions are Network.Gemini.Capsule.listenLoop and Network.Gemini.Capsule.adjustServerParams.

                    <span>I&#x27;m a fairly new Haskeller (~1 year) and I&#x27;ve been getting into graphical programming with Haskell using various C bindings like X11, GTK, and OpenGL/GLFW. And while the bindings seem the be very mature and capable, they tend to have me writing in an imperative way (a lot of do blocks for callbacks and such), probably a reality of being bound to imperative languages.
 This got me wondering if it&#x27;s possible to do graphical programming in Haskell sans any bindings at all. If so are there any projects that attempt to do this? The closest thing I&#x27;ve found so far is GPipe, which promises an alternative to the imperative style of OpenGL, but seems to be built on the OpenGL bindings itself.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve done a lot of OO programming and get the mental model of objects representing bits of state and methods representing ways to enact changes on that state.
 However I&#x27;m having a hard time getting my head around Haskell (I&#x27;ve just started). I get the idea of no side effects and I get the idea of pure functions, but I still can&#x27;t grok how to such a language can have state that exists for the duration of a program.
 Let&#x27;s say an object that is created at the start and over time the objects state changes. For instance a chess board. How can I stop recreating a new object (let&#x27;s says it&#x27;s large), in every function call?
 Edit: thank you everyone. I&#x27;ve got some answers which have really made my thinking much much clearer.

                    <span>I&#x27;m using org-mode in Spacemacs. In my org agenda, open items (TODO, QUESTION, ...) are purple, while closed items (DONE etc) are green.
 I export my calendars to org-mode, with timestamps and the CALENDAR keyword. I would like to be able to tell at a glance which items are calendar items, because these are different from open as well as closed items. Can I somehow customize the color of an item - not the keyword, but the rest of the line! - depending on the keyword?

                    <span>Hi /r/orgmode
 With Org 9.5, we&#x27;ve got this amazing new citation setup. (See https://blog.tecosaur.com/tmio/2021-10-31-release.html for a great overview.)
 While my setup previously relied on org-ref for both managing .bib files and fixing LaTeX exporting, I feel like I should upgrade my configuration. I&#x27;m thinking of moving away from org-ref because the package always felt a bit too heavy (e.g. relying on helm).
 So I&#x27;m looking for inspiration. What do your setups look like? Which packages should I look into?
 Cheers

                    <span>Recently, a group of Haskellers within Tweag had a knowledge-sharing event
where we shared our varied Haskell setups with each other, and learned some
nice tricks and tips for every-day life.
The idea was raised of sharing these findings via the blog, so without further
ado, let’s explore the varieties of the Tweag Haskelling experience by
covering a few of our personal setups!

                    <span>Hello everyone!
 Title says. What&#x27;s the best way to define key bindings so i can easily turn them on / off.
 I was thinking creating a empty / bare bones minor mode and attaching all my binding customizations to it. Is it good idea or is there a better way?

 But found some code on stackexchange. Hope this helps some.

                    <span>The evil-tutor and the emacs-tutor are both pretty good, given their limitations with regard to the greater emacs ecosystem. But discoverability of interface and commands remains extremely hard.
 I am really hoping for interactive-tutorials for Magit, Dired, and Org-Mode; at least the basics but, preferably, also evil (or viper) bindings. (Yes, I understand Org-Mode is a big ask due to it&#x27;s vast capabilities)
 Do such tutorials exist?
 If No, is anybody working on any of these and looking for testers?
 Thanks.

                    <span>Based on my earlier org-jira post, I was thinking something like wjira would help me a lot to straighten my workflow.
 Is this interface explored in other tools? I guess a wifconfig for example, where you can edit the ip addresses yourself would be a fun project, but I don&#x27;t recall seeing other tools like these.

                    <span>I often use M-: (eval-expression) to check or set variable values or as a calculator. But if I try to use completion there, I always end up with the *Completions* buffer. Is there any nice completion replacement package which deals with this use case? I think it’s a matter of supporting completion-at-point inside the minibuffer. 
 So far, I found that:
  
 company-mode is not supported in the minibuffer.
  Helm does have some support for this, but it’s a little wonky. Something about the way it handles spaces makes it unintuitive in this use case.

                    <span>A recent mistype activated emacs tabs on my screen. Once I found out what was going on, I was intrigued. Now, I don&#x27;t think they provide anything that I need on top of my normal buffer management habits, but I don&#x27;t want to dismiss anything the emacs core folks thought was good to include in a recent update. Do any of you use tab-bar-mode? What does it do for you?

  IMPORTANT: please install Org from GNU ELPA as Org ELPA will close before Org 9.6 
 The startup is insanely long, because I suppose for each single open org-mode file it tries to communicate with the server and all I get is that IMPORTANT message.
 https://orgmode.org/elpa.html says the archive will be deprecated, but not what is the proper replacement.
 My current year-long setup is:
 (add-to-list &#x27;package-archives &#x27;(&quot;org&quot; . &quot;http://orgmode.org/elpa/&quot;) t) (use-package org :ensure org-plus-contrib :pin org :commands (org-mode org-capture org-agenda orgbl-mode) :bind (&quot;C-c l&quot; . org-store-link) :init ;; (package-initialize &#x27;org) ;; org settings (load &quot;~/.emacs.d/settings/settings-org.el&quot;))

                    <span>I switched from Vim to Emacs a few months ago. The actual editing part I picked up pretty quickly. But since day 1 I&#x27;ve been trying to get a config for Emacs that works for me and it&#x27;s like I&#x27;m playing bug/unexpected weirdness whack a mole.
 - Getting LSP support in particular has been particularly frustrating - remote LSPs don&#x27;t work, have to fix paths, frames don&#x27;t work correctly on Mac, icons get rendered as bogus unicode characters in the terminal.
 - Getting TRAMP to not freeze my emacs all the time has been frustrating. Quite frankly it&#x27;s a heaping pile compared to VSCode&#x27;s remote server. It&#x27;s slow. You&#x27;re lucky if it works with the feature you want, and when it doesn&#x27;t work it just destroys the entire emacs instance requiring a force quit.

                    <span>Hi everyone! I&#x27;m a beginner at Haskell and this is my first question. I figured out how to make things work myself and asking this just to understand Haskell better and improve my code.
 I want to write a file, but its path might exist already so I want to find a free path by adding numbers to the path. E.g. if I already have &quot;foo.txt&quot; then I want to write to &quot;foo 1.txt&quot;, then &quot;foo 2.txt&quot; and so on.
 So I wrote this function:  findFreeName :: FilePath -&gt; IO FilePath findFreeName path &#x3D; head  filterM isPathFree (map makePathWithNumber [1, 2 ..]) where -- skipping implementation here: isPathFree :: FilePath -&gt; IO Bool -- uses the path parameter and turns x to &quot;foo x.txt&quot; unless x is 0 makePathNumber :: Int -&gt; FilePath  And it started to check paths &quot;foo.txt&quot;, &quot;foo 1.txt&quot;, &quot;foo 2.txt&quot; and …</span>

                    <span>I want to write the gui for my iOS app in swift, and the logic in Haskell. How would I go about doing this? It seems for the a macOS app I can create an excecutable in cabal then simply bring that into my Xcode project, but I don’t think I can do this for an iOS app.

                    <span>Working with the REPL, I just tried this
 mylist1 &#x3D; [1,2,3] 
 then I was foolish enough to do this
 mylist1 &#x3D; -2 : -1 : 0 : mylist1 
 then
 mylist1 
 The result was runaway recursion that I could stop (I&#x27;m in Emacs) only by BREAK and STOP from the Signals menu. Once stopped just entering mylist1 again started the infinite recursion again. It&#x27;s like mylist1 is a hidden bomb. Can it be defused? So what exactly is happening with my &quot;don&#x27;t try this at home&quot; experiment?

                    <span>I use org to publish my notes as part of GitHub actions CI. It uses Emacs v27. In that last couple days, I noticed that all the special characters in the text content are HTML encoded (eg &#x27; becomes &#x27;) and that page breaks. Does anyone have any ideas as to where I might look to resolve this? In the mean time, I&#x27;m building and deploying from my local machine which is still creating the markup without issues.

                    <span>Hello!
 I have completed the red book (Functional Programming in Scala by Chiusano Paul) book and exercises, and I am now looking for more beginner exercises at a similar level. 
 ​
 Do you guys know any purely functional scala exercises for beginners? Leetcode seems to be popular in Java, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s mostly suited for this paradigm of programming.

                    <span>Hello all! I&#x27;m learning emacs lisp and getting used to the language. Yesterday I was trying to write a function to build and execute a shell command that I type frequently, to backup some of my files to google drive. I could make it work by hardcoding the commands, but as a learning exercise, I decided to try some fancy, overengineered stuff, to see if I can incorporate what I&#x27;m thinking in Elisp.
 Well, I couldn&#x27;t. I still get confused with the function/var namespace separation, and the multiple ways I can declare things (let, letf, flet, defalias, ...). When to use lambda functions or just quoted expressions. If I should use partial application or just macros (like the threading ones). Etc.
 What I wanted to write is something like this:
 Given a list of file paths:

But when characters reach the end of a line it displays the ($) symbol. I have tried the toggle-truncate-mode and got some results but again displayed a (\) symbol when the characters exceeded the current line. What can I do to solve this problem?

                    <span>Hi all.
 I have this very strange problem and I hope someone can help me fix it (or least find out why it happens).
 I&#x27;m using Doom emacs. I&#x27;ve submitted an issue with this problem but /u/hlissner marked it invalid for insufficient information. I completely understand because the information I have is indeed very vague but I don&#x27;t have the expertise to provide more. He pointed a discourse thread with further information I could try but I&#x27;ve had no luck...
 So what happens is emacs starts lagging very badly. Even just moving the cursor up and down is painful. It doesn&#x27;t lag when I start it but after a short while it begins to lag more and more to the point where it simply becomes unusable. I have to keep restarting... Like every minute or so.
 Can someone help me make something out of this?…</span>

                    <span>Hello,
 Recently I installed pdf-tools on emacs through MELPA,
 The keybindings seem not to work, for example I cannot zoom out with the &quot;-&quot; key, when changing page the pdf render dissapears, etc...
 My setup: Arch linux, 4k display (XFT scaling done on Xresources file).
 Installed pdf-tools by M-x package-install pdf-tools; M-x pdf-tools-install.
 Also tried the AUR package emacs-pdf-tools-git.
 Both seem to not work :(
 I do not how what more info to post, please tell me what shall I add to the post. (new to reddit)
 Thanks in advance,

                    <span>Recently I tried (for 3 days only) orderless, consult, marginalia, vertico and embark.
 I was amazed regarding the init time of this framework (its init time feels like zero). I was surprised to find, that I have more Ivy related packages installed, than I need for this vertico &amp; Co framework. Also the documentation of vertico and Co is very comprehensible. Those different packages play really well together. And those packages provide quite some nice features, I haven&#x27;t seen in Ivy (I haven&#x27;t looked for new features in ivy for quite a while, because Ivy just works fine here).
 Nevertheless, I&#x27;m back on ivy right now (whose configuration I lavish and care since about 5 years), because there are some minor things (with vertico and Co) I would have to take care of, before I feel at home.

                    <span>Hey Haskell Devs,
 I am a Blockchain Master student - not a Dev though - who went through an incubation program for a DApp idea that is especially targeting the Global South/Africa and hence aligns very well with the vision of Cardano. Now I am looking for Haskell capable Devs who wanna team up and then also try to get some funding from the catalyst program and ultimately create a DAO that serves the needs of people in the Global South with a viable use case.

                    <span>I&#x27;m new to Haskell and need to list all possible ways to pair up (even) lists of Ints.
 E.g.
 [1,2,3,4] -&gt; [[(1,2),(3,4)], [(2,3),(1,4)], [(1,3),(2,4)], ...] 
 Generating all possible pairs is easy enough (shown below) but I can&#x27;t work out how to return only ways to pair up the entire input list.
 pairs :: [a] -&gt; [[(a, a)]] pairs l &#x3D; [(x,y) | (x:ys) &lt;- tails l, y &lt;- ys] 
 Any help appreciated!
 Edit: Thank you very much to everyone who helped, I&#x27;m going to have another go with your advice

 when I add a display math environment using \[ … \] org export will seemingly arbitrarily interpret it as $\blackslash$[ … $\blackslash$], which is very much what I don’t want. However, this does not happen every time in the document and I can’t tell what is causing it. Any advice?

                    <span>For example, given an error if the user passed in 1 item or many item you might adjust the English grammar from &quot;error xyz. 1 argument was passed.&quot; To &quot;error xyz. 5 arguments were passed&quot;.
 I was wondering if there was a library that could handle this transparently instead of the junior engineers littering the codebase with if size is 1 say this else that.
 It&#x27;s mostly for constructing exceptions to be sent to the user

                    <span>I understand the purpose of every course is learning, but I am already familiar with most of Functional Programming concepts (I often play with F# in my free time).
 But scala jobs in my area are already quite low, and whenever there is one, they seem to be preferring java experienced developer (since scala devs here are pretty low in number already).
 Some how I have ended up with almost 7 years of PHP and javascript experience. (We all know about the reputation PHP has in developer community). but every thing about scala excites me (The FP, big data, clustered &amp; distributed systems)
 I want to get into scala but recruiters won&#x27;t even reply to my application because of my background.so hence the questions, does the coursera course certificate help people landing a scala job. (or atleast get me an interview, I understand after that it depends on my skills)

                    <span>First off, I want to thank this community for all the help I have gotten both through explicitly asking questions and just through watching others questoins. 
 ​
 Main point: 
 I recently switched to EXWM because its awesome. I found some rough edges that I have been trying to smooth out and wanted to share a particularly simple one. 
 The EXWM wiki suggets merging framemove with windmove to move between workspaces on two different monitors. I found that framemove considers not just visible workspaces but also inactive (invisible) workspaces. Imagine the following setup
 Monitor 1: assigned workspaces 0 and 1; currently showing workspace 1
 Monitor 2: assigned workspaces 2; currently showing monitor 2. Focus is on workspace 2. 
 Trying to move across frames using framemove could actually cause focus to not just switch to monitor 1 but also monitor 1 to change from showing workspace 1 to workspace 0. 
 Turns out it was pretty simple to modify framemove to restrict to only considering currently active frames using the predicate function &#x60;exwm-workspace--active-p&#x60;. 
 ​
 In case anyone else runs into this issue take a look at my forked version of framemove: https://github.com/jsilve24/framemove. 
 ​
 Honestly, it seems rediculous that I forked this repo since my contribution is essentially nil. That said, I really wasn&#x27;t sure a better way since the original library is on the emacswiki and also maintained by the emacsmirror github user. 
 ​
 That said, hope this helps someone else.
 ​
 Cheers.

                    <span>I am annoyed that when I C-g out of my expand-region session my cursor does not return to its original location.
 In trying to resolve this annoyance I found that expand-region comes with a variable er/save-mode-excursion that is described as:
  
A function to save excursion state while expanding
  
I set this variable to (lambda (&amp;rest body) () (save-excursion body)) and I found that this does not suit my needs for the following reasons.
  
This variable does not seem to effect any er/ commands outside of er/expand-region. For example if I do er/mark-defun and then hit C-g my cursor position is not returned.
 I often use a key-chord bound to (lambda () (interactive) (execute-kbd-macro (read-kbd-macro &quot;\C-g&quot;))). When I use this key-chord instead of actually hitting C-g my cursor position is not returned. I do not understand why this is.
  
Next I tried taking advantage of the deactivate-mark-hook to programatically hit C-u C-SPC.
 (add-hook &#x27;deactivate-mark-hook #&#x27;(lambda () (let ((current-prefix-arg 4)) (call-interactively &#x27;set-mark-command)))) 
 This works great for my non expand-region region endeavours but when I try to use any er/ commands I get unpredictable behavior. I believe the problem is that expand-region resets the mark multiple times and therefore deactivate-mark-hook is called multiple times.
 My next idea is to make my own expand-region-minor-mode where I can probably solve this problem. Before I do this though I want to know if there are already existing solutions.

                    <span>Anyone having problem with launching vterm from a TRAMP buffer?
 When I am in a TRAMP buffer I cannot launch vterm. I do not want a vterminal in the remote location of the buffer, but only a simple vterm in my home directory. (I would like to also have a vterm in the remote directory, but it doesn&#x27;t work; anyways, this is for another post).
 I tried this simple function, but didn&#x27;t work either.
 (defun run-my-vterm () (interactive) (let* ((buffer &quot;vterm&quot;)) (require &#x27;vterm) (if (buffer-live-p (get-buffer buffer)) (switch-to-buffer buffer) (vterm)) (vterm-send-string (concat &quot;cd &quot; &quot;~&quot;)) (vterm-send-return))) 
 It seems like vterm tries to open the terminal in the remote location but doesn&#x27;t succeed. 
 A workaround I use is to jump to scratch buffer and launch vterm from there, or use ansi-term.

                    <span>Is is possible to change the behavior of the ‘results’ header argument for the whole document?
 Like adding :results verbatim and :export both in 
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 +begin_src sh :results verbatim :export both
 ls -l
 +end_src
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 I&#x27;ve tried adding it the document header like so:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 +OPTIONS: :results verbatim
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 and 
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 +PROPERTY: :results verbatim
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 -- edit - solution
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 +PROPERTY: header-args:sh :results verbatim :exports both
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Also found it in the manual under the section Header arguments in Org mode properties

                    <span>Hello there! I hope this is the right group to ask this, as Im using Spacemacs.
 ​
 This is my first Reddit post, so be gentle 😊
 ​
 I want try using Telegra (Telegram client in Emacs). So Ive been following this link. https://ritschmaster.github.io/2021/06/13/Using-telga-in-Windows-10.html . Which I successfully installed MSYS2 MinGW (some Pacman installer inside Windows), which helps to install Telega inside Emacs. I need the MSYS2 version of Emacs, so that Telega will work (it only works out-of-the-box with any Emacs with Linux and Mac).
 ​
 Now having installed, my limited knowledge made me confused as to why Emacs opens up as Spacemacs (I thought it would create its own Emacs?). But doesnt matter, coz if I can make Telega work, then there is no need to use 2 separate Emacs, and I wil…</span>

                    <span>I remember a couple of blog posts that went viral on hackernews. As I roughly recall both were in the form of &quot;interviews&quot; with an interviewer asking basic questions and the interviewee taking them into a deviant descent into madness.
 One warped Haskell, the theoretically sound and purely functional language, into essentially assembly code. The other (and I&#x27;m more fuzzy on this) programmed using only c headers, or something equally absurd that is not intended to write real programs.

                    <span>See: https://github.com/haskell-perf/sequences.
 With chrisdone we just added DList &amp; Acc &amp; snoc benchmarks into comparison.
 I think it is useful for everyone to see &quot;if old folk DList recommendation to solve [] problems actually holds water&quot;.
 Because there is a direct comparison with numbers now.
 To be sure I additionally checked with spl (DList author) in: https://github.com/spl/dlist/issues/102 &amp; chrisdone of course holds the benchmarking repository.
  
Where is no benchmarks for data types - it implies the library/data type authors consider operation counterproductive to structure &amp; so those operations made not idiomatic (like for simple snocing the [] one needs to list  [el] - [] does not provide snocing operation for reason of it being counterproductive) - it means the operation to be composite/requires conversion into other data type &amp; so not showable in the benchmark
  
Would note that DList is not designed for strictness.
 DList data design relies on the leverage of Haskell laziness &amp; function composition, please use DList as it is by default.
  
An update:
 Acc claim still checks-out under conditions for purpose of the data type. For example - DList is created to be consumed partially &amp; in a lazy fashion, while Acc is created to be a builder type that goes into full normalization to be converted into a storage type (like Vector or Seq). So every type has its own domain of application &amp; haskell-perf/sequences currently has not enough benchmarks to show all particularities of types under different conditions of use.
 As I opened: 1. Please, make a traverse test: https://github.com/haskell-perf/sequences/issues/24 2. Please, add to/fromList conversion tests: https://github.com/haskell-perf/sequences/issues/26 3. Please, add a NFData normalization benchmark: https://github.com/haskell-perf/sequences/issues/27

                    <span>Hi!
 I am trying to use {-# LANGUAGE LinearTypes #-} to make one of my user-facing APIs safer. However, I find myself in a situation where I am relying on a third-party function that has no linear type. Is there some escape hatch that lets me take my argument in a a %1 -&gt; b and give it to a function a -&gt; b?
 I tried to google this and found some references that said there were no such hatch, but they were quite old so perhaps things changed since then. If I can not do this I am afraid I won&#x27;t be able to use LT for a while. I just want to use LT to make my API safer, not my implementation.
 Thanks

 The output is going to be LaTeX. Is there an easy way to do this with org-mode?

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been working over the last week to read and process for my ZK a particular book.  It contains about 40 short articles by different authors with &quot;inspirational&quot; messages and discussions of life experiences.  I created a zettel for each article (these were fairly short, mostly one- or two-idea articles).  After a while, I created a structure note for the book, grouping and linking to each zettel/article.
So far, so good - normal use of a structure note.  The little &quot;aha&quot; moment came as follows...
At the end of each zettel, (because the zettel contained an inspirational idea), I added a &quot;What will I do?&quot; question.  I didn&#x27;t want to just capture the idea, I wanted to see if I could incorporate it into my life in some useful manner.  The &quot;aha&quot; thought was to copy that question and its short answer from each zettel and paste that after the reference to the corresponding zettel on the structure note.  That way, I can simply scan down the structure note occasionally to remind myself of what I wanted to do, check my progress, pick out one item on which to focus for a few days, etc.
So the structure note became a way of reviewing my follow-up actions.  This is a simple addition that I&#x27;ve made to one structure note, and perhaps in retrospect, it is so evident as to be painfully obvious.  But it both simplifies and enhances the way that I interact with my ZK.  I have previously written zettels about various philosophies (regarding ethical behaviour) and have a few structure notes related to those.  If time permits, I may give them the same treatment.
As an aside, I did ask a question about this process before (of acting on ideas we bring into our ZK), which received a few interesting comments.  You can find the previous post here:

                    <span>I am using Zotero as reference manager. I use my Zettelkasten for maintaining references that are actually in use but Zotero holds lots of unused and unmaintained references (i.e. not in my ZK), especially webpages that i store offline just in case the source is changed or unavailable.
In Zotero it is easy to find duplicates which is the only maintenance i do. Zotero allows creating folders, tags to help with search but i find maintaining two separate systems is too much effort. I also don&#x27;t worry much about unused references because i don&#x27;t see them as backlog, they&#x27;re just collecting dust. But i know there is good stuff in it and occasionally i&#x27;d simply like to dig into it and add something interesting to my Zettelkasten.
I think what would be most helpful to me is a list of unused references sorted by creation date or in general allow communication between both systems for maintenance purpose only.
In previous discussions others mentioned that they use &quot;The Internet Archive&quot; to store webpages or don&#x27;t store webpages in their RMS at all and instead paste the URL to the note1. Some are maintaining a reading list.
Any thoughts on maintenance?

                    <span>I use outshine-mode, which extends outline-mode. This is wonderful for big structured buffers like large emacs libraries. But with functions like describe-{variable,function} I often jump right into the middle of a (new) random elisp buffer, and the text is folded so I can&#x27;t see the text I want. Point is officially on some text which is hidden, but the cursor displays at the end of a (folded) heading. Is there a way to automatically show the text I&#x27;ve jumped to, after using functions like describe-{variable,function}?

                    <span>I recently discovered an awesome capability of Emacs, where I can use occur to pull all matching lines into a split window and press e to enter occur-edit-mode. In this mode I can do things like replace-string to modify all of the matching lines in my original buffer.
 This only modifies the occurrences, and is fantastic! The best part is that I can see all of the potential changes to the original buffer in a concise, noise-free area.
 Shortcoming
 This mode does not currently have evil bindings. I can test my regex by using evil-ex - I get my lovely red strike-through and expected changes, but entering evil-ex seems to disable the edit capabilities of the occur-edit-mode and I&#x27;m left with a read-only buffer.
 Current Workflow
 I&#x27;m modifying 20+ large files with many rewrite rules and have come up with the following:
  
Use eshell to create a grep buffer across all relevant files.
 Test my regex using : (evil-ex) in the grep buffer
 Verify that all buffers will change as desired.
 Jump to each matching file from the grep buffer one-at-a-time
 Apply my regex to the original buffer, scanning for errors
 Save file and repeat for next file in the existing grep buffer.
  
This is not perfect because the regex applies to the original buffer as a whole, not only the matching lines, but so far it&#x27;s a huge time saver!
 Does anyone have a better workflow?

                    <span>The new Org-Ref version has broken my configuration. When I add a reference, it starts with ebib:citekey, instead of a cite link.
 I used the exact config example from GitHub. No other packages loaded, I only used this config.
 Any suggestions how to fix the issue? org-ref-helm does not seem to be doing its thing.

                    <span>On Emacs 27.2 with emacs -q, calling calc-edit (bound to the &#x60; key by default) with an element on the calc stack will bring up the *Calc Edit* buffer in place of the original calc buffer. When you&#x27;re done editing the element, you can do C-c C-c to dismiss the *Calc Edit* buffer and the original calc buffer will now have your edited element on the stack.
 However, on a version of Emacs I built off the emacs-28 branch about a week ago, also with emacs -q, calling calc-edit will instead bring up the *Calc Edit* buffer in a separate window, while the original calc buffer is still visible. Then, after editing the element and doing C-c C-c, the window layout becomes messed up: the original calc buffer remains at the bottom, but now there&#x27;s another calc buffer and *Calc Trail* buffer in the place of where the *Calc Edit* buffer was. I attached an image to show what this layout looks like.
 Since this happens with emacs -q, it seems like it could be a bug, but searching around online doesn&#x27;t show anyone else bringing it up, so maybe it&#x27;s either a recent bug, or could it just be me? Can anyone confirm this behavior?
 This is all on macOS, by the way.

                    <span>Consider the following function which pulls out the elements of m with keys of the form [i,j] for some characters i and j. Can you spot the mistake?
 import Data.Map as M subTable :: Char -&gt; M.Map String Int -&gt; M.Map Char Int subTable i m &#x3D; M.foldrWithKey maybeInsert M.empty m where maybeInsert :: String -&gt; Int -&gt; Row -&gt; Row maybeInsert [i,j] v r &#x3D; insert j v r maybeInsert _ _ r &#x3D; r 
 Indeed, the mistake is that in maybeInsert I am trying to pattern match on a previously bound variable i. But the compiler no longer recognises i as bound, and it compiles fine... but the code doesn&#x27;t behave as intended. Should the compiler allow this in a where block? I would suggest it should at least include a warning. I imagine many of us have made this mistake at some point...
 For reference, my intended behaviour is achieved by 
 maybeInsert [i1,j] v r | i1&#x3D;&#x3D;i &#x3D; insert j v r | otherwise &#x3D; r

                    <span>For example
 import GHC.Stack x :: HasCallStack &#x3D;&gt; Int x &#x3D; (srcLocStartLine . snd . last . getCallStack) callStack main &#x3D; do print x print x print x 
 results in
 7 8 9 
 and after rewriting with a rewrite rule we take for granted:
 import GHC.Stack x :: HasCallStack &#x3D;&gt; Int x &#x3D; (srcLocStartLine . snd . last . getCallStack) callStack main &#x3D; do let y &#x3D; x print y print y print y 
 outputs
 7 7 7 
 That is to say, referential transparency is violated. There&#x27;s an easy fix: change the type of callStack from
 callStack :: HasCallStack &#x3D;&gt; CallStack 
 to
 callStack :: HasCallStack &#x3D;&gt; IO CallStack 
 Observing call stacks in IO is perfectly reasonable. (So technically it&#x27;s not HasCallStack that breaks referential transparency, but callStack.)
 But I can&#x27;t be the first person to make this objection. It must have been made before the proposal to add HasCallStack was accepted. What was the explanation for dismissing it? I can&#x27;t find the proposal in the ghc-proposals repo. Perhaps the functionality predates that repo.

Aside: Is there a better way to lift a function than &#x60;liftedFun x &#x3D; return $ functions x&#x60;?
 Is there a good way around this? I would like to just import the text and keep playing and testing my code, preferably without having to play laborious for every step.

 ghci &gt; scanl ( flip (:)) [] [3 ,2 ,1] [[] ,[3] ,[2 ,3] ,[1 ,2 ,3]] 
 scanl is like foldl, so isn&#x27;t the first call to the lambda have 2 parameters [] and 3?
 The accumulator and x like:
 (/acc x -&gt; x : acc) --so why is it giving [] as the first element of result? 
 The [] is an intermediate accumulator in the case of scanl? So it&#x27;s like foldl but slightly different?
 This definition on Hoogle for foldl:
 foldl :: Foldable t &#x3D;&gt; (b -&gt; a -&gt; b) -&gt; b -&gt; t a -&gt; b
 vs what I imagined it to be but is wrong:
 fold::(b-&gt;a-&gt;b) -&gt; b -&gt; [a] -&gt; b 
 t a means &quot;the current value of some List of type a&quot;?

                    <span>The documents mode are a tree based data structure. A graph based data structure is more powerful to express task dependency. Even we use some plugin like org-edna/org-depend to express a dependant task of a headline h1 who isn&#x27;t a descendant of h1, all functions on subtask can run only for descendant of a headline.
 For instance, what will happen if 2 projects p1 and p2 depend a same task t1. t1 is a descendant of p1. And we want know the progress of p2, the progress of t1 won&#x27;t be integrated to calculation of progress of p2.
 To solve this problem, org mode should integrate the notion of symbolic link headline, like in tree based file system, we have file and symlink into a file. I don&#x27;t think org mode will evolve into this direction, because it is designed to write documents. A document don&#x27;t need this feature.
 What do you think about this limit of org mode to become the ideal task management? How you bypass the problem?
 I think to switch into a graph based task management system. Someone know a good open source graph based task management system? If possible like emacs, is fully customizable.

                    <span>Hello,
 I&#x27;m attempting to create a template for making labels with Org-Mode &amp; org-pandoc (Latex PDF).
 What I still want to do is justify the text so that it&#x27;s centered, and add an option to increase text size (to more economically use whitespace as needed).
 This is my progress so far:
 #+TITLE: #+DATE: nil #+AUTHOR: nil #+LATEX_HEADER: \usepackage[paperheight&#x3D;0.5in,paperwidth&#x3D;1.5in,tmargin&#x3D;0.04in, lmargin&#x3D;0.1in, rmargin&#x3D;0.1in, bmargin&#x3D;0.04in]{geometry} #+LATEX_HEADER: \usepackage[T1]{fontenc} #+LATEX_HEADER: \usepackage[scaled]{roboto} \renewcommand\familydefault{\sfdefault} *Karabiners* 
 #+BEGIN_CENTER &amp; #+END_CENTER do not seem to have any effect on the output. I&#x27;m using Emacs 27.2; latest DOOM, on Fedora 35.
 What I&#x27;m looking for is a couple of one-line commands at the head of the document to accomplish my goals. Any help or input is appreciated.

                    <span>I&#x27;m new to purescript but I&#x27;m understanding the fundamentals pretty well since I have some previous experience learning haskell. I just started looking at concur and it seems pretty complicated. I&#x27;m thinking making a full scale project is going to be alot of work compared to JS since I want to add tailwind and markdown+mermaid among other stuff. Would it be painful to add non purescript libraries to work with purescript?
 The other option I&#x27;m looking at is using Sanctuary + vue, but I love the ADT system in Purescript so much for defining my domain model that I don&#x27;t want to lose it.

                    <span>Hey all, I&#x27;ve been playing around with general and noticed that it&#x27;s doing something weird. Namely, I have &quot;SPC w&quot; mapped to evil-window-map (so I can do &quot;SPC w s&quot; to open a window below or &quot;SPC w l&quot; to move focus right). However, when I evaluate (key-binding (kbd &quot;SPC w&quot;)), it returns (keymap evil-window-map evil-window-map) - that is, &quot;SPC w&quot; is bound to a keymap whose elements are two copies of the evil-window-map keymap. This doesn&#x27;t affect my workflow at all, but it&#x27;s pretty unexpected, and I thought I&#x27;d check on here to make sure I wasn&#x27;t missing something dumb.
 The minimal config I could reproduce it with is:
 (use-package general :config (general-create-definer leader-def :states &#x27;(normal visual motion) :prefix &quot;SPC&quot;)) (use-package evil :config (evil-mode)) (leader-def &quot;&quot; nil ;;to prevent an error about SPC not being a prefix &quot;w&quot; &#x27;evil-window-map)

                    <span>Hi folks - 
 I&#x27;m fiddling around with using transient for building a menu over a CLI. I wanted some insight into typical transient usage. My main use of transient currently is magit. 
 I want to build a transient menu which lets me choose from an arbitrary number of options. I will only know the number of options at run time. How do I paginate this with transient? 
 ​
 for example, show only the first 4 elements and map those to &#x60;a s d f&#x60; and when the user presses &#x60;g&#x60; show the next 4 elements. Or is there a better way of using transient menus with arbitrary lists of options?

                    <span>This is a niche use case. When I use qutebrowser, I have emacsclient as the external editor. I recently took the EXWM plunge. I want to pass the right options to emacsclient so that when it is spawned from qutebrowser (or emacsclient is spawned in general because in exwm, I no longer use it) it spawns as a floating frame. Currently my qutebrowser config.py has the line 
 c.editor.command &#x3D; [&quot;emacsclient&quot;, &quot;-c&quot;, &quot;{}&quot;]
 Your lisp-fu is greatly appreciated.

                    <span>So I have the same problem with almost all languages.
 Including Schemes. What a shame!!!
 All I want to do is fetch a html file from an address(let&#x27;s say from &quot;http://shenlanguage.org/TBoS/tbos_29.html&quot;).
 I can do it in every language, yes. It&#x27;s not difficult. What is difficult to get it done with one function call.
 Even most schemes force me to do at least something like (with-standard-input-from-url....
 Sorry, but that sucks for writing quick (and sometimes dirty) scripts.
 I want one thing - It has to be done in one function call. Period. No compromises here. 
 I found something like (url-retrieve-synchronously ...) and thought I was lucky.
 I was wrong. It gave me a fucking buffer object!!! #
 Fantastic.

For example, one of the most obvious things to do after breaking down and linking up the project is to display it as a network diagram - a graph on which each task is a node, and nodes are linked to those they depend on. This lets you get a high level view of the project, in a way in which manually inspecting :PROPERTY: drawers and decoding org-ids doesn&#x27;t.
 I&#x27;ve done some hacks to create such visualizations in the past, see e.g. this bit of bad elisp that scraps :BLOCKER: entries for trivial ID-based links, builds a graph description and shoves it to Graphviz for rendering. I&#x27;m thinking about continuing developmen…</span>

                    <span>I remember using org-jira successfully when I could authenticate with a password. I tried entering my username and password manually, entering the token as password, using .authinfo and combinations of these, but nothing seems to work.
 org-jira fails, telling me to look at the Messages buffer, where I find this:
 I was called, was it with a callback? yes Fetching issues... [error] request--callback: peculiar error: 400 &quot;JIRA_ERROR - see your *Messages* buffer for more details.&quot; &quot;JIRA_ERROR REQUEST: &quot; &quot;/rest/api/2/search&quot; (:type &quot;POST&quot; :data &quot;{\&quot;jql\&quot;:\&quot;assignee &#x3D; currentUser() and resolution &#x3D; unresolved ORDER BY\\n priority DESC, created ASC\&quot;,\&quot;maxResults\&quot;:100}&quot;) &quot;JIRA_ERROR RESPONSE: &quot; ((errorMessages .

 Is there anything obvious, (except entering my token wrong, which should not be happening considering how many times I tried) that I am doing wrong?
 Thanks!

                    <span>I&#x27;ve released on ELPA the new package kind-icon, which adds simple, lightweight text or monochrome icons to the prefix margin of compatible completion UI&#x27;s, matching by default the font-lock colors of variables/functions/keywords/etc. Many backends like lsp-mode support the :company-kind completion property, which is how kind-icon determines the kind. Since text and icons all take up the space of precisely 3 characters, alignment is always pixel perfect.
 kind-icon is easy to set up, and works either as a &quot;margin-formatter&quot; function (for supporting UI&#x27;s such as the excellent [corfu] completion front-end), or by wrapping the completion function, for other completion UI&#x27;s which can handle the Emacs 28+ affixation-function completion property.
 An example of kind-icon in action with corfu:
 kind-icon with corfu and orderless, in lsp-mode
 And with more than 6500 icons instantly configurable by name, you can easily make it your own...
 Easy configurability

                    <span>I currently have to read a library source code for some project that I&#x27;m working on, so far I&#x27;m very grateful for git-timemachine, magit (magit-blame mostly) and LSP. However, I sometimes find myself wanting to do some other stuff like tracking a function for example and then go back to where I was in the same buffer, there&#x27;s probably some Emacs keybinding for that which I am not aware of.
 So do you guys know how to do this ? also if you have any tips or packages that are useful for source code reading on Emacs I would be very grateful.
 I love this community &lt;3

                    <span>Hello!
 I use nano-modeline, which moves the modeline to the header spot. However, this conflicts when trying to use lsp-mode with breadcrumbs. Is there any way I can instead put the breadcrumbs in the modeline position instead? I really like how the modeline looks up top.

                    <span>Hello Haskellers of Reddit,
 This may be an inappropriate question for this subreddit, if so let me know and I will take it down right away, but this is a community who&#x27;s opinions on this matter I respect.
 I love math and computer science and their intersection, and I have a career choice conundrum. Here is what I want: my dream is to work towards a garageband hedgefund. I love the math and programming challenges in finance, I love the control you get over the direction you take, I love the immediate and direct feedback on your work, I love the excitement and the power and the challenge, I love the data accumulation and processing infrastructure you can create, I love the high and low level thinking involved. I want to be able to whole heartedly work towards a career in this field.
 Here is another set of desires: I also want to contribute to society. I want to work towards making peoples lives better. I want to deepen as a person and work towards being a human of heart.
 These two ideas seem to be in direct conflict and have left me floundering directionless during my Masters degree in software and math. I would really appreciate thoughts from this community which seems to straddle a line between math, programming, and passion.

                    <span>I was reading Learn You a Haskell for Great Good. There was this line
  
Notice how we pattern matched on (x :-: xs) . That works because pattern matching is actually about matching constructors. We can match on :-: because it is a constructor for our own list type and we can also match on : because it is a constructor for the built-in list type. Same goes for []. Because pattern matching works (only) on constructors, we can match for stuff like that, normal prefix constructors or stuff like 8 or &#x27;a&#x27;, which are basically constructors for the numeric and character types, respectively.
  
Here the code comes from hs infixr 5 :-: data List a &#x3D; Empty | a :-: (List a) deriving (Show, Read, Eq, Ord) 
 Can you please elaborate this section please.

                    <span>i need help switching from vim
 ok so I&#x27;ve been using vim for a bit and mainly I was just learning programming so it was no problem, but lately I feel like I need a better development environment.
 So I&#x27;ve read a thing or two about emacs and emacs is I think exactly what I need. 
 Problem: I spent a lot of time to customize vim. lots of scripts, functions, mappings so now I really dont feel like switching to something else but I dont have a choice. I tried watching some videos on youtube like emacs introduction something like that, but they dont seem very helpful
 So: if you can give me some documentation or any kinda resource i can read or watch whatever so i can pick up emacs and start writing asap, the more in depth stuff I&#x27;ll learn as I use emacs thruout. 
 Thanks

                <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/qxq0uh/idiomatic_way_of_defining_bindings_with_a_common/">

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(1 min)</span>
                    <span>Taking inspiration from Doom, I&#x27;m using a &quot;local leader&quot; setup to bind mode-relevant commands, like:
 (general-create-definer local-leader-def :states &#x27;(normal visual motion) :prefix &quot;SPC m&quot;) 
 This way, I can do stuff like (local-leader-def :keymaps &#x27;ledger-mode-map &quot;r&quot; &#x27;ledger-report), making it super easy to access the report when I&#x27;m in ledger mode with a quick SPC m r. However, this approach starts to break down in more complicated scenarios, such as:
 (local-leader-def :keymaps &#x27;org-mode-map &quot;a&quot; &#x27;(:ignore t :wk &quot;attachments&quot;) &quot;a a&quot; &#x27;org-attach &quot;a d&quot; &#x27;(:ignore t :wk &quot;deletion&quot;) &quot;a d d&quot; &#x27;org-attach-delete-one &quot;a d G&quot; &#x27;org-attach-delete-all &quot;r&quot; &#x27;(:ignore t :wk &quot;refile&quot;) &quot;r r&quot; &#x27;org-refile) 
 First, this is kind of ugly - Org has a ton of features, and I try to use a lot of them, so some of my key sequences can get pretty long. I end up retyping the same prefix many, many times, sometimes with multiple layers of the (:ignore t :wk &quot;foo&quot;) trick (as seen above).
 Second, (and more annoyingly, IMO) doing it this way &quot;shadows&quot; the which-key description for modes which share a prefix. That is, if I&#x27;m in ledger mode and type &quot;SPC m&quot;, it yields the suggestion &quot;r -&gt; refile&quot; instead of &quot;r -&gt; ledger-report&quot; as it should.
 I&#x27;ve been futzing around with general&#x27;s &quot;:prefix-command&quot; and related facilities to try and figure out a way of avoiding this second issue, but so far I haven&#x27;t been able to get anything to work. Since my current strategy is ad hoc and not based on any best practices I&#x27;m aware of, I thought I&#x27;d ask here if there&#x27;s a canonical/idiomatic way of using general&#x27;s capabilities to define groups of similarly-prefixed commands without breaking which-key.
 (Also, why is there a distinction between :prefix-command and :prefix-map? When do you need to store a keymap as the value of a function instead of as variable or vice versa?)

                    <span>The documentation states nothing other than how to set it up in org-roam buffer and that by enabling it in org-roam-mode-section-functions, yet org-roam-unlinked-references is not found in the functions to be used.
 What am I missing?

                    <span>Hi everyone,
 I&#x27;ve been diving into learning some emacs over the last week or so as I&#x27;m interested in possibly switching over from using neovim (primarily because I want org-mode). I&#x27;ve been deep diving into a lot of new things and trying to set up alternatives for my major nvim workflows, but one that I&#x27;ve been having a ton of trouble with is searching and the previews for it in particular. In my projects I make heavy use of Telescope within neovim and one of the major reasons that I love it is the ability to preview grep results from files in my project directory within a separate window. I like being able to get more context from the search without actually opening up a new buffer. I&#x27;ve set up Ivy and Counsel and was trying to get the same functionality working, but I&#x27;m having a heck of a time with previewing. The closest I&#x27;ve come is realizing that after using counsel-projectile-rg that I can use ivy-next-line-and-call functionality to move the current buffer through the search results with C-M n or C-M p, however, that actually opens the buffer and populates my buffer list. Does anyone know if there&#x27;s some sort of functionality to open a new preview window and navigate through those search results in it by default with C-j (I&#x27;m using evil mode). Essentially I&#x27;d always like this type of preview whenever I&#x27;m doing searches. Also, I&#x27;m not attached to any particular completion or search framework, so if this is easier in something like Helm then I&#x27;d be open to solutions from that as well. I attached a gif of what I&#x27;m talking about working in Telescope

                    <span>I created an eshell module a while ago that I use. 
 Here&#x27;s the description:
  
em-compile tries to determine what commands it should defer to a 
 compilation buffer, and alerts you when it&#x27;s done. It determines 
 which commands it should defer by keeping track of how long each 
 command took to finish. By default if it takes more than 5 seconds 
 then it will start to defer that command whenever it&#x27;s invoke via 
 eshell. You can of course customize the amount of seconds or offer 
 a list of always defer or not defer.
  
Link: https://github.com/gopar/.emacs.d/tree/main/lisp/eshell/module
 I have no interest in making this into a package (i was at one point but not anymore), so if you want to turn it into something. Go for it :)
 Have you created anything that you&#x27;ve been hiding? :)
 Also, plz ignore the messy config files. Too lazy to clean up.

                    <span>This topic is difficult to google, therefore I ask:
 Some of my notes will be changed from time to time. Information will be replaced (e.g. I&#x27;m regularly borrowing a book to people and the note remembers to whom I lend the book currently).
 The deleted information is not of much use, but sometimes it could be necessary to recover it (e.g. after a while the book got tatty, so I&#x27;d like to know its history of borrowers).
 (Note: the above book example is just an example to explain a concept)
 Would it be practical to create a git repository out of my org-roam notes folder, or are there unwanted side effects with that approach (i.e. inconsistent database, confused org-roam, ...)?
 Edit: thanks for all the positive feedback, that keeping org-roam notes in a git repository is possible and works.

                    <span>Hey!
 I&#x27;d like to add a face definition to whitespace-mode&#x27;s customize group faces, so that I can pick that color, but I can&#x27;t figure out how to do it. Could anyone give me any pointers?
 Specifically, I&#x27;d like to pick this one from org-mode:
 (defface org-hide &#x27;((((background light)) (:foreground &quot;white&quot;)) (((background dark)) (:foreground &quot;black&quot;))) &quot;Face used to hide leading stars in headlines. The foreground color of this face should be equal to the background color of the frame.&quot; :group &#x27;org-faces) 
 But I don&#x27;t know how I&#x27;d do that. I also don&#x27;t know what the background function does here or how this works. All I know is that this makes characters invisible unless you highlight them or otherwise change the background color, which is what I want.
 The name of the face doesn&#x27;t matter as long as it does what the above face does.
 Any help would be much appreciated. Thanks!

                    <span>I&#x27;m currently using General for leader-key bindings, and I have various categories of keybindings under different prefix keys like &quot;f&quot; for files, &quot;b&quot; for buffers, etc. I use SPC as my leader key, so to access my file related commands I would press &quot;SPC f&quot;, where I would be presented with a list (via which-key) of my file related keybindings.
 Ok I&#x27;m sure many of you are with me so far. Here is my question: I&#x27;d like to create keybindings for language-specific commands, but I don&#x27;t want to create a separate prefix key for each language. What&#x27;s the best way to manage that?
 One idea I&#x27;ve thought of is to use &quot;l&quot; (for &quot;language&quot;) as a prefix key for whatever language mode I&#x27;m in. So if I&#x27;m programming in Scheme, and I press &quot;SPC l&quot; it would bring up my scheme keybindings. But if I was in javascript, and I press &quot;SPC l&quot; it would bring up my javascript bindings.
 However I&#x27;m not sure how to implement that. I&#x27;m a bit of a emacs noob to be honest.
 Is there some other recommended way to deal with this? I&#x27;m open to other ways of organizing.
 Another idea I thought of is to create another level of prefix keys under &quot;l&quot; where each key would bring up the keybindings for a given language. So maybe &quot;SPC l j&quot; would bring up the javascript menu, and &quot;SPC l s&quot; would bring up the scheme menu. This is something I probably could do without too much trouble, but I prefer the first approach.
 Any help appreciated, thanks!

                    <span>To use tramp, I use the find-file function and type in the following.
 /ssh:user@hostname:/
 Now on the very last forward slash, my emacs just hangs there for a really long time. Nothing pops up on the Messages buffer, and it takes a long time before the line 
 [Opening connection for user@hostname using ssh... \]
 appears in the mini buffer. And the line
 Tramp: ‘getconf PATH’ not successful, using default value &quot;/bin:/usr/bin
 appears in the Messages buffer.
 In the meantime, the CPU usage for emacs jumps to ~30%.
 Does anyone know what could be the problem?

                    <span>So I&#x27;m trying to make an emacs package that rips off Rofi-Beats. Hopefully using completion eventually to choose a station.
 ; lofi mode (setq lofi-playing nil) (defun cader/lofi () (interactive) (if lofi-playing (cader/kill-lofi) (cader/start-lofi) ) ) (defun cader/kill-lofi () (async-shell-command &quot;killall mpv&quot;) (setq lofi-playing nil) ) (defun cader/start-lofi () (async-shell-command &quot;mpv \&quot;http://stream.zeno.fm/f3wvbbqmdg8uv\&quot;&quot;) (setq lofi-playing t) ) ; no window for async shell command (add-to-list &#x27;display-buffer-alist (cons &quot;\\*Async Shell Command\\*.*&quot; (cons #&#x27;display-buffer-no-window nil))) 
 It works, but it is very basic currently. My problem with it is that I wind up with a lot of Async Shell Command buffers. I&#x27;d like to have no buffers created from the function. Is there something besides aysnc-shell-command that I can use?
 ​
 I also have to answer y/n to 
 A command is running in the default buffer. Use a new buffer? (y or n) 
 when cader/kill-lofi is called. How do I just make it exit without additional input?

                    <span>Hi, we were trying to figure out an ideal way to represent Semver. There are a few ways we&#x27;ve tried representing semver however each has its drawbacks. Here are the 3 possible implementations we&#x27;ve considered each of them have drawbacks:
  
Simple data type data Version Natural Natural Natural
 
Sum type data Version &#x3D; Major0Minor1Patch0 | Major0Minor2Patch0 | Major1Minor0Patch0 | Major1Minor1Patch0
 
Use a sum type on each major minor patch version. This is the approach we are currently taking: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;haskell data Patch &#x3D; Patch0 deriving (Eq, Show, Generic, Enum, Bounded)
 
 data Minor &#x3D; Minor0 | Minor1 deriving (Eq, Show, Generic, Enum, Bounded)
 data Major &#x3D; Major0 deriving (Eq, Show, Generic, Enum, Bounded)
 data Version &#x3D; Version { major :: Major , minor :: Minor , patch :: Patch } deriving (Generic, Eq, Show) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Requirements:
 Serialization/deserialization via aeson
 Complicated pattern matching
 This is important with event sourcing as some consumers may not care about minor version changes only major version changes.
 If we have a new major version and we don&#x27;t handle it then we want to fail to compile.
 1: Wouldn&#x27;t give us strong compile-time guarantees. I don&#x27;t know all actual versions we have.
 2: Forces us to handle all versions even if the consumer does not care. I don&#x27;t have a way to say I only care about Major versions.
 3: Lets us handle only major version changes, and we know all possible major versions. However, we are representing a product and can introduce versions that don&#x27;t really exist. e.g. if we have 0.1.0, 1.0.0, 1.1.0 then if we create a 1.2.0 we are now also representing 0.2.0.
 I&#x27;m curious if anyone has an alternative representation that might be better. Thanks!

                    <span>I&#x27;m happy to announce that the first release candidate for upcoming text-2.0 with UTF-8 underlying representation has been just uploaded on Hackage: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/text-2.0/candidate
 Changelog: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/text-2.0/candidate/changelog
 Please give it a try.
 What&#x27;s next?
 In the next couple of months I&#x27;ll be working with maintainers of downstream packages to identify migration opportunities. The plan is to patch entire head.hackage (which includes, for instance, pandoc) before cutting a final release of text-2.0.
 Thanks to Ben Gamari&#x27;s efforts, text submodule in GHC source tree has been already bumped to 2.0-rc1. The next major release of GHC (9.4, ~Q3 2022) will ship with text-2.0.

 What packages you use, which linter, etc. What other helpful things do you use ? 
 P.S: I googled around for some tutorials but most seem outdated, I know I can use some more specific IDE&#x27;s but I would like to continue using Sublime.

                    <span>So as I understand, something like this
 data List a &#x3D; Nil | Cons a (List a) 
 is considered a sum type because it is a sort of set theory &quot;sum&quot; or &quot;disjoint union&quot; of the two constructors. A disjoint union, as I understand, is just when you have a union of sets that have nothing shared; you &quot;summed&quot; the sets. So we imagine our List above a sort of disjoint union of Nil and Cons a (List a). Correct? What gets confusing is from a Wikipedia article on Algebraic data types :
  
In set theory the equivalent of a sum type is a disjoint union, a set whose elements are pairs consisting of a tag (equivalent to a constructor) and an object of a type corresponding to the tag (equivalent to the constructor arguments).
  
The disjoint union article was fairly understandable, but I&#x27;m not making the connection between my List above and this quote above about tags and constructors and constructor arguments. Nice if someone could shine some light on this for me.

                    <span>Hello!
 I&#x27;m trying to set up a capture template for a weekly status update I send my manager. I want the org document organized by the dates of the Mondays of the week. I am trying to use &#x27;file+headline&#x27; target. Is it possible to have the headline set dynamically?
 Something like the following? 
 (setq org-capture-templates &#x27;((&quot;d&quot; &quot;Demo template&quot; entry (file+headline &quot;demo.org&quot; &quot;&quot;) &quot;** Content Start\n%?&quot;) )) 
 I appreciate any help!

                    <span>I keep getting this error trying to access M-x org-agenda then &quot;t&quot; for a global TODO list. Should be simple, right?
 I have been following DT, System Crafters, etc. I even went to a very basic ~/.emecs.d/init.el file with 5 commands to setup Org and org-agenda with the requisite org-agenda-files list pointing to one org file with 2 TODOs.
 I have tried this on a ThinkPad Ext Gen 4 running Ubuntu 21.10 and a ThinkPad w520 running Ubuntu 21.04. But, I keep getting the same error. I am running Emacs 27.1 on both. But, I tried 27.2 earlier with same results.
 Is anyone else having issues? I was only able to find one helpful mailing post regarding a change to the Org installation doc as follows: &quot;Important: You need to do this in a session where no &#x27;.org&#x27; file has been visited ...&quot; - not sure what I should do with this.
 My next attempt will be to reinstall Ubuntu and then install on another distro. I suppose, I could also try pre-27 emacs versions, but I like the 27 upgrades.
 Anyone have any idea what could cause this (before I reinstall)? 
 Thank you in advance!

                    <span>A tree model isn&#x27;t the ideal model to represent the tasks.
 If few projects depend a same task, we can&#x27;t express it with tree model without redundancy. A graph model is better.
 It seems org-edna allow express the graph dependency of task (I never have use it).
 But org-edna miss some operation on graph, for instance visualize dependency graph of tasks.
 In https://karl-voit.at/2020/08/14/project-mgt-draft/, the author use plantUML to visualize dependency graph of tasks. But he doesn&#x27;t haven say how he generates the code of plantUML from org headline.
 I think maybe org-roam could be a better approach to interact with the dependency graph of tasks.
 Does it is possible to integrate org-roam to org-edna to interact with the dependency graph of tasks?

 Founded in 2015, IO Global (previously IOHK) is one of the world’s pre-eminent blockchain research and engineering companies, best known for the Cardano blockchain platform.
 I’m hiring for our Atala team who have developed a Digital Identity and Verified Credentials product – www.atalaprism.io. We use Scala for the backend, and Kotlin to define a software development kit for JVM, Android, iOS, and web platforms. Our infrastructure is currently defined in Terraform and runs in AWS and we are experimenting with Nomad and Kubernetes for orchestrating our services. We have an automated test suite, and we are applying Continuous Integration (CI) practices.
 As a Software Engineering Lead, you will be the role model for our engineers and technical architects. You’ll still be writing high quality code and reviewing PRs, so we are looking for people with a passion for Scala and who like to solve complex problems.

                    <span>I am trying to figure out the difference between a full keymap vs a sparse keymap. Looking at the documentation I can see that it claims full-keymaps are faster:
 22.4 Creating Keymaps make-keymap &amp;optional prompt [Function] ... A full keymap is more efficient than a sparse keymap when it holds lots of bindings; for just a few, the sparse keymap is better.&quot; 
 From reading about this in the manual I have 2 question:
  
Why is a full keymap more efficient than a sparse keymap? Is it just because of the overhead of accessing an element in an alist vs a char table?
 Is there a definitive way to determine when to use a sparse-keymap vs a full keymap?

                    <span>Hello!
 I&#x27;m attempting to finish up a package that uses comint to wrap around an external REPL.
 The program itself has tab-completion already, but obviously running it in a comint buffer doesn&#x27;t allow for the tab-completion. In the REPL, pressing TAB on say some-module.s will bring up all the available functions that match and pressing TAB again will cycle through them.
 How does one go about having this functionality in a comint buffer? Or is it better to make use of term or vterm?

                    <span>I usually possess the TeX input method enabled in org-mode, so I can type mathematical formulas or even‍ simple subscripts easily. However, when I enter code in org-mode via &#x3D;foo_x&#x3D;, I actually want this disabled, so &#x3D;foo_x&#x3D; doesn&#x27;t become &#x3D;fooₓ&#x3D;. Is that possible somehow?

                    <span>Is there an updated guide on how to enable emacs to use ibus-anthy?
 I have found this guide: https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/IBusMode
 But the problems is that it does not work anymore.
 I have tried the set-input-method for japanese but it does not work well with converting hiragana to kanji.
 I would like to use ibus-anthy since all of programs already use that.
 So far I have set this in my /etc/environment:
  
export GTK_IM_MODULE&#x3D;ibus
 export XMODIFIERS&#x3D;@im&#x3D;ibus
 export QT_IM_MODULE&#x3D;ibus
  
I have tinkered with the .Xresources file as well but none of the options did work.

                    <span>The title explains it all, the bar was fine until today (default doom emacs status line). I was using emacs for C development with lsp-mode and vterm but for some reason the bar started to look like this after I restarted the emacs.

                    <span>Time for another hls release!:
  
@pepeiborra has done an epic work to improve performance, redefining some of the core pieces of HLS 
 You can take an overall look to improvements in these slides
 Performance would be noticeable in large projects without too much template haskell usage
 
 We have fourmolu support for ghc-9.0.1 thanks to @georgefst
 We have got improvements over import suggestions thanks to @yoshitsugu and @alexnaspo
 Completions also has been improved in general thanks again to @pepeiborra

                    <span>There&#x27;s lots of change (daily it seems) as things are updated for the new arch. It seems that some people have managed to get things built during this transition. Most of the options I have tried, however, have failed to produce any builds at all. I&#x27;ve been on nix. I&#x27;ve tried stack. Nothing works.
 I am certain some people have gotten it all to work, but the canonical sources for installing have not allowed me to build even a basic Hello World project and such knowledge for how to do so seems scattered in mindspace now as far as I can tell. 
 My goal is to just code with Haskell. I&#x27;m willing to do any hacks to just compile my code and explore. Tips?

                    <span>Hey there,
 I am currently working on a project for College involving Scotty/Blaze libraries for web server needs. When I began working on the project, I could build the application using stack, with no problem at all, and recently, I moved the project for other reason and it won&#x27;t compile anymore, saying the following. On other computers, it works well, so I am wondering where I did wrong...
 I tried to install the correct version Win32 using stack install Win32-2.13.1 yet it did not helped much, and also tried to purge my Haskell installation from my computer, yet it did not solve a bit.
 Please remove if not relevant to the r/, I am so frustrated right now...

                    <span>Hi all
 I&#x27;m looking for a way to automatically replace placeholders with text upon export. 
 So let&#x27;s say I write a standard tekst like this:
  Hello {{{Name}}} 
 I would then be able to, upon export, replace {{{Name}}} with whatever I define it as at that moment.
 Is anything like that available? Or any pointers on what to search for?

                    <span>The ([https://orgmode.org/manual/References.html](manual on org-table references)) currently claims it is possible to make remote(NAME,REF) references to cells of org-tables in other files. No example is provided, and I can find nothing on stack exchange.
 Is this really a thing? If so, what is the right syntax for NAME to refer to table remote-table in other-file.org?
 Thanks in advance :)

                    <span>When I do a search for a tag, sometimes I get tags that begin with the same characters but have additional characters. This is annoying. For example, #idea returns #idea and #idea_index. I&#x27;m using Obsidian, by the way.
I was thinking of adding a character at the end of the tags. For example, ;, , or .. But, I&#x27;d have to change the tags manually since the Tag Wrangler plugin won&#x27;t let me add those characters. And that can take some time.
I could use Obsidian&#x27;s tag: search operator. Instead of searching for #idea, I type tag:idea and get what I want. I&#x27;d prefer to stay software-independent, so no thank you.
I couldn&#x27;t find anything on this around here or in the Obsidian forum.
So, I would like to ask how you guys go about this. Mind sharing?</span>

                    <span>This post is quite long, so for a TL;DR take a look at my github and specifically the last two functions of that section which essentially document what I did.
 Hello r/emacs
 Recently I was facing an issue with my org roam config. Specifically, I wanted to share my notes on a subject with a friend and I realized how annoying it is to select every note that points to an index and copy it to a folder which I can share with someone. The easiest solution I could find was to open the org-roam-dedicated-buffer of the index and slowly mark every file there in dired and finally copy them to a location. But that is really slow to do.
 So, since this is emacs, I decided that if a feature doesn&#x27;t exist, you just create it yourself. Today I found the time to work on this and got a working result. Not…</span>

                    <span>I use Gnus to read my mail, and it is good. But emails come in with a hyperlink embedded. I would like to be able to see where this link points without clicking on it. Right now the only work-around I&#x27;ve found is to open the email as HTML in my browser, and THERE hover over the link to see where it points. There must be a better way, but neither web searches nor customization searches have helped me here. How can I see the target of a link from [Gnus] article mode viewing HTML emails?

                    <span>So I just upgraded to Emacs 27.1 from ‏‏‎ 26.3 and was wondering about what masses put in their early-init files. If anyone wants to show off their awesome configs, I would highly appreciate it. Also, I know for the most part we want to place things that are not GUI related, but do we have to provide the file? Or does emacs find it on its own in the ~/.emacs.d directory? Anyways, Tips are greatly appreciated for a newbie like me!

                    <span>So, I&#x27;m using i3wm, and I would like to bind a key which will create a new frame in whatever i3 workspace I am in.
 For example, the way I have configured i3 right now is so that Windows key + F will bring up a firefox window. So, I can press Windows + F where-ever and a new firefox window spawns. I want to do the same with emacs, but with new frames rather than emacs instances. (Frames are faster to create, and I have some idle timers that sync directories which would be unnecessarily duplicated when more than one emacs instance is spawned.)
 Is this possible? For reference, my firefox configuration in i3 is simply bindsym $mod+f exec firefox. Is there for example a exec emacs --create-frame-from-existing-instance?

But when I type to the colon in find-file &quot;/ssh:user@host.com:&quot;, it gives me this error and I cannot proceed. &quot;Error in post-command-hook (vertico--exhibit): (void-function tramp-ensure-dissected-file-name)&quot;
 I thought it was a vertico issue, but even if I disabled vertico mode, it still raises a similar error. &quot;completion--some: Symbol’s function definition is void: tramp-ensure-dissected-file-name&quot;
 The definition of function tramp-ensure-dissected-file-name is missing, but I could not find the definition of it in all the tramp source file.
 I tried to toggle-debug-on-quit but no useful information is given. toggle-debug-on-error does not help either.
 Does anyone know what is going on? I use straight.el btw, I am not sure if that is the issue, because the tramp I am using is the latest git version.

                    <span>Hi Guys,
 I am working with a lot of TCL files where each file defines a new namespace and have class/proc definitions under the new namespace. The regexp way of creating tags for TCL mentioned here only gets the tags for procs. It doesn&#x27;t qualify them with the namespace information.
 Tag Tcl files: etags --language&#x3D;none --regex&#x3D;&#x27;/proc[ \t]+\([^ \t]+\)/\1/&#x27; *.tcl 
 I wrote a script to parse each of the TCL files and then dump out the tags for classes, its methods and procs qualified with the proper namespace information.
 for example:
 # File: f1.tcl namespace eval ::A::B { ::A::Util::new_class create C { method M1 {} { ... } self { method SM {args} { ... } } }; # class C proc P1 {} { ... } }; # namespace ::A::B 
 The tags I generate for this file are as follows:
 ^L f1.tcl,189 namespace :…</span>

                    <span>I work for a tiny company (7 developers) which offers a sophisticated financial model. Our core software was written 20 years ago in C, and our new development is in a proprietary scripting language. This scripting language was never really meant to be used so widely, and it&#x27;s becoming difficult/painful to maintain. I have gotten really into functional programming lately so I started thinking about it as a solution. Specifically, I want to slowly replace all this code in our proprietary language with code in an off-the-shelf, functional language. Enter Haskell: from all my research, it emerged as my favorite choice. Fundamentally, our model just does a bunch of math on many lists of numbers (to give more context: the big competitors to our model are Excel spreadsheets). Haskell seems well …</span>

                    <span>Hey, I&#x27;m experimenting with literate coding. In the process I couldn&#x27;t properly evaluate a block. I wanted to use both:results output and :export both, and I&#x27;m getting troubles to make those work with :defines. This is the code I have: 
 #+property: header-args :includes  #+property: header-args :defines cool_macro(x) x #+property: header-args :exports both #+property: header-args :results output #+begin_src C printf(&quot;cool_macro(7): %u\n&quot;, cool_macro(7)); printf(&quot;cool_macro(7): %u\n&quot;, cool_macro(7)); #+end_src 
 As it is, both :exports and :results have no effect. I figured that if I place them above the :includes then they&#x27;ll have effect, but I get a compilation error because it cannot find the macro, as if now both :includes and :defines doesn&#x27;t have effect.
 If I place those 2 after the #+begin_src C then everything works as expected, but it&#x27;s inconvenient since I want those to affect the whole buffer..
 #+property: header-args :includes  #+property: header-args :defines cool_macro(x) x #+begin_src C :results output :exports both printf(&quot;cool_macro(7): %u\n&quot;, cool_macro(7)); printf(&quot;cool_macro(7): %u\n&quot;, cool_macro(7)); #+end_src 
 Am I doing something really wrong or what?
 Thanks.

                    <span>Here&#x27;s the POC code to generate a table report, I put it as an org-mode dynamic block to help me deal with the table data management.
 https://gist.github.com/Trevoke/c91cc8c97476f681f82f9ce44efdac9b
 ​
 e.g. do this:
 #+begin: clockreport-by-project #+end: 
 and hit C-c C-c on the begin line.
 It generates this:
 ​
 #+begin: clockreport-by-project | | 2021-11-15.org | 2021-11-16.org | |------------+----------------+----------------| | EA | 0.18 | | | internal | 0.83 | | | management | 0.47 | 1.70 | #+end: 
 ​
 It makes two big assumptions:
 * you use a PROJECT property on things you clock
 * you are using files named after the day of the year (e.g. &#x60;2021-11-16&#x60; but really whatever makes sense for you)
 ​
 * right now it&#x27;s not using any of the clocktable report filters, e.g. &quot;thisweek&quot; -- that&#x27;s a relatively easy change you can make on line 14
 * You can adjust the path to the files on line 15.
 ​
 When you run this, it will take you away from the buffer where you put the dynamic block. I don&#x27;t yet know how to not do that, I thought save-excursion would do it, but obviously not.
 ​
 feedback and improvements welcome :D

                    <span>let&#x27;s say I have a chain of sub projects defined in the build.sbt:
 lazy val a &#x3D; (project in file(&quot;a&quot;))
 lazy val b &#x3D; (project in file(&quot;b&quot;)).dependsOn(a)
 lazy val c &#x3D; (project in file(&quot;c&quot;)).dependsOn(b)
 ...
 and so on (actually 11 of them)
 each of them has its own version.sbt file, like that:
 version :&#x3D; &quot;2.3-SNAPSHOT&quot;
 question:
 is there a way / plugin / sample configuration that will trigger the build from the certain project in the middle, let&#x27;s say, project c
 and rebuild everything from c to the end of the chain, incrementing the major/minor version depends on some command / setting. 
 I use sbt-release plugin, it works well for any other project which has only one version.sbt for all subprojects in the repo
 but here I need to maintain a different version for each subproject
 Actually, this isn&#x27;t rocket science, but probably this thing is already created.
 Thanks in advance

                    <span>During my internship at Tweag, I worked on creating a
safe interface for the sparkle library under the excellent mentorship of Facundo
Domínguez. sparkle is a Haskell library that provides bindings for
Apache Spark using inline-java’s Java interop capabilities.
As such, this new safe interface accomplishes the same
thing that inline-java’s safe interface does; it helps to ensure safe
management of Java references at compile-time using linear types.
As discussed in this earlier post,
we need to be careful to free Java references provided by inline-java when they’re done
being used, and we also shouldn’t use them after they’ve been freed. Since sparkle
manipulates references to Java objects defined in the Spark Java library, any potential users
must take care to safely manage references when…</span>

                    <span>I just downloaded the free trial of The Archive. I read the Welcome page and also the App Guide. But I still don&#x27;t understand something very basic to the program. How do I actually go about creating a link to another note, for example to appear as [[202111151211]] in the note I am working on?
I can search in the Omnibar, find the note I want to link to, copy and paste the link into the new note I am working on, but this seems very complicated. Is there a better way?</span>

                    <span>I found a way to update the agenda buffer every 10 minutes when Emacs is idle for 3 seconds by using
  (run-with-timer 3 600 #&#x27;org-agenda-maybe-redo) 
 While the countdown timer runs in the background, Emacs freezes for the duration of the update. I want to have the agenda buffer update asynchronously so that it does not freeze Emacs.
 This answer seems to suggest there is no way to do this.
 I tried making sense of this but could not.
 Finally, I tried to wrap the function in async-start but even that did not work.

                    <span>Recently I&#x27;ve been keeping track of time I&#x27;ve worked using this very simple format: time: 8:58-12:10 1:30-5:00 5:20-6:00 Typically a day‍ fits easily on a single line, with the advantage that it&#x27;s not a major mode and can be ancient with modes such as (ORG, reStructuredText, MarkDown... etc). I keep this in the same document I maintain my work log. Recently I extracted this functionality into a package to clock in/out, and reports a summary of the last time: as well as accumulating all available times (which I use to show the time worked in a week). Link to the utimeclock repo. Locally I have the mode-line display the accumulated time for the day &amp; week which I quite like. Although this would need some more work to split out from my init file (see this question) since it&#x27;s piggy backing on which-function. ---- Before creating the package I checked on other time tracking utilities, as far as I can tell they&#x27;re more verbose, and don&#x27;t fit so easily into editing a text document which happens to contain a time log. Feedback welcome.

                    <span>One of the common complaints with the Haskell ecosystem is the existence of libraries with little expository documentation. Sometimes these libraries are quite useful and, in fact, are part of the mind space of the more seasoned members of the community. Yet, for a newcomer such libraries can seem impenetrable. Yet is all hope lost? The code is there after all. That’s the documentation, right!?
 What are your strategies for familiarizing yourself (to the point of pragmatic proficiency) with a sparsely documented library? 
 Do you have any stories or tales of a time when you achieved something “great” in such a case?

                    <span>For context: I’ve been using Haskell for about five years now, and loving it. I consider myself a relatively intermediate Haskeller, insofar as I understand and regularly use the more advanced parts of GHC. Though I rarely use it in production (as almost all my programming is for personal projects of interest), I find myself extremely productive in Haskell, and can generally get GHC to do what I want.
 Except when what I want is good performance. It’s not that I don’t know about laziness: I know what it is and (roughly) how it works, and I take advantage of it often enough. It’s not that I’m unaware of space leaks: if the profiler shows a great big triangle shape, or my program slows down as it runs, those are usually pretty good signs that I have one.

                    <span>I am on a sabbatical to reevaluate priorities in my life and decided to finally take a deep dive on the language after knowing about many years ago.
 It&#x27;s been a daily lesson on humility. For most other languages, one week of studies at the end of a work day plus the whole weekend would be enough to have a firm grasp of its fundamentals and make decent stuff. But with Haskell it&#x27;s been three weeks from monday to monady and it is kicking me hard on the butt, nuts, teeth and anyplace else that hurts. I think this is more related to the way I think as an imperative programmer (more than OO or even immutability) than being a difficult language. Maybe it is a difficult language. I don&#x27;t kow.

                    <span>Let&#x27;s say I am working on multiple Haskell projects, some of them using cabal as the main build system, some of them using Stack, some of them are just libraries, some also have executables, and they don&#x27;t all always use the same version of GHC (that changes through time of course). Some of these projects are mine, some are not mine and I am contributing via a fork.
 What is the best way to maintain my tools/toolchain so that I can easily switch between the projects without too much hassle?
 Specifically, the things I find tricky is:
 - Ensuring I use the correct version of &#x60;stan&#x60;, since it needs to be compiled with the same version of GHC as the project.- Ensuring I use the correct version of &#x60;hls&#x60;, since it needs to be compiled with the same version of GHC as the project.

                    <span>Hello everyone,
 I am trying to write a report in org mode of which the references are handled by org-cite. So far, everything is working really well, meaning I am able to include references from a .bib and export them to a .pdf via latex-export without any major issues.
 However I noticed the inline citations in the final pdf, print the citation number twice like so: &quot;1[1]&quot;. I would like to get rid of the first &#x27;1&#x27; in a way the result looks like: &quot;[1]&quot;. I am probably (not) doing something that causes this. 
 Here is what I do to replicate the issue:
 references.bib:
 @article{hello, title&#x3D;{Hello}, journal&#x3D;{Journal of Hello}, author&#x3D;{Test McTesty}, year&#x3D;{2018} } 
 test.org:
 #+TITLE: Test #+AUTHOR: Test McTesty #+CITE_EXPORT: csl &quot;~/Repositories/styles/ieee.csl&quot; #+BIBLIOGRAPHY: references.…</span>

                    <span>I have been using Scala and following it for years. Scala is declining in usage because Java is becoming better and Kotlin is getting pushed hard and is a smaller step for many Java developers. Personally I really love the Scala language over all the other languages I have tried. I have been following on Twitter and on Reddit and the only thing I feel is that I want to stay as far away from that mess as possible. I sugest the leaders in the comunity to travel somewhere and get a professional mediator and resolve all issues. You don&#x27;t have to be friends after that but at least stop making Scala look more like daytime soap opera than an excellent comunity with smart people. You all want this to succeed. Perhaps it is more complicated and I&#x27;m being naive but from a bystanders perspective it looks pretty bad.
 The reason why I went to all the Scala conferences was because of all the smart people and the technology. Please bring back that focus and become that comunity again.
 As said before I don&#x27;t have the details. I&#x27;m just describing how it looks from my perspective and others might feel different or that it&#x27;s to complex to resolve these issues.

                    <span>I did a little searching on the forum and didn&#x27;t find a whole lot about this idea. (the main thing I found was someone&#x27;s setup for creating journal entries) A lot of new note-taking applications (e.g.: Roam, Craft) have the idea of creating a dedicated note for specific days of the year when you access the application. This allows for easy access to journaling, creating stuff that you&#x27;ll see on specific days, idea entry that you can sort later, etc. which I personally find to be quite nice. I don&#x27;t necessarily always have some specific title in mind for something I want to write about, or even links to other things.
This seems to be a bit at odds with how The Archive wants to nudge you into adding to your Zettelkasten. And just basically somewhat opposed to the idea of creating atomic notes that are heavily interlinked, since it&#x27;s more of a scattered &quot;note&quot; that might just have thoughts about stuff on a specific day. But I also wouldn&#x27;t want to give up the ability to link to things in my Zettelkasten (and have stuff in separate locations, because goodness knows I&#x27;ve used a lot of applications and have notes scattered everywhere), or searchability across everything, because I want to write stuff related to specific days. (I have made at least one note in the style of the linked post, using just YYYYmmdd, which maybe just solves the issue but I haven&#x27;t done much with that idea yet so I&#x27;m not sure how it might work out long term)
Does anybody have experience working with &quot;Daily Notes&quot; in The Archive/Zettelkastens in general? Is there something specific you do to make it work well? Is this discouraged? etc.</span>

                    <span>When I create a indirect buffer, the major mode &amp; all minor modes are inherited by the indirect buffer. Turning off the major or minor mode in indirect buffer is reflected in the original buffer. 
 Is there a way to disable this?

                    <span>Just wanted to share a small bash script for moving between emacs and i3 windows with just one set of keybindings. &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 !/bin/bash
 if ! [[ &quot;$(xdotool getactivewindow getwindowclassname)&quot; &#x3D;&#x3D; &quot;Emacs&quot; &amp;&amp; &quot;$(emacsclient -e &quot;(windmove-$1)&quot;)&quot; ]]; then i3-msg focus $1 fi
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; Then just call your script with the direction (eg. emacs-i3 left). To see a much better and more involved example refer to this great blog post: https://sqrtminusone.xyz/posts/2021-10-04-emacs-i3/

                    <span>ie. show which files in one not the other, ignoring file contents.
 What I want (faster) is achieved by: 
 ls -1 firstdir &gt;a
 ls -1 seconddir &gt;b
 ediff-files a b
 ​
 ediff-directories is great if I want to see which files are different but I don&#x27;t see with it which filenames are missing from the other directory.

                    <span>Hey there! I&#x27;m using Emacs 28.6.0 from flatwhatson pgtk repository. I compiled every elisp code while compilation using make NATIVE_FULL_AOT&#x3D;1. My Emacs sometimes lag and on idle both of Emacs and Emacs Daemon uses 4-5% CPU. However, while profiler stats shows byte-code is 70% responsible for this load. What is this, can anyone please elaborate.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve spent 2 days scouring the internet for answers on how to make company work with proper code completion, however I can&#x27;t seem to find a solution that just works on my emacs installation. I only chose company because it seemed to be the most efficient and best choice, however I am doubting that now.
 I&#x27;m asking for help here as a last resort to find solutions or personal fixes of all kinds to get simple code completion (including variable names) inside emacs using whatever module is best. What I have in mind is VSCode-like code completion with the drop down menu we can go through, however if there&#x27;s an alternate kind thats fine as well. Whatever help you have, keep in mind I&#x27;m a relative emacs newbie, so if it could be explained simply / explicit config lines that would be most helpful.
 Thanks in advance.

 I was following this article which is for 27.1 but I guess the fedora packages should be similar https://freesteph.info/blog/compiling-emacs-27-1-on-fedora.html

                    <span>When I press return from an item in a list, then it automatically indents without the list heading. I would like to have a setup (that is common in other software) where the normal return gets me the next item (with heading), and a backspace would remove the heading (and the indent) altogether. Are there variables I may customize in order to achieve this behavior?

                    <span>Hello everyone!
 Looking to hear from people who tried both Orgzly and Organice as org mode for mobile.

                    <span>Hi, I am using a fresh install of Debian 11 (Bullseye) and Emacs 27.1
 The only Meta key that behaves as expected is the left hand side of the space bar. I need both to behave as modifiers otherwise emacs is very difficult for me to use.
 ​
 I have started with emacs-gtk -q --no-init-file to ensure it isn&#x27;t something I have enabled. The only way it works is to run emacs in the virtual console with no X.
 Even emacs in X terminals (gnome, xfce, Mate etc.) still have the right Meta disabled.
 Does anyone have an fix? Thanks!

                    <span>Am trying to sync a NextCloud calendar to org calendar. It connects fine, showing sync state with some events from my NC calendar. When I sync again it complains that it cannot find a calendar UID.
 (use-package org-caldav :init ;; calendar configurations (setq org-caldav-url &quot;https://bla.bla:1443/remote.php/dav/calendars/user/&quot;) (setq org-caldav-calendars &#x27;((:calendar-id &quot;org-test&quot; :inbox &quot;~/Documents/org/calendars/org-test.org&quot; :files (&quot;~/Documents/org/calendars/calendar.org&quot;)))) :config (setq org-icalendar-alarm-time 1) (setq org-icalendar-timezone &quot;Europe/Amsterdam&quot;) (setq org-agenda-files (list &quot;calendars/calendar.org&quot;))) 
 While the paths are correct, the inbox and files org files remain empty, so the events aren&#x27;t added?

                    <span>Non-technical Emacs newbie here trying to get a shell prompt in order to download some youtube vids.
 I&#x27;ve tried to write some functions but I cant find how to get prompted in order to paste the youtube url. 
 I&#x27;ve tried with a defalias function
 (defalias &#x27;you (lambda() (interactive)(shell-command &quot;/usr/bin/./yt-dlp -f18 -P~/Videos-Youtube-Downloads&quot;))) 
 And also with a defun function
 (defun youtube-download () &quot;download youtube video&quot; (interactive) (shell-command &quot;/usr/bin/./yt-dlp -f18 -P~/Videos-Youtube-Downloads&quot;))&#x60; 
 Both works but I do not get prompted to paste the youtube url. What am I missing in order to get prompted so I could paste the youtube url?
 Thanks in advance.
 New Edit: Working now. Thanks to @RadicalDownist / @ieure
 (defun youtube-download (Y-URL) &quot;Download Youtube Video&quot; (interactive &quot;sPaste YouTube URL: &quot;) (shell-command (format &quot;%s %s&quot; &quot;/usr/bin/./yt-dlp -f18 -P~/Videos-Youtube-Downloads&quot; Y-URL))) 
 If you do not want any shell output buffer. Replace shell-command line with:
 (call-process-shell-command (format &quot;%s %s&quot; &quot;/usr/bin/./yt-dlp -f18 -P~/Videos-Youtube-Downloads&quot; Y-URL nil 0)))

                    <span>Very recently I switched to native compilation branch of emacs (aka gccemacs). It works nice so far.
 Now a few questions arrived.
  
How to clean up eln-cache? I have multiple files of the same package, all the same size. Probably the older file is obsolete, can I identify obsolete files by its date? Is there already some available mechanism to use for deleting obsolete *.eln files?
 Example:
 -rwxr-xr-x 1 user user 628720 13. Nov 01:06 yasnippet-026a6aeb-f8d0d467.eln
 -rwxrwxr-x 1 user user 628720 12. Nov 20:11 yasnippet-4376b1db-f8d0d467.eln
 
Emacs is distributed with lot of lisp files, all those compiled *.eln files are kept at ~/.emacs.d/eln-cache/*/. The result is, every user on the system needs to compile those lisp files and every user allocates HDD|SSD memory for those lisp files. Is it possible to keep those *.eln files at a central location on the HDD|SSD (e.g with the emacs installation)? How to do that?

                    <span>Hello /r/emacs,
 recently I&#x27;ve been working a lot with tables (with text rather than numbers), and for the first time in years I came to the conclusion that Emacs is not the best tool for a task (especially one it could in principle be good at), and thus for now I&#x27;m doing my tables in Google Docs. 
 table.el is in principle suitable, but 
  
it is not snappy,
 having multiple lines per cell requires empty lines between them, otherwise they will be collapsed into a single line (since I need multiple lines per cell I can&#x27;t use the org-mode table editor)
 it has its own separate mode which doesn&#x27;t work well with org-mode (particularly I&#x27;m missing lists and org-ref links)
 it is easy to mess up the table structure by accidentally typing on the lines,
 it cannot temporarily hide rows or columns (a Google Sheets feature I didn&#x27;t expect to be so handy) and
 both navigating around and repositioning columns and rows is rather tedious.
  
Of course it is still a great piece of software, but I think it can be improved. I&#x27;ll start to tinker with it soon-ish, but my elisp knowledge isn&#x27;t the greatest, so I thought I&#x27;d ask here if anybody has ideas where to start. In particular, I have the hunch that child frames can be used to address the lack of snappiness, the empty lines issue and the lack of org-mode integration, but I haven&#x27;t used them much myself, so perhaps someone with more experience has thoughts about their appropriateness. Also if there are other ideas how to improve editing text tables I&#x27;d love to hear them.
 Cheers!

                    <span>Hi, I&#x27;m having a terrible time with haskell. I&#x27;m taking a class in college, office hours are offered but only when I&#x27;m working and i can&#x27;t make it in for help during them. I&#x27;m looking for someone available in the evenings 7 or later EST. The first topic I&#x27;m looking for guidance in would be parsing. 
 Thanks

                    <span>Hey there,
 currently I&#x27;m trying to learn Haskell but I am a person that depends heavily on exercises or practicing
 their newly acquired knowledge. I&#x27;m following learn you a Haskell and Real world Haskell but
 I&#x27;d like to get more experience and knowledge by doing exercises..
 Could someone point me in the right direction and to some exercises or old homeworks?
 Thanks in advance!

                    <span>Data.Vector.Unboxed essentially gives a Structure of Arrays representation - Vector (a,b) can be stored as (Vector a, Vector b). 
 This has some minor issues - deriving doesn&#x27;t really work, writing the typeclass by hand is really annoying, GHC cannot optimize away dead reads if you only use one field - but overall it&#x27;s a reasonably nice and composable abstraction.
 I&#x27;m currently playing with some code which accepts messages and must store them efficiently before they get batch-executed. To make this extensible I&#x27;d like some freer monads, more extensible effects style interface, composing the command enum like Either Op1 Op2.
 But my usecase could be seen as a mildly wonky Op-Based CRDT which means the operations commute and order doesn&#x27;t matter. It would be really nice if internally I could store everything as (MVector Op1, MVector Op2)behind the scenes.
 This lead me to a number of questions:
  
Is there an array-of-sums representation that stores Vector (Either Op1 Op2) as (Vector Op1, Vector Op2)?
 Is there a better way to derive unboxed vector boilerplate? I have seen https://hackage.haskell.org/package/vector-th-unbox-0.2.2/docs/Data-Vector-Unboxed-Deriving.html before but it feels like DerivingVia should be able to handle it if the monad was constrained to be representational
 Are there interface ideas to manipulate unboxed vectors structurally? Say, lift projection functions like Vector (a,b) -&gt; Vector a? In my case also things like pop one Op1 value, or take all Op2 values
 Is there an approach to structurally manipulate types in Haskell? Most code in Haskell only folds over the generic representation but e.g. StrictCheck has some tooling to add a functor at each level of a type, typescript has a bunch of tools for this like
  
 
type ExtractPII &#x3D; { [Property in keyof Type]: Type[Property] extends { pii: true } ? true : false; }; 
 If people have ideas to any of these points I&#x27;d really like to hear about them!

                    <span>Hello, I am working on two functions that filter values from a list of Cupcake type objects, and I am getting a &quot;Pattern match(es) are non-exhaustive&quot; error when running them, which causes any example I try on them to give me *** Exception: Assessed3.hs:(25,1)-(31,67): Non-exhaustive patterns in function priceRange.
 I really don&#x27;t see anything wrong:
 priceRange :: Price -&gt; Price -&gt; [Cupcake] -&gt; [Cupcake]
 priceRange minprice maxprice [] &#x3D; []
 priceRange minprice maxprice [CC p i] &#x3D; [CC p i | pricelower minprice p, pricelower p maxprice]
 where
 pricelower :: Price -&gt; Price -&gt; Bool
 pricelower (P x) (P y) 
 | x&lt;&#x3D;y &#x3D; True
 | otherwise &#x3D; False
 Assessed3.hs:25:1: warning: [-Wincomplete-patterns]
 Pattern match(es) are non-exhaustive
 In an equation for ‘priceRange’:
 Patterns not matched:
 (P _) (P _) ((CC (P _) []):_:_)
 (P _) (P _) ((CC (P _) (_:_)):_:_)
 |
 25 | priceRange minprice maxprice [] &#x3D; [] 
 For this it says I didn&#x27;t match the two cases in which the list inside is empty or non empty but I really don&#x27;t see how that will give me an error.

                    <span>Learn You a Haskell says, &quot;The most common use case with flip is calling it with just the function
 parameter and then passing the resulting function on to a map or a filter. &quot;
 I saw this: https://stackoverflow.com/q/14397128/9481613
 But what are some use cases?

                    <span>Hi,
 I just set up a new host with Xubuntu 20.04 LTS which comes with GNU Emacs 26.3 (build 2, x86_64-pc-linux-gnu, GTK+ Version 3.24.14) of 2020-03-26, modified by Debian.
 Of course, I&#x27;m reusing my config from here which worked on Emacs 28.0.50 (my previous host that died and had a snapshot release installed which I could not re-install) and which still works on Emacs 26.3 on another Xubuntu 20.04 LTS machine - the very same Emacs version.
 Therefore, I&#x27;m puzzled of this error message on startup:
  Debugger entered--Lisp error: (void-function make-closure) make-closure(#f(compiled-function (url arg) #) &quot;ftp&quot;) byte-code(&quot;\300\301\302\303#\210\304\211\203\035\0\211@\300\001\302\305\306\005\&quot;#\210\001A\266\202\202\007\0\207&quot; [org-link-set-parameters &quot;help&quot; :follow org-li…</span>

                    <span>Hi,
I use the &quot;Saved Searches&quot; heavently, so the included Icons don&#x27;t tell me enough about the saved search. I&#x27;ve for example &quot;Saved Searches&quot; for Lisp and for Haskell programming.
The easiest way would be to use the language specific icons, so I&#x27;ve done this, but the Icons looks not so nice in the sidebar (I use the small icons), they are blurred. Is there is a Icon size, I could use, so the icons I create look as good as the built-in ones? :-)

Best regards
Michael</span>

I am new to this wonderful forum on zettlekasten.
I came across this method through the Smart Notes book I picked up a few years ago, that I read in and off. But in recent months I started the process all over again.
I don’t own a Mac so I am missing out on The Archive. My current setup that I am evaluating is

                    <span>Hey all,
 I have the following in my config
 (setq org-stuck-projects &#x27;(&quot;+project+LEVEL&#x3D;1&quot; (&quot;NEXT&quot; &quot;IN-PROGRESS&quot; &quot;WAITING&quot; &quot;DONE&quot; &quot;CANCELED&quot; &quot;DELEGATED&quot;) nil &quot;&quot;)) 
 And when I list stuck projects I get the correct output.
 The problem comes when I use the org-agenda-custom-commands like so:
 (setq org-agenda-prefix-format &#x27;((&quot;r&quot; &quot;Weekly Review&quot; ((agenda &quot;&quot; ((org-agenda-skip-function &#x27;(zin/org-agenda-skip-tag &quot;work&quot;)))) (tags-todo &quot;+tickler-DEADLINE&#x3D;{.+}-SCHEDULED&#x3D;{.+}&quot;) (stuck) ;; problem here (todo)) ((org-agenda-sorting-strategy &#x27;(priority-down)) (org-agenda-files &quot;~/.emacs.d/org/weekly-reivew-agenda-files.org&quot;)))) 
 Whenever I run this custom view, the list of stuck projects that is being produces is different than whats produces when I run the stuck projects command alone. I&#x27;ve tried passing the same list as I have above but doesn&#x27;t change anything. I&#x27;m not sure how to debug this :(
 ​
 Org mode version 9.4.4 (release_9.4.4 @ /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/Resources/lisp/org/)
 Any ideas/hints would be appreciated! :)

                    <span>Hi folks,
 Yesterday, I finished up putting my first custom keyboard together. It comes with a lot of extra keys, a couple of which are bound to &#x27;Hyper&#x27; by default. &#x27;Hyper&#x27; is a &#x27;modifier&#x27; provided by QMK (the firmware that powers this board) that maps to pressing &#x27;Control-Alt-Super-Shift&#x27; all together. Because there are no default mappings in the Hyper space, it seems like a good place to put some global Emacs shortcut keys that will absolutely-for-sure not ever get clobbered.
 While it would be easier to bind C-M-s- instead of H- and get more or less the same effect, I would like to be able to utilize C-x @ h (event-apply-hyper-modifier) as an option to &#x27;gracefully degrade&#x27; on computers where I don&#x27;t have my keyboard (for example: the Chromebook I occasionally play with Emacs on). That way those global binds can stay available and reasonably within reach. It doesn&#x27;t seem possible to chain C-x @ mod application functions together, but even if it were possible, chaining 4 of them together would get really old really quickly.
 I would prefer for this to get handled by Emacs instead of getting handled by the OS, just for that extra level of &#x27;don&#x27;t need to account for some random specific machine configuration&#x27;, but I&#x27;m open to suggestions on what to do there if no good options exist on the Emacs level. My main machine (the one the keyboard lives at) runs mostly Fedora Workstation, and sometimes Windows 10 Pro (though I almost never use Emacs in Windows).
 Thanks, all.

                    <span>I have been editing a lot of nginx conf recently, but I found that Emacs doesn&#x27;t auto indent for me in conf-mode.
 Is there a built-in setting to enable indentation in conf-mode? Or do I need to install an extra package to achieve this?

 Typically the files shown in Deft have the date/timestamp aligned to the right, but often times the date/timestamp end up moving a few spaces to the left for no particular reason.

                    <span>[SOLVED] Thank you all!
 I am attempting to create a custom theme using ThemeCreator, but this problem also appears for other custom themes that aren&#x27;t installed in bare Emacs, but come from the color-theme-modern package.
 For these themes, and the one I created and installed from a local file, the colors appear to be broken in my terminal (bash via GNOME terminal on Manjaro + GNOME). Using TERM&#x3D;&quot;xterm-256color&quot; changes nothing, and in fact using TERM&#x3D;&quot;xterm&quot; is slightly better (in the sense that it&#x27;s closer to the original theme).
 I suspect something fishy is happening though, as the real issues set in after I agree to run the Lisp from these themes. For example, let&#x27;s say I&#x27;m running wombat theme but want to switch to taylor. Everything looks fine (or what I consider fine) in wombat, I navigate up to taylor and hit enter, the colors change to something that looks nice but probably isn&#x27;t Taylor (maybe some previous selection that isn&#x27;t wombat), but then as soon as I allow the Lisp from Taylor to run, I get an absolutely horrible scheme that is almost unreadable.
 All appears well in GUI Emacs, but I am not interested in using that unfortunately.
 I have also tried other, more esoteric settings for the TERM variable, but to no avail. Any help would be greatly appreciated!

                    <span>Data.Functor.{Product,Compose,Sum} define instances of many type classes. While both the Deriving Via paper and the corresponding repository offer examples for letting newtypes derive via these functors, they all don&#x27;t compile with a current GHC. As many other features are showcased in the same examples, I haven&#x27;t managed to grasp what parts I need and where I need to make adjustments. A straightforward failed attempt at what I want to achieve would be:
 newtype MyPair a &#x3D; MyPair (a,a) deriving Applicative via (Data.Functor.Product (Identity a) (Identity a))
 I&#x27;d be glad if someone can help me out. I would also happily take code that only works on GHC 9.

I told him about static generators and Hakyll from u/jaspervdj but the internationalization piece was missing. Of course there are other generators with internationalization but... Well here is one for Hakyll. * Generator source code * Use case and its source code --- If it already exists, ‏‏‎ please hide that fact from me. If not and if you enjoy it, please use it at will. There is a public docker image at registry.gitlab.com/swi18ng/swi18ng:latest for quick testing purpose if needs be (don&#x27;t forget to add -e LANG&#x3D;C.UTF8 if you use some special characters). And of course, don&#x27;t hesitate to give me some feedback. This would be greatly appreciated! &gt; P.

                    <span>Example org file
 * Title ** TODO subtitle1 :tag1: subtitle1 body ** TODO subtitle2 :tag1:tag2: subtitle body ** TODO subtitle3 :tag1:tag2: more body text 
 When I filter by tag2, it displays the entries subtitle2 &amp; subtitle3, but won&#x27;t display the body text. 
 Is there anyway to display the body text along with the titles?

                    <span>I&#x27;ve finally come around to updating to org version 9.5. A change that I&#x27;m a fan of is the default for org-adapt-indentation is now nil since 9.5. However, my primary org file has been written with the hard indentation from org-adapt-indentation t. Is there an easy way to logically remove the preceding whitespace from this? I&#x27;ve tried using delete-whitespace-rectangle, but this doesn&#x27;t preserve the indentation of subsetted bullets.
 Is there any way to essentially shift the hard tabbed indentation to the left to remove the spaces but preserve the structure?

                    <span>Happy Saturday Fellow Scala People!
 Quick announcement that Indigo 0.10.0 is now available for all your FP Scala.js game building needs.
 This release features a completely re-written Clone system for when you just have to render thousands and thousands of things, and new variation on the theme called Mutants! It also contains many bug fixes, API improvements, and performance enhancements - it even works on Windows!
 Please note that this is the first Scala 3.1.0 version, so if you have an existing project you&#x27;ll need to upgrade!
 Full release notes: https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/indigo/releases/tag/v0.10.0
 The docs are - possibly for the first time! - up to date and are now fully checked by mdoc: https://indigoengine.io/docs/quickstart/setup-and-configuration
 We now have a Giter8 template! You could have a simple game up and running on your machine in 5 minutes - why not give it a shot? :-)
 To get started, try &#x60;g8 PurpleKingdomGames/indigo.g8&#x60; or &#x60;sbt new PurpleKingdomGames/indigo.g8&#x60; from your command line.

                    <span>How do you use org-roam for a Zettelkasten (ZK)?
I am interested in your init.el, in key-bindings, in capture-templates, tags (+filetags or others), categories (+category), other helping packages or other magic stuff I have never heard about. How is your org-roam specific ZK-workflow?
There is a lot of very good tutorial stuff out there about org-roam but not from experienced ZKlers. Even David Wilson (SystemCrafters, Emacs From Scratch) talks about that topic but do not dive into it very deep.</span>

                    <span>After using The Archive for some time,  there is one feature I couldn&#x27;t get used to it: the ESC shortcut for Reset Search. It happens quite often that while I&#x27;m writing a note I end up pressing ESC twice in a row (for example to cancel a search in the note, or the spelling box), and suddenly I lose the view of the note. While I can easily go back to the note, it still takes a bit of time to find the line I was at. Plus, there is an annoying break in the flow.
I was wondering if others had a similar experience and if they have a solution. Maybe redefining ESC with Keyboard Maestro, in such a way that one can still use this to cancel the other boxes (find, spelling etc.)? I find the role of ESC to Reset Search more intuitive in the Omnibar (when it&#x27;s active), rather than in the body of the note itself.</span>

                    <span>Hello! I&#x27;ve posted this to r/spacemacs as well, but I thought somebody here also experienced this problem.
 I&#x27;ve been experimenting with Org Agenda recently for my school schedule, birthdays and other TODOs. I saw on the Org layer site that it can have agenda notifications and I thought &quot;Great, I can have an useful agenda now that can remind me stuff!&quot;
 But I simply haven&#x27;t been able to get it working no matter what, this is what I have for my org layer in .spacemacs:
 (org :variables org-enable-github-support t org-enable-reveal-js-support t org-enable-org-journal-support t org-enable-hugo-support t org-enable-sticky-header t org-enable-valign t org-enable-notifications t org-start-notification-daemon-on-startup t) 
 Here&#x27;s my Spacemacs config, if it&#x27;s required. (also, I&#x27;m on the develop branch and it&#x27;s up to date with HEAD).
 Anyway, if I add this in my agenda:
 * TODO Go for a walk  * TODO Go shopping  
 I don&#x27;t receive any notifications for those 10 minutes prior. Is there something I&#x27;m missing? Is it something wrong with perhaps org-wild-notifier that seems to be the Org Agenda notifier thingie? Thanks for your time!

                    <span>There are a couple of simple ways to track the progress of your tasks in org-mode
 Simple todos:
 * TODO foo * DONE bar 
 Statistics cookies:
 * tasks [1/2] ** TODO foo ** DONE bar 
 But what if I want to track tasks like these:
 * Jump 20 times [13/20] * Read 3000 words [1340/3000] 
 It doesn&#x27;t make sense to break down this kind of tasks into subtasks, but I still need to track their progress in numbers.
 Ideally, I would also want org-mode to &quot;understand&quot; these numbers so that I can search/sort them out later.
 So, is there a good way to do this in org-mode?

                    <span>Just wanted to say that the new landing website is shaping up pretty nicely. I particularly like the Features page, which I wish I had when I started using Emacs. Org mode has so many features that sometimes I think newcomers get overwhelmed, and this page summarizes the most important ones and has plenty of links to good resources.
 I also use the Quickstart and the not yet complete Syntax pages when I want to remember some of aspect of the markup language.
 Thank you to the people putting in all the effort.

 I like to write in a light theme, but would prefer dark background for shell out of habit. Am using modus-themes.
 Is this something y&#x27;all have experimented with and see how it performs?

 is there any way to have it rank paths with exact substring matches higher than ones where all the letters are present but with tons of other things in between?

 While on the text/html line I am typing . o w3m RET I get the message displaying w3m /tmp/...done yet w3m doesn&#x27;t launch.
 If I use firefox instead of w3m the command sequence works fine.
 Am I missing a config setting somewhere? Or is the internal w3m confusing things?
 Thanks.

                    <span>i run emacs built locally from an up-to-date savannah clone - currently &quot;GNU Emacs 29.0.50 (build 1, x86_64-pc-linux-gnu, GTK+ Version 3.24.30, cairo version 1.17.4)&quot;. the OS is an up-to-date fedora 35 instance (KDE, not Gnome). 
 i&#x27;m using it to work with some scala 3 code courtesy of metals (0.10.9) and LSP. that&#x27;s because i can&#x27;t bring myself to invest time in vs code and because i&#x27;ve already set the record for intellij idea bug reports related to their scala plugin and scala 3:-). until recently, this setup worked well. 
 but during the last week, something strange started to happen. i use the tab bar in multiple windows. in one window with primarily text files, i was able to use the mouse to interact with the bar successfully (e.g. selecting a tab, closing a tab). but in a window dedicated to working with scala 3 code, use of the mouse with the tab bar began to fail.
 any attempt to interact via mouse button one triggered the error &quot;  is undefined&quot;. &quot;&quot;? &quot;describe-key&quot; only sees the &quot;&quot; event, no &quot;&quot;. if i switch from Scala mode to Fundamental mode, normal behavior returns (the mouse can select tabs, close tabs, etc). if i turn Scala mode back on, the failures return.
 i&#x27;m looking for suggestions about how to debug this. thoughts/comments?

                    <span>Yesterday I made a virtual machine with Debian 10 xfce and when I use emacs and hover over characters and it highlights it, it shows a different size. Idk how to better explain it but I can show exactly what happens:
 how it shows on small characters like &quot;;&quot; https://imgur.com/a/axr9Ot4
 how it shows on bigger characters like &quot;x&quot; https://imgur.com/a/S6pgAkl
 ​
 I really need to fix this cause i wanna work on this new machine instead of ubuntu. On ubuntu this issue is non existent.

                    <span>Over the past half year or so, I have really come to love Emacs and would like to contribute to this wonderful project. I sometimes do programming livestreams and typically use Emacs as my editor to try and introduce it to those who may not even be aware it exists. Since I am not much of a LISP developer, I feel like this is the best I can do to support the software and get more people using it; but I have found myself wondering how else I can contribute or introduce more people to Emacs. In my experience, once people realize how cool and versatile it is, they quickly become curious about its various functionalities. How can I help Emacs maintain its longevity?

                    <span>Hi guys,
 I&#x27;ve been iterating over my previous shot at a Big Sur style icon and I&#x27;ve produced a new version that I consider to be more polished and hopefully a bit less amateurish. The changes are:
 - The background is now vectorized and sports a slight shadow at the sides and bottom, this is based on a svg template for Big Sur icons. It should be easy to make the background circular or squircular for those of you that prefer so.
 - I further smoothed the curves by removing extra degrees of freedom.
 - The logo shadow is now blurry and less opaque.
 - There is a subtle radial gradient that spotlights the logo and turns darker near the edges.
 - The upper and lower halves of the logo are slightly more proportionate.
 I&#x27;ve learned the basics of Inkspace and, against my expectations, I actually enjoyed using it :)
 I&#x27;m sharing a png image and its svg source (not permalinks, sorry, I promise to keep them online for some weeks at least).
 - png: https://drive.google.com/file/d/14BDnwlGa17ds0CZI1kNBNghqt4TSqVEl/view?usp&#x3D;sharing
 - svg: https://drive.google.com/file/d/14L_roGCSD9dMnhL4Cq3w2_sfP4vvlk0_/view?usp&#x3D;sharing
 Hope you like it.

                    <span>I prefer isearch over evil-search as the evil-search-module but one thing that bothers me is that pressing escape during a search leaves the point at the current match instead of going to where the search was started.
 As a workaround, pressing Ctrl-g during the search instead of Escape imitates the vim behaviour which I like .
 Is it possible to make the Escape key send Ctrl-g just during evil/isearch?

How can I do that with package package? Or I must install other package managers like use-package, straight in order to achieve this? The reason is that I want to keep my setup minimal

 Haskell has separate namespaces for types and values. When types and data constructors share a name, Haddock, Haskell’s documentation generator, can get confused. In this post I show how to disambiguate types and values in Haddock documentation.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve looked around a bit and haven&#x27;t seen any examples of how you might differentiate different types of org link visually, perhaps with a font-lock; specifically differentiating the protocol (not the link content)
 For example, [[id:some-guid][Link Name]] would be a different color than [[file+emacs:file-path][My File]]. 
 Has anyone tried to do this before? 
 Just to clarify, the idea is not to apply different styles when publishing, but rather in-buffer. 
 (Bonus: how would you hook into a theme palette when specifying color?)

                    <span>Hi all.
 I&#x27;m learning spark, in an exercise I have used transform in spark sql query, it is this one:
 spark.sql(&quot;&quot;&quot;
 SELECT celsius,
 transform(celsius, t -&gt; ((t * 9) div 5) + 32) as fahrenheit
 FROM tC
 &quot;&quot;&quot;).show(false)
 I have defined the dataframe as follows:
 val t1 &#x3D; Array(35, 36, 32, 30, 40, 42, 38)
 val t2 &#x3D; Array(31, 32, 34, 55, 56)
 val tC &#x3D; Seq(t1, t2).toDF(&quot;celsius&quot;)
 tC.createOrReplaceTempView(&quot;tC&quot;)
 I am trying to do the same but without using spark sql, but I can&#x27;t do it. This is the code works in Databricks azure cluster,:
 tC.withColumn(
 &quot;fahrenheit&quot;,
 transform(col(&quot;celsius&quot;), f &#x3D;&gt; ((f * 9) / 5) + 32)
 ).show(false)
 In IntelliJ IDEA does not work. The errors are:
 - Cannot resolve symbol *
 - Cannot resolve symbol /
 - Cannot resolve symbol +
 Thanks for your help

                    <span>I have been working with Scala (Functional) and Clojure for the last ~ 4 years but I still can&#x27;t give a proper brief answer whenever someone asks me &quot;Hey, what is FP and why should I use it?&quot; 
 I generally start with concepts like immutability, local reasoning, referential transparency, functions as first class citizens, currying etc. But I soon find myself going all over the place. For example, I find myself giving unconvincing arguments when someone asks me &quot;what practical benefit does referential transparency actually provide to the developer?&quot;
 There are arguments like imperative programming depends on the order of execution of statements, while FP is declarative. But FP also depends on the order of execution (you insert into database and then read, you can&#x27;t do vice-versa). Sure, you can say that &quot;ordering&quot; that we are talking about here is in the context of mutating global state. There isn&#x27;t any global state in FP. But at the core of it ordering does matter right?
 Then there is the argument that immutability allows use of different cores in parallel. But I have never seen this happening in any business application, i.e, immutability used to parallelize processing. Sure, making a value immutable makes it thread safe (since no one can change it). But most real life scenarios require mutability. So we model them as Atomic, Ref etc and make them thread safe. But these things exist in imperative languages as well. So, what exactly is the connection between immutability and parallel processing &amp; thread safety.?
 Then we have the lazy evaluation of IO which provides referential transparency. I have used IO and I love it. But I can&#x27;t seem to find practical/objective points as to what benefits it provides. So when I say that all my DB operations and external API calls are an IO, I again find myself giving unconvincing answers about their benefits.

                    <span>Occasionally, I would like to find posts that I made on this forum, in response to a &quot;discussion&quot; started by someone else.  I find this difficult to do.  I can find discussions that I started easily, but not ones to which I only contributed.
I have tried using the &quot;search forum&quot; capability, but it is not helpful unless I can remember something specific and unique about the discussion and what I posted.  And in any case, it feeds the request into my default search engine (Google or Duck Duck Go, or whatever), which somehow diffuses the search.
Sometimes looking at the &quot;mentions&quot; will help, if someone commented on your post, but not that often and you still have to wade through a lot of not relevant material.
Am I missing something?  Is there some way to see my past posts (on someone else&#x27;s discussion)?</span>

                    <span>Is there any way to configure Org-roam or a similar wiki plugin to have separate libraries per project?
 I&#x27;m using Org as a scrivener replacement and I want to keep my novel wikis separate from one another and accessible in the tree view, but Roam seems to be a one-per-system kind of thing, unless I&#x27;m missing something in the settings.

                    <span>Hello, I do use that https://github.com/zonuexe/right-click-context/blob/c3c9d36ffbc9fb2bc7c2c4b75291dbcdb1c5f531/README.org
 from melpa stable. I kindly ask how do I :
 1) get the example working 
 ;;RIGHT CLICK MOUSE MENU (right-click-context-mode 1) (require &#x27;datetime-format nil t) (let ((right-click-context-local-menu-tree (append right-click-context-global-menu-tree &#x27;((&quot;Insert&quot; (&quot;FooBar&quot;getPosition :call (insert &quot;FooBar&quot;)) (&quot;Current Time&quot; :call (insert (datetime-format &#x27;atom)) :if (fboundp &#x27;datetime-format))))))) (right-click-context-menu)) 
 I get aforementioned menu in scratch buffer on start ... but when emacs fully loads the menu it is the default one
 2) make the menu contain:
  
xref-find-references for text which is marked in region
 xref-find-definitions for text which is marked in region
 ack for text which is marked in region

                    <span>When I use org-roam, I often want to insert a link to another org-roam node, but I find the completions seem little janky when using the brackets [[]]. Is it somehow possible to insert a link by finding it using an interface similar to org-roam-node-find?

 I have a modified version of Spacemacs. I used to run an emacs from scratch version now I use Spacemacs and like it... I always run from gui
 Target Goal: make the background transparent in emacs
 Stretch Goal: Ideally I could use the scroll+hotkey or some other key combination to adust.
 ​
 Thanks!!!

                    <span>My font setup looks as belows.
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;elisp
 (set-face-attribute &#x27;default nil
 :family &quot;FiraCode Nerd Font&quot;
 :height 130
 :weight &#x27;regular
 :width &#x27;normal)
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 But FiraCode does not support italic, so currently my emacs can&#x27;t display italic.
 I found another font that supports italic and matches FiraCode font: Dejavu Sans Mono
 Now I want to mix both fonts. Main font must be FiraCode and I hope only italic letters are displayed by Dejavu Sans Mono.
 Is it possible for emacs to do this? I hope so and I am expecting it can do that. How can I write proper configuration to achieve that?

                    <span>Hello! I am a new user of emacs, and really exploring the configuration options around. But I just found some very annoying aspects that are driving me crazy.
 First:
 How on earth can I just use tabs in a sane way?
 In VSCode I found tabs pretty smart. Press the key once, and it dropped you on the correct indentation level for the line, press it more times and it inserted spaces to your liking. In emacs apparently the default behavior stops at the first part, but for example, in PHP I&#x27;m writing a SQL string and to avoid wraping I press enter, but then it goes to the beginning of the line and if I press tab it just won&#x27;t work because it thinks it is still at the correct level of indentation. and to correct the string I have to press space for doing so. I have no idea how to search for this in google, and the few posts I found give no solution whatsoever, and some say &quot;just get used to it&quot;.
 Second:
 Are modes always &quot;wonky&quot;? For example, I am writing PHP at the moment, and web mode is pretty deficient for it, inserting a &quot;&gt;&quot; character when I write &quot;&lt;&quot; in a comparison because it thinks I&#x27;m writing an html tag. For that I installed PHP-mode, and now... formatting the file is impossible because it says that clang-formatter is not found. For web mode I installed Apheleia, and it works fine, but now I can&#x27;t use it with PHP-mode. So how can I configure it so it works?
 And when I was just using web-mode, it suddenly, and apparently at random, just go back to fundamental mode. And had to enable web-mode manually several times. This is what made me install PHP-mode in the first place.
 I hope someone has an idea of how to fix this stuff, or at least point me in the right direction. Thanks in advance!

 However, version 9.2.1 of that package seems to have a dependency that has been included to deliberately make it impossible to build (depends on unbuildable (&gt;1 &amp;&amp; &lt;1)).
 Is there an ETA when a working version will arrive on Hackage or some kind of workaround for this issue? I could not find anything on the GHC issue tracker.

                    <span>I have a project with ~200 hundred files and I wanted to move all of them one level deeper, so that all of my modules become prefixed with the name of the project. This results in me needing to rename all the module names, all the imports of those modules, and then also qualified calls in the code.
 Compiler guides me through that but it is a lot of manual work so I wrote a small script that does most of the work for me - it updated module names to reflect their paths and also corrects old imports to use the new name (it doesn&#x27;t take care of qualified calls though).
 Script is pretty naive, in the sense that it uses just regexes and therefore risks false positives, but it actually worked very well for my use case, I had only 2 false positives which I easily fixed. I still needed to do manual work to find those false positives and I needed to correct qualified calls, but it still felt like much less work than without using the script.
 Script: https://github.com/wasp-lang/misc/blob/master/hs-fix-modules.hs .
 How would you go about this problem, what do you do / use? I tried looking for existing solutions, including retrie, but it didn&#x27;t seem anything out there supports this kind of refactoring.
 If I wanted to make a proper solution that parses the code and looks at AST in order to figure out what needs to be updated -&gt; how would I go about that, where would I start, and is that feasible?

                    <span>I am writing some bit level functions for Word128 data type in Haskell, and one function involves extracting n bits from the t-th least significant bit in a word x. I also intend to write a function that will essentially be a reverse of this above function of extraction (a function that basically restores the extracted bits). I have designed a C pseudo code for the extraction function, and this what I have written so far for the extraction function in Haskell-
 In C :
 extractBits (unsigned int x, int t, int n) mask &#x3D; ((1 Integer -&gt; Integer -&gt; Word128 extractBits x t n &#x3D; x .&amp;. (shiftL ((shiftL 1 n) -1) t)
 The above code seems to be fine type wise. However, a suggested solution that we have for this function is as follows -
 extractBits x t n &#x3D; shiftL ( x .&amp;. (shiftL 1 n-1)) t
 Not quite sure however I think the function above does not seem to be logically the same as my implementation? They are giving different results for some values. Does it have something to do with how overflow is handled by each if these functions? 
 Additionally, I am having trouble thinking about the reverse of this function and how it can be implemented. Any suggestions if possible would be much appreciated. Thank you.

                    <span>Hey guys, 
 I am currently working through the LYAH book and on the bottom of this page it goes into creating a Monad by example. So far, so good... 
 The only thing I can&#x27;t get my head around at all is the final function:
 import Data.List (all) flipThree :: Prob Bool flipThree &#x3D; do a &lt;- coin b &lt;- coin c &lt;- loadedCoin return (all (&#x3D;&#x3D;Tails) [a,b,c]) 
 In my head a &lt;- coin results in a being: [(Heads,1%2),(Tails,1%2)]
 same for b, and for c it results in [(Heads,1%10),(Tails,9%10)] 
 Now.. why does (all (&#x3D;&#x3D;Tails) [a,b,c]) work?
 When I am loading it up in ghci and trying
 all (&#x3D;&#x3D;Tails) [[(Heads,1%2),(Tails,1%2)],[(Heads,1%2),(Tails,1%2)],[(Heads,1%10),(Tails,9%10)] ]
 results in (as expected) countless errors.

                    <span>The red book talks a lot about Laws, but I don&#x27;t understand the concept and why it&#x27;s useful. For example in the chapter 9 about Parser, it says that that map is structure preserving and one can stipulate that law the following way: map(p)(a &#x3D;&gt; a) &#x3D;&#x3D; p
 What does this actually mean and why is it useful? 
 Then they go on to make their laws executable by using a library:
 import fpinscala.testing._ trait Parsers[ParseError, Parser[+_]] ... object Laws { def equal[A](p1: Parser[A], p2: Parser[A])(in: Gen[String]): Prop &#x3D; forAll(in)(s &#x3D;&gt; run(p1)(s)&#x3D;&#x3D; run(p2)(s)) def mapLaw[A](p: Parser[A])(in: Gen[String]): Prop &#x3D; equal(p, p.map(a &#x3D;&gt; a))(in) } } 
 How is this different from testing? What is actually happening?

                    <span>macOS Monterey comes with Shortcuts -- the same facility you may already know from iOS to create automation workflows. Even pretty complex ones, including uploading files via ssh to a server. Didn&#x27;t expect it to be that powerful!
If you have or stumble upon a cool shortcut for Zettelkasten work, please do share!
Here&#x27;s an ages old iOS Shortcut that works on macOS Monterey as well. The classic. Generate Zettel ID 
https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/efb23d9a1e0b463c9d951913ffb913d8
Nesting/Using Shortcuts
The cool thing is you can use this Shortcut as a dependency of more complex workflows.

They can even be nested and include branching logic etc., it&#x27;s pretty wild, but also beyond what I&#x27;ve done so far.</span>

                    <span>Found this very interesting bit:

  
Linked information systems
In providing a system for manipulating this sort of information, the hope would be to allow a pool of information to develop which could grow and evolve with the organisation and the projects it describes. For this to be possible, the method of storage must not place its own restraints on the information. This is why a &quot;web&quot; of notes with links (like references) between them is far more useful than a fixed hierarchical system. When describing a complex system, many people resort to diagrams with circles and arrows. Circles and arrows leave one free to describe the interrelationships between things in a way that tables, for example, do not. The system we need is like a diagram of circles and arrows, where circles and arrows can stand for anything.


From Tim Berners-Lee&#x27;s original proposal for the worldwide web. Emphasis mine.
It is quite fascinating how this fact seems to be rediscovered again and again.</span>

                    <span>Hej fellow &#x27;macsers,
 TL;DR: wanna compile a number of lists (tracklists to show friends, one list per year), maybe in a kind of database. I want duplicates to be detected. Ideally, I want the ability to export to a nice-looking format. Package tips, programming suggestions, everything welcome. Thanks :)
 I have a somewhat unconventional taste of music - at least when compared to my friends. I rarely play music I enjoy personally other than some beat tapes which are simply lit when hangin&#x27; out together.
 Now, I have been asked by one friend of mine to compile a list of music that I have enjoyed throughought the year. Since I actually enjoy sharing/discussing music, I agreed. So I compiled a list of songs - free form, no format etc. 
 However, I&#x27;ve been wondering: I might be doing this every year from now on. First off, it was a bit tedious to do the freeform entry. Secondly, and more important, I don&#x27;t want to manually search for duplicates when compiling my 2022 list. Finally, it would be nice if I could have this list (or a subset of such a list) exported either in a nice-looking pdf or in some other conventient form. 
 Then, I thought to myself: well, since you can do practically everything with emacs, why shouldn&#x27;t it be able to help me out this time?
 Thus, I&#x27;d love to hear your thoughts on the matter. It might be some kind of database thingy that is able (programmably) to detect duplicates. It might be a program that does EXACTLY what I want. It might be a hint on how to do autonumbering on an unformatted file. It might be a tip on how to automate the &quot;finding duplicates&quot; process. Anything, really :)
 Thanks a bunch, have a good day, fellows! :)

                    <span>In clojure, I want to hide my debug forms in that way:
 Instead of
 (postmortem.core/spy :debug :emacs-reddit)
 I want to just display:
 :emacs-reddit, possibly with some custom text properties, like underlining.
 I&#x27;m guessing it should be possible with overlays, but I don&#x27;t know how to make them automatic so that when some text matches a regex, the overlay gets created automatically.

                    <span>I am a doom Emacs user. I tried using the consult-org-agenda command to go to and change the TODO org document but Hitting RET on the titles will not change (TODO to DONE) or (check the checkboxes) . To confirm that it related to Consult-org-agenda i used the usual org-agenda to go to the todo list and it worked fine there and after using org-agenda the consult-org-agenda also worked fine after i ran the org-agenda command to go to the todo list
 I am using emacs 27.2 and running the doom version 21.12.0-alpha
 After running consult-org-agenda buffer
 I am pressing RET on the titles but they are not changing
 After running org-agenda
 and as soon as i mark with org-agenda it works just fine
 then running consult-org-agenda
 and now here also it seems to work in this instance of emacs but as soon as this instance of emacs is closed i have to again open org-agenda to make consult-org-agenda to work
 This is the pastebin link to my config

                    <span>Recently, I have compiled the latest Emacs on Ubuntu to update from version 26 and get the native compilation working. Aside from a few hiccups, it went well. 
 However, when I began using it, I discovered that the Projectile is not aware of any of my projects. In particular, whenever I try to switch to a project, it says that that directory is not a project. In the past, it would show me an array of projects in curly brackets in minibuffer that I could arrow through and choose.
 Here is what I have in the &#x60;.emacs&#x60; file related to Magit and Projectile:
 (global-set-key (kbd &quot;C-x g&quot;) &#x27;magit-status)
 (put &#x27;upcase-region &#x27;disabled nil)
 (require &#x27;projectile)
 (define-key projectile-mode-map (kbd &quot;s-p&quot;) &#x27;projectile-command-map)
 (define-key projectile-mode-map (kbd &quot;C-c p&quot;) &#x27;projectile-command-map)
 (setq projectile-project-search-path &#x27;( &quot;~/sites/&quot; &quot;~/Projects/&quot;))
 (projectile-mode +1)
 (setq projectile-switch-project-action &#x27;projectile-vc)
 (eval-after-load &quot;projectile&quot; 
 &#x27;(progn (setq magit-repo-dirs (mapcar (lambda (dir)
 (substring dir 0 -1))
 (seq-filter (lambda (project)
 (file-directory-p (concat project&quot;/.git/&quot;))) 
 (projectile-relevant-known-projects))))
  &#x60;(setq magit-repo-dirs-depth 1)))&#x60; 
 ​
 There are do not appear to be any errors or warnings in the Messages or Warnings buffer. Any help on this is appreciated.

                    <span>In the middle of function #1 I&#x27;m writing, I&#x27;d like to enter the minibuffer and run function #2 after the minibuffer has been entered, before function #1 has exited. I understand that trying to do the opposite (i.e., running a function in the middle of another function after exiting the minibuffer) can be tricky, as explained here, but I&#x27;m not sure if abo-abo&#x27;s solution can be adapted to my case.
 I&#x27;d like to avoid using the minibuffer-setup-hook for simplicity&#x27;s sake. The simple functionality I&#x27;m after is inserting the text at point as the first minibuffer text for the yas-insert-snippet command, but I can foresee needing similar functionality in more complex circumstances. Any help would be appreciated!

                    <span>I&#x27;m not a native English speaker and often make some stupid grammar mistakes. I find that Grammarly is pretty useful to catch those errors. However, Grammarly is only officially supported on websites. VSCode has an unofficial Grammarly extension, I&#x27;ve tried it and it works pretty well. Is there a similar Grammarly package on Emacs?

                    <span>I have a function as follows :
 data UnaryOp &#x3D; Move | Negate | Complement | Not deriving (Eq, Show, Generic)
 instance Arbitrary UnaryOp where
 arbitrary &#x3D; genericArbitrary uniform
 encodeUnaryOp :: UnaryOp -&gt; Word32
 encodeUnaryOp Move &#x3D; 0
 encodeUnaryOp Negate &#x3D; 1
 encodeUnaryOp Complement &#x3D; 2
 encodeUnaryOp Not &#x3D; 3
 I am supposed to code a function, decodeUnaryOp, which has the following type signature and is supposed to be the exact reverse of the encodeUnaryOp function -
 decodeUnaryOp :: Word32 -&gt; Maybe UnaryOp
 And so far, I have framed my solution (the code for decodeUnaryOp) as follows :
 decodeUnaryOp w &#x3D; do
 0 &lt;- Move
 1 &lt;- Negate
 2 &lt;- Complement
 3 &lt;- Not
 .......
 In place of the .... I intend to write something which will convert the UnaryOp to a Maybe type, however I am not sure how to proceed with this? Other than that, I think my code seems to be correct.
 Can someone kindly let me know to turn the result into a Maybe type? Additionally, if the code I have written so far correct functionally? Thank you.

                    <span>Hi guys!
 I&#x27;m in the middle of a project in which I need to do some kind of upsert to a nested map structure (3 levels deep), creating all the intermediate keys if they don&#x27;t exist and just retrieving them and continue going down if they do. The structure would be something similar to this:
 haskell data NestedMap &#x3D; M.Map Key1 (M.Map Key2 (M.Map Key3 [Item])) 
 You can assume Key* and Item are simple Strings.
 I wanted to try using Lens to do it, but I&#x27;m having trouble understanding some concepts. For example, I have seen that to manipulate map-like structures in this way at should be used, as well as non to provide the keys when missing and continue operating. However, when looking at the docs for non I have found this:
  &gt;&gt;&gt; Map.fromList [(&quot;hello&quot;, 1)] &amp; at &quot;hello&quot; . non 0 +~ 2 fromList [(&quot;hello&quot;,3)] &gt;&gt;&gt; Map.fromList [(&quot;hello&quot;, 1)] &amp; at &quot;hello&quot; . non 0 -~ 1 fromList [] 
 I don&#x27;t understand the second result at all. Shouldn&#x27;t the result be something like fromList [(&quot;hello&quot;, 0)]? Why it&#x27;s not the case?
 To be honest I&#x27;m also having trouble trying to think on how could I chain all the ^.s, ats, nons and ?~s into an expression to finally add a [Item] at the bottom of the nested map, but as I&#x27;m not understanding the non function I&#x27;ll need to go step by step.
 Could someone please help me understand this better? Thanks!

                    <span>This message might seem like it is about the romance of Haskell and Category Theory. But it is really about what kind of conversations we can or cannot have.
 A prequel.
 I once wondered whether Functional Programming is actually as good as I think. The default way I deal with questions is to ask the Internet. So, I formulated the question and put it into 2 communities.
  
In /r/AskProgramming, it has been received very well. All of the commenters engaged with the actual question.
 
In /r/functionalprogramming, it has not been received so well. Many commenters declined to engage with the question. People in comments told me that my formulation of the question is unacceptable and said bad things about my comments as well. Eventually a moderator stepped in and locked the conversation.

                    <span>It&#x27;s fairly easy to install Haskell, I followed this exactly:
 https://preview.redd.it/h0gesvexvpy71.png?width&#x3D;1704&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;fb888ea11ef30866b8efe2cbf235771fba126a2d
 I opened Terminal, typed curl --proto &#x27;&#x3D;https&#x27; --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://get-ghcup.haskell.org | sh, and hit enter.
 But for uninstalling Haskell on Mac, I can&#x27;t find anything? Specifically for OS X 10.15.7.

 Now I am left wondering: how do I uninstall Haskell?

                    <span>Hello,
 I posted my question in stack-overflow here, but I thought I might get a quicker response if I post it here as well. There was a question before on just auto-complete for python, but I am also looking for something that does syntax-filling automatically as well. I thought emacs-jedi (for python) was something close, but not fully what I was looking for. Any suggestions for just python or just tcl or both (preferably) is highly appreciated.
 Apologise if anyone feels I am repeating questions already asked.

                    <span>There are a couple of things that come to mind as a prelude to this issue:
  
switched to ZSH and Oh-My-ZSH a couple of days ago. 
 built Emacs 29 (latest from source) today on Ubuntu 20.04.
  
After installing the newly built Emacs, I noticed that the icon in the Ubuntu Dock didn&#x27;t seem to work. I removed the icon. I then went into Applications and launched an instance of Emacs. It worked. I added it to the favorites in the dock. I closed the instance. I then went to click the icon again. It opened a weird Emacsclient instance, which didn&#x27;t split the frame into three windows like it always does at startup (I have this written in .emacs).
 To summarize, whenever I launch from the applications, I can start a &quot;normal&quot; Emacs version. As soon as I add its icon to the dock, the icon begins launching Emacs(client) version.
 In the applications, I have three icons: Emacs, Emacs(client), Emacs(Terminal).
 Any help on figuring out what is going on is appreciated. For one, I would love to learn what this client thing is as I have never seen nor used it. It would also be great to get to the usual behavior of just getting good old Emacs after clicking the icon in the dock. If there is reason to this client madness and it can be beneficial in this case, I am all ears.

                    <span>We need a way(mode, keybinding) to send the keybinding we press, to the application opened in that buffer. 
 I tried exwm-input-release-keyboard and it has always worked flawlessly. I can open firefox, then use exwm-input-release-keyboard and then continue using firefox keybindings like C-c to copy, C-v to paste etc.
 But surprisingly, this did not work when I opened a file with nano inside vterm buffer. Any idea on how to address this issue?

                    <span>Hi!
 I use the modus-operandi theme but I would like to change how the magit diff seems ...
 If you check the active region it is gray background but the lines with differencies are with gray background as well. I think the inactive region is more readable ... 
 How can I set it up to hold the red and green background for the lines where the changing have ?
 I tried to change the magit-diff-highlight-s because this layer is graying it but ...
 Here is my screenshot to see it

The issue is the first frame that the is created by the client does not show the battery icon in the doom modeline as well as the custom banner for the dashboard that is set in the config is not shown but if i open a second frame it will fix all the issue with both the frames icons and banner.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve recently started with JavaScript.
 Indium is suggested everywhere as the standard development environment for JavaScript, so I&#x27;ve used it with some success. It works beautifully for Chrome, with evaluation of code, inspection, REPL, etc. but only up to a point.
  
When it comes to Node, I&#x27;ve no success. I can start the node server but I cannot connect to it. I&#x27;m not sure it starts the node server correctly; in the documentation it says that you can start the node server manually and then connect to it, but the code says otherwise (it always asks if you want to close the previous connection, doing nothing if you chose &#x60;no&#x60;, starting a new server if you choose &#x60;yes&#x60;)
 Evaluating TypeScript code leads to errors, even though the documentation and the discussions that I&#x27;ve seen lead to the impression that evaluating TypeScript should be no different than evaluating JavaScript code.
 Async functions cannot be evaluated with &#x60;indium-eval-last-node&#x60; since it only evaluates the code after the &#x60;function&#x60; token, ignoring the &#x60;async&#x60; token, which leads to the error that &#x60;await&#x60; cannot be used in non-async functions.
 The Indium setup documentation references functions that are no longer available, like &#x60;M-x indium-connect-to-nodejs&#x60;
 the last commit is from March 2021 and there are still open issues from 2017 and no responses from the developer
  
Developing such a huge and nice package is surely overwhelming. I (and maybe others) would just like to know if we should bother with it, that&#x27;s all. There might also be some people who would like to take it over, who knows. Does anyone have any info regarding this?

                    <span>Is it possible to start a section on the new page. I have a section(2) at the end of the page and the images in that section move to the next page and the next section(3) starts right at the end of section 2 before the images. I have tried using the [htb!] but that jumbles up the images of the entire document. I am exporting to latex.
 Expected:
 Section 2 -&gt; images -&gt; Section 3
 Current Output:
 Section 2 -&gt; Section 3 heading -&gt; Section 2 images -&gt; Section 3 images

                    <span>I&#x27;m currently trying to get a webbrowser to work in emacs under Windows. Not really as a Firefox replacement, but more for having documentation or single sites displayed.
 From my research it looks like EAF is the best option for that. From their docs it seems like they support Windows. I did the full install as the Readme advises and everything seems to be working fine. At least the &quot;demo&quot; application runs as expected.
 With eaf-browser i&#x27;m at a dead-end though. All i get is an empty buffer and a Message &quot;Process *eaf* exited abnormally with code 9&quot;. No further Information what failed. All dependencies are installed, update runs through fine.
 Has anyone gotten this to work under Windows?
 My current config for eaf looks like this:
  (use-package eaf :load-path &quot;~/.emacs.d/site-lisp/emacs-application-framework/&quot; :custom (eaf-browser-continue-where-left-off t) (eaf-browser-enable-adblocker t) (browse-url-browser-function &#x27;eaf-open-browser) :config (require &#x27;eaf-browser) (require &#x27;eaf-pdf-viewer) (require &#x27;eaf-demo) (eaf-bind-key nil &quot;M-q&quot; eaf-browser-keybinding)) 
 Any help on this would be appreciated.

                    <span>I’ve been an emacs user for years now and have yet to find a jsx/tsx setup that works perfectly (indentation, AC, etc). If anyone has a configuration they think works perfect, please post it. If not, I’ve been learning elisp for some time, but am at the point where I need to build something. Is anyone with experience (preferably also interested in having such a major mode) willing to help me make something like this? React is so popular and really needs solid emacs support
 With tree-sitter and lsp, I’m guessing it shouldn’t be that hard? Assuming the hardest part will be getting the indentations right

                    <span>I&#x27;m currently in the middle of finishing my thesis project and I need some small games that have been in developed in Haskell. The subject is automating texture management through using statically analyzable code to implement the games and then analyze certain functions for the textures they use.
 The reason I need source code for games written in Haskell is to be able to compare metrics from a game without my added structures and typeclasses vs with my typeclasses. I would change the way the game is written using my classes and see what the impact is on performance, compile size/time, memory usage. 
 I will cite all the games used and their developers of course. I&#x27;ve found some github repositories here and there of finished games, but wanted to see if any of you know of some good resources.

I like Haskell. In my experience, it is at once the strongest and the most approachable programming language in the world. Haskell is the answer to the problems raised by John Backus and Edsger Dijkstra. It also has a community that I am honoured to be among. So, whenever I see a problem that can be solved by a computation, I want to have a solution in Haskell because I expect it to naturally turn out better than an alternative.
 Actually I even expect that a program written in a language without algebraic types, parametric polymorphosis and lawful type classes will exhibit stupid, e…</span>

                    <span>We are pleased to announce the release of Copilot 3.6, a stream-based DSL for writing and monitoring embedded C programs, with an emphasis on correctness and hard realtime requirements. Copilot is typically used as a high-level runtime verification framework, and supports temporal logic (LTL, PTLTL and MTL), clocks and voting algorithms.
 Among others, Copilot has been used at the Safety Critical Avionics Systems Branch of NASA Langley Research Center for monitoring test flights of drones.
 This new release supports three new operators: atan2, floor, and ceiling. Additionally, the target directory of the code generated by Copilot can now be customized. Release 3.6 also includes a battery of unit tests for the library copilot-core. This release introduces other fixes in the code and in the documentation, and deprecates definitions that have been superseded or that were largely unused.
 Current emphasis is on facilitating the use with other systems, and improving the codebase in terms of stability and test coverage. Users are encouraged to participate by opening issues and asking questions via our github repo.

                    <span>I have a problem to solve which I&#x27;m almost sure has been encountered by people before (so expecting there to be reasonable library for that), but I don&#x27;t know what exactly to search for. - I&#x27;d like to run potentially long-running actions triggered by some user HTTP requests in a web app - These actions have to run on the server receiving that request. Imagine something like initializing user-scoped sqlite file in the filesystem where the haskell web server binary is running (so no external &quot;job runner&quot; service) - The actions should run in separate thread (async?) - For any user, there should be at most 1 parallel copy of that action running at any given time (i.e. if user triggers 2nd copy of that action while the first is still running, the 2nd action should be skipped)
 My idea about solution so far includes: - some data structure (?) for managing bunch of locks, addressed by integers (user ids) - ensure locks are released both when the async action fails or succeeds
 Here&#x27;s a dirty prototype (most likely not bug free) demonstrating what I&#x27;d like to achieve https://gist.github.com/jhrcek/5123bc0ad42522dff837be5580e9766e
 Is anyone aware of some libraries that would make this kind of thing possible?

                    <span>My new goal this year is to learn a new programming language and do at least one project with it. My current (uneducated) choice is between Haskell and C. 
 I’ve written down bullet points to help organize my thoughts, and I was wondering if anyone could share their thoughts on what to learn first and correct me if any of my thoughts are biased. I would really appreciate it!
 Here’s a little context for me first:
  
On a gap year before entering college as freshman next year
 Have done Java as part of intro to CS class + Python for majority of projects (overall ~3 yrs of coding experience)
 Interested in pursuing Machine Learning / ML Systems
  
My short term goal:
  
Push outside my comfort zone and gain a deeper understanding/practices in programming
 Prepare myself for rigorous CS curriculums I’ll soon face
 Hopefully, gain a small advantage in resume screenings when I apply for DevOps/MLOps internships after sophomore year.
  
Why Haskell?
  
The idea of Functional Programming itself interests me, and many have said it’s a great way to push outside the comfort zone and understand more deeply about ‘programming’
 I’ve heard many companies use Haskell for their “low-latency, high-volume database access”
 Project Ideas: Map-reduce?
  
Why C? (Or maybe C++)
  
Learning C will expose me to more fundamental inner workings of computer systems.
 As I am interested in ML Systems, I’ve heard “writing highly performant/error-proof systems-level code” is an essential skill to have/practice
 Project Ideas: Database, Distributed File System

I have a section(2) at the end of the page and the images in that section move to the next page and the next section(3) starts right at the end of section 2 before the images. I have tried using the [htb!] but that jumbles up the images of the entire document. I am exporting to latex.
 Expected:
 Section 2 -&gt; images -&gt; Section 3
 Current Output:
 Section 2 -&gt; Section 3 heading -&gt; Section 2 images -&gt; Section 3 images

                    <span>Hi,
 Is it possible (in other words is there a Melpa package I guess) that lets me specify scheduled tasks with a duration:
  * TODO ... SCHEDULED:  
 rather than 
  * TODO ... SCHEDULED:  
 Note that in the first sample I specify 15:00hr + 1 hour rather than second example where I have to calculate the end time myself.

  Let time &#x3D; if runFn1 isDone unit then do Case instant (runFn1 offsetTime (uninstant t)) of Just x -&gt; x Nothing -&gt; t 
 .......
 If I remove the Case it gets angry because of an unhandled maybe but with the case I am getting the following error:
 Unknown data constructor Just.
 What did I do wrong. Why does a Maybe Instant not have a Just?
 EDIT: solved on the purescript discourse. Needed to import Maybe(..) instead of just Maybe

                    <span>I am a new user to Doom Emacs and been wanting to make these two changes to the doom mode line but i am unsure of how to do that:
  
Make the modes (like normal , insert , emacs , visual) written in text in the mode line rather than the color of the dot represent it. (Similar to this https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/140797/49694189-6913d480-fbc0-11e8-93ae-9578455dcd2c.png)
 When playing music with emms it show the whole path to the music . I would prefer if it just showed the song name not /home/$USER/Music/song.mp3 but rather just song.mp3

 Now you can run SPICE simulation for simple circuits in GNU Emacs. Since the circuit and graphs are in SVG format, you can easily share it on web or embed in a document.

                    <span>Recently, I compiled Emacs PGTK Nativecomp and running it on my machine which is fairly good. Surely, using nativecomp is a new experience and everything felt very fast as compared to Emacs 27. But yesterday, I was facing Emacs freeze while editing a simple dockerfile which is hardly 100 lines ig and I inspected it in Htop and found that Emacs using 100% CPU. Then I killed emacs and run another instance and profiled it while editing same dockerfile but again I left with freezed Emacs. Again I tried same and found in profiler that evil (especially evil-ex command), timer.el(IDK what it is) and selectrum(precisely selectrum--update) using CPU. Then I removed evil packages from my init.el and replaced selectrum with vertico. Now, Emacs is usable. But it still lags (not freezes) in between and its due to native compilation turned on. 
 Is this only happening to me or anyone else facing same issue? Is there any workaround for it?

                    <span>I&#x27;ve recently reached an initial milestone in the development of SLinC (Scala Link to C), a library in the vein of Java Native Access and Java Native Runtime. I&#x27;m designing SLinC to use cats&#x27; &#x60;Free&#x60; monad for a native effect type called NativeIO, and it&#x27;s powered by Scala 3&#x27;s macros and Java 17&#x27;s foreign incubator.
 An example usage of SLinC is binding to stdlib.h&#x27;s div method:
 C representation
 struct div_t { int quot; int rem; }; div_t div(int numerator, int denominator); 
 Scala 3 binding and usage
 //scala representation of div_t struct type div_t &#x3D; Struct { val quot: int val rem: int } //method binding for c stdlib&#x27;s div val div &#x3D; NativeIO[(Int, Int) &#x3D;&gt; div_t](&quot;div&quot;) //usage of our binding //Struct returns require native memory allocation, so an allocation scope is needed Native.scope( for result &lt;- div(5,2) quot &#x3D; result.quot.get rem &#x3D; result.rem.get yield println(s&quot;quotient: $quot, remainder: $rem&quot;) ) //natively allocated data is freed after this point .foldMap(NativeIO.impureCompiler) //compiles and runs the native kernel we just defined, prints &quot;quotient: 2, remainder: 1&quot; 
 The library is still in development, so it&#x27;s not as fully featured as JNA or JNR, but I&#x27;m hoping to improve it in the coming month. It&#x27;s also very promising performance-wise: despite me not putting much of any effort into optimization, it&#x27;s already rivaling JNR in performance, and resoundingly beats JNA.

                    <span>Greetings, fellow FP fans!
 This is not your typical r/scala question about type classes or another generic job post – you won’t see any “in this role you will…” or “Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science or equivalent.”
 You also won’t find any corny buzzwords like “bleeding edge,” “gamechanging,” “unmatched,” or – God forbid – “robust.”
 So… what are we doing here?
 Well, you’ve stumbled upon a Scala &amp; FP trap laid by myself, Alec, with Signify Technology – we’re the world’s only Scala &amp; FP specialist recruiting firm. And yes, I know that 80% of you just rolled your eyes or moved to close this post when you read “recruiting firm,” but give me a chance here.
 As I was saying; we’re the world’s only Scala &amp; FP specialist recruiting firm. We work with both the biggest names &amp; fastest-growing…</span>

                    <span>Difference between the following statements:
 def size &#x3D; 2 and var size &#x3D; 2, val size &#x3D; 2.
 They only differ that former is a definition or function named size which don&#x27;t take any argument but returns 2 and the later is a variable which holds an integral value 2 and last is same as 2nd just that its value cannot be changed.
 Are there any other differences?
 Can you give more examples where you stuck at your time, related to the topic, and you wanna teach us?
 Like Haskell Another sessional came this, and I&#x27;m not been able to I&#x27;m new to Scala and not been able to pay that much attention and time to it, it needs. But unlike Haskell, I don&#x27;t want to drop scala.
 Anyways thanks for all help.
