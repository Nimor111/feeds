                    <span>I just switched to manjaro linux, and I cannot find out how to install the dependencies libgccjit and libjansson that are needed for compiling emacs with &quot;native-compilation&quot; and native json support. Is there an alternate name for these packages in the manjaro package repositories? Or could I obtain these dependencies from a non official package repo? I would rather not compile these libraries from source myself. Thanks

 As in the title; I opened the Obsidian app, for example, which offers a startup floating window, but I can&#x27;t enter in the details necessary to create a vault. The text always goes to the fullscreen application behind it.
 Thank you kindly for the help!

 As stated in the title; it seems that every time I switch buffers or exwm frames, they keep getting smaller and smaller. Running the fullscreen commands don&#x27;t work, either.
 Any help would be greatly appreciated!

                    <span>Hey, I was wondering if there was a way to emulate ns-auto-titlebar-mode in Gnome. I like Gnome, but I would like a titlebar that feels more integrated into emacs.
 And if not, if it would be possible to write an extension in elisp that would do the same thing. What kind of functions and/or parameters would I need to change. 
 I am guessing I need to change the Client Side Decoration from GTK.

                    <span>Hello! I am trying to switch over from irony mode to lsp mode for c++ development, and am running into an unfortunate issue while trying to work with SDL2.
 Basically, there is this weird bug that I cannot figure out where within the main sdl header, it cannot find another header &quot;begin_code.h&quot;. But the thing is, the project compiles fine. (I&#x27;m building with cmake). I&#x27;ve tried to get the error go away (it looks like this is a known issue with SDL and clang) but after hours of googling and wanting to punch my laptop, I would prefer just to suppress the error message, but I can&#x27;t find a way to do that in my current emacs setup. I believe I was able to do this with irony-mode, so it would be awesome if there was an equivalent feature. 
 If anyone has a way to do this that would b awesome! Thanks so much.

                    <span>I&#x27;m new at both org-mode and latex, and I&#x27;m trying to use natbib to cite in the Harvard style. I&#x27;m using Doom Emacs. 
 I&#x27;ve made a .bib file in the same directory (spc-f-f bibliography.bib), but can&#x27;t link it. 
 I&#x27;ve tried using #+BIBLIOGRAPHY: bibliography agsm, #+LATEX_HEADER: \addbibresource{bibliography.bib}, and the same with header_extra, and both with ./bibliography and ./bibliography.bib, and all of that with \bibliography. 
 They all result in ? when exported, and reftex says: No bibliography defined in file
 I&#x27;m currently using vertico, but I&#x27;ve seen people modify helm or ivy to do this and connect bibtex to org-roam. Do I need to do the same or am I missing something? Am I missing headers or something in the bib file?

                    <span>I know that:init is executed before the package is loaded while:config the code is executed after the package has been loaded, but what does that mean how can I execute something before the existence of a package, for example taking ivy-mode, we set it as follows;
 :init (ivy mode 1) 
 How do we invoke the mode before the package is loaded?

 If I turn menu-bar-mode on, this seems to fix it (so far). 
 Am using the pre-compiled native-comp branch from ArchlinuxCN, will try the pgtk branch from aur later today.
 Think I have just worked out:

 It is when then menu overlaps the emacs frame,

                    <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;ve been a long time user of Ivy and Counsel but a couple of days ago I decided to give Vertico, Embark and Consult a try. I&#x27;m very happy with them so far, however I&#x27;m having a couple of issues: -
  
I&#x27;ve read that using Embark to collect a list of grep results should result in a grep-mode buffer. I used to use Ivy to produce an occur buffer which I could then edit allowing me to make changes across multiple files easily. Getting a grep-mode buffer sounded good to me as I could then use wgrep to edit these matches directly in a similar way. However, when I collect these results (via embark-collect-live, embark-collect-snapshot or embark-export) I always end up with an embark-collect-mode buffer. I cannot see a way from here to make this a grep-mode buffer or to make changes to these matches in the same way I would in an editable occur buffer.
 In the collected results as mentioned in the first question, if I press RET on any of these results I get the following error: Error running timer ‘consult--async-after-change’: (buffer-read-only #).
  
I&#x27;m currently using Emacs 28.0.50 and I use Evil mode.
 Any help on the above would be greatly appreciated!

                    <span>Since FRP is purely functional, it has to precisely describe relationships between interdependent GUI widgets in one place.
 I think there has been efforts to increase decoupling between interdependent widgets.
 Reactive Programming using Reactive Values introduces reactive values which decouple interdependent GUI widgets through non-functional reactive values. Reactive values look similar to
  
https://github.com/hoplon/javelin
 https://reagent-project.github.io/docs/master/reagent.ratom.html
  
Reactive values can increase modularity, decoupling, and separation of concern while FRP increases referential transparency.
 Have FRP libraries found a way to decouple interdependent widgets as reactive values do?

 Is it okay how I do it? I mean I use lowercase drawer names with camel case notation. Or is it better to use something like :GENRE: :LABEL: ? Any suggestion is appreciated.

                    <span>How to get v1.7.x
On the Cutting Edge update channel, v1.7.0 just hit, and it brings the new MultiMarkdown-aware editor.
What&#x27;s different?
If everything goes well, then at the end of this testing phase, everything should look exactly like it did before.
But everything should be so much faster now.
If everything should look the same, what&#x27;s different?!
The editor now recognized Markdown better. Less unhandled edge cases. Less styling surprises.
But since applying theme styles is different, there are the occasional visual quirks, like the bracket colors in link definitions being color of links instead of being the color of link definitions. Please report anything you notice via email or here. I&#x27;ll be patching these mostly in the upcoming days.
Some things also look different, but on purpose:…</span>

                    <span>I use Emacs on Windows, on NTFS, so the file system does have file notifications, and so (global-auto-revert-mode 1) works for me.
 However, out of curiosity, I&#x27;m trying to revert a changed buffer by using an alternate way, by using auto-revert-use-notify:
  
By default, Auto Revert mode works using file notifications, whereby changes in the filesystem are reported to Emacs by the OS. You can disable use of file notifications by customizing the variable auto-revert-use-notify to a nil value, then Emacs will check for file changes by polling every five seconds. You can change the polling interval through the variable auto-revert-interval.
 Not all systems support file notifications; where they are not supported, auto-revert-use-notify will be nil by default.
 - Emacs Manual: Auto Revert
  
The following line does nothing for me:
  (setq auto-revert-use-notify nil) 
 What I&#x27;m doing wrong?

                    <span>After a long while of using (relatively) stock emacs, I&#x27;ve started to configure it more and more. One of the favorite parts of my note-taking process with org is exporting it into a fancy latex and html pdfs. I already stole tecosaurs html export config, but his latex config seems pretty complicated and probably more than what I need 
 So, does anyone have any cool latex-export configs they would like to share?

                    <span>For the past 2 days I&#x27;ve been trying to install org-roam on windows with little success.
 I followed along perhaps 15 git guides and 5 youtube videos already. All of them still produce error.
 15 hours installing and reinstalling emacs, gcc, scoop, sqlite3 database, changing registry and what not. Somehow Sqlite database still missing. I&#x27;m starting to lose hope now. :/
 This is a rant of frustration. Why is this so freaking difficult? :/

                    <span>Hi,
 I would like to crop images in the *image-dired-display-image* buffer with the mouse and save them to disk then.
 Who would like to write the code for this functionality please?
 I would be happy to sponsor your work.
 What recompense would you like to receive? Or could you give me some pointers please, where to find a coder for this task?
 Most of the work is already done: https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/2018/11/12/cropping-images-in-emacs/
 Thanks in advance. Kind regards, Peter

                    <span>I used to use NeoMutt with notmuch and I had many messages dating back years in my sent folder.
 For some reason either mu is only indexing the messages in my sent folder from this year, or mu4e is only showing those messages. In other folders I have messages successfully indexed going back a few years so not sure what the problem is.
 Any help appreciated.

                    <span>Currently I&#x27;m a heavy user of Midnight Commander and goes back in and out of emacsclient tens or hundreds of times a day. I&#x27;m planning to live in Emacs more, and am collecting tips/tricks on making dired and the shell mode more convenient to use for me. I&#x27;m practically a complete beginner when it comes to dired and shell mode, using only their basic features. Currently here are my pet peeves or wishlist:
  
256 colors does not work in shell (as well as eshell).
 Programmable completion has bugs making many of my completions not working. [1][2]
 I&#x27;m using split window and wish dired would open file in another window.
 I wish instead of the default pager less being used when doing the &#x27;man&#x27; command, shell mode could somehow create a new buffer to show the output.
 I wish there were an easier way to enter shell commands in dired, much like in Midnight Commander (including equivalents of its feature like Alt-Enter, C-x t). Dare I wish also for dual-pane?
 How to make shell mode quickly cd to a directory being selected in dired?
  
Any tips, pointers, comments are welcome.

                    <span>Hi, I have been using emacs doom for couple of months now and I still don&#x27;t know if I am doing it the right way. For example I never configure any thing beyond theme or font. I am not sure why packages exist what are the useful ones to be installed. Also when I face an issue in emacs doom do I have to look for it as it&#x27;s emacs? Or emacs doom?

                    <span>Basically the title. I started a project in Solidity on Ethereum last year and it&#x27;s sort of fallen through. What&#x27;s good is that I have a work-in-progress to build off of conceptually. I&#x27;d like to shift to Cardano (once smart contracts are going) and create an application on there. Let me know if this interests you.

                    <span>I&#x27;m doing some Servant stuff and I have a mismatch between the API type and the route implementation. The problem is I can&#x27;t get the type the API should be.
 I get the current error message
 • Couldn&#x27;t match expected type ‘ServerT MaintenanceAPI App’ with actual type ‘(WrappedAuthToken -&gt; App (Cookied CommandResponse)) : (WrappedAuthToken -&gt; App (Cookied CommandResponse))’ 
 with
 type MaintenanceAPI &#x3D; &quot;optimize&quot; :&gt; &quot;all&quot; :&gt; AuthProtect &quot;cookie-auth&quot; :&gt; Get &#x27;[JSON] (Cookied CommandResponse) : &quot;sync-variants-definition&quot; :&gt; &quot;all&quot; :&gt; AuthProtect &quot;cookie-auth&quot; :&gt; Capture &quot;product_id&quot; ProductId -&gt; Get&#x27;[JSON] (Cookied CommandResponse) 
 Is there a way to &quot;expand&quot; MaintanceAPI, so I can how the two types differ ?
 Update
 :kind! should work indeed but not in this case because a put ProductId -&gt; Get&#x27;[JSON] (Cookied CommandResponse) using -&gt; instead of :&gt;. This is a valid type definition but not a valid HasServer instance as u/Iceland_jack pointed.
 If I fixes it, :kind! works indeed.

                    <span>I&#x27;m used to Yesod and recently starts using Servant for another project.
 AFAIU, Servant is offering a safer routing system than Yesod, mainly because you can express in Servant constraints like query parameters or headers which you can&#x27;t with Yesod.
 ​
 Howerer, I came across the following problem which paradoxally seems safer with Yesod than with Servant. I have two routes which have the same signatures. Basically they do nothing but putting a job in a queues. They have to parameters and return an error if something got wrong.
 The (hypotetical) Api looks like this 
 JobAPI &#x3D; &quot;cleanup&quot; :&gt; Get &#x27;[JSON] Response : &quot;refresh&quot; :&gt; Get &#x27;[JSON] Response 
 And then jobRoute &#x3D; cleanup : refresh. The problem is, as cleanup and refresh have the same type, jobRoute &#x3D; refresh : cleanup will compiles but routes the http request to the wrong handler.
 With Yesod, I would write
 /cleanup GET CleanupR GET /refresh GET RefreshR GET 
 And I would have to implement getCleanupR and getRefreshR : no (obvious) way to get mixed up.
 Okay, it&#x27;s not the end of the world, so I could ignore the problem (solution 1) or create newtype so that the two routes have a different type signature (solution 2). The API will look like
 newtype CleanupResponse &#x3D; Cleanup Response newtyp RefreshResponse &#x3D; Refresh Response JobAPI &#x3D; &quot;cleanup&quot; :&gt; Get &#x27;[JSON] (CleanupResponse) : &quot;refresh&quot; :&gt; Get &#x27;[JSON] (RefreshResponse) 
 So, what is the common solution to this problem ?

                    <span>Stack Overflow has released the results for yet another annual developer survey with little Haskell presence and where Haskell is present, it doesn&#x27;t really shine: https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021
 I&#x27;ve been wondering how much of this is due to the fact that Stack Overflow is way less prominent in the Haskell community. I remember that in the past, when I was using C++, Java, MATLAB or Python in $DAYJOB, half of writing code consisted of googling for information about the libraries I was using and ending up in Stack Overflow. I don&#x27;t know why exactly, but I do less googling since I&#x27;ve been writing Haskell and I usually land on the documentation of modules on Hackage when I do. I don&#x27;t remember the last time I&#x27;ve found the answer to something in Stack Overflow. That&#x27;s also why I never ended up joining these surveys as a Haskeller.
 If that&#x27;s the case for the community in general, I believe that might be skewing the Stack Overflow survey results. That would be unfortunate, because since the mainstream developers use Stack Overflow regularly, they might think that the result is unbiased for all languages.
 I wonder if the results would be any different if members of the community made an effort to inform the others when these surveys are taking place, or does anyone really care about that?

                    <span>I&#x27;m trying to set up Haskell in an Ubuntu VM, but for some reason vscode is running hls in debug, which means it doesn&#x27;t actually display code lenses and errors and such. The first two images are what the trace looks like in the VM, and the final image is from my normal Windows environment, where it works fine. I haven&#x27;t been able to figure out a way to change the flags vscode is using for hls, does anyone else know what&#x27;s up?

When I summon the Export Dispatcher, C-v to toggle on Visible only the keybinding is not recognized. The single character keybindings work fine, and I can export but just not with Visible only toggled on.
 Question: is there way for me to permanently set Visible only to always be on? My intention here is just to bypass the problematic keybinding.

                    <span>Hi. I have been trying to parse a nested XML into separate dataframes. The idea is that the nested XML has multiple tables in it and I need to extract all those tables.
 Due to me not knowing how to format the post properly, I am attaching a link to my Stackoverflow post. Hope you can have a look and give me suggestions.

                    <span>I am quite new to Zettelkasten.
I still have a doubt though.. Should notes link only to older ones? If yes, they are connected like a directed acyclic graph.
The argument for it would be:
need to change, they are just linked to from new ones
Counterarguments:
Also I am not sure what the implications would be for links between literature and permanent notes.
Like.. Literature note can link to previous permanent notes that are useful for the idea. But what for permanent notes created just to explain something in the literature note? I guess we treat them as if they were older than the literature note, even if the UID is more recent (timestamp) breaking a bit the rule. This means: create the new permanent note but linking to it from the older literature note. As for permanent notes that then emerge from literature note review — meaning after finishing the literature note — I guess they link the literature note that inspired their creation.</span>

                    <span>I was looking for an application to edit raw org files on the iPhone and iPad. I currently sync the files I would like to edit via Dropbox. Syntax highlighting and collapsing the structure of the file would be nice, but is not necessary.
 I have tried beorg, but it is not conducive to my workflow. My main file in which I run my life through more or less is &#x27;One Big org File&#x27; similar to this.
 Any recommendations would be greatly appreciated.

                    <span>Hi everyone!
 I want to do a presentation about Emacs to my team. I was looking for videos that would help me motivate them take the challenge of using Emacs, knowing its steep learning curve vs other editors.
 Do you have any recommendations?
 -------------------------------------
 For example I liked the video &quot;Emacs: The editor of a lifetime&quot; that emphasizes the fact that everything you do with a computer is basically editing text. 
 Since Emacs lets you interface with almost all of the apps you use through a unified text editor, you will only have to become an expert at one thing. This shows that using Emacs will give you always more value as time passes.
 I&#x27;m looking for other videos that show inspiring aspects of using Emacs. Many videos out there are tutorials.

                    <span>Guys hi
 I am using org mode to organize my research notes. I need to achieve something like this:
 Total A items: 3 Total B items: 1 * My list ** !A Jessica ** Charlie ** John ** !A Ashley ** !B Tom ** Donald *** !A Joe 
 Basically i want emacs to autocount number of times !A is in document and display it as number next to &quot;Total A items:&quot;, and same for !B.
 What&#x27;s the best way to achieve it?

                    <span>I&#x27;m collecting information on basic Org mode support in tools that are not Emacs.
 I already have: GitHub, GitLab (exactly like GitHub), OrgModeWeb, Orgzly, Orgro, Emacs, vim-orgmode.
 What I need is information on much more tools.
 I have set up a syntax checking file on GitHub which also contains my current compatibility table for the most basic set that makes sense as a Markdown-pendant outside of Emacs according to my subjective judgement on Org mode at the bottom.
 My focus is on tools that - at least - offer text formatting syntax highlighting for *bold* /italic/ and so forth. The rest could be &quot;works as text but has no special support for outlining and more&quot;.
 The goals is to emphasize that there are much more tools that allow for viewing and/or editing data in Org mode syntax.
 Since I don&#x27;t have an iPhone, iOS-based tools supporting Org mode syntax is very much appreciated.
 Please do hand in more lines for the table either here, via email or as a GitHub pull request.
 Thank you!

 Just got GPT-j going. It will use whichever engine you have a key for when running the prompts. GPT-j works surprisingly well for the prompt functions designed for GPT-3!
 Get yourself a free key. Then you can be copiloting and many other things with emacs!

                    <span>Would like to use Emacs as EDITOR and VISUAL and have a quick loading time. I should add that I run mu4e with mu4e t at startup. I tried running Emacs as daemon from my .profile and it hung upon login unless I removed the mu4e startup. I also have the problem that if I log out and back in, I cannot log in the second time because it&#x27;s trying to run the daemon twice.
 I also tried as a systemd unit with the same problem. Can&#x27;t log out and back in. Can anyone advise?
 I&#x27;m new to this by the way. I&#x27;m really loving it.

I don&#x27;t know how to downgrade the org-mode version to an older one.

                    <span>This is an rework of my previous attempt at this with hopefully a more sane appoarch.

 The idea here is to parameterize Type with what I&#x27;m calling an impact. A type with kind Type(Data) is a normal type and can appear anywhere we&#x27;re used to whereas a type with kind Type(Code) can only appear on the right side of the arrow. This should prevent the need to allocate IO thunks because they can always piggyback of the allocation for function types (at least in strict languages, not sure if it applies to lazy ones).
 This can be extended to support levity polymorphism by parametering Type with both an impact and a representation, eg Type(Data, P).
 Edit: I messed up the σ -&gt; σ&#x27; rule. Arrows are always have kind Type(Data).
 Edit2: Rules corrected.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been studying liquid haskell&#x27;s implementation of refinements, and I&#x27;ve not been able to figure out how type constructors with refined argument types desugar into some kind of core calculus. The papers describe a simple, more minimal system. Here&#x27;s is an example of the kind of expression I&#x27;m interested in:
 {-@ weAreEven :: [{v:Int | v mod 2 &#x3D; 0}] @-} weAreEven &#x3D; [(0-10), (0-4), 0, 2, 666 :: Int] 
 Liquid haskell accepts this. How is v quantified? It must be existentially quantified with the quantifier on the inside of the type constructor. We can confirm this with the malformed type:
 {-@ bogusEvenHead :: [{v:Int | v mod 2 &#x3D; 0}] -&gt; {x : Int | x &#x3D;&#x3D; v} @-} bogusEvenHead :: [Int] -&gt; Int bogusEvenHead (y : ys) &#x3D; y 
 Liquid haskell fails with unbound symbol v, which is consistent with the interpretation of [{v:Int | v mod 2 &#x3D; 0}] as [exists (v : Int) | v mod 2 &#x3D; 0}]. Do any of the papers discuss the impact of this kind of existential quantification on checking and inference?

                    <span>Is there a (simple!) way to accomplish what I want ... to explain a bit, I have a tree of items:
  
home stuff 
 living room [1/3] 
 TODO mirror 100
 TODO cabinet 45
 TODO wash carpet
 DONE cabinet 130
 
 home office [1/2] 
 TODO headphones 59
 DONE desk 250
 
 
  
With these, the completion ratio thing was as easy to get as typing in &quot;[/]&quot;, even picking up things recursively only required one rather clumsy, but not too bothersome, :PROPERTIES: definition. Now, the numbers after some of the items are prices of those things. I&#x27;d like a sum of those not yet DONE to show up on the higher level heading, i.e. &quot;bedroom [1/3] 145&quot; and &quot;home office [1/2] 59&quot;. What would be the simplest way to achieve this? Ideally, the summing would work recursively for deeper trees and could be toggled to include either DONE or TODO, or both.
 I tried lazily searching on the Internet for something that does this, but perhaps I had the wrong keywords ... all I found was table mode things, which seemed fancy, but neither very easy to use, nor compatible with my way of doing things---that is, lazily.
 (I&#x27;m a software developer by trade and could probably conjure up some lisp to do this, but I&#x27;d like to think that something close enough to what I want already exists in a usable form, somewhere. And possibly made by someone who is a robust professional, not a lazy hack like me.)
 I&#x27;m using Doom Emacs, in case that makes any difference.

Has anyone found a fix for this? I&#x27;ve already fallen behind schedule on important things on several occasions when the Entry repeats message didn&#x27;t show up in the minibuffer and I didn&#x27;t notice the change until it was too late.

                    <span>Anyone run into the issue of org-set-tags-command not allocating enough vertical space for the minibuffer contents? It seems like the command works as expected the first time I run the command, and then every time afterwards (even across buffers) it instead looks like this.
 Not a big problem, just kind of annoying to not know why it&#x27;s doing this.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been learning scala for about 2 weeks now and stumbled upon a test case that sparked some curiosity with tapir and mock http/client testing.
 Can anybody explain the why the following works under the hood for 400 exception testing:
 implicit val sttp &#x3D; stub .whenRequestMatches(req &#x3D;&gt; req.method.method &#x3D;&#x3D; &quot;DELETE&quot; &amp;&amp; req.uri &#x3D;&#x3D; uri&quot;${hostUrl}/api/docs/doc1?account_id&#x3D;account1&quot;) .thenRespond(Unit) 
 The idea here is that some API returns a 404 if the document is not found either from bad id or no account with that doc id.
 client.deleteDocument(docId &#x3D; &quot;WRONG_DOC_ID&quot;, accoundId &#x3D; &quot;account1&quot;).map { res &#x3D;&gt; res.code shouldBe StatusCode.NotFound // passed this test case by accident passing strings around and misspelling params } // deleteDocument Endpoint documentEndpoints.delete .in(&quot;docs&quot;) .in(path[String]) .in(query[String](name &#x3D; &quot;account_id&quot;)) .out(emptyOutput) // Delete returns an empty response from external api call .errorOut(stringBody) // StatusCode 
 ​
 Essentially I stumbled here because I didn&#x27;t know the inputs to the client.deleteDocument had to be the same values from the uri path and query parameters aka doc1 and account1.
 Can anyone offer an explanation as to what might be happening that returns a not found even though this is a mock http call. Is it mocking that account1 and doc1 will be in the system somehow (maybe from the implicit logic) and by passing in invalid parameters it&#x27;s treating this as a 404.

                    <span>Okay, I have to demonstrate something cool. Lispy has a convolute command, and it&#x27;s hard to describe what it does in words, but it&#x27;s easy to show it. The problem is that it&#x27;s not easy to explain when the command is needed, so it&#x27;s hard to make the case for why it&#x27;s useful.
 But now I have an example: while writing a macro, I have a cl-labels form wrapping a let* form, and I realize that the labels form needs to be inside the let* form. Fixing that manually would require a lot of killing and yanking text. But the convolute command does that for me in a single keypress. Here&#x27;s the macro before convoluting:
 (defmacro ement-with-progress-reporter (reporter-args &amp;rest body) (declare (indent defun)) (pcase-let* ((reporter-sym (gensym)) (progress-value-sym (gensym)) (&#x60;(,_message ,_min-value ,max…</span>

                    <span>With ivy-posframe, I frequently have long file paths that I cannot see because of the size of the frame. https://i.imgur.com/jCrd1FK.png - as you can see, the prompt shows the current file path, but there&#x27;s no way for me to see what I&#x27;m typing at the end of the path. 
 https://i.imgur.com/fvD7XrM.png Here you can see what the prompt would look like in the mini buffer without &#x60;ivy-posframe&#x60; (I&#x27;ve used some handy obfuscation on this buffer but the content is identical) 
 As you can see, without posframe, it spans the entire screen so I can edit the path as I prefer. But I want to be able to truncate the current path with posframe enabled.

                    <span>My specific issue stems from &#x60;org-collect-keywords&#x60; which was just added to org-mode in version 9.4 (released in March 2021). Should I jump on starting to use it? If not, how long should I wait?
 And a few followup questions:
 - is there any way to determine the minimum versions of dependencies that my package requires? (at least to the degree that the imported function exists, but better if the argument number also matches)
 - how much of the required dependencies should I list? given that emacs has many built in and that thus they are provided already by the emacs version itself.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve used Emacs for several years now, but only on Linux. Recently, I began using it on MacOS and ran into a small number of pesky differences (fonts, etc.).
 Is there a way to use automatically use conditional options in my init file based on which OS I&#x27;m working on? My goal is to have one init file for both Linux and MacOS.

                    <span>Is evil-mode customisable in the following ways?
  
select first, act on selection
 remove all the usual navigation (selection?) commands in favour of avy-style movement, where it shows you a bunch of candidates highlighted in the buffer to move to and you just press the corresponding key
 also, how easy is it to reuse parts of evil? I&#x27;m thinking selection, movement commands etc.
  
After using avy a bunch I&#x27;d really like to try modal editing, but I think these are vital for me. I read a lot about evil and even tried to look into the source, but it&#x27;s such a big ecosystem and seems quite content on vi emulation that I&#x27;m unsure how to proceed.
 Thanks!

                    <span>I&#x27;ve recently switched to emacs to give it a solid, fair shake (I&#x27;ve never tried it for more than a day or two, before). I&#x27;ve managed to get almost everything working in a way I like, but I&#x27;m still struggling with JSON formatting in Org babel source blocks.
 I figure I must be missing something obvious because I can&#x27;t be even close to the only person who does a lot of things in JSON, one way or another.
 Basically, given the following org source:
  #+begin_src js { &quot;some&quot;: { &quot;object&quot;: &quot;test&quot; } } #+end_src 
 I would expect to have JSON formatted as I type, with correct indentation, etc... but it&#x27;s all over the place. I have to hit  on each line for the alignment to work itself out. 
 Is there an easy way to get progressive, correct indentation in js in org babel, without having to hit tab on every line?
 This is an example of what it actually looks like, if all I do is hit  for each line:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; { &quot;some&quot;: { &quot;test&quot;: {&quot;object&quot;: &quot;is weird&quot;} }
  } 
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; And yes, its that far indented. I have no custom keybindings set for anything in org mode, and my org config is essentially completely standard.

                    <span>By default, text in info mode is crammed in a column. It would be desirable if some line breaks were removed and words were wrapped automatically according to window width. Any ideas?

 Text with fancy fonts (top) converted to PS file (bottom)
 ​
 Sudoko grid (top) converted to PS file (bottom)
 Here is my next iteration on basic WYSIWYG printing in GNU Emacs for printing fancy fonts and tables. Now you can print Sudoku grid, lotto tickets or quick party invites for some weekend fun.
  
Run M-x ps-print-buffer-with-faces to send output to printer.
 Run C-u M-x ps-print-buffer-with-faces to send output to file (PS format).

                    <span>I seem to remember reading an article (perhaps linked on this subreddit?) where the author showed McBride-style indexed monads m a i -&gt; (forall j. a j -&gt; m b j) -&gt; m b i and Atkey-style indexed monads m i j a -&gt; (a -&gt; m j k b) -&gt; m i k b to be equivalent in power, even though it seems like McBride&#x27;s ones would be strictly more powerful.
 I&#x27;ve been digging for the article (wanted to link it in a Stack Overflow answer) but my Google-fu has failed me. Anyone here recognise this and happen to have a link handy?

                    <span>I have a Haskell function that&#x27;s up and running, but it&#x27;s doing the wrong thing.
 It&#x27;s supposed to output a Fibonacci sequence up to the maximum number specified.
 Like this:
  
fibonacciSequence 86 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 33 54
  
My code is currently outputting the first 10 numbers in a Fibonacci sequence instead of a Fibonacci sequence from 1 to 10.
 It&#x27;s outputting 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 33 54, but it should be 1,1,2,3,5,8.
 fib :: Int -&gt; Int fib 0 &#x3D; 0 fib 1 &#x3D; 1 fib n &#x3D; fib (n-1) + fib (n - 2) ---print (fib n) fibList n &#x3D; map fib[1..n] main &#x3D; do putStrLn &quot;The fibonacci series from 1 to n is:&quot; print (fibList 10) 
 Any help would be GREATLY appreciated. Thanks!

                    <span>Whenever I schedule something with org-schedule I noticed that it will show up in every week&#x27;s agenda unless I delete it. I&#x27;m positive I&#x27;m not understanding something about them correctly, but I would just like to see them if they&#x27;re marked for some future time/date, and not other times after that. Do I need to mark them as done or something?

                    <span>I essentially followed the setup described here:
 https://jingsi.space/post/2017/04/30/org-protocol/ 
 I&#x27;m not using the browser extension though, I took my bookmarklet from the manual:
 https://orgmode.org/manual/The-capture-protocol.html#The-capture-protocol
 This sort of works, except for two things:
 1) When I try to use the expansions %l or %:link to get the url from the bookmarklet, nothing shows up. Even %a only gives the page name.
 2) The expansion %d expands to the last block of highlighted text on a clipboard if nothing is currently highlighted
 Has anyone experienced this?

                    <span>Coming from Haskell. ghci lets you run something like :info Ord which prints the following in the repl
 Prelude&gt; :info Ord class Eq a &#x3D;&gt; Ord a where compare :: a -&gt; a -&gt; Ordering ( a -&gt; Bool ( a -&gt; Bool (&gt;) :: a -&gt; a -&gt; Bool (&gt;&#x3D;) :: a -&gt; a -&gt; Bool max :: a -&gt; a -&gt; a min :: a -&gt; a -&gt; a {-# MINIMAL compare | ( Ord [a] -- Defined in ‘GHC.Classes’ instance Ord Word -- Defined in ‘GHC.Classes’ instance Ord Ordering -- Defined in ‘GHC.Classes’ instance Ord Int -- Defined in ‘GHC.Classes’ instance Ord Float -- Defined in ‘GHC.Classes’ instance Ord Double -- Defined in ‘GHC.Classes’ instance Ord Char -- Defined in ‘GHC.Classes’ instance Ord Bool -- Defined in ‘GHC.Classes’ ... 
 which shows the
  
Typeclass it extends from

 Minimal methods that must be implemented by an instance
 Currently active instances
 (some other stuff not shown above which I don&#x27;t totally understand, but whatever)
  
I&#x27;m looking for how to do this in Purescript?

                    <span>Using P T (bmkp-bmenu-filter-tags-incrementally) in my bmkp bookmark list I can see all bookmarks containing a certain tag, but I cant figure out how to use the regexp input to match 2 or more &quot;AND&quot; tags. eg easy for me to see all bookmarks containing the tag &quot;emacs&quot; but how to see bookmarks with tags &quot;emacs&quot; AND &quot;project&quot;? I *can* use T M * to mark all bookmarks containing more than one tag but I cant then save that list as a tag based dynamic list.
 Thanks for any pointers.

                    <span>Hi everyone! What I&#x27;m trying to do is make it so when C files (ending in .c, .h, or .i) are opened, certain variable and style settings are applied. I only want it to apply to those file types though, since I want different settings for other file types like .cpp for C++. I am on emacs 26.1 at the moment (Debian).
 I&#x27;ve been reading the documentation, wiki pages, and various stack overflow topics, but am having some trouble with it and would appreciate some help. I&#x27;m focusing purely on C for the moment, here&#x27;s what I have been trying (note that the style settings are nowehere near done, this is in-progress):
 (c-add-style &quot;my-c-style&quot; &#x27;((setq c-basic-offset 8) (setq c-indent-tabs-mode t) (c-set-offset &#x27;substatement-open 0))) (defun my-c-mode-hook () (setq indent-tabs-mode t) (setq tab-widt…</span>

                    <span>I&#x27;m playing with adding various small tools to my emacs config. Mostly I&#x27;m wrapping shell commands and I&#x27;d like to display the output in a temp buffer (that can be dismissed with a q).
 This sort of works:
 (with-output-to-temp-buffer &quot;*clone-output*&quot; (shell-command (concat &quot;git clone git@github.com:&quot; repo &quot; &quot; clone-dir) &quot;*clone-output*&quot;) (pop-to-buffer &quot;*clone-output*&quot;) (special-mode)) 
 But it only shows the first line of the shell command. I&#x27;ve attempted a few things (shell-command-to-string for example) but just can&#x27;t seem to make it work. 
 special-mode also doesn&#x27;t seem like what I&#x27;m really after here, it gives me the q to close the buffer but doesn&#x27;t kill it, which more of what I&#x27;d prefer. I&#x27;m sure I could create a mode for what I want but I&#x27;m sure something exists I&#x27;m just looking past it. 
 Any advice?

                    <span>Sometimes I run into issues where the minibuffer loses focus in the middle of an operation. It happens infrequently so I&#x27;ve tolerated it for a while, but now now I&#x27;m hoping to do something about it. 
 After a little research into other minibuffer-related fixes, I&#x27;ve cobbled together something that appears to be working for me (so far): 
 (defun switch-to-minibuffer-window () &quot;switch to minibuffer window (if active)&quot; (when (active-minibuffer-window) (select-frame-set-input-focus (window-frame (active-minibuffer-window))) (select-window (active-minibuffer-window)))) (defun preserve-minibuffer-focus () &quot;keep the minibuffer in focus&quot; (when (and (&gt;&#x3D; (recursion-depth) 1) (active-minibuffer-window)) (switch-to-minibuffer-window))) (add-hook &#x27;mouse-leave-buffer-hook &#x27;preserve-minibuffer-focus) 
 I&#x27;m curious if other folks have experienced similar issues with the minibuffer? 
 Also interested in feedback on this code. I pulled these original snippets, then modified them slightly to achieve my goal:

                    <span>I am trying to understand the rules of emacs words motion and change them if possible.
 Assume we have the following text
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; |word
 ()()end &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Where | is where the point position. Pressing M-f once takes me to end of word, pressing it again takes me to end of end.
 But then pressing M-b once takes me back to just before end, pressing it again takes me to just before word. I find this inconsistent since I go to different points when going forward versus backward.
 Is there a way to make this consistent? I would rather have forward and backward word motion stop at |word, |()()end, ()()|end and ()()end|.

 toggle-debug-on-error leads to a locked Emacs (100% CPU thread) and neither C-g nor multiple esc presses will recover it, so I can&#x27;t get any info.
 This has happened before but I can&#x27;t remember what the fix was.
 Any clues?

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been using Orgmode to make webpages in a literate mode. Code block will evaluate and spit out SVG strings that then get exported/embedded to HTML
 ex: https://geokon-gh.github.io/literate-clojure.html
 This is all very groovy and I get nice documents with images directly embedded in them. I&#x27;m very happy with orgmode and this workflow - its giving me the exact results Ive wanted - however Emacs goes a bit crazy when my SVGs get too complicated. Long SVG are in html RESULTS blocks (it&#x27;s one long SVG string) and this makes Emacs very unhappy
 In the above example the last image is a very extreme example, with a ~500,000 character svg - but I mostly have ~1-200k character SVGs. I mean it&#x27;s large... but it&#x27;s 100s of kilobytes at most, not gigabytes

                    <span>This is a naive solution. Feel free to suggest alternative solutions or improvements.
 https://gist.github.com/ram535/a2153fb86f33ecec587d593c1c5e1623
 The Goal
 When pressing TAB in vterm terminal, we should get a list of suggestion. The suggestion list should either be a file, a directory, a history command or a program name.
 What we need
 This is the list of what we need for the solution.
  
 emacs
  vterm
  bash
  
Step 1 - Get the list of program
 If you go to the terminal and run:
 compgen -c 
 You will get a list of all the programs under the PATH environment variable.
 Let&#x27;s get that list using elisp.
 (shell-command-to-string &quot;compgen -c&quot;) ;; &quot;emacs\nnano\nneovim\nvim.......&quot; 
 This gives us a long string.
 Let&#x27;s split that long string into a list of string.

                    <span>I just tried to configure centaur-tabs (coming from tab-line), and really love it— except, for buffer grouping.
 In tab-line I enjoyed hiding all &quot;*&quot; buffers (except for *scratch*), and keeping every other buffer visible as a tab.
 However, following the README on the projects github, I tried running with the following config without much luck. It seems to retain the default buffer groups (&quot;Org&quot; &quot;Emacs&quot; &quot;Coding&quot; etc).
 Anyone have thoughts on what I&#x27;m getting wrong? Still pretty new to Emacs so might be obvious. Would also appreciate seeing how others set up the package. Thanks!

                    <span>I am building a GUI-application in GTK and try to use reactive-banana as the style of FRP seems a lot better to work with in Haskell. The basis works: receiving events from the GTK-side lets me properly update the internal state. The problem however is when I want to create my own events and hook them onto the rest of the event-network I get a deadlock. I already sent an issue on Github, https://github.com/HeinrichApfelmus/reactive-banana/issues/216 , but looking at the commits it seems it is not that actively maintained anymore. I was able to find some kind of work-around for a basic use-case, but it is not enough when dealing with an event-stream that will fire multiple events. I created the following test-code to check where the problem lies (a bit simplified from the one on Github):

                    <span>I am working my way through Will Kurt&#x27;s &quot;Get Programming in Haskell&quot; and cannot help myself relating concepts to OOP as the author also does from time to time. Please excuse my lack of terminology or feel free to correct me.
 The main points that differentiate it from OOP so far seem to be:
 -no inheritance but use sum types to mix and match
 -&quot;thinking in types&quot; meaning creating types and then using &quot;instance&quot; to give them traits that you want which feels makes types feel like structs or lightweight classes with attributes
 Please feel free to add some other insights but limited to a novice to low intermediate level. I like the book but do find myself searching GitHub for other people&#x27;s solutions to the end of chapter questions which I have worked through to Chapter 17. I want to refrain from mentioning what that chapter is on so that discussion does not become focused on that part.

I have a distant memory that it once was possible to enter something like &quot;tomorow&quot; or &quot;next friday&quot;, but it seems this doesn&#x27;t work anymore. I didn&#x27;t find anything about it in the documentation.
 Does anyone know if this was possible at some point and why it is not anymore?

                    <span>When I put the latex command \, into an org document it gets exported to $\backslash$, . How can I make it be exported to \, (latex for &quot;narrow non-breaking space&quot;)?
 I suspect this has to do with the fact, that it&#x27;s a one-letter command. Other latex stuff works as expected.

 Why?
 Also, when I run log &quot;hello&quot; or something, I get &quot;Unknown value log&quot; even though Main has import Effect.Console (log). When you import Main into the repl does it not run all the import statements contained therein?

                    <span>The reference card itself, just in case: https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/refcards/pdf/refcard.pdf
 Could somebody explain me:
  
What is the reason that some words are put in bold, as &quot;read&quot; in &quot;read a file into Emacs&quot;?
 Why some articles are omitted and some are not, as in &quot;save a file back to [no article] disk&quot;?
 Isn&#x27;t it that the word &quot;later&quot; in &quot;select next later search string&quot; is excessive and actually should be removed?
  
Sure, these questions are more about English language than Emacs itself, so sorry if you expected something different.
 I&#x27;m a foreigner who is somewhat over-concerned about language questions and issues. Cheers. :)

                    <span>Essentially the workflow would be like this: 
 (1) write some literate code in org. 
 (2) tangle that code to one or more files. 
 (3) git commit those files. 
 (4) have lunch 
 (5) git pull my colleague&#x27;s changes. 
 (6) &quot;inverse-tangle&quot; those changes back into code blocks in my org file
 Can anybody tell how this is working for you? In particular I&#x27;m interested how &quot;non-org&quot; team-members handle the comments in the tangled files, linking back to the org file.

 Is there a way to justify center the latex preview in the screenshot above.

                    <span>I use Doom Emacs. Currently I am working on a Jekyll site. I have an org file, which I wanted to export it to markdown. I need to export literally the front matter which has some variables in it (the line inside --- block). At first I am using emacs&#x27; default backend (md I guess?), then I found that emacs&#x27; default backend won&#x27;t export src block nicely (md export).
 Then I search online, and found ox-pandoc. When I use ox-pandoc to export the org file to markdown (gfm specifically), it exports the src block like I wanted, but it export the front matter differently from the md backend (ox-pandoc export). How to fix this behaviour?

                    <span>Dear Japanese or Chinese users here, 
 How do you solve the word-wrap problem? 
 https://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug&#x3D;29364
 This link described the problem, and this is what I am facing now (and definitely I am not the only one). 
 But I couldn&#x27;t find any solution.
 There is a message in the correspondence (the link above) saying:
  
This has been fixed in Emacs 28. You can now say (setq word-wrap-by-category t) to make Emacs respect kinsoku rules when wrapping lines visually.
  
But I don&#x27;t know there is an &quot;Emacs 28.&quot;

 The figure is rendered inside latex using circuitikz package inside latex.
 The latex snippet is given below.
 \begin{circuitikz} \draw (0,0) to[battery] (0,4) to[ammeter] (4,4) -- (4,0) to[lamp] (0,0) (0.5,0) -- (0.5,-2) to[voltmeter] (3.5,-2) -- (3.5,0) ; \end{circuitikz}

 As in the title; no idea why.
 Any help would be greatly appreciated!

                    <span>I use GNU Emacs 26.3 and I&#x27;m looking for a better syntax highlighting package for Cpp. I find the highlighting in spacemacs very appealing and was wondering if I could install it in my Emacs?
 Any inputs would be appreciated.
 Thanks.

 Today I released the first version of a tiny library to facilitate asynchronous local caching of infrequently updated data from a remote source.
 Thanks to all of those here who reviewed early versions of the code and gave input to improve the functionality!

                    <span>2021 July release of HLS arrives! This release includes binaries for GHC 9.0.1 and some new interesting features. Here is the brief summary of changes:
  
Binaries for GHC 9.0.1 are added by u/anka-213.
 Call hierarchy plugin is added, contributed by u/July541.
  
https://i.redd.it/e0pwhgp07le71.gif
  
Now completions work with definitions from non-imported modules, thanks to u/pepeiborra.
  
https://i.redd.it/0bazgno37le71.gif
  
Eval plugin 
 The plugin supports GHC 9.0.1, thanks to u/berberman.
 
 &#x60;:info&#x60; command is added by u/akrmn.
 The plugin uses the same default language as GHCi with u/fmehta&#x27;s patch. 
 Wingman, where most changes owing to u/isovector
 Wingman no longer changes the fixity of function definitions.
 Wingman now gives unique names to the holes it generates.
 Wingman&#x27;s ability to reason about polymorphic and GADT types is significantly improved.
 Wingman no longer suggests homomorphic destructs when the codomain is larger than the domain.
 &quot;Complete case constructors&quot; action supports empty lambda cases.
 Wingman now gives a warning if it ran out of gas during &quot;attempt to fill hole&quot;.
 Metaprogramming for Wingman has been improved with symbolic-name support and the &#x60;pointwise&#x60; combinator.
 An option to enable/disable Wingman&#x27;s proof state styling is added.
 Hole fit suggestions are now disabled for performance reasons when using Wingman.
 
 Hovering on a name displays the package where the name is defined, contributed by u/berberman.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve met them in profunctor optics tutorials, but I can&#x27;t understand how to think about them. Sure, they are just &quot;double&quot; functors, that are contravariant on the first type argument and covariant on the second one, but how the hell should I understand why Strong profunctors form lenses, and Choice ones form prisms, e.t.c.? Even this video, where there are only UpStar profunctors disguised as regular functions, was hard to wrap my head around.

                    <span>I usually use a combination of handwritten notes and org-mode based notes. For example, when interviewing candidates, I will often scribble notes as I go along, as I feel it better allows me to also stay focused on the conversation. I then summarise into org at the end. I feel this isn&#x27;t the best workflow, especially if I end up jumping immediately onto another call.
 This usually isn&#x27;t a problem, but I&#x27;ve actually been travelling a bit over the last couple of weeks, and as it happens, I&#x27;ve left a number of important handwritten notes (incl interview notes) back in my home office.
 This has caused me to reflect on how I work. I&#x27;ve realised, particularly for interview notes, but also other types, that it would suffice for me to just take a photo and embed that into org. If I wanted to get fancy, I could invest in a digital note taking platform, etc.
 I&#x27;d like to hear from people who have faced similar issues and how you have tackled it.

                    <span>I am working with Akka gRPC for a project that requires it. It&#x27;s totally messed up my IntelliJ. Many imports don&#x27;t work, type annotations don&#x27;t work for method returns it can&#x27;t figure out, and I spend too much time doing &#x60;println(obj.getClass)&#x60;. Is this the case for others too?

                    <span>I&#x27;m trying to reformat a date string that&#x27;s the form &quot;YYYY-MM-DD&quot; but when I try to parse it, so that I can then reformat it, I get the wrong result. E.g., (format-time-string &quot;%Y-%m-%d&quot; (date-to-time &quot;2021-03-03&quot;)) evaluates to &quot;1999-12-31&quot;.
 If I use u/github-alphapapa&#x27;s excellent ts.el package I don&#x27;t have any such problem: i.e., (ts-format &quot;%Y-%m-%d&quot; (ts-parse &quot;2021-03-03&quot;)) gives the expected result. I don&#x27;t mind just using ts.el, but I&#x27;d like to understand why the base Emacs lisp code doesn&#x27;t work.

                    <span>I rely on outshine-mode for its ability to create headings in a wide variety of files. It helps for navigation.
 However, for Javascsript files, the syntax for an outshine header means that the headers are indented when I do things like indent-region or evil-indent, shifting it away from the first column, which means outshine does not recognize it as a header anymore.
 Has anyone observed this as well and/or found a workaround? Thank you!

                    <span>Hi guys, newbie here.
 Been learning emacs in my spare time for a few weeks, I&#x27;m getting comfortable with it and I now want to install packages to enhance my ui and experience. I came across doom-themes and spacemac-theme, installed them, but didn&#x27;t quite get the same looks as in the screenshots. My treemacs icons are looking huge and old, and no vertical indentation lines (unlike in this screenshot: emacs-doom-themes/doom-one-light.png at screenshots · hlissner/emacs-doom-themes (github.com) ), My org files don&#x27;t look as nice as in the 5th spacemacs-theme screenshot, when I headline stuff (&quot;* ...&quot; or &quot;** ...&quot;) instead of showing small radio-button-like circles on the side, it just shows them as is.
 If anyone knows about any of the packages/settings used in any of those screenshots, please comment them. I already know about ivy, ivy-rich, ivy-posframe, magit, counsel, treemacs, linum-mode, scrollbar-mode, variable-pitch-mode.

                    <span>Hi, 
 I am an emacs newbie and I have been experiencing problems with M-x ediff-files and ediff-files3 while copying a region from one file to another. Emacs just hangs up in the middle of copying and I have to SIGKILL emacs. One peculiarity I see is that the emacs process keeps on eating my ram (memory leak?) incrementally in steps of 2 MB/s endlessly.
 ​
 This behaviour also happens randomly: like during typing a keybinding for example C-x and then it just freezes.
 I am using the vanilla ediff-files function without any customizations.
 How can I get around this?

                    <span>The ripgrep command I use to consult-ripgrep, that uses consult-ripgrep-command.
 How can I add this option to my ripgrep command, -g &quot;pattern&quot;, which has the following value:
 rg --null --line-buffered --color&#x3D;ansi --max-columns&#x3D;1000 --no-heading --line-number . -e ARG OPTS 
 What I did is to concat it at the end command, but I think OPTS in the string is prevent it from working as intended. Because I tested it on command line as well without OPTS and ARG replaced with the pattern.

 I might accidentally enabled some mode in emacs, now when I do TAB which is bound to completion at point with for instance /home/usr/data it will list everything start with data, but if I have a typo, I hit TAB with /home/usr/dada it supposes to say no match but it actually deletes /home/usr from the command line with only dada left. This is very annoying when Im looking for some file and have a typo in the file name

                    <span>Update: projectile-mode seems to mess this up. after disabling it it works fine
 Hi!, I have a setup like
  
app1/
 app2/
  
etc, which all have a main.cpp file and their build/ directory.
 The problem is when I am at app2 and run (compile), if there&#x27;s an error in main.cpp, it (wrongfully) opens app1/main.cpp instead of app2.main.cpp
 The compilation output includes the following lines in the beginning  meson compile -Cbuild ninja: Entering directory &#x60;build&#x27;  And the error looks like  ../main.cpp:6:1: error: 
 After searching, I saw that emacs is supposed to parse and use the entering directory.. (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10451242/how-to-adjust-the-path-that-emacs-compile-goto-error-gets-from-the-compilation). The regex is working (in compilation--parse-region (re-search-forward (car compilation-directory-matcher) end t) )
 After some debugging, I&#x27;m finding that this is the place where the wrong file is being returned
  (apply #&#x27;compilation-find-file marker (caar (compilation--loc-&gt;file-struct loc)) (cadr (car (compilation--loc-&gt;file-struct loc))) (compilation--file-struct-&gt;formats (compilation--loc-&gt;file-struct loc))) 
 Any ideas where things go wrong? Using emacs 27.1 GNU Emacs 27.1 (build 1, x86_64-pc-linux-gnu, GTK+ Version 3.24.20, cairo version 1.16.0) of 2020-09-19

                    <span>Hive isn&#x27;t quite SQL, but I would really like a way to use Haskell types to wrangle all these Hive table schemas and write type-checked queries.
 If nothing supports it out of the box, are any of them easy to extend/fork in order to support Hive?
 Esqueleto, for instance, seems quite nice &amp; basically what I want. But I would need to write some kind of Hive backend to persistent. And then I&#x27;d end up using TH to map Hive tables to Haskell (not that bad..)
 Short of that, any tips for building something that would work for Hive?
 I really just need Haskell -&gt; SQL String conversion. I don&#x27;t need a library to manage the connection to Hive itself. It&#x27;s the SQL I care about.

 I have some experience with haskell, which I&#x27;ve put on my CV, on the basis of which some opportunities have come up.
 My questions are twofold 1. What can I expect from a haskell specific hiring process for a fresh-out of college, junior dev kinda situation? 2. How do I go about finding more leads? I&#x27;ve tried many job-boards, and many of them are asking for prior commercial experience with haskell, or post-grad qualifications
 Any help on this would be greatly appreciated, this is my only source for any real knowledge on the topic

                    <span>I was watching this, but then smoke started coming out of my ears circa the 21:00-mark. But before the melting and smoking, I did realize that this sort of thing
 &gt; [(x,y) | x &lt;- [1,2], y &lt;- [&#x27;a&#x27;,&#x27;b&#x27;]] [(1,&#x27;a&#x27;),(1,&#x27;b&#x27;),(2,&#x27;a&#x27;),(2,&#x27;b&#x27;)] 
 is from now on strictly amateur hour stuff, that there must be a Wadler/Bird-approved way, a composing function &quot;point-free&quot; style to get a Cartesian product &quot;observation.&quot; Would anyone have some CT way of doing the two &quot;product candidates&quot;, A x B and X in the video (and in many other set-CT tutorials)? I may just be hallucinating, but this first dip into CT tells me the usefulness lies in being able to not have to brute-force your way through a set theory definition of the Cartesian product; rather, we&#x27;re taking this up to a higher abstraction that gives a sort of automated Cartesian product. So is there a point-free version of the definition @ 18:11?

                    <span>I&#x27;m creating some custom js/html/css for my org-html export, However, I&#x27;m adjusting things with the name org-html-* (e.g. &#x60;org-html-block-collapsible)
 If I just load my config, then it errors saying that it can&#x27;t the variable org-html-whatever. If I do (require &#x27;org) or (use-package org) then it works, but my startuptime increases by 2-3 seconds 
 Is there a way to tell emacs that those variables exist, but still lazy load org? I&#x27;m using doom emacs

                    <span>I recently upgraded Org from 9.4.1 to 9.4.6, which changed how the bodies of headlines indent. Ever since I started using Org, things indented like:
 **** foo bar :PROPERTIES: :FOO: bar :END: 1234 
 But now, the body (and property drawers etc) don&#x27;t indent under the body, they stay flush at the left edge:
 **** foo bar :PROPERTIES: :FOO: bar :END: 1234 
 I prefer the indented style. I don&#x27;t see anything in the changelog about this, nor any obvious variables that would control it.
 How do I get the old indent behavior back?

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been an Emacs and org-mode user for almost a year now and after learning a lot about it, I decided to do a revamp and start fresh again (not only in Emacs, but in my life, my systems), with the knowledge I gather this past year.
 Doing so, I realized I don&#x27;t have (or rather don&#x27;t know, to be more precise) a way to get a look in the things I&#x27;ve done. Let me paint you a picture: I&#x27;m a CS major who wants to do research. I read a lot, and I&#x27;m expected to write a lot. In the past year I worked into getting those things in Emacs (and for 95% of the cases I succeed). Although it all became centralized around org-mode, I realized those systems never gave me feedback, like &quot;how much did I wrote today&quot; or &quot;I spent X time reading those stuff&quot; or, more simply, &quot;I did Y tasks today, and Z this week&quot;. Once a task is done, she is just gone into the void.
 More recently, through some amazing work of karlicoss, I discovered the whole #quantifiedself and wondered how order may see this and/or solve this problem? You have a way to review your progress? Maybe a progress bar of some sort, of your week or project? I would appreciate some ideas about this matter.

                    <span>Hi,
 I do think that many Orgers are changing IDs all the time as long as they tend to keep a human readable ID aligned with a changed heading text.
 When I do have the urge to change an existing ID property which is just used within the same file, I need to close the Org file in Emacs, re-open the buffer either in Emacs in basic mode or in vim, apply search&amp;replace for the ID and re-open it in Emacs/Org mode again.
 The reason is that - by default or at least in my setup - text in link targets is not affected by search&amp;replace.
 Is there a more clever way of doing this?
 Optimum would be something like &quot;change this ID (either by yanking manually, point on property or point on link to an ID) in all agenda files&quot;. But I&#x27;m also interested in an improved workaround in comparison to my method above.

                    <span>Hello,
 can someone tell me where can I find configuration files of vhdl-mode in emacs? I want to copy my vhdl-mode configuration so I can put it on other computer. It should be somewhere in .emacs.d directory but it seems like I can&#x27;t find them(I tried looking in ~/.emacs.d/elpa/26.3/ but no success).
 It would help me a lot because I have customized TB generation option a lot. I wouldn&#x27;t like doing it from scratch again.
 Thanks,

Why does the lambda have ,? Shouldn&#x27;t it just evaluate to a closure without the ,
 
Why is the display-buffer-* list not quoted?
 
What exactly is being passed to display-buffer-alist? 3 of the elements are associations, one is a list and one is a lambda.... so how is this an list?

                    <span>I am using Doom emacs, where the menu bar is turned off by default. 
 I know that I can toggle menu bar mode with M-x menu-bar-mode.
 But instead of always having to toggle the menu bar when I need it, I only want to enable the menu bar for specific file extensions. For now, only files that end with &quot;.v&quot; and &quot;.fst&quot;. Is there a way to do this?

 (whitespace-mode +1) (setq whitespace-style &#x27;(face tabs trailing)) 
 in the mode hook for a programming mode I use. I thought this would only show me visible indications of tab characters and trailing whitespace, but instead I see $ signs at the end of every line and &quot;·&quot; in place of every space character. Have I misunderstood something or is emacs just not behaving correctly?

                    <span>I am a CSE undergrad student, new to Emacs.
 I have seen tutorials on setting up Org Agenda, but I&#x27;d like to know more workflows. u/Nicolas-Rougier wrote an amazing blogpost on his workflow, I&#x27;d like to know how everybody else is using Org Agenda.
 I would appreciate things like your day job, agenda-files setup, and if possible a screenshot of your current agenda view. Thanks!

                    <span>I have observed that while setting it globally is meaningless in .el files, it indeed affetcs eval-expression.
 If I evaluate this with M-:: 
 (let ((val 1)) (defalias &#x27;foo (lambda () (interactive) (print val)))) 
 M-x foo will raise an error without lexical-binding.
 So there&#x27;s some benefits if I do enable, but will there be breakage elsewhere?

                    <span>Found a wired behavior in gui emacs on macos.
  
 There&#x27;s rendering lag when call next-line with j (hold j key)
 And the rendering is smooth when call next-line with C-n
  
 I&#x27;ve recored a video reproducing it withemacs- Q and uploaded it at https://youtu.be/mdvTZERI8RM
  
 Anyone encountered the same problem and happen to know how to fix it? Searched through the internet found nothing.
  
 BTW: it only happends in gui, emacs in terminal don&#x27;t have this problem
  
 emacs version is 28.0.50 https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/commit/?id&#x3D;dd34bef7d3769a8574bcee2c1e91e8445129af75 built with build-emacs-for-macos https://github.com/jimeh/build-emacs-for-macos/tree/1c2745cd366cacc3c5b579c80d7375aaedbd1608/
  
 another video, inserts have the same problem https://youtu.be/snKCdEB6h0U

                    <span>Videos for the Oregon Programming Languages Summer School (OPLSS) have been uploaded (see this YouTube playlist). One interesting lecture series is called &quot;Principles of Programming Languages&quot; by Robert Harper (link to the first lecture).
 One interesting topic discussed in the second lecture is by-name (e.g. lazy) evaluation vs by-value (strict) evaluation. The main observation being that with by-name evaluation (e.g. in Haskell) it is not possible to define inductive data types because the data types can always contain hidden computations. This has several consequences: it is no longer correct to apply mathematical induction to these data types (at 40:00) and exceptions can occur in unexpected places (at 1:05:24).

                    <span>I find it quite strange, as to me it is not mathy at all. Perhaps it is a bit more rigorous in ensuring that stuff works, but does not seem mathy by itself. In the end, no one is mentioning limits, topological spaces or manifolds. So I am wondering, why do ppl say haskell is mathy?

                    <span>I&#x27;m hoping to use the linear package to demonstrate matrix and vector operations in an educational setting, but sometimes converting exact mathematical expressions to numbers can obscure their simplicity. Eg. sqrt 2 becomes 1.4142... and then ends up completely unrecognisable in the output of subsequent calculations (eg. 0.7071... instead of sqrt 2 / 2). What I want is something like:
 mat &#x3D; V2 (V2 1 (sqrt 2)) (V2 3 4 ) ---------------------------- &gt; mat !* (V2 1 1) V2 2.4142... 7.0 -- Not like this V2 (1 + Sqrt 2) 7 -- More like this 
 Allowing for named variables as well would be even better. I started making my own DSL to do this, but writing a simplifier for algebra is not at all trivial and I suspect finding the simplest equivalent expression probably requires some kind of non-determinism/backtracking (not sure if algebra has a sensible normal form), so I&#x27;ve hit a &#x27;maybe I should see if someone else has already done this&#x27; wall.
 Ideally I would like:
  
An eDSL for expressions containing at least basic arithmetic, surds, and named variables (easy enough to do by itself)
 A robust simplifier (speed is not especially important)
 Num and Fractional instances (or at least the ability to make my own out of it) 
 Not super fussed if they&#x27;re strictly lawful or not, I&#x27;d just like to be able to use them in Num/Fractional polymorphic functions like the matrix operations in Linear
 
  
The closest library I&#x27;ve managed to find on hackage is th-cas, which has the same sort of DSL I&#x27;d like, but a pretty half-hearted simplifier that can&#x27;t really handle the outputs of any matrix operations.
 Does what I want (more or less) already exist for Haskell?

 Today I actually wrote a small function that allow to filter different projects into different Calendars (so here I want to see how I work on ONE of my projects).
 I wanted to be able to see my OrgMode Clockings in my Calendar, so I wrote this script.
 It&#x27;s pretty simple but maybe some of you will find it useful https://github.com/mmagnus/OrgModeClocking2Calendar
 this approach works only on Mac right now (I&#x27;m using Apple Scripts inside) but it will insert events into Google Calendars as well if they are seen in Apple Calendar.
 Enjoy!

                    <span>Greetings! I am a doctoral student hoping to gain insights about the Zettelkasten system. It is my hope to develop a system that allows me to write productively for my field and accrue a vast body of knowledge along the way. From what I have read thus far on the forum, articles about the Luhmann&#x27;s numerical system have piqued my interested because I do want to use it in my system; however, I am still trying to grasp exactly how the new UID, aside from Luhmann&#x27;s numerical one, is used for linking to other notes in the digital slip-box. I am currently deepening my understanding of this system by reading How To Take Smart Notes.
Pertaining to software, I am in need of advice. I have both Obsidian and Zettlr downloaded, having used Obsidian in the past for note taking but not as well organized as I would have liked. The latter software is a recent find; I have no experience with it. Yet I am open to suggestions concerning other applications available for Linux.
With regard to my studies, I am in the midst of my coursework and trying to figure out my niche, but I do have an affinity for Plato and Spinoza. What led me to the field in the first place was the Islamic philosophers, namely Al-Farabi and Ibn-Rushd (Averroes). Anyhow, I look forward to perusing the forum for past insights and discussions.</span>

                    <span>I have my head wrapped around taking notes from your typical nonfiction books and feeding them into my zettelkasten. I&#x27;m not sure though what is the best way to take notes from a textbook if you are learning a topic for the very first time (psychology 101, history 101, neuroscience 101, etc.)?
If you were to be incredibly systematic with it, I imagine it&#x27;d take an incredibly long time because they tend to be information dense. So what level of note-taking is the right one? At the most abstract, you could reduce the textbook down to a paragraph summary. You could reduce it down into a set of notes based on the key concept of each chapter. Or you could be extremely detailed and create a note for every concept you come across. The advantage of that is it might help you see how everything is connected and you have a large set of notes to hook new notes from. The disadvantage would be that it is an incredible time sink and that a lot of the concepts aren&#x27;t worth having notes on because you will internalize them as you do with common words.</span>

                    <span>Probably in package form, but in the which key popip, something like counsel search the current key chord options, so you don&#x27;t have to just page back and forth or hunt and pec if it&#x27;s hard to did through them?

 I thought I would share this code snippet to make inline square roots in org mode. It will put overline over any text within curly braces immediately following a square root symbol (√). I also have the font of the square root symbol itself set to Iosevka, because its square root glyph is closest to lining up with the overline, but you can set it to any font you want.
 (defface sqrt-delimiter &#x27;((t :height 0.1)) &quot;Face for the curly braces around square roots.&quot;) (defface sqrt-symbol &#x27;((t :family &quot;Iosevka&quot;)) &quot;Face for the square root symbol.&quot;) (font-lock-add-keywords &#x27;org-mode &#x27;((&quot;√&quot; (0 &#x27;sqrt-symbol)) (&quot;√\\({\\)\\([^}\n]*\\)\\(}\\)&quot; (1 &#x27;(:overline t :inherit sqrt-delimiter)) (2 &#x27;(:overline t)) (3 &#x27;(:overline t :inherit sqrt-delimiter)))))

                    <span>Does anyone know how to compile a latex project (e.g., based on projectile) rather than just the current buffer? 
 To be clear, I often have multiple tex file all imported by a single file (e.g., main.tex). I would like to be able to compile the project even if I am current visiting a file &quot;appendix.tex&quot; which is imported by main.tex . 
 Is there some way to tell auctex or something which file to use when compiling? I feel like this must be a common problem... no?
 Thank you all in advance.

                    <span>I had a working version of org-roamv2, but after updating my packages recently, I get the following error message:
 Autoloading file .../elpa/org-roam-20210728.1341/org-roam.elc failed to define function org-roam-graph 
 This also happens when I start with a fresh emacs config using emacs -q and install org-roam from there. What is strange is that I am not experiencing this error with my spacemacs config (using chemex2).
 Any thoughts or suggestions on why the function isn&#x27;t working? I don&#x27;t see any issues on the GitHub repo about this. I can get this to work by loading the org-roam-graph.el file manually, but I think this shouldn&#x27;t be necessary.

                    <span>Trying to install back-button in emacs 25, Kubuntu 18.04. 
 I downloaded back-button.el from www.emacswiki.org/emacs/back-button.el to the directory .emacs.d in my home folder. I chmod a+xrw back-button.el. 
 Then, I included
 (require &#x27;back-button)
 (back-button-mode 1)
 in my . emacs and started a new instance of emacs. I get the error message 
 An error occurred while loading ‘.emacs’:
 File error: Cannot open load file, No such file or directory, back-button
 Any idea? I just want to be able to navigate the files in Emacs as I do in Acroread or Okular, where you have a button to come back to the page you&#x27;ve seen last time. 
 Thanks in advance

                    <span>Hello, everyone! As it says in the title, this is my first time trying Emacs (although, technically, my second time installing it). I had been using Neovim exclusively prior to that and absolutely loving it (I still do), but I always knew I wanted to try out Emacs at some point. A few days ago I heard about native-comp coming to Emacs 28, and given that the Nix emacs-overlay provided emacsGcc, now seemed like the perfect time to do so!
 A few days (and a lot of reading documentation and running rg and fd over Doom Emacs&#x27;s source code) later, I have to say I&#x27;m impressed! I was expecting Emacs to be excellent, no surprises there; what I didn&#x27;t expect was how passionate and active the community is. It&#x27;s honestly inspiring seeing how much time and effort is being put into the various community…</span>

                    <span>Suppose you have a bunch of tasks (for example 30 tasks) which you want to to in a given period of time (for example in the next 3 weeks), where the tasks may have very different durations from several minutes to several days. Further assume that you can order the tasks during the given period of time freely. 
 What would would be a good workflow using org mode to assist making a plan when to do which task?

                    <span>I&#x27;d like to write a function that lets me open the shell in a window that spans the bottom of the frame, basically where the mini buffer would be. I&#x27;d like to bind it to a key so I can quickly open and close the shell.
 It would be awesome to also have the compilation buffer also show up there as well.
 Anyone familiar with Elisp know how to write that?

                    <span>I&#x27;ve just finished reading though Abstract Data Types without the Types
 It talks about ADTs dynamically typed languages, but it also uses Miranda vs Haskell as comparison and talks how those two languages have different methods at guaranteeing abstraction:
 ​
  
Turner’s Miranda offers a style of data abstraction different from that found in other languages, such as ML, HOPE, and Haskell. Miranda uses type signatures where the others use information hiding to enforce seals; I will refer to the two approaches respectively assigning and sealing. 
  
Paper also latter mentions that Standard ML now supports both ways.
 ​
  
How are those two things (&quot;singing&quot; and &quot;sealing&quot;) called in Standard ML?
 (My google searches... turned out some song singing contests... xD)
 How is Miranda singing related to GADTs?

                    <span>I have Org files with many tables in them, and I was surprised that there aren&#x27;t any functions in Org (and also apparently nothing online) for jumping between tables. Looking at the implementation of org-table-map-tables, I cooked up my own functions:
 (defun org-next-table (&amp;optional arg) &quot;Jump to the next table. With a prefix argument ARG, jump forward ARG many tables.&quot; (interactive &quot;p&quot;) (dotimes (n arg) (let ((pt (point))) (when (org-at-table-p) (goto-char (org-table-end))) (if (re-search-forward org-table-line-regexp nil t) (when (org-invisible-p) (org-reveal t) (org-show-entry) (unless (org-at-table-p) (org-next-table 1))) (goto-char pt))))) (defun org-previous-table (&amp;optional arg) &quot;Jump to the previous table. With a prefix argument ARG, jump backward ARG many tables.&quot; (interactive &quot;p&quot;) (dotimes (n arg) (let ((pt (point))) (when (org-at-table-p) (goto-char (org-table-begin))) (if (re-search-backward org-table-line-regexp nil t) (progn (when (org-invisible-p) (org-reveal t) (org-show-entry) (unless (org-at-table-p) (org-previous-table 1))) (goto-char (1+ (org-table-begin)))) (goto-char pt))))) 
 The main challenge for me was dealing with invisible text. My solution to use a recursive call works okay, but in my opinion its not very elegant. Would it be better to decrement n instead?
 I hope some of you find these useful!

 1.1 Level 2
 1.2 Another Level 2
 1.2.1 Level 3
 Now it looks like this:
  
Main
  
Level 2
 
Another Level 2
 
 
Level 3
  
I look through the org manual at all the export settings and still have no clue what changed and why it works for ASCII and not HTML.
 Thanks for any help!

                    <span>Hi everyone!
 This is probably a naïve question, but given that so much of algebird revolves around monoids, it surprises me that the exponential histogram, described as &quot;a sliding window counter,&quot; doesn&#x27;t have a Monoid instance. It would seem to me that, since ExpHist is defined by a Config with an epsilon and a windowSize, and a Vector of Buckets with a size and a timestamp, that the empty for the Monoid would be empty from ExpHist with a Config with (0L, 0L), and plus from Semigroup would start with the empty ExpHist, use a Config taking the maximum of each element from the Configs of the two ExpHists, and simply call addAll on the ++ of the buckets Vectors from the two ExpHists. This seems sound, because the comment on addAll says all timestamps in the vector being added must be &gt;&#x3D; the time of the ExpHist being added to... which, given that we&#x27;re starting with empty, will be 0.
 My main question, then, regards the soundness of combining two Configs simply by taking the max of each field, especially epsilon. My intuition is &quot;take the greater possible error,&quot; but I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s correct.
 Does anyone have any ideas here?

                    <span>Hello everybody!
 Going to rewrite the almost 10-years old Spark Application to the modern stack.
 I&#x27;m not sure about Scala 3, because the current codebase is 2.10/2.11. And I don&#x27;t want to break everything in one moment :)
 I&#x27;d like to get some inputs from those of you who are using/used both of them or have strong pros/cons for a particular one. 
 Basically, the application will:
 - read from Kafka
 - deserialize XML (probably JAXB will be used due to ~300 nested entities)
 - do a lot of transformations (~500 different types)
 - serialize
 - write to Kafka
 Previously we were using HDFS, for now, everything is Kafka :)
 Mostly all transformations are stateless,
 but sometimes it would be nice to pass the state between different element mapping. 
 P.S. I have a good experience with Akka Streams, it&#x27;s good,
 but I want to shift some burden on the compiler.

                    <span>If you have a large Haskell code base, organized in multiple Cabal
packages, with many system dependencies, and which takes very long
to build, then this post is for you. We describe herein
gazelle_cabal, a new tool that generates Haskell
rules to build with the Bazel build tool. It saves the
maintainer the trouble of writing these rules to begin with, and
then keeping them synchronized with the Cabal files whenever they
are modified.
Developer teams who want to make a gradual transition to Bazel can
continue to specify builds via Cabal files while still using Bazel to
build their artifacts.
Why Bazel?
Bazel is known to offer caching for builds of multi-language projects.
Once the cache is hot, builds can avoid rebuilding many intermediate artifacts,
shortening the overall build times. Thi…</span>

                    <span>(new to zk)
Given all the discussion of how L-style ID&#x27;s can be association-brittle relative to using just links, I was wondering if the following has an implementation in any digital system.
I&#x27;d like the following:  an L-style ref to &quot;position-sequence&quot; extended to differentiate between paths through the sequence --based on context --  in which one context path may share some im/proper subset of the other.
Example: given say 
Here we have the shared edge (xa,xb) &#x3D; (1b,1ba). And indeed it would be stultifying to assume that the meaning in context2 is partially identical to context1 simply because of the shared referential sub-structure.
Question: for the advocates of links only: is there a simple way to differentiate multiple referential contexts. I.e., to allow for the same edge/link to be given different meaning.
This could be via named links -- not just links named for their nodes, or multi-links, or some in-note context to mimic this behavior.
Does such a thing exist?</span>

                    <span>Embark is an Emacs package providing a context menu at point and in the minibuffer. The context menu is triggered via a single embark-act command, which should be bound to a convenient key, e.g., C-; or C-.. Embark detects the target object at point and provides the user with a set of action commands which can operate on the target.
 Embark in Action
 Recently we made a few developments, which improve the accessibility of Embark:
  
A detailed action indicator, which is enabled by default.
 The target at point is highlighted.
 By pressing the embark-act key, you can cycle between targets, if multiple targets are detected.
  
As an alternative to the detailed action indicator you can configure which-key or use the minimal indicator which shows a brief message in the echo area. The minimal indicator is mainly useful if the keybindings are already familiar. With the minimal indicator it is still possible to request keybinding help by pressing C-h. In order to act with a single key press on the target, Embark offers the embark-dwim command, which performs the default action. The command embark-dwim corresponds to a left click and the command embark-act can be seen as a right click, which opens the context menu.

                    <span>For some time now I&#x27;ve realized that S-Space is being interpreted as just a plain old Space in my Emacs installation. For instance, C-h k S-Space will give me the help for SPC, no matter what mode I&#x27;m in, and (read-key) followed by shift and then space will give me keycode 32, the same code I get when I don&#x27;t press the spacebar. 
 I can&#x27;t figure out what the issue is. As far as I can tell, there is nothing relevant in my config, and emacs -Q shows the same issue. Other gtk programs can register the difference between space and shift-space. 
 Anyone have any brilliant ideas?

                    <span>So real new (day old)emacs user, previous daily driver was vim/nvim. 
 Context:
 Terminal: Alacritty + tmux
 WM: I3 
 Keyboard: Lily58Pro - 58 keys 
 ​
 So I&#x27;m running through the tutorial, but I&#x27;m running into issues in some of the key maps ( alt key combinations ) which i3 is mapped to
 F# keys as well, grant it i haven&#x27;t gone through the tutorial if those are even used yet, and I&#x27;m not to worried as they only get used only at startup ( F1 - F5 are browsers, term, files, spotify etc) so their not that important i can use rofi for that )
 Is there a way to have emacs to &quot;hijack&quot; or take over those keymaps while it is in focus / the active frame ? 
 is that even a thing?

                    <span>I am running racket using geiser within Emacs. The results for rational numbers are coming somewhat weird.
 ;; in geiser (/ 3 2) &#x3D;&gt; 3/2 ;; in Dr. Racket environment (/ 3 2) &#x3D;&gt; 1 1/2 
 I think, it used to come correct, but I goofed up with something, so the results are peculiar. I don&#x27;t know where I goofed up.
 Can anyone please point out where I am doing the mistake.

                    <span>Hi, I am looking email client (or web app) that supports the following two features:
  
Emacs/Vim keybindings
 Latex support
  
As far as I can tell, this does not exist. I tried a few alternatives listed below, but they don&#x27;t work all that well. Also, yes I know that I could use an email client directly in emacs (Mu4e, notmuch). However, this solution has issues with html emails, and seems like overkill for such a limited set of features...
 Latex support
 MarkDownHere (https://markdown-here.com/) + Email Webapp
 This combination works pretty well, but the Latex rendering is kind of low resolution sometimes.
 Emacs/Vim Bindings
 Amazingly I could not find a single solution that really seems to nail these keybindings.
 One attempt at a solution is to enable the keybidings in the browser and then use an email webapp. The following works for Firefox:
 https://askubuntu.com/questions/245746/emacs-like-keybindings-system-wide
 But this solution is not super compatible with email webapps. For exampl, Ctrl-b enables bold on the email webapp instead of shifting the cursor back. This solution also only works for a limited set of keybidings, i.e. no kill/yank combo in emacs.
 Another possible solution is to use something like GhostText (https://github.com/fregante/GhostText) in the browser. However, this solution is unworkable because when you open up an email, all the nasty html shows up in the external editor.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been working on a system which uses recursion-schemes to annotate a recursive type. The annotated tree itself is pretty simple; at each level, we pair the annotation with the base functor, or
 type Annotated t a &#x3D; Cofree (Base t) a 
 It&#x27;s pretty straightforward to use an algebra to annotate a tree from the leaves inward:

                    <span>Hey,
 I am a CS student and learned about monads, monadtranformers, parsers and GADTs in a functional programming&quot; lecture. Now I want to create my first web app. In that web app the user should be able write code for a small programming language in an editor and execute that code. I have already written the lexer, parser and an interpreter but I dont know how to make a nice web app out of it. Can you please point me to the right tools, tutorial and similar projects.

                    <span>This is a really good introduction to the ideas with the historical context that takes you from deforestation all the way to the stream fusion: http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/amal/course/7480-s12/deforestation-notes.pdf
 Once you&#x27;ve read that, I recommend learning more about how phase control, inlining, and RULES interact: https://markkarpov.com/tutorial/ghc-optimization-and-fusion.html
 And if you&#x27;re really ready to dig into the details of stream fusion there is of course Duncan Coutts&#x27;s thesis: https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:b4971f57-2b94-4fdf-a5c0-98d6935a44da/download_file?file_format&#x3D;pdf&amp;safe_filename&#x3D;Thesis%2BPDF%252C%2Blayout%2Bfor%2Bdouble%2Bsided%2Bprinting&amp;type_of_work&#x3D;Thesis
 One important thing to keep in mind before you go off and implement anything using RULES is that RULES can be a dangerous feature if used incorrectly. You need your rules to be terminating and confluent, for example.

                    <span>Hey, I&#x27;m a Scala beginner and I&#x27;m kind of struggling with its Generics.
 Please have a look at this fiddle: https://scalafiddle.io/sf/F0LPuNB/0
 It should be fairly straightforward what I&#x27;m trying to achieve. There should be a Repository of SongWriters available at the end. Running the fiddle causes a type error. I have struggled to resolve this, but I can&#x27;t find a solution. 
 Anybody able to help me out?

                    <span>Greetings, what&#x27;s the current status of having scalaJs work with Scala 3 language features? Last I heard Sebastian and other contributors were working hard to make the necessary compiler plugin adaptations. Latest ScalaJs release brought compatibility to the latest versions of Scala 2, so I&#x27;m wondering now in which phase the upgrade is in currently.

 and this is a demo app made using this SpaceFX running in the browser - https://spacefx.webfx.dev
 This uses GWT, and TeaVM to compile JavaFX to static javascript for making serverless apps. In this way, it is different from JPro.

 When I dot C-p s s, projectile always search from the root of the current project. But most of the time, I want it to search from the current directory. Is it possible?

                    <span>I was thinking about further optimizing my environment when I realized I &quot;finger-bind&quot; my right ring finger to p. It seems that it&#x27;s not the optimal position (for common typist at least), and the &quot;correct&quot; finger seems to be pinky.
 I think I developed this habit because I swapped [( and ]), and because I&#x27;m a heavy Lisp coder my pinky is almost always hovering above (. Therefore I unconsciously adapted to use ring finger to press p. However it does seem to cause lots of unnecessary hand movement.
 Does anyone else share such experience adapting to suboptimal hand positions? I guess anyone aware of this has already rebind  and , but where to put (, for Lispers? I&#x27;m currently considering put it to where ; was, but there&#x27;re already bunch of quite frequent bindings on ; (;, M-;, C-M-;) and it&#x27;s a bit messy to move 5 frequent bindings at once (I always move anything-( together with (). It also breaks the symmetry that ( and ) sit beside each other...

                    <span>Following an upgrade of my work laptop to Big Sur, skipping a few OS versions, I find in Emacs that font-locked text--that is, text rendered in a color other than the default, such as programming language keywords and string literals--is being rendered in a proportional font. It&#x27;s really annoying, especially considering that it&#x27;s happening without my having changed my Emacs configuration at all.
 Any leads on how to revert this behavior would be greatly appreciated. I&#x27;m on Emacs version 27.0.50, which I downloaded from https://emacsformacosx.com/, if it matters.

 How do I ensure that Emacs always queries when encountering such eval forms? Currently I don&#x27;t have any related variables set.

                    <span>I&#x27;m familiar with rainbow-delimiters, which changes the color/face used to display parens and brackets based on nesting level.
 ​
 Is there any way to do this except instead of using color/font changes, visually substitute some of the variety of unicode brace/parenthesis characters available? Like a nesting-level-sensitive prettify-symbols mode.

                    <span>Greetings emacsians,
 Today my new kinesis advantage 2 keyboard arrived and I connected it in place of my old (normal layout) keyboard. Everything I&#x27;ve done so far seems to work, except for certain keys acting slow.
 When I hit &quot;C-x&quot; or &quot;C-h&quot;, the &quot;C-x&quot; or &quot;C-h&quot; is slow to appear in the minibuffer (perhaps a half second delay). Many other keys and key combos (including &quot;M-x&quot;, &quot;C-g&quot;, and &quot;C-s&quot;) seem to work/appear fast in emacs, and Vim responds quickly to &quot;C-x&quot;, so I have no idea what could be causing this. With my old keyboard, &quot;C-x&quot; appeared immediately in the minibuffer after the key combo was hit so this short delay is new. It&#x27;s incredibly weird that it only happens with some keys but not others, it only happens in emacs and not Vim, and it only happens with my new kinesis advantage 2 keyboard and not my all keyboard.
 Does anyone have any idea what could be causing this or how I could fix it? Any ideas or guidance would be much appreciated as I have no idea where to even start looking for the cause of the problem. Thanks!

                    <span>Hey r/emacs!
 So basically what the title says . I&#x27;ve lived vim for multiple years, and evil for many months now. I put evil in my config within first hour of using emacs because I needed to get sufficiently productive fast before I lost interest because of the alien-ness of a different ecosystem.
 I have a bit of time on my hands now and wanna invest this into getting productive with emacs keybindings, among other things. Just want to explore how things are done the emacs way.
 The motivation is more than purely exploratory, though. While evil is the best vim emulation I found, there are still small niggles and I find myself fighting a little when customising packages and keybindings. I use evil-collection and general.el, which are both awesome, btw.
 So, what words of knowledge does the community has for someone like me? I&#x27;d be grateful for tips about keybinding patterns, any good practices related to keybinding customisations etc.

                    <span>I&#x27;d like to have a use-package definition that loads my :custom section only when prog-mode is turned on. I know I can do this with a hook and a lambda, but this is a lot messier and I like adding the doc strings in :custom.
 Also, is there a way to define which-key strings when using :bind?

 I was using a spreadsheet (Calc). Now I use literate calc. But yet I can&#x27;t find a way of organizing them so I can see easily if there is any incoherence between my notes and those of the personal chief (Excel, with every day annotated and the rest of my free hours).

                    <span>I&#x27;ve recently switched to Emacs from VSCode. I did try Spacemacs, DOOM and then decided to go with my own config for the vanilla Emacs following the great series by System Crafters on Youtube. I am now struggling with a couple of issues regarding developement with Vue JS using vue-mode or web-mode. Some features that I miss from VS Code are:
 - Auto completion for classes inside templates. (Both vue-mode and web-mode)
 - Syntax Highlighting and Auto completion for Vue specific properties such as v-mode, v-if,..etc.. since they are formatted as normal strings as they are inside Double Quotations (&quot;). (vue-mode)
 I would like to know if other people who switched from VS Code were able to replicate those features or find alternatives, or may be point me to some tutorials or custom configs that can help. 
 I am really determined to switching to Free and Open Source Software and would like to contribute if I can in any package or project that can help people make the switch.

                    <span>Hi,
 I am the maintainer of modular-config.el. I created this package out of my own necessity for dividing my emacs configuration file into multiple files. At this moment, I am feeling the need to make it more robust and optimized. 
 I am looking for suggestions/feedbacks/contributions for the same.
 I request the emacs guru&#x27;s and emacs users to help me make this package better.
 Any feature/optimization you need/expect from the package. Please let me know, so that we can make it better together.
 Feel free to open issues or pull requests on github. Thank you. :)

Run M-x ps-print-buffer-with-faces to send output to printer.
 Run C-u M-x ps-print-buffer-with-faces to send output to file (PS format).

It’s a pioneering work describing a new field - Software Engineering in Functional Programming, a discipline that didn’t exist before. There were different takes on that including books, articles, and talks, but my book is the first comprehensive source that a…</span>

 As a static site builder, Hakyll can be a good choice for publishing data that change infrequently. In this post I demonstrate how to use Hakyll to generate site content without corresponding source files.

                    <span>I&#x27;m wondering, for those who have experience with monad transformers and mtl, how much interest do you think one should have for polysemy? Should give it some time to understand how to use it, or should I just stick with traditional monad combinators?

                    <span>I was looking around for a hook or some way to have a PROPERTIES drawer created for a new heading. Say, I have:
 * Heading 1 :PROPERTIES:... * Heading 2 :PROPERTIES:... 
 Now, if I go and create a Heading 3, I would like a PROPERTIES drawer (ultimately, with a unique :ID: created within that) created automatically. Is there a hook I can leverage or some other strategy I can employ to accomplish this?

                    <span>I&#x27;m looking for a simple HTTP library like Express.js. I want to be able to:
  
Serve static files (like express.static)
 Create routers to keep code separated
  
I found Scala.js but I&#x27;d like to know if there are alternatives, as scalajs-io/express seems dead.

                    <span>Hello Everyone,
 I am very new to Doom Emacs, and have had good luck with getting everything to work with (csharp +lsp) in my config. So far so good, been a good experience.
 The auto format on save works great. There is just one thing, it formats braces as BSD/Allman style and my preference is K&amp;R style braces.
 ​
 Is there a simple setting change somewhere that I just haven&#x27;t found yet to set my braces preference?
 Edit:
 ------------------
 Thanks to to u/bbenne10 I found the answer to this question along with the help of this Stackoverflow post and the official documentation.
 The summary is that you place your customized settings in a file called &#x27;omnisharp.json&#x27; in your $HOME/.omnisharp directory, then relaunch emacs. I assume this also works for any editor that uses Omnisharp-Roslyn as well.
 On re-launch and saving a file, I know have K&amp;R/1TBS braces in my code!
 For anyone looking to do the same, my omnisharp.json file simply contains the following and nothing else.
 { &quot;FormattingOptions&quot;: { &quot;newLine&quot;: &quot;\n&quot;, &quot;useTabs&quot;: false, &quot;tabSize&quot;: 4, &quot;indentationSize&quot;: 4, &quot;NewLinesForBracesInTypes&quot;: false, &quot;NewLinesForBracesInMethods&quot;: false, &quot;NewLinesForBracesInProperties&quot;: false, &quot;NewLinesForBracesInAccessors&quot;: false, &quot;NewLinesForBracesInAnonymousMethods&quot;: false, &quot;NewLinesForBracesInControlBlocks&quot;: false, &quot;NewLinesForBracesInAnonymousTypes&quot;: false, &quot;NewLinesForBracesInObjectCollectionArrayInitializers&quot;: false, &quot;NewLinesForBracesInLambdaExpressionBody&quot;: false, &quot;NewLineForElse&quot;: false, &quot;NewLineForCatch&quot;: false, &quot;NewLineForFinally&quot;: false, &quot;NewLineForMembersInObjectInit&quot;: false, &quot;NewLineForMembersInAnonymousTypes&quot;: false, &quot;NewLineForClausesInQuery&quot;: false, } }

                    <span>Hello, I am working on some elisp helper functions to aid my daily workflow. One thing i always wonder is the iteration cycle and how to make it faster.
 For example, i often want to test the function for the line at cursor, i do something like this:
 ​
 (defun foo () (some-function (thing-at-point &#x27;line t))) 
 then i switch to the buffer with line i want to test on, but that &#x60;foo&#x60; function doesn&#x27;t print.
 so i will have to add an print wrapper and later remove
 ​
 (defun foo () (interactive) (print (some-function (thing-at-point &#x27;line t)))) 
 This get tedious quickly. I wonder what do others usually do. One way i can think of is test &#x60;some-function&#x60; directly, but then i will have to copy the string and it&#x27;s hard for more dynamic cases.
 Moreover, the common iteration cycle when writing software is not something discoverable or googleable until you see how other people do it, I wonder if there is good resource or pointers on this.

                    <span>This might just be an Org mode limitation, but is it possible to get a code block to ask you for an input? For example, if I run 
 #+begin_src python :results output :exports both :tangle hello.py :file hello.py myName&#x3D;input() #+end_src 
 Then I get the following error:
 Traceback (most recent call last): File &quot;&quot;, line 1, in  EOFError: EOF when reading a line 
 If I run the code in a regular .py file, it runs without issue and asks me for my input. I tried looking this up and didn&#x27;t find anything related to what I need, but I am not sure if that&#x27;s just because I didn&#x27;t know exactly what to search for. 
 Here is a pastebin link with my info. I am running Doom Emacs, though I don&#x27;t think that should matter. https://pastebin.com/qxfJKW2D

                    <span>When I&#x27;m messing around with some random Haskell code snippets, I&#x27;ll often have my code file loaded in vscode and stack ghci running in a terminal with that file loaded. Then my workflow is:
  
Save Haskell file
 :r in ghci
  
I was looking around for a way to have ghci automatically reload the file whenever it changes. I found the following post on stackoverflow:
 https://stackoverflow.com/q/7705717/268581
 however, none of those seemed ideal.
 I&#x27;ve been using the following script:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 !/bin/sh
 $(while inotifywait -e close_write $1; do pkill ghc; done) &amp;
 while inotifywait -e close_write $1 do sleep 2 stack ghci $1
 done &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 It works, but has a couple of issues:
  
It assumes that you only have one instance of ghc running.
 For some reason, you have to save the file twice for the reload to happen.
  
I usually run it at a terminal like this:
 exec ./inotifywait-stack-ghci.hs abc.hs 
 (I posted this script in an answer to the above stackoverflow post.)
 Is there a more popular or accepted approach for doing this? Thanks for any suggestions!

                    <span>haskell.social - After the whole Freenode debacle, I was motivated to set up an experimental web, Matrix, and Pleroma set of services to give the Haskell community an alternative to centralized Meetup, Slack/IRC/Discord, and Twitter, etc. 
 Matrix and Pleroma certainly have their downsides - IRC and Twitter are pretty hard to beat - but they have their upsides as well and I figured it’s a fun experiment at the least. I won’t be leaving IRC any time soon.
 Feel free to join me and/or contribute if you’re interested. I’m always up for hearing feedback as well.

                    <span>While it does seem like haskell introduces many useful concepts and even attained better tooling, it has remained to be very unpopular - so much so that many are arguing that it is not worth learning because it is dwindling down language of the past. They even try to actively ward off people from even getting close to it. Why do you think it has been the case? Is it because the entire CS department is engulfed by the Deep Learning hype, where everyone is running the half-baked random predictor on tensorflow or pytorch?

                    <span>I use org for (among many other things) storing recipes and tracking bakes of those recipes. I keep the ingredients in an org table using baker’s percents (where every ingredient is recorded as a percentage of the total flour), allowing me to easily scale a recipe up or down by changing only the desired total weight of the finished product. It works really well!
 Of course recipes also have an instructions section in the form of paragraphs of text. What I would love to do is combine the calculated cells from the table with this text. For example, the instructions might say, “add the 300g of softened butter to a bowl”, but if I scale the recipe, that 300g amount would change. I would want it to update either automatically when the table is recalculated, or manually by running some command. I’m sure this is possible for an elisp guru, but I’m wondering if it’s doable “out of the box” or with some additional package? Has anybody else done something similar?

                    <span>I configured company mode in my emacs and it working fine with showing up the completions but the completion menu is big and contains lots of unecessary details that are not required for my workflow.
 ​
 The company completion menu in my emacs configurations
 my company configuration is given below.
 (use-package company :hook ((prog-mode text-mode lisp-interaction-mode) . company-mode) :bind (:map company-active-map (&quot;&quot; . company-complete-common-or-cycle)) :config (setq company-backends &#x27;(company-capf company-yasnippet company-keywords company-files company-elisp company-ispell company-semantic)) (company-mode 1) :custom (company-format-margin-function #&#x27;company-vscode-dark-icons-margin) (company-idle-delay 0.1) (company-echo-delay 0.1)) 
 How can we remove the module path and other unwanted details from the completion menu.

                    <span>Hi,
 I have this issue: I installed chicken-scheme to ~/chicken-install and added it to my PATH at /etc/profile. But when running run-geiser I get the error: csi not found, why is it?
 Thanks!

                    <span>I could really use some help with this weird issue I am having: I am running emacs in WSL on Windows, with VcXsrv as an X server. It works great. I love it most of the time, but when I have a Fullscreen game running and I switch back to emacs from it, my input causes all sorts of trouble. 
 I think I have narrowed it down to emacs thinking that the meta key is being held down. 
 Thanks!

                    <span>I&#x27;m still new to Emacs. I&#x27;ve been getting issue after issue trying to get tramp and remote emacs-lsp to work correctly. Now I can get to the point where I get the error in the title. If I Ctrl-g then Tramp seems to restart or something and actually opens the file after another 10 seconds of &quot;Getting prompt&quot; messages flashing.
 What even is &#x60;vc-registered&#x60;, and why does it hang? I waited for over 5 minutes and it never completes.

                    <span>Hello everyone!
 I&#x27;m in the process of moving into and learning emacs (Doom emacs). After many tutorials, I was able to set it up, make some adjustments, and within my .doom.d I uncommented the LaTeX language.
 ​
 It seems to work!
 Yet, I do not know how to compile and I can&#x27;t find any info about it. It is all about org mode, yet I do not want to use that for now. I want straight up &quot;vanilla LaTeX&quot;. How can I output the PDF?
 Thanks in advance! I have been loving emacs so far.

 Core ideas:
 - Provide a declarative API for modeling optimization problems, take advantage of type-level programming &#x3D;&gt; type-safety
 - Manipulate and transform the optimization problem symbolically &#x3D;&gt; optimize &amp; reduce redundant computations
 - C code generation &#x3D;&gt; fast

                    <span>I have been trying to tweak org mode&#x27;s export settings for LaTeX, but I can&#x27;t for the life of me find exactly what I&#x27;m looking for online (or I don&#x27;t have the vocabulary to search properly).
 In short, assume the following heading structure to an org document, where I have #+latex_class set to article:
 * Heading 1 ** Heading 2 *** Heading 3 **** Heading 4 
 Currently, these are exported to .tex as:
 \section{Heading 1} \subsection{Heading 2} \subsubsection{Heading 3} \item Heading 4 
 But I would like them exported as:
 \part{Heading 1} \section{Heading 2} \subsection{Heading 3} \subsubsection{Heading 4} 
 I don&#x27;t want to use \part{} directly in the document because the file is quite long (thesis-length), and I would prefer to retain subtree folding at all levels of the document.
 Any guidance would be appreciated.
 ​
 Solution
 Thanks to scbagley for pointing me to org-latex-classes. Following that lead, I stumbled across an older post on this subreddit and cobbled together a short solution.
 Here&#x27;s an excerpt from my config.el:
 (use-package! org :defer true :init (with-eval-after-load &#x27;ox-latex (add-to-list &#x27;org-latex-classes &#x27;( &quot;thesis&quot; &quot;\\documentclass{article}&quot; (&quot;\\part{%s}&quot; . &quot;\\part*{%s}&quot;) (&quot;\\section{%s}&quot; . &quot;\\section*{%s}&quot;) (&quot;\\subsection{%s}&quot; . &quot;\\subsection*{%s}&quot;) (&quot;\\subsubsection{%s}&quot; . &quot;\\subsubsection*{%s}&quot;)))))) 
 In order to export all four heading levels as expected, I must have #+OPTIONS: H:4 set as well. Thanks to tecosaur for the clarification.
 I should have mentioned that I&#x27;m running a Doom Emacs config, so I will report for the squirrel lashing, per the rules.

                    <span>I find @Will&#x27;s idea of sharing zettels great - so here comes my  latest example, with a number of remarks. 


Remarks:
The 2013 Zettelkasten Exhibition in the Literaturmuseum der Moderne in Marbach/Germany was titled &quot;Zettelkästen. Maschinen der Phantasie&quot; (perhaps roughly &quot;Zettelkästen. Machines of Imagination&quot;). I&#x27;m fascinated by the question how a zettelkasten can support creative processes. My zettel shows one of the approaches I am experimenting with.
The basic idea is the following: I collect ideas triggered by the question &quot;How can inventive principles from the TRIZ method be used to make zettelkasten work more interesting, successful or effective?&quot; Background: TRIZ is the &quot;theory of inventive problem solving&quot;, and one of its key components is a list of 40 (or so) inventive principl…</span>

                    <span>I&#x27;m experimenting with w3m package and I quite like it so far, except for the slowness. When I open a link, it takes at least 4 seconds to show the page in Emacs while the w3m command on the terminal renders pages near instantly. 
 I tried doing emacs -Q and using but the result is the same. Most of the time is spent on Reading 
... phase, takes at least 3 seconds. Then it shows Rendering... and Fontifying... phases on the echo area. Rendering... takes ~1-2 seconds and Fontifying... is near instant. I guess the process communication should introduce a bit latency but ~3 seconds is just too much. 
 Anybody have any ideas how to speed things up or is this the way w3m package works?
 Just to note, I know about the eww package and I use it but w3m&#x27;s rendering is just better and I would like to be able to use it.
 I&#x27;m using the latest version of the package (20210615.103 from MELPA) and I tested it in both emacs 27.2 and 28.0.50.

                    <span>When running emacs in an xterm on MacOS, the two Cmd keys send the same code, and it&#x27;s mapped to Meta. The two option keys send different codes, and they are both mapped to &#x27;Mode_switch&#x27;, whatever that is. In emacs if I try to get help for whatever the option key is mapped to, it acts as though I didn&#x27;t press any key.
 Can anyone point me to some info about what I need to tweak to have these work the other way round? 
 So I want option to behave as Meta, and Cmd to be available for use as a modifier. 
 Note: when I run emacs without being in an xterm, it&#x27;s working the way I want (i.e., within iTerm or Mac terminal).

                    <span>Org mode&#x27;s manual appears to be published into a series of separate HTML files, ordered hierarchically, and nicely linked with options like &quot;Up,&quot; &quot;Next,&quot; etc...
 I can see from org&#x27;s source code that the manual is in fact one big .org file.
 How do I configure org&#x27;s publishing options to make my big .org file into many files, like org&#x27;s manual?
 EDIT 1: It seems that the manual is made with Texinfo (texi). Now my question is: how can I best go from .org -&gt; texi -&gt; the html format I see in the docs?
 EDIT 2: I found my answer. First, export from org to texi.
 Then, use makeinfo to build the html. For example: makeinfo --no-validate --force book.texi --html -o book
 The command above will produce a directory called book/ containing an index.html, with each heading a separate HTML file.
 I should be able to take it from here with org publishing configuration. Thanks all for the help.

                    <span>In my LaTeX projects, I usually have one file main.tex and sub-directories including other tex files which are ultimately included in then main.tex. The way AUCTeX handles this is by setting TeX-master to point to main. Instead of setting this variable locally in each file, I used to have a &quot;.dir-locals&quot; file in each sub-directory to set TeX-master.
 Since dir-local variables are inherited, I wanted to make it so that I can set TeX-master in the root directory once for all files. For example, having the following structure:
  - main.tex - sub1.tex - .dir-locals.el - sub/ |-- subsub1.tex |-- subsub2.tex |-- subsub |-- subsubsub1.tex |-- subsubsub2.tex 
 and then have in .dir-locals.el 
 lisp ((latex-mode . ((TeX-master relpath &quot;main&quot;)))) 
 Then in both main.tex and sub1.tex, TeX-master would main but in subsub*.tex, TeX-master would be ../main, and subsubsub*.tex TeX-master would be ../../main and so on.
 Having an eval statement would not work since I wouldn&#x27;t be able to get the path to the directory. The way I solved this is by advising hack-local-variables-filter to handle this particular value.
 What do you think of this solution? Comments on my lisp-fu are also welcome.
  (define-advice hack-local-variables-filter (:around (old-fn variables dir-name) replace-rel-path) (let ((new-variables (if dir-name (mapcar (lambda (x) (let ((val (cdr x))) (if (and (consp val) (eq (car val) &#x27;relpath)) (cons (car x) (file-relative-name (concat (file-name-as-directory dir-name) (cadr val)))) x))) variables) variables))) (funcall old-fn new-variables dir-name)))

                    <span>Hi,
 Total beginner here, I followed this tutorial to create a major mode for a scripting language that I need to use sometimes in my petroleum engineering work, its working great for me now, having different colors for different kinds of keywords makes editing and reading the file a lot easier, but when editing python scripts I have the ability to fold the classes or functions to easily navigate the code, and I have a list of all classes and functions using imenu-list, how can I add this feature to my custom made major mode? 
 Below is the code I assembled from the tutorial mentioned above:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; (defun read-lines (filePath) &quot;Return a list of lines of a file at filePath.&quot; (with-temp-buffer (insert-file-contents filePath) (split-string (buffer-string) &quot;\n&quot; t)))

                    <span>When I use C-SPC or C-x b to switch to another buffer, my Dired buffer has an exclamation mark in front of it. Here&#x27;s an image of it.
 I&#x27;m not sure why it appears, but I assume it is to show it (or the buffer) is modified? I think it appeared after I marked a file for deletion in the Dired buffer with d and then deleted it with x.
 Sadly, I was not able to find anything while searching around. Google&#x27;s search operators absolutely hate trying to search for a !. Even when doing stuff like intext:(&quot;! Dired&quot;) or allintext:(&quot;! Dired&quot;), the AND operator didn&#x27;t help much either. Not even the  + operator worked, which is supposed to force an exact match. I also tried to search for more generalized strings, because that&#x27;s what the search engine is built more towards nowadays, but even with a verbose &#x27;exclamation mark&#x27; did not help me much.
 Thus, I gave up and came here. I am rather new to Emacs, so if it is something obvious, I have either missed it or just plain don&#x27;t know about it. All help is appreciated :)

Unfortunately my job does not allow me to help by reproducing bugs and this kind of stuff. Anyhow I am very glad to donate periodically. Where would you suggest me to donate in order to help? Directly Org? Or FSF? Both?

                    <span>Hi all, wanted to raise a discussion about a thought I had. 
 As a moderately experienced Emacs user (8 years), I&#x27;ve invested a LOT of time into learning and configuring Emacs (including email, RSS, browsing, calculator, etc). I can say that it does what I want and how I want it. I won&#x27;t go into the fact that it&#x27;s a never ending process because tastes and interests (+ jobs) change. 
 I would reckon that we all stick to Emacs, at least in some small part due to the sunk cost fallcy. Basically it means a price already paid in the past on our actions keep influencing our decisions in the future even though it shouldn&#x27;t. From the link: 
  
People demonstrate &quot;a greater tendency to continue an endeavor once an investment in money, effort, or time has been made.&quot;
  
The question of whether the time invested in Emacs is worth the productivity gained is discussed here all the time. My view is to justify it by a combination of the following: believing in FOSS, (related to that) text centricity, and it could be viewed as a mental hobby, a creative outlet. 
 However I might admit that I exhibit some sunk cost fallacy thinking. It becomes clear when I realize that I WON&#x27;T recommend Emacs to new users - unless they are going to invest large amounts of time learning it, like I did. 
 What are your thoughts on this? would you admit that there&#x27;s some irrational thinking in choosing Emacs over some other tools, e.g. the longer you use it the more you&#x27;re convinced it&#x27;s the best even though new tools are keep being developed.

                    <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;ve loved Haskell for a long time but have always had trouble getting a full workflow set up. I&#x27;m primarily a c#/.net developer, so i&#x27;m used to big chunky IDEs like Visual Studio where I press a big button to install, the install &quot;just works&quot; without setting up any special environments or manually installing any special tools, I write code, intellisense tells me what&#x27;s broken, and I press a big button to run.
 What is the closest thing to this experience for haskell?
 Looking forward to your suggestions so I can get more haskell into my caveman brain.
 Thanks, doodeoo

                    <span>With Haskell being a compiled language, would it be possible to build a framework like WordPress with the ability of adding plugins, themes etc? The plugin system of WordPress is powered by PHP&#x27;s ability to load other PHP code at runtime as an interpreted language. The same thing goes with themes.
 Would it be possible to build a similar framework/system using Haskell?

                    <span>Good day
 I&#x27;m very new to Haskell and trying to write a simple game for practice. I&#x27;m trying to figure out an alternative approach with an element of the game, and I was looking for suggestions. Ideally, your suggestion should not be too advanced for a newbie and relatively easy to grok. :)
 The element of the game in question I am seeking help with is something I call Snapshot, which essentially just captures the number of every resource in the game at a certain point in time.
 Existing code:
 data Resource &#x3D; Wood | Wheat | Person | Stone | Gold | Weapons deriving (Show, Ord, Eq) data Snapshot &#x3D; Snapshot { resources :: [(Int, Resource)], buildings :: [(Int, Building)] } 
 As it is, each part of the program that creates or reads a Snapshot validates which resources are contained in the lis…</span>

                    <span>Hello, I&#x27;m using the external STG interpreter to observe the runtime behaviour of Haskell programs.
 Lately I&#x27;ve added an initial call-graph construction feature that I plan to refine further.
 https://twitter.com/csaba_hruska/status/1417486380536582151
 Is there anyone who has dynamic analysis related research ambitions and wants to study Haskell program runtime behaviour in detail?
 If so then it would be great to talk. 
 Cheers,
 Csaba

                    <span>Hi,
 If you type zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ID in your browser, Zotero opens the pdf of the item specified with ID.
 I want to be able to click on this link in my org file and have it opened. However, when I insert [[http://zotero://open-pdf/library/items/][A pdf]] in the org file, it doesn&#x27;t work, and the address in the browser&#x27;s address bar doesn&#x27;t contain the colon after &quot;zotero&quot; and before &quot;//&quot; and the link is changed to zotero//open-pdf/library/items/ID which doesn&#x27;t open Zotero and therefore the pdf.
 I also tried removing the HTTP:// and using [[zotero://open-pdf/library/items/][A pdf]] but emacs asks to create a heading and doesn&#x27;t open the browser at all.
 I would appreciate it if you could tell me how should I insert this type of link in my org file so it doesn&#x27;t change it when opens the browser.
 Thanks!

 I tried adding this line in the config file:
 (setq org-agenda-start-with-follow-mode t)
 I also tried M-x follow-mode in the Agenda buffer.
 But both didn&#x27;t work.
 How should I configure it?

 I am not a programmer and know nothing about lisp. I just copy those configurations here and there from the internet.

                    <span>I am a long-time coder learning scala. I am currently working through Programming Scala for Scala3.
 I don&#x27;t understand why pattern matching is a big deal. I get that it&#x27;s like a switch statement but more powerful because you can match types. 
 Where exactly is pattern matching applicable? What problems does it solve? Why is it such an integral part of the language? 
 Thanks for your help.

                    <span>dotty-cps-async 9.0 https://github.com/rssh/dotty-cps-async is published on maven central (actually a few days ago, but during the week it was hard to manage time to write announce),
 What was changed since 1-st public release in the version, which is available for scala3 final:
 Main points behind bug fixing:
  
Implemented async variants for most high-order functions from scala standard library; Now, if you use await inside for loop or fold -- usually, it just works.
 The simplified setting of shifted version of high-order functions: now developer can declare one in place, instead of creating an extra typeclass.
 
Implemented custom call-chain builders: I.e., the following expression
  
 for( url  0) yield await(fetch(url))  will traverse through urls only once because we can merge filter and map in
 WithFilter call-chain builder.
  
Implemented support of automatic coloring:
  
I.e., we can write something like:
  async { val auth &#x3D; db.retrieveAuth(url) val data &#x3D; fetchData(auth,URL) if (isInteresting(data)) then db.increaseScoring(url) } 
 And the compiler will insert needed awaits automatically.
 This works not only for plain Futures but also for effect monads, such as cats-effects IO, Monix, and ZIO. (see article about this: https://github.com/rssh/notes/blob/master/2021_06_27_automatic-coloring-for-effects.md )
  
ScalaJS:
  
Implemented support for non-monadic objects in awaited statements (i.e., &#x60;js. Promise&#x60;) - now it is possible to use await(js.Promise) inside an async block.
 Implemented JSFuture, which looks like &#x27;promise&#x27; from the js side, but as typed monad on scala side.
 
  
Also, during the year passed from the 0.1 version, we tested it in few internal projects.

                    <span>Hello, I keep all my notes in a version controlled fork of foam: https://foambubble.github.io/foam/
I have a lot of ebooks on my computer in .epub, .mobi, and .pdf formats. I read most of these on a kindle and I sync books to my kindle using calibre (https://calibre-ebook.com/). I highlight a lot of things and take a lot of notes while reading on the kindle.
Does anyone have a workflow for syncing highlights and notes taken on the kindle to markdown files?
Thank you</span>

                    <span>Sometimes I download Emacs on public computers, and I would rather not load certain parts of my config (such Newsticker feeds). How does one set up conditional loading (home vs public computers) and a fetch mechanism to retrieve the sensitive parts?

                    <span>Hello, I just migrated from org-roam v1 to v2 following the steps listed in https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam/wiki/Hitchhiker&#x27;s-Rough-Guide-to-Org-roam-V2#migration-instructions . I always used deft (as suggested in the org-roam manual) to search the notes, but now deft summary looks like this: https://imgur.com/a/HGbCUSw which is not very useful: before, I could nicely read the title of the note in bold, now it&#x27;s all the same (:PROPERTIES:, :ID: etc..).
 I tried various combinations of deft-strip-title-regex and deft-strip-summary-regex trying to remove the unwanted parts, but without success.
 Anyone had the same problem and has a solution for this? Or maybe an alternative for full text searching and narrowing the notes like deft does?
 Thanks in advance

                    <span>This is a tip a lot of you are sure to know about, but it just made my day. pdf-tools has a dark mode called &quot;midnight mode&quot;.
 It can be activated with C-c C-r m – or M-x pdf-view-midnight-minor-mode if you can&#x27;t remember the keybinding.
 What&#x27;s more, there is even an associated variable, pdf-view-midnight-colors, which lets you set the foreground and background color of the render. In init.el I just put
 (setq pdf-view-midnight-colors &#x27;(&quot;#f8f8f2&quot; . &quot;#282a36&quot;)) 
 and now PDF looks at home with Dracula my theme of choice.
 Here&#x27;s what it looks like: https://i.imgur.com/Lqhxiim.png

                    <span>I&#x27;ve made my own Emacs theme where I only use the 16 standard and bright Terminal colors. I have my colors defined like this:
  (defvar theme-colors-alist &#x27;((&quot;black&quot; . &quot;black&quot;) (&quot;red&quot; . &quot;red&quot;) (&quot;green&quot; . &quot;green&quot;) (&quot;yellow&quot; . &quot;yellow&quot;) (&quot;blue&quot; . &quot;blue&quot;) (&quot;magenta&quot; . &quot;magenta&quot;) (&quot;cyan&quot; . &quot;cyan&quot;) (&quot;white&quot; . &quot;white&quot;) (&quot;brightblack&quot; . &quot;brightblack&quot;) (&quot;brightred&quot; . &quot;brightred&quot;) (&quot;brightgreen&quot; . &quot;brightgreen&quot;) (&quot;brightyellow&quot; . &quot;brightyellow&quot;) (&quot;brightblue&quot; . &quot;brightblue&quot;) (&quot;brightmagenta&quot; . &quot;brightmagenta&quot;) (&quot;brightcyan&quot; . &quot;brightcyan&quot;) (&quot;brightwhite&quot; . &quot;brightwhite&quot;) ) &quot;terminal colors.&quot;) 
 However, GUI emacs seems to only have the standard colors defined, not the bright colors. There is no &quot;brightred&quot;. I did some research and found out that the GUI gets its colors from rbg.txt which is an X11 specific file, and that it does not define those colors.
 So I&#x27;m wondering how I can handle this. Maybe there is a way to change the value of these mappings if emacs is running in GUI mode so I can map the bright colors to hex values or other colors?

 Hello Guys, I recently switched from ivy/counsel to vertigo/consult/embark but the issue I&#x27;m facing is that minibuffer completion. As you can see instead of completing the define-key, it says to click on the function. Can we customize this to complete functions/variables as we have in ivy

                    <span>Is there a way to show imenu contents in its own buffer? I would love to have a &quot;document map&quot; visible at all times.
 My current workaround is to use M-x occur and search for keywords such as &quot;class&quot; and &quot;function&quot;, but I can&#x27;t help wondering if there&#x27;s a better way.

                    <span>I&#x27;m getting to grips with the daunting but excellent bookmark+ extension. Tag based bookmark navigation lists are superb.
 The only issue I have is that I&#x27;m not seeing any backup bookmark files despite setting the recommended values from the docs at the link above.
 ​
 (use-package bookmark+ :demand :custom (bookmark-version-control t) (bookmark-save-flag 1) (delete-old-versions t) :after bookmark) 
 I do use no-littering that doesn&#x27;t appear to be hiding anything. ~/.emacs.d/var/bmkp/current-bookmark.el contains my bookmarks. Thats the only file there.
 ​
 So, the Q is : is auto backup working for you with bookmark+? Emacs 28.0.50.
 ​
 Or, have I missed something very obvious?

                    <span>I know there are a lot of solutions which can essentially create persistent (i.e. continues after Emacs close) workgroups, but they require a lot of manual tweaking.
 In particular, I feel like a solution to have persistent eyebrowse workgroups should be in place by now but, as far as I know, hasn&#x27;t. Does anyone have a solution of their own they are willing to share?

                    <span>I am working on emacs-27.2 of Windows 10 Build 19034.
 When Strike M-x shell, it invokes CMD, since foreach does not work
 C:\&gt;foreach foreach &#x27;foreach&#x27; is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file. 
 You have to activate powershell by explicitly call PowerShell as:
 C:\&gt;powershell powershell Windows PowerShell Copyright (C) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved. Try the new cross-platform PowerShell https://aka.ms/pscore6 PS C:\&gt; foreach foreach 
 How could set PowerShell as the default shell?

                    <span>I&#x27;m trying to get org capture to create a headline based on the name of the current project I&#x27;m working on. That way I can quickly capture a todo for that project, and then later on I can visit my projects.org file and each project will have it&#x27;s own heading, i.e.:
 * ~/path/to/project_1 ** Some todos * ~/path/to/project_2 ** Some todos 
 This is what I have:
 (defun my-org-capture () (interactive) (setq my-project-name (project-root (project-current))) (call-interactively #&#x27;org-capture)) (setq org-capture-templates &#x27;((&quot;p&quot; &quot;Project TODO&quot; entry (file+headline &quot;~/path/to/projects.org&quot; my-project-name) &quot;* TODO %? %^g\n%a&quot;) )) 
 I would expect this code to get the project root path, store it in my-project-name, and insert it as the headline in the capture template. Instead I get the error Wrong type argument: stringp, my-project-name.
 I&#x27;m aware I can manually do this by manually creating a headline for each project and refiling the captures correspondingly, but if possible I&#x27;d like to &quot;automate&quot; that away.

                    <span>OneLook is a thesaurus which uses the Datamuse API to search for synonyms for vague phrases (as opposed to words). 
 This has clearly helped me in times when I vaguely know what I&#x27;m trying to say but can&#x27;t quite put my finger on a word which approximates it. In these cases, PowerThesaurus is not useful.

                    <span>Hello everyone, Hope you all having a good time. 
 I have a simple function : 
 func :: IO String func &#x3D; let passed &#x3D; -- some func that return IO Bool in let result &#x3D; (\x -&gt; if x then &quot;passed&quot; else &quot;failed&quot;)  passed in result 
 &#x60; So, how can I bind the return value of func to some variable say, var :: IO String?
 Or this can&#x27;t be done or should not to be done? Writing var &#x3D; func won&#x27;t work. 
 I am a beginner in Haskell and FP overall so sorry if it sounds stupid. And another thing, why can&#x27;t I write something like &quot;let passed &#x3D; IO True&quot;? 
 A better qn would be how to put Bool inside IO context?

                    <span>Hello everyone :) In an attempt to level up my Haskell skills I&#x27;ve been trying to do Leetcode problems starting on the &#x27;easy&#x27; difficulty. This was the third problem I ran into and it wasn&#x27;t obvious to me how to solve it. What is the simplest way you can solve this problem in Haskell? I honestly found it a bit discouraging to have such difficulty with a problem that I could solve easily in other languages.
 Here&#x27;s the problem:
 Given a string s containing just the characters &#x27;(&#x27;, &#x27;)&#x27;, &#x27;{&#x27;, &#x27;}&#x27;, &#x27;[&#x27; and &#x27;]&#x27;, determine if the input string is valid. An input string is valid if: Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets. Open brackets must be closed in the correct order. Example 1: Input: s &#x3D; &quot;()&quot; Output: true Example 2: Input: s &#x3D; &quot;()[]{}&quot; Output: true Example 3: Input: s &#x3D; &quot;(]&quot; Output: false Example 4: Input: s &#x3D; &quot;([)]&quot; Output: false

                    <span>I have (not too many) notes in the same directory of which I tag various headings (e.g. * Some Heading :person1:something-else:whatever). I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s happening, but when I search for a given tag using org-tags-view some tags don&#x27;t show up in the results. I know they&#x27;re there because a simple grep shows them.
 Am I missing something? Do I need to re-index my tags or something like that?

                    <span>I am extremely new to purescript and I am getting quite frustrated trying to find answers to simple questions online. I was hired to managed an existing codebase in purescript so I already have tons of existing code I need to work around. I have a newtype called ContentKey that derives from String. I then have a FFI returning a string. How if possible do I convert that string from a string to a ContentKey?
 Thanks in advance.

                    <span>One thing I did miss from Java is the for(int i&#x3D;0; i (range), when used in simple &quot;for-comprehension&quot; with .foreach logic, gets treated with some macro magic :
 import scalqa.{*, given} val a &#x3D; new Array[Int](1000) for(i &gt; a.length) a(i) &#x3D; i 
 and gets compiled into direct JVM for-loop:
 int[] a &#x3D; (int[])(new int[1000]); int i &#x3D; 0; for(int e &#x3D; a.length; i  { for(i &quot;,()&#x3D;&gt; { for(i &gt; a.length ) a(i)&#x3D;i; a.length }), ) // Output Final Result.

                    <span>I have 2 projects, project A and project B. Project A is getting published in an artifactory. Project B is an extension of project A, using project A and its dependency as a dependency. I am able to import project A as a dependency but not it&#x27;s dependencies. Any suggestions on how this could be achieved? Sorry I am still learning sbt.

                    <span>Hi folks, I am quite smitten with some of the features in auratikum.  Being able to search for and link notes to notes, or references to notes, or notes to references without having to &quot;manually&quot; link the items in markdown (for example).  Also it nicely takes care of the storage of notes and references in projects.   Any other similar self-hosted / open source software available?   And I forgot - mathjax (or similar) is essential.</span>

 but now every time I press enter in any context as in just adding a new line out side of a regularly indented context it inserts a tab
 example:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 int main () {
 } | &lt;-- say this is my cursor, if I press enter right here
 | &lt;-- my cursor ends up here

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been have this issue ever since I switched to emacs28 with native comp. If I try to open a file directly in the terminal version of emacs (e.g. emacs -nw filename), emacs won&#x27;t open the file -- instead I get an error message saying: Symbol’s value as variable is void: \213, and a blank buffer.
 As far as I can tell, emacs works normally after that, and I can open the file with C-x C-f but it&#x27;s a bit of an annoyance. The --debug-init option gives no additional output. 
 This only happens with the -nw option. The gui works normally. 
 Anybody know what&#x27;s going on here?
 PS: I&#x27;m on MacOS and using the emacs-plus distribution from Homebrew.
 EDIT: After some investigation it turns out the following code inside my init.el file was the issue: 
 (defvar startup/file-name-handler-alist file-name-handler-alist) (setq file-name-handler-alist nil) (defun startup/revert-file-name-handler-alist () (setq file-name-handler-alist startup/file-name-handler-alist)) (add-hook &#x27;emacs-startup-hook &#x27;startup/revert-file-name-handler-alist) 
 Anybody know why this would cause the error on emacs28?

                    <span>This is a question motivated by my desire to learn emacs and make a silly thing, not to build a super useful tool.
 I would like to create a minor mode so that when I&#x27;m editing text or org files, every instance of the word &quot;clock&quot; will be replaced by &quot;HH:MM&quot; which would represent the current time and would be updated every minute to stay accurate. 
 Is there a way to either have the buffer pull clock times every minute or for some sort of clock to push updates to a buffer every minute to trigger rerendering? 
 I&#x27;m not too sure on what to look for in the emacs docs to find what I need so any guidance would be much appreciated.

                    <span>I&#x27;m moving my CV to org mode, exported to latex. I use org headlines as headings, and then plain lists and text for the body. I had previously kept the whole thing in latex, and have a format which I&#x27;m really happy with. I&#x27;m turning that into a custom class, which I will use in the export.
 Some of the headings have dates attached to them. The class file I&#x27;ve made redefines the the LaTeX section command to have two arguments: \\section{}{
}.
 The most obvious way I can see to store these associated dates in org mode is in a property, like :DATE: 2018. 
 Is there a way that I can inject these property&#x27;s values into the section strings in the export? The only similar functionality I have found so far is the strings in the third argument of org-latex-classes, but that only interpolates the heading title, and doesn&#x27;t provide any way of getting further information into the string.
 If this is just not possible at the moment, would anybody else be interested in it if I were to try to implement it?

 I have a problem regarding EXWM. When I pop up an ansi-term buffer and run a command that updates the contents of it like htop, the caret starts jumping around and the focus of the frame moves along with it which is pretty annoying. Have you come across this issue? Could you share a workaround with me? Thanks in advance!

                    <span>Recently I was switched on to fancy-dabbrev from the post: Package praise: Prodigy and fancy-dabbrev 
 Having completions preview in a way that can be quickly accepted without blocking input is great (as I&#x27;m now used to in fish).
 However fairly quickly I ran into some annoyances/functionality that wasn&#x27;t working as I needed.
 I&#x27;ve since submitted some PR&#x27;s which Joel Rosdahl has been kind enough to review &amp; apply.
  
Only complete when a preview is visible (fall-back to tab action) - so tab doesn&#x27;t complete when I don&#x27;t expect it to.
 Configurable tab action (command to fall back to when completion isn&#x27;t used).
 The message buffer is no longer flooded with noisy dabbrev progress reports.
 Fix for exiting fancy-dabbrev-mode leaving preview visible.
  
Highly recommend giving this package a look.
 My configuration:
 (use-package fancy-dabbrev :commands (fancy-dabbrev-mode) :config (setq fancy-dabbrev-preview-delay 0.1) (setq fancy-dabbrev-preview-context &#x27;before-non-word) (setq fancy-dabbrev-expansion-on-preview-only t) (setq fancy-dabbrev-indent-command &#x27;tab-to-tab-stop) (define-key evil-insert-state-map (kbd &quot;&quot;) &#x27;fancy-dabbrev-expand-or-indent)) 
 Since I find these kinds of packages a little intrusive (with pre/post commands that run on each key-stroke), I only enable this in evil-insert mode.
 ;; Only while in insert mode. (with-eval-after-load &#x27;evil (add-hook &#x27;evil-insert-state-entry-hook (lambda () (fancy-dabbrev-mode 1))) (add-hook &#x27;evil-insert-state-exit-hook (lambda () (fancy-dabbrev-mode 0))))

                    <span>I found a good, stack based setup to write Haskell applications and manage their dependencies. But I would like to use the language also for quick, exploratory work and small scripts. For that it seems to be unnecessary complicated to create a .cabal and a stack.yaml file. Instead I would like to maintain a global set of packages that are just available when I open ghci in my terminal.
 Both cabal and stack seem to be able to install Haskell packages globally. I&#x27;m a bit lost, though, which setup is more convenient and where the pitfalls are. I was hoping some more experienced Linux users could share their experiences (I&#x27;m on Manjaro and Ubuntu).

                    <span>There&#x27;s Wolfram, MatLab, Python, R -- and now Julia roaring to the fore. What about Haskell for numerical analysis, as a computer algebra system? There seem to be many sundry things on Hackage, Wiki, etc. for math, but scant documentation -- unless you want to read skeleton-ish data type source and puzzle out what&#x27;s going on, what might be going on once fleshed out.
 Just this beginner&#x27;s delvings indicate to me that Haskell would make as good a CAS as any other language. Not that I&#x27;m qualified to make a final decision. While doing math with other leading languages has many thick textbooks, I only know of 2-1/2 books (one is SML-based), all dealing (quite well) with discrete math. Am I missing something? Did I arrive at the conversation late? Why doesn&#x27;t Haskell have a nice, big chunk of CAS and numerical analysis?

                    <span>I haven&#x27;t really been able to find anything that works regarding this.
 Say I have two files, file1.org and file2.org. In file1.org I have the src that is going to tangle to result1.el, in file2.org there is something specific that is useful in that file but also in file1.org.
 It&#x27;d be nice to be able to include it in a similar fashion of how you can do it with noweb yes in the same file, rather than having to duplicate the code.
 Hopefully my explanation is good enough, but if not, please give me a heads up and I&#x27;ll try to explain better!

 ​
 I use a capture template to add TODOs to entries under a date tree, to help me keep track of them. However, I don&#x27;t need the date tree to add the /day/ that the TODO was added, I just need the year and the month - is there a way to limit the date tree to just years and months?

                    <span>* DONE Item1 * TODO Item2 * Table | Title | Status | | [[Item1]] | DONE | | [[Item2]] | TODO | 
 I have a list of tasks and I want to create a table with so that the &#x60;Status&#x60; column is automatically updated with the TODO state of the item. Can I use an ELisp formula for this? 
 I&#x27;m new to Emacs and OrgMode and have little experience writing Lisp.

                    <span>So. I can&#x27;t say compile-time reflection and code generation is bad. But. When porting existing code to Scala3, I found out compile-time reflection has some issues hampering my productivity.
 - Compile-time reflection API is much more complex than runtime reflection API
 - new reflection API is badly documented and behaves weirdly in corner cases
 - Compile-time reflection is impossible to debug, logging is all you have.
 - Compile-time reflection is pain to test, incremental compilation does not track macros so I have to rebuild every time.
 Summarizing, runtime reflection is huge boost in productivity for complex cases. Writing some tests is much easier (faster, simpler code, less maintenance) than getting compile-time reflection to work.
 Soooo.... Any signs?

                    <span>In Property Based Testing (PBT) the programmer specifies desirable properties or invariants for the code under test, and uses a test framework to generate random inputs to find counter-examples.
For example, “a reversed list has the same size as the original list” which can be written as:
fun l -&gt; List.length (List.reverse l) &#x3D; List.length l

Imagine this test fails for the list [42; 9079086709; -148; 9; -9876543210].
Does this counter-example fail the test because there are 5 elements? Or because there are negative numbers? Or maybe due to the big numbers?
Many reasons are possible.
To help narrow down the cause of test failures, most PBT libraries provide a feature called shrinking.
The idea is that once a test fails for a given input, the test engine will try less complex inputs, to fin…</span>

Jared Gorski wrote a response to my article “Backlinks are bad links”. Since it’s a short and concise response, a re-response is warranted. He summarised my point fairly and sufficiently, so I don’t need to repeat myself here. If you are not familiar, please read the article linked above. I’ll reply to Jared’s post point by point.

                    <span>Hi, I&#x27;ve been using org-mode for a while now and am really enjoying it. However, I&#x27;m running into an issue with calctex. If I open up calctex via M-x calc, then inputting anything freezes emacs. However, if I run the embedded-calc, then it works perfectly fine. 
 I&#x27;m using emacs-mac on an m1 MacBook, but the same issue occurs with emacs-28. I&#x27;m using BasicTex installed via home-brew as my tex distribution, and all required packages are installed via tlmgr. 
 Note that I&#x27;ve already put tecosaur&#x27;s fix for dvichop in my config: https://tecosaur.github.io/emacs-config/config.html#calc-calctex 
 Is there anything else I&#x27;m missing?

                    <span>The trick of switching CAPS to CONTROL is classic, and highly recommended for emacs. But, on a full size keyboard, this leaves the right pinky stretching down to the far corner still. Now, the symmetrical fix would be the ENTER key, but remapping that seems problematic. What are some recommendations for getting the right hand to experience some of the same savings that the left hand does with the CTRL rebinding?

Of course, there is the excellent documentation, but this is a little bit overwhelming to me. Are there some sources with easy tutorials or introductions of Org-Roam Version 2?

                    <span>Recently I have built my emacs from source with xwidget support.I figured out how to call function in javascript from emacs-lisp.You can do this with xwidget-webkit-execute-script function like this:
  (xwidget-webkit-execute-script (with-current-buffer &quot;*xwidget webkit: *&quot; (xwidget-at 1)) &quot;myFunction()&quot; ;; name of my javascript function ;; additional callback here if I want to get the return value or do something else ) 
 How can I do it the other way around? I mean, trigger some emacs-lisp function after e.g.: button click in my javascript widget?

 ((nil . ((projectile-project-compilation-dir . &quot;misc&quot;))))
 But the value is still nil:
 projectile-project-compilation-dir is a variable defined in projectile.el Value nil 
 I can confirm &#x60;dir-local-variables-alist&#x60; is properly set:

                    <span>I have some websites that are served from user directories, so a domain like www.domain.com will have the root in the server configuration as:
 /home/joebloggs/websites/www.domain.com/www/html.
 The idea is to create a table of the kind
 | user | website | |-----------+---------------------| | joebloggs | www.domain.com | | janesmith | www.fancydomain.net | 
 etc.
 If I replicate the root directory in two columns then in one of them the search and replace should delete the /home/ and /websites/www.domain.com/www/html in ther user column and in the website column the search and replace would delete /home/joebloggs/websites/ and /www/html.
 I&#x27;m sure there are fancier methods but I would prefer it to be a sequence of regular search and replace using the vi syntax, ie :s/xxx/yyy/g in the minibuffer but use regexes to match the relevant parts.

                    <span>Hi there,
 I want to use a proprietary C++ library from Haskell using FFI under Linux (in case it matters, I’m running GHC 8.0.2 on Ubuntu 18.04.5 LTS). 
 Taking inspiration in the “sin” example in chapter 17 of the Real World Haskell, I started with use a &quot;C-only&quot; small example with 3 small files (&quot;.c&quot;, &quot;.h&quot; and &quot;.hs&quot;), and that worked fine.
 File “code2.h” looks like so:
 double plus_one(double x); 
 File “code2.c” looks like so:
 #include &quot;code2.h&quot; double plus_one(double x) { return x + 1.0; } 
 File “ffi2.hs” looks like so:
 {-# LANGUAGE ForeignFunctionInterface #-} import Foreign import Foreign.C.Types foreign import ccall &quot;code2.h plus_one&quot; c_plus_one :: CDouble -&gt; CDouble ffi_plus_one :: Double -&gt; Double ffi_plus_one x &#x3D; realToFrac (c_plus_one (realToFrac x)) main &#x3D; mapM_ (print . f…</span>

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been using LogicT lately and discovered that msplit causes some pretty bad slow downs. Edward Kmett pointed out to me that the Reflection without Remorse paper covers this in depth as well as provides a solution. In the paper, sequences, such as sequences of binds are reified into type aligned sequences. This makes it cheap to inspect them without reassociating the binds. Thus getting rid of the quadratic slowdown incurred by inspecting the sequence. There is a downside in that the constant factors are worse.
 I looked around a bit on hackage to see if anyone had packaged up the LogicT version from the paper. I found one package based on the paper that applied the techniques to the free monad. Also, one of the paper authors uploaded two packages related to the paper for working with t…</span>

                    <span>Hey all, I want to have a todo block in org-agenda with the most immediate deadline items first, followed by items without deadlines, like
 proj1: TODO 2021-08-18 foo proj2: TODO 2021-08-19 bar proj3: TODO foobar proj4: TODO baz 
 However, setting (org-agenda-sorting-strategy &#x27;(deadline-up)) puts items without deadlines first, like:
 proj3: TODO foobar proj4: TODO baz proj1: TODO 2021-08-18 foo proj2: TODO 2021-08-19 bar 
 And of course, setting &#x27;deadline-down puts later deadlines first, then closer deadlines, then items without deadlines, which isn&#x27;t what I want either.
 How would I go about ordering a todo block in the desired order of closer deadlines-&gt;further deadline-&gt;entries without deadlines. It seems like org should have a built in way to do it, but will I have to write something custom to get it working as expected?

                    <span>While messing around with a mundane Bash utility, I had a realization - the way I write Bash is primitive beyond Python&#x27;s level of interactivity - where I can hit C-c C-c to reload the buffer&#x27;s definitions in the prompt and otherwise execute newly-defined code piecemeal - let alone Lisp(s).
 This wasn&#x27;t noteworthy earlier because &quot;shell isn&#x27;t a serious language&quot; and nothing I write is more than ~100 lines I think, yet I, in sum, probably have written more of it than anything. (because the terminal is the terminal and it gets things done, day after day) Easing the transition from (increasingly lengthy and arcane) a la carte invocations to standalone scripts would be among the more productive uses of time for extending Emacs.
 I use vterm as my primary terminal, and generally re-execute the whole script as a unit, as if it were in a edit-compile-debug cycle. How can I make the setup more SLIME-like?

                    <span>I&#x27;m struggling to use emacs for React development, and I just can&#x27;t get Graphql syntax highlighting and indentation to work in web-mode.
 I know there&#x27;s graphql-mode, but it&#x27;s a major mode and it replaces the web-mode. So if I activate it, graphql highlighting works, but jsx and the rest stop working.
 Can someone please help me to figure out how to make both jsx and graphql syntax/indentation work in emacs? Maybe share your config?

                    <span>I&#x27;ve googled and have not found any package that does this, but I figured I&#x27;d ask here as well in case I&#x27;ve missed something. Is it possible to convert org-mode files to R markdown -- I&#x27;m interested specifically in using R&#x27;s bookdown feature. Unfortunately there&#x27;s no org-mode equivalent to bookdown, so I&#x27;ve decided to just convert all my org-mode files to Rmd and use their tools (I know you can probably achieve something similar with the org-html exporter, but not without a lot of work). 
 Has anybody been able to do this?

                    <span>I have written another emacs package during a rainy sunday afternoon. dired-gitignore.el is a minor mode for dired to hide and show items in your dired buffer, that are ignored by git due to an entry in .gitignore
 As of now the easiest way of installing it is to use straight.el as described in the README of the repo.
 After some testing period I will submit it also to MELPA.
 Have fun, feedback welcome.

                    <span>Hello fellow &#x27;macers,
 after having tested both MPDel and EMMS, I came to like the first more. One thing bumps me out, though. It has some very long key prefix (C-x Z), and I cannot change it.
 Whenever I try to set it - either in use-package, or outside of use-package, using (setq mpdel-prefix-key (kbd &quot;s-m&quot;)) - it comes up with an error saying: package.el mpdel failed to define keymap mpdel-prefix-key. And this is strange because in the beginning of mpdel.el (using M-. on the mpdel package), one of the first things defined is (defcustom mpdel-prefix-key ...).
 Is anyone else here using mpdel and has encountered similar issues? 
 Otherwise, any tips/suggestions welcome.
 Thanks a bunch, have a good day!

                    <span>Is it possible to customize Emacs to open files/windows/tabs from the previous session before it was killed? Since most of the time, I am working on one project at a time, I find it helpful if my windows opened up when I started Emacs. IIRC, other editors/IDEs do this by default. My Google-fu doesn&#x27;t lead to any helpful results. Any help will be appreciated. 
 Thanks in advance!

                    <span>The set of functions that comes with Emacs sucks. Variable / function names don&#x27;t start with the thing it operates on (mark-, buffer- etc..) and functions are named haphazardly, so it&#x27;s almost impossible to discover functions while programming without having to refer to the guide (which also sucks)....
 So I&#x27;d like to ask if there were any efforts to wrap the standard library and provide a sensible api ?

                    <span>One thing that&#x27;s kept Emacs in Evil Mode, and Vim before it, from being a fully functioning text editor for me was that I couldn&#x27;t use it extensively for Korean writing projects due to the need to shift manually to Korean input when entering insert mode.
 (Yes I did the tutorial and gave the default Emacs keybinds a try for a while. I&#x27;m glad I know them but they weren&#x27;t for me.)
 Recently I redefined the evil-insert function to add toggle-korean-input-method to the end, and this achieved what should be the default behavior for Vim/Evil Mode imo, switching the language input method to what it was before leaving input mode last time.
 I won&#x27;t reproduce the whole redefined function since all I did was repeat the whole function in my init.el while adding one line after (evil-insert-state 1), like this:
 (evil-insert-state 1) (toggle-korean-input-method) )) 
 The obvious solution might have been to advise the function, which was the first thing I tried but it resulted in breaking the evil-insert function. Here&#x27;s the advice I tried:
 (advice-add &#x27;evil-insert :after #&#x27;toggle-korean-input-method) 
 Maybe I did it wrong but it made Evil Mode unusable, and the Emacs manual says advising a function called by other functions is is bad practice so I went with redefinition, clunky though it is.
 Frankly I don&#x27;t entirely understand why this works the way it does, but it&#x27;s made me very happy and maybe it&#x27;ll be helpful to others :)

                    <span>How do I remap my modifier keys so that right shift is super, right control is meta, right alt is hyper, and left alt is alt?
 I&#x27;m using Windows and GNU Emacs.
 EDIT: Got something working. It&#x27;s hacky af, but it&#x27;s something. In my .emacs file:
 (setq w32-pass-apps-to-system nil) (setq w32-apps-modifier &#x27;super) (setq w32-scroll-lock-modifier &#x27;alt) (setq w32-pass-rwindow-to-system nil) (setq w32-rwindow-modifier &#x27;hyper) (w32-register-hot-key [H-]) 
 And in AutoHotKey (AHK):
 ScrollLock:: While GetKeyState(&quot;ScrollLock&quot;, &quot;P&quot;) { SetScrollLockState, On } SetScrollLockState, Off Return PrintScreen:: While GetKeyState(&quot;PrintScreen&quot;, &quot;P&quot;) { SetScrollLockState, On } SetScrollLockState, Off Return RShift:: if WinActive(&quot;emacs@DESKTOP-FOO&quot;) { Send, {AppsKey down} } else { Send, {RShift down} Return } Return RShift up:: if WinActive(&quot;emacs@DESKTOP-FOO&quot;) { Send, {AppsKey up} } else { Send, {RShift up} Return } Return 
 I tried to remap Right Win to Right Control, but Emacs can&#x27;t intercept it. It can intercept the real key, but not the artificial one. That means I have to use my pinkies, but it&#x27;s not the end of the world because my pinkies only have to move up one row to hit the two Right Wins. 
 I think that&#x27;s good for now; after all, I can chain them.

                    <span>hi r/emacs I have been an emacs user since 2008. Still have not put in the time to master lisp or configuring emacs. I have a copy-paste config that has landed me in some weird mix.
 My current config shared here. adds 8 spaces in python mode mysteriously and i have tried everything to solve it with no luck. I could use some help.
 Also if some one wants to make some extra $ or BTC i would be happy to pay to have my config set up right. 
 Here is what i would like from my emacs set up:
 - Python development
 - Rust development
 - React development
 - I would like to have autocomplete
 - linters - eslint and I am open to what i use for python amd rust
 - Auto complete - preferably company mode
 - Git integration.

                    <span>I first installed all-the-icons-ivy-rich-mode with the required fonts and then installed neotree file manager but not all the icons are loading some are missing.
 What should I do to solve this problem?

Been looking at haskell.org but if you have a recommendation and want to save me hours of trying to find and familiarize myself with something that isn&#x27;t quite what I need, well, I would appreciate it very much. I know I could just use plane text pbm but I don&#x27;t really want to. Thanks!

 I am _not_ looking for a library that matches Regular Expressions on a given string. I need to use the parsed Haskell data type for something else which I will be doing inside Haskell itself.
 Thanks!

                    <span>The statement is as follows: Implement an executable program that produces statistics about a file provided as input. The statistics produced must be the number of lines and words present in the file.
 I managed to write the code, but I didn&#x27;t understand how to run the executable with a text file as an argument.
 ​
  The files at the end of the three red arrows correspond respectively to the executable created with \&quot;stack build\&quot;, the file where I wrote the code and the test text file. 
 I tried &quot;stack exec exercicio-exe&quot; but obviously the text file reference is missing.

Sometimes it corrects itself and the normal color pallet appears and other times I have to close the buffer and reopen the file to get it to render correctly. I&#x27;ve tried looking online but I haven&#x27;t found others with a similar issue. I&#x27;m unsure of the name of the feature that I&#x27;m interacting with here either.

 For system information, I&#x27;m using Doom on Emacs 27.2.

                    <span>Hi folks 
 I am proud to release a project, which took me a decade to develop (though first 5 years I worked in Java). There are many new ideas and Scala3 became the ingenious technology to make them happen.
 Scalqa stands for &#x27;Scala Quick API&#x27;. It is built around fast proprietary collections, which support unboxed processing of primitive types.
 It also provides a standardized way to define opaque data based on Java primitives. Data elements naturally inherit built-in specialized collections.
 A simple J.Benchmark test
 import scalqa.{*, given} val array: Array[Int] &#x3D; (1 to 1000).toArray J.Benchmark( (&quot;Array&quot;, () &#x3D;&gt; array .map(_.toLong).filter(_ % 2 &#x3D;&#x3D; 0).sum), (&quot;Iterator&quot;, () &#x3D;&gt; array.iterator.map(_.toLong).filter(_ % 2 &#x3D;&#x3D; 0).sum), (&quot;Scalqa Stream&quot;, () &#x3D;&gt; array.~ .map(_.toLong).filter(_ % 2 &#x3D;&#x3D; 0).sum), ) 
 yields output
 Final Result. Total length is about 12 secs --- ------------- ------- --- ------ --- --------- Num Name Ops/Sec % Memory % Avg Value --- ------------- ------- --- ------ --- --------- 1 Array 29.8k 30 97.6kB 100 250500.0 2 Iterator 27.3k 28 45.9kB 47 250500.0 3 Scalqa Stream 97.4k 100 517B 0 250500.0 --- ------------- ------- --- ------ --- --------- 
 Memory consumption clearly indicates unboxed processing.
 The value proposition is: Scalqa is much simpler and faster than general language API. Also, one can immediately be efficient with opaque types, which otherwise would take long time to get right.
 The project feature set is complete, but any good ideas (based on feedback) will still be taken in before version 1.0 in late Fall.
 Any discussion will be appreciated, for larger questions please use the new GitHub discussions feature.
 PS. The documentation is still &quot;work in progress&quot;, sorry for any inconsistencies you might come across.

                    <span>Hello guys, a emacs and doom-emacs newbie here. I recently installed emacs and doom-emacs and I wanted to make doom-emacs ready for python development just like pycharm or vscode with autocompletions and code navigations atleast. So, I followed this link from the official documentation and installed mspyls as the language server for emacs. It did work and it does give me autocompletion for the inbuilt modules but for third party libraries like pandas and numpy it gives me a :
 unable to import pandas/numpy [import-error] 
 I&#x27;ve install pyenv in emacs for pyenv-mode as well as installed pyenv in my machine. I&#x27;ve activated the environment through emacs and emacs shows the name of the environment as well as the version of python in the bottom right corner. I&#x27;ve also installed pandas and numpy in that environment but emacs is not able to recognize the packages.
 Screenshot of emacs with pyenv:

 Also, I&#x27;ve tried some other links like this where packages like pyvenv is suggested. Although I&#x27;ve managed to install pyvenv and also create/activate the virtual environment from it and also install pandas and numpy in the virtual environment, emacs is not able to import third party packages.
 Screenshot of emacs with pyvenv:

 Any help would be appreciated to resolve this error.

                    <span>Is there inbuilt functionality or package that requests root permissions when editing files that are required to be edited as root or with a program like sudo?

                    <span>I&#x27;ve discovered that Emacs and/or Org-Mode is a &quot;rabbit hole&quot; (there&#x27;s an actual post about this in this group). 
 ​
  : I&#x27;m not an expert at either Emacs or Org-mode. 
 But Org-mode and Emacs are both very large systems, and sometimes I feel like they really are so large, and so complex - that there is a trap, of tinkering with E/O and never getting anything done (of value-add). 
 However - playing devil&#x27;s advocate - building / configuring org-mode / emacs is alot like building your own light saber / becoming a jedi: incredibly powerful tools / processes, but in the wrong hands, they are worthless, or dangerous. Only when used correctly can they help you actually get real work done. 
 It hasn&#x27;t taken me long to figure out that the only real way to &quot;master&quot; (use competently) org-mode/emacs is to just dive in, figure out what YOU want out of your management system, and go for it. 
 if you find your self at a dead end, it&#x27;s probably not a limitation of the system, but a limitation on your specificity of your goal / problem. 
 However complex, labyrinth-ian both systems get, they will never be outpaced by other &quot;note taking &quot; apps . 
 Why? 
 ​
 because org-mode and emacs are both more about the processing of text than simply note-taking. 
 ​
 I really think that the future of org-mode however, is to move away from some of the architectural constraints of emacs.

                    <span>Consider this newtype:
 newtype Stacked f a &#x3D; Stacked { unStacked :: forall r. f r -&gt; f (a, r) } deriving Functor 
 With this you can define an Applicative instance for any Functor:
 instance Functor f &#x3D;&gt; Applicative (Stacked f) where pure x &#x3D; Stacked (fmap (x,)) Stacked p  Stacked q &#x3D; Stacked (fmap (\(f, (x, y)) -&gt; (f x, y)) . p . q) 
 Here the tuples that are returned form a sort of stack which can be pushed to as in the pure function and popped as in the definition of .
 I found this pattern in the future parsers described in Section 4.6 of &quot;Combinator parsing: a short tutorial&quot;. Their Pf st a is coercible to Stacked (ReaderT st Steps) a.
 Does this newtype already exist in some library?
 This also reminds me a bit of monoidal functors. Is there some connection to category theory here?

                    <span>Hi, I am new to scala and I have been trying to understand case classes and I came across this
 case class Block(b1: Pos, b2: Pos):
 // Additional Methods
 case class Pos(row: Int, col: Int):
 // Additional Methods 
 val b &#x3D; Block(Pos(0, 0), Pos(0,1))
 val c &#x3D; Pos(0,0)
 b &#x3D;&#x3D; c // Returns False 
 My question is how are b and c being compared, if they are different case classes ? Does scala assume they are of the same type ?

                    <span>Hi guys,
 I&#x27;m new to emacs and I just installed ivy, counsel, swiper, flycheck, paredit and the base company packages. I think all that is left is an auto-completion package (if there are other stuff I might need but don&#x27;t know, please say so).
 In my search for auto-completion packages, I came across rtags, irony, ycmd and cquery, I&#x27;ve seen comments about rtags and irony not being good for large projects (although rtags can handle larger projects than irony). I&#x27;ve also heard that rtags wouldn&#x27;t work if there are many errors and that there were some problems when the irony server was up for long. I visited ycmd&#x27;s repo, and it seems to now be unmaintained: abingham/emacs-ycmd: Emacs client for ycmd, the code completion system. (github.com) 
 Many people said that they were interested in cquery, but most of what I found was from a few years back, so I just wanted to ask how far have these packages come? can I use a combination of them at once? are there stuff that one is better at than the rest at?
 Thanks in advance!

                    <span>I&#x27;m very interested in using emacs to write college papers, since I do all of my note taking and organizing on there as well. However, the formatting requirements have left me stuck writing papers in LibreOffice. The research I&#x27;ve done is mostly geared towards people writing technical papers, not general English/non-technical papers. Does anyone on here use emacs to write papers? Are there any special tools or features you use that make it easier?

                    <span>So I&#x27;m doing some programming exercises from a site called exercism, because even simple programming problems can be fun and give you an opportunity to learn things. One of the exercises is about detecting anagrams in a list.
 There are lots of ways to do it, but decided to try something that was less about manually iterating through the characters in a word myself and more about using built-in functionality.
 (defun anagrams-for (word anagram-list) (cl-loop for drow in anagram-list with tmp-drow &#x3D; drow unless (equal (downcase word) (downcase drow)) do (setq tmp-drow drow) unless (cl-mismatch (cl-sort word &#x27;&lt; :key &#x27;downcase) (cl-sort drow &#x27;&lt; :key &#x27;downcase)) collect tmp-drow)) 
 First, that with tmp-drow &#x3D; drow absolutely does not work as I expect. The cl-loop is supposed to set variables in a let* manner, but when that with is called, drow is still unset. That&#x27;s why I do the setq later.
 Second, cl-sort is destructive, so I thought I&#x27;d be able to copy the value into tmp-drow and avoid the rearranging of pointers that it performs. However, that&#x27;s not the case. Is there a way to explicitly make a copy of the data, not just what&#x27;s being pointed to?

I tried using Corfu, everything works fine as expected but whenever I try to use corfu in c-mode buffers while using Elgot as LSP client and ccls as server, it doesn&#x27;t show me any completions whereas Corfu works for me in Zig, Rust, Python and JavaScript modes. Can anyone help me?
 I also tried vertico, but it doesn&#x27;t show completions for everything like if I press :e in normal state while using Evil mode, it doesn&#x27;t show me completions. Maybe I&#x27;m missing something, can you guys help me out!

                    <span>So i don&#x27;t like vim &quot;hjkl&quot; model, and installed doom emacs to try out some alternatives. I really like default binds shown in tutorial like C-v / M-v / C-f / C-b / C-n / C-p / C-u etc.
 I was really disillusioned when i discovered that tutorial does not apply (evil). Tried to disable evil manually but now space doesn&#x27;t do anything. 
 I always first learn the tool, then customize/ tinker with, so i would really appreciate any advice on &#x27;out-of-the box variation&quot; like doom that is not evil.

                    <span>I have used lsp mode with web mode along with some other minor modes for web app developments. But the performance was too bad for me, of course i don&#x27;t have a state of art computer (pretty old one actually), but thats really no excuse for pure performance, by poor performance i meant ram usage, speed, processor usage etc. For example when working on a react project in typescript (tsx created by CRA), the ram usage increased up to several gb and eventually or immediate there were input lags and really slow and sluggish performance. meanwhile i found vscode very performant on same machine on same project. lsp isn&#x27;t slow for any other mode, i use it frequently for go, python, c/c++, they work smoothly. Then i tried out tide in web mode, and boy it was a good change. tide works out of the box, very well, fast enough and it didn&#x27;t eat up so much ram either. i am not very familiar to elisp tracebacks, so just moved on to tide, instead of going deeper. i feel somewhat guilty for that, but i just don&#x27;t know where to start or where to look at, cause lsp-mode code is huge and i don&#x27;t know where to begin.
 Anyway, did anyone else have this problem? If so, did you find any solution? I looked into the git issues but not much luck. I am liking tide very much, great project.
 If you are wondering about my emacs configs here they are.

                    <span>Hi. Please help me implement alternating background color under each section in emacs outline minor mode. Org mode has this feature where each section (the region between headings) have a different background color to help you see the different regions of text better. Magit also has this feature. Please advise. Thank you!

                    <span>I&#x27;m using emacs and org-mode at work for note taking and task management. Until now I&#x27;ve used my own laptop for this and it&#x27;s been working very well. I&#x27;m also looking to integrate org-roam in my workflow as soon as v2 is stable.
 We&#x27;ve only recently been handed work laptops, so currently I&#x27;m travelling with both laptops, which is not really convenient. As the work laptop (Windows 10) is heavily secured (no admin access, no installs of apps in user context either, lots of security-related logging and alerts, ssh client disabled), I guess that the only way to use emacs on this thing is over https (which is monitored as well, mind you). I do have experience with self-hosting some stuff on my own domain, so I&#x27;m looking for a web application I can self-host which allows me to use emacs over a web browser.
 There are many pieces of information about this, such as
  
shell apps: gotty, web-console, gateone, shellinabox, butterfly, webssh: most seem no longer maintained and there&#x27;s no clear indication regarding conflicts with key mappings between the browser/app and emacs ;
 more specific emacs/orgmode apps: cloudmacs, organice, orgmodweb, filestash, org-web: they are more limited by nature, but I might use them if they have support for custom agenda views which I use heavily ;
 the use of chrome web app mode or spacemacs to resolve the keymapping problem.
  
So, before going through each and every combination, or having to torture my muscle memory, does anybody have a thorough (and positive) experience of using emacs, or at least org-mode, in a browser on a daily basis ?

                    <span>Did someone manage to setup eglot correctly with straight.el? I would like to give it a try (lsp-mode is somewhat too bloated for my taste), but it looks as if there is some friction between those packages. For example both of those issues are still present although are marked as closed.

                    <span>I use spacemacs with a ton of packages and memory-report says this:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; Estimated Emacs Memory Usage
 65.8 MiB Overall Object Memory Usage 26.8 MiB Reserved (But Unused) Object Memory 12.1 MiB Memory Used By Global Variables 6.7 MiB Memory Used By Symbol Plists 1.3 MiB Total Buffer Memory Usage 0.0 KiB Total Image Cache Size
 Object Storage
 25.7 MiB Vectors 18.2 MiB Strings 17.9 MiB Conses 3.0 MiB Symbols 1.1 MiB Intervals 22.3 KiB Buffer-Objects 6.3 KiB Floats &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 A quick glance tells me that&#x27;s &lt;200MiB which sounds about right.
 However, top reports Emacs as using ~583MiB in total and this climbs to gigabytes over the course of a few days. Emacs never uses this memory more than once because it&#x27;s almost always swapped out.
 I have disabled GC because it makes Emacs a stuttery mess but I set up a trigger set up to GC whenever Emacs loses focus (which is often) and doing a manual GC doesn&#x27;t change anything about Emacs&#x27; RAM usage.
 This is happening on both Linux and OSX with 27.2 and 28.5.
 Does your Emacs ever give memory back to the OS?
 How big is the delta between the tallied-up memory-report and real-world usage? (as reported by top in its USED metric (RSS + SWAP).

                    <span>Hello there,
 In the past couple of years that I&#x27;ve been using emacs, I&#x27;ve never had a reason to give org-mode a try, but now I do. I Installed linux and wordpress on a raspberry-pi-4(which I&#x27;m going to use as a local web server to host the blog), and was able to get wordpress up and running nicely with some themes and plugins.
 When searching: does emacs work with wordpress, I saw this org2blog emacs package: https://github.com/org2blog/org2blog .
 Anyways, my goal is to use this local pi linux web server to host a simple wordpress blogging website. At 1st I just want to have a single web page, where I post a professional photo of myself with a hyperlink to my github projects. Eventually, I would like to do full blown blog posts with all kinds of stuff, like for example, if I&#x27;m applying for a particular freelance project, lets say python web scraping, I would want to create a simple python web-scraping application, push the completed project to github, then write a blog post, where I show step by step with coding blocks, how I developed and built the application from scratch. That way I can demonstrate to the client that I have the necessary skills required to complete that particular freelance gig.
 If there&#x27;s any extra wordpress themes/plugins that you&#x27;d recommend for this use-case, then let me know.
 Also, I&#x27;m new to wordpress, so I&#x27;m not sure how remote wordpress development works, I would like to develop the blog using emacs on my laptop, test it to make sure that it works correctly and does not crash wordpress, then push the changes remotely to wordpress on the pi linux web server.
 Thanks in advance for the help!

                    <span>Hey all, this is my first serious attempt at making something in Haskell and I&#x27;d really appreciate any feedback you might have, be it whether something is not idiomatic Haskell or if there&#x27;s a simpler/better way to accomplish something. https://github.com/osoleve/Name-QuickSearch
 The purpose of the tool is to allow for fast matching of names (or other short natural language strings) against another set of names using fuzzy similarity metrics, letting you get, say, the highest scoring name out of a set of hundreds of thousands using Jaro-Winkler in under a second. Most of the speed is achieved using a token-matching heuristic, where the similarity scores are only computed between pairs of names sharing an entire token, with token inventories being precomputed and stored in a hashmap.
 It works pretty much exactly as I want so far, but as a Haskell beginner I&#x27;m sure there are improvements that can be made, and I figured this would be a good place to ask.
 Thanks in advance!

                    <span>When defining a custom record type to match some table, I sometimes want to use record field types other than the default ones assumed by opaleye.
 E.g. for a (Field SqlNumeric), I don&#x27;t want to use a Scientific in the Haskell record type when the scale of the postgresql NUMERIC field is 0; it makes more sense to use Integer instead of Scientific. Similarly, if a column is of a domain that constrains the value to be non-negative, it may make more sense to use an unsigned type such as Word64 instead of Int64.
 Consider the following code:  data Rec&#x27; a b &#x3D; Rec { a :: a, b :: b } type Rec1 &#x3D; Rec&#x27; Scientific Scientific type Rec2 &#x3D; Rec&#x27; Integer Integer type RecField &#x3D; Rec&#x27; (Field SqlNumeric) (Field SqlNumeric) $(makeAdaptorAndInstance &quot;pRec&quot; &#x27;&#x27;Rec&#x27;) recTable :: Table RecField RecField recTable &#x3D; table &quot;rec&quot; (pRec Rec { a &#x3D; tableField &quot;a&quot;, b &#x3D; tableField &quot;b&quot; }) 
 If I try to use selectTable recTable and runSelect to read a [Rec1] it&#x27;s fine, but if I try to read a [Rec2], I get a compilation error (No instance for (Opaleye.Internal.RunQuery.DefaultFromField SqlNumeric Integer). How can I simply map the table to a record type that uses Integer instead of Scientific without adding much boilerplate? I only need to read the tables, not write to them.

                    <span>I recently listened to the following podcast where the guest compared Haskell, Coq etc to the weird stuff you&#x27;d see in a runway show, and that its not really meant for everyone one to wear/use (unless I suppose you are Bjork) but rather to push the envelope. Of course I don&#x27;t agree in entirety. BTW, Not all runway fashion is impractical (example).

                    <span>I created some quick (but literate woo!) scripts to make it easy to automatically tangle and export each time I commit. The generated files are automatically appended to the commit.
 This is handy for generating README.md from README.org which I hope can reduce vendor lock in for org-uses who right now might feel a bit locked into to forgets (like GitHub) that &quot;natively&quot; support Org.

                    <span>Hello!
 I&#x27;m fairly new to org-mode, and have just been familiarizing myself with the basics for the past few days. After going through some excellent posts, I decided to try out org-mode for taking down and organizing lecture notes, and thought I could first try it out on a MOOC that I am taking.
 Now to the real question. As someone who has always taken down notes on paper using a pen, I do not plan to move away from it, and infact would like to org-mode to supplement it. Being a grad student in Computer Science, and Engineering, I realize that apart from taking down notes on a paper, I would need to annotate PDFs, to add notes that, have blocks of code from different stages at different points in the notes.
 Thus, I may potentially have upto 5 sources of notes (yes, seems like a lot): (i) a majority on pen-paper, (ii) annotations in a PDF, (iii) normal notes and points in a normal org-mode text window, and (iv) blocks of code and (v) diagrams. Is there a good way to combine these different sources in org-mode and make it seem streamlined and efficient? Essentially, a good workflow for me to add pdf&#x27;s and diagrams/code to my pen-paper notes and organize them. Is it even feasible, as I am still fairly new to org-mode?
 Breaking it to a simpler need, what is the best workflow to integrate lecture slides (with annotations) with handwritten notes? 
 Note: Please don&#x27;t provide answers such as &quot;Just listen in class don&#x27;t take notes constantly, or you will miss out&quot;, it doesn&#x27;t for me. I&#x27;m someone who relies on writing a lot to understand information, and pen-paper notes has worked well for me. I would love to supplement it with other sources to make it better :)
 Edit: I have come across org-noter, and though I find it to be cool, I don&#x27;t understand most of it, and it seems for a pro-org-mode user! If someone does suggest it, I&#x27;d highly appreciate it if someone explains what it does for a noob user.

                    <span>Ok I&#x27;m brand new in scala and i&#x27;m having trouble trying to define a function to get an array of all of the neighbors of a given cell in a 500x500 grid. Currently my table is:
  
 Cell: Int num_point: Int 
  
 I would like to make the table:
  
 Cell: Int num_point: Int neighbor_cells: Array[Int] 
  
 I thought I had followed to right formula to create a function but i&#x27;m getting errors everywhere about top level specifiers (which is literally a useless error i might add) I believe what I have done is no different than how the main function is declared but mine just doesn&#x27;t work. Anyone able to help me figure out what&#x27;s up. I set it up as best as I could (coming from a background of C++)

                    <span>I&#x27;m using Emacs + LSP to program in C# and Unity and after using auto-completion several times my memory usage goes above 2GB RAM. Even with garbage-collect the RAM usage only goes to about 2GB and never less. Also, this is not a problem of omnisharp as it&#x27;s memory usage won&#x27;t go above the 100MB RAM.
 How can I fix this?
 This is the memory report before and after using LSP and completions:

                    <span>Hi everyone,
 The title says almost everything. I came across this amazing tool based on remark.js called xaringan, but every single tutorial that I read is based on using Rstudio as the suite to create and visualize the slides.
 I would like to use this library on Emacs, but honestly I am not familiar with R and this is the closest post that I found where they dedicate a single paragraph to say that you can use xaringan on Emacs by using the packages Emacs Speaks Statistics ess combined with surf browser.
 Thanks!

                    <span>Found the working js-doc snippet from here.
 Which outputs to
 /** *  * @param {} port - * @param {[]} methods - * @param {} host - * @return */ var connect &#x3D; function(port, methods, host) { 
 I was just wonder how can I have a dynamic cursor inside the parenthesis and at the last of the line, something like
 /** * $0 * @param {$1} port - $2 * @param {$3} methods - $4 * @param {$5} host - $6 * @return */ var connect &#x3D; function(port, methods, host) { 
 So that I can manually enter the type and description on the dynamic cursor positions. Any idea??

                    <span>Have you suffered from these symptoms...
  
Have you been stuck about when to use setq versus defvar? 
 Does it hurt when you see one allows documentation but not the other?
 
 Do your non-Lisp friends think setq is a strange name to define variables?
 Do your fingers cramp knowing there&#x27;s no unified definition interface for variables &amp; functions?
 Do you want to have an elegant, lightweight, syntax for furnishing functions and variables with runtime type checks? ---Including complex checks between function arguments!
  
Dr. Musa&#x27;s “L”anguage “F”eatures lf-define macro cures all ills!
 Come one, come all! Emacs lisp is a no-holds-barred! ⇒ Repo link ⇐

                    <span>As far as I know the Base type family is used to be able to work with normal recursive types like the standard list type instead of data ListF a b &#x3D; Cons a b | Nil.
 I guess there are alternative approaches, but I lack the appropriate terms to reasearch further. Every tip is appreciated.
 The question arose, because I translate Kmett&#x27;s recursion schemes to my own typed language that unfortunately doesn&#x27;t support type families.

                    <span>I am following Get Programming in Haskell by Will Kurt and in Unit1 Ch.5 closures are introduced.
 Specifically Listing 5.5 shows
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 genHostRequestBuilder host &#x3D;
 (\apiKey resource id -&gt; getRequestURL host apiKey resource id) 
 exampleUrlBuilder &#x3D; genHostRequestBuilder &quot;http://amazon.com&quot;
 genApiRequestBuilder hostBuilder apiKey &#x3D;
 (\resource id -&gt; hostBuilder apiKey resource id)
 myExampleUrlBuilder &#x3D; genApiRequestBuilder exampleUrlBuilder &quot;api-key&quot;
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 where closures are being used to make a function that at first accepts host, api key, resource, id as parameters but in the end just the resource and id since the host and api key are often redundant when making api calls to the same site.
 My attempt at the above was different but I&#x27;m able to get the correct answer, ie. a valid url to make an api request
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 exampleUrlBuilder2 &#x3D; exampleUrlBuilder &quot;my-api-key&quot;
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Thus it seems like this closure is overly complicated and in the process I discovered that I can create an alias for a function partially applied to one parameter? What is the advantage of the textbook&#x27;s way of using a closure here instead of what I did?

                    <span>Normally take :: Int -&gt; [a] -&gt; [a] takes the specified number of elements or less, if the list appeared shorter than expected. Now if you wish to distinguish between these cases, you need to check that length (take n xs) &#x3D;&#x3D; n. This is wasteful.
 I&#x27;d like to define takeFoo :: Int -&gt; [a] -&gt; (Int, [a]), which tells immediately how many elements were successfully taken. What is the best name for such function?
 (If you are wondering about my context, this is actually not about lists, but about Text, where length is very expensive).

                    <span>Did you know?
 The first Plutus Pioneer Program had 1,500 students. The second cohort is underway with over 2,800 students learning to code both Plutus and Haskell programming languages.
 Plutus is based on Haskell and will be used to create smart contracts on Cardano.

                    <span>Hi all,
 Just wanted to share my final year university project repo which was implementing a language very similar to Elm:
 https://github.com/georgegarrington/Syphon
 Megaparsec used for parser, Hindley-Milner system (albeit I never implemented let polymorphism) based on this Cornell course used for the type system and custom transpiler made without using a string template library, didn&#x27;t know this was a thing until after the deadline haha oops. Transpiles to ES6 making use of arrow functions for currying and uses React and Electron, useReducer hook in React is essentially the Elm architecture so this was used, and useEffect hook was used to implement subscriptions.
 Would love to know anyone&#x27;s feedback at an amateur attempt at language implementation, and also hope this might help people working on a similar project :)

                    <span>Here is a discussion of newtype. Note 
 newtype State s a &#x3D; State { runState :: s -&gt; (s, a) } 
 And then later
 State :: (s -&gt; (s, a)) -&gt; State s a runState :: State s a -&gt; (s -&gt; (s, a)) 
 which I assume are only the type id&#x27;s from doing :t. Good. And I think I understand that since s -&gt; (s, a) , i.e., (s, a) is a tuple, we are not violating the one-parameter restriction of a newtype. But what does s -&gt; (s, a) mean, i.e., what is a function doing in a type declaration? I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;ve never run across this before. Also, what could this type be used for?

Cast Haskell values with Witch by Taylor Fausak
I’m happy to announce Witch, a library that aims to make those conversions easy and painless. This post will explain my motivation for creating the library and show some examples of how to use it.
Cheap interpreter, part 4: stack machines by Gary Verhaegen
In this post, we’re going to explore a completely different approach: we’re first going to design a stack machine, then write an interpreter for the stack machine language, and finally write a compiler from our toy language parse tree to stack machine instructions.

                    <span>In a major mode, I use general to assign &quot;SPC b b&quot; to command. How do I assign a string to appear under &quot;SPC b&quot; in the which-key popup, only for this specific major mode? My current setup carries the string into other modes, which I don&#x27;t want.
 Currently, I do (something similar to) the following
  (general-create-definer jl/major-modes :keymaps &#x27;(normal visual operator motion) :prefix &quot;SPC&quot; ) (jl/major-modes :keymaps &#x27;org-mode-map &quot;b&quot; &#x27;(:ignore t :which-key: &quot;Babel&quot;)) 
 If I have another key under &quot;SPC b _&quot; in another mode, which-key still displays &quot;Babel&quot; as &quot;SPC b&quot;, rather than the usual &quot;prefix&quot;.
 I have tried looking through the documentation for both general.el and which-key, but I can&#x27;t find the correct way to set a prefix string.

 (M-TAB should call the pcomplete command which, when called after the \ character, shows the possible completions e.g. \real, \alpha ecc.)

                    <span>I have some custom keybindings in elfeed to allow me to mark elfeed entries as &quot;starred&quot; or &quot;favorite&quot; but I would also like to add &quot;starred&quot; entries to an Org agenda category such that they will show up in org-agenda/org-super-agenda without doing an org-capture + org-cliplink.
 I&#x27;m thinking perhaps some sort of query of the elfeed database from Org agenda though I&#x27;m not sure how one might go about that... org-ql?
 Anybody come up with a similar flow?

                    <span>hej fellow &#x27;macsers,
 I am in the process of tuning my configuration so as to recognise different machines and act upon it - for instance by executing particular functions or loading particular files. For this, I rely upon information outside of emacs such as environment variables and/or the desktop resolution.
 In one function, I was able to successfully use (getenv &quot;HOME&quot;). However, in another function, (getenv &quot;HOST&quot;) evaluates to nil even though echo $HOST does show a legitimate value (though it does not show in printenv funnily enough...). Also, environment variables that I have set in my .zshrc and which show up in printenv cannot be called upon.
 Any tips / tricks are very welcome!
 Have a good day :)

 I don&#x27;t know where to look. I tried searching the error, but I can&#x27;t seems to find anything related.
 My Emacs config is here https://github.com/vfsoraki/emacs.d
 I used Emacs in Linux and Mac, and both have the same problem.
 I&#x27;m using Straight to install and manage my packages. I took a guess and tried loading projectile before Magit, but it did not solve my issue.
 I don&#x27;t know where to look. Any tip on how to debug this will be more than useful, thanks!

                    <span>Just spreading the word on a couple of packages that I don&#x27;t see discussed very much, but that I&#x27;ve become a very heavy user of. Hopefully some people will try these packages out and be able to improve their workflows!
 Prodigy: For my job I often have to run various web servers locally, and Prodigy is the best (only?) way that I&#x27;ve found to do that all within Emacs. You can define individual services, and then bring up an overview buffer from which you can start, stop, and view the status of each service. You can also bring up an output buffer for each running service. It has some neat features like being able to define custom statuses for a service that will be triggered based on the output -- for example, when developing locally, I have a couple of services that are set to automatically…</span>

                    <span>Hi
 I want to learn emacs. I am a long time vim user, not planning on learning emacs for just text manipulation.
 I have done some basic elisp coding. But by brain never thinks like lisp.
 Found this amazing video that blew my mind. I am looking for more advanced level emacs/elisp videos, to get over my initial inhibition and think more lisp like. Please share.

                    <span>For a project I&#x27;m working on, I need to parse existing Haskell files into some representation that is able to process them. In a perfect world, there would just be a library that allows for a deep embedding of Haskell inside Haskell. Does something like this exist?
 Maybe I could use parts of ghcide or hls, since they obviously need some way of working with source code, though I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s possible. (and in case it is, if it&#x27;s a good idea)
 Maybe something like this could be done in template Haskell, but I don&#x27;t know a lot about TH.
 A library that compiles haskell down to System FC would also be fine, though not perfect since I later need to generate haskell.
 Has anybody had a similar task?
 How did you solve it?
 Thanks in advance!

 https://storm-framework.github.io/
 STORM lets you write expressive and auditable security policies with the data model. The policies are enforced via compile-time refinement type checking with LiquidHaskell.

                    <span>I am trying to learn Haskell. And thought that it would be a good idea to be able to use VS Code for simple code writing during the process of learning.
 Has anybody else faced this? I would think that ideally I should point VS Code extension to the Haskell-stack installed GHC. Not sure how and don&#x27;t know if that is ideal or unnecessary.

                    <span>I don&#x27;t mean TODO keywords, I mean those that start with &#x27;#+&#x27; like &#x27;#+TODO&#x27;, &#x27;#+begin_src&#x27; etc.?
 Is there some established API? I have tried to search, but I am just getting hits for TODO keywords :-(. Maybe I am searching for wrong term.

                    <span>Following this post of mine. From everyone answer (thanks guys!), I also thought that Scala code may be slow because of JVM slow warmup and startup time. So, I decide to quick implement the java code with almost exactly the same to Scala code to the same merged two sorted list problem. And here is the computing time and memory used.
 Scala, Rust, Python and Java computing time and space
 But what I found is that even Java doesn&#x27;t have the same JVM problem! Java is even on par with Rust! (It may not exactly equal though, because the time unit is too large)
 So, what is the cause of slowness in Scala then?

 I do &quot;successful&quot; PKM for more than a decade (check this out http://hg.defun.work/tips/) figuring everything &amp; building tooling around myself.
 I split data into projects each in own Mercurial repository for syncing:
  
private info (contacts, medic records, etc)
 semiprivate info (shops, contractors, equipment)
 tips in RST format (HTML compiler preview: http://tips.defun.work/)
 cooking in RST format
 blog in MD/RST/Asciidoc/txt formats (for curious http://blog.defun.work/)
 dump with WIP blog posts (2MiB of RST text)
 per employer notes each in a single file (contacts, creds, etc) in Org mode
 dump with notes in Org format - everything else goes here
  
I use Org mode only for one reason: it is possible to mark a section as DO…</span>

                    <span>Hi! I started using notmuch in Emacs as my mail client today. It was quite easy to set up and now I have two email inboxes synced via isync. The issue is that notmuch doesn&#x27;t seem to distinguish the two. As the ones I&#x27;m currently using are my private ones, it doesn&#x27;t matter a ton but I&#x27;d like to bring in my (much! more spammy) gmail and school mail, and would therefore like to know if there is an easy way to separate them.
 Thanks in advance!

                    <span>I have a problem related to cosmetics that isn&#x27;t that pressing, but I am frustrated I can&#x27;t figure out it. I&#x27;m on Windows 10 x64 running emacs 27.2 and org 9.4.4.
 I&#x27;ve added 
 (setq org-ellipsis &quot; ▾&quot;) 
 to my .emacs
 After loading that, when I open an .org file, the character shows up as &quot; â¾&quot; ; same for with describe-variable -&gt; org-ellipsis. I visit my .emacs, M-x eval-buffer and then reopen the org file and it&#x27;s fixed. 
 Any ideas? Is there something weird with encoding?
 I wondered if the font used in my headings didn&#x27;t support that character, but &quot;C-x 8 RET 25be&quot; types it no problem in either default font used in my .org files.
 seems a similar issue occurred with this person as well: although I have not messed with its face settings on purpose https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/48272/org-mode-ellipsis-arrow-is-not-using-my-defined-encoding-utf-8

                    <span>I am trying to compile emacs directly from the repo (not from a tar release). I checkout master and run:
  ./autogen.sh ./configure make  But I get the following error:  In toplevel form: shadowfile.el:77:1:Error: Recursive load: &quot;/tmp/stage/emacs/lisp/net/tramp.el&quot;, &quot;/tmp/stage/emacs/lisp/net/tramp.el&quot;, &quot;/tmp/stage/emacs/lisp/net/tramp.el&quot;, &quot;/tmp/stage/emacs/lisp/net/tramp.el&quot;, &quot;/tmp/stage/emacs/lisp/net/tramp.el&quot; make[2]: *** [Makefile:296: shadowfile.elc] Error 1 make[2]: *** Waiting for unfinished jobs.... make[2]: Leaving directory &#x27;/tmp/stage/emacs/lisp&#x27; make[1]: *** [Makefile:319: compile-main] Error 2 make[1]: Leaving directory &#x27;/tmp/stage/emacs/lisp&#x27; make: *** [Makefile:411: lisp] Error 2  This happens even when I compile from a commit tagged as a release, e.g. emacs-27.1 emacs-27.2. Compiling from a tar release works fine. (tried this on versions 27.1 and 27.2)
 I&#x27;m using Archlinux, kernel 5.12.4-arch1-2
 Note: I am a very new emacs (spacemacs) user and I am not very experienced in the patching/development process in general.

 Don&#x27;t feel constrained in regards to what you post, just keep your post vaguely, generally on the topic of emacs.

                    <span>The 2-character indentation on plain lists doesn&#x27;t work well for me, it makes it tougher to read the structure of deeply nested lists.
 - Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. - Aenean fringilla, neque ut malesuada mollis, elit ex cursus sem, in accumsan justo turpis sed nibh. - Nunc mollis nunc eu faucibus viverra. - Quisque condimentum interdum lorem, vel ultricies arcu suscipit at. - Integer dolor augue, pharetra sit amet augue ac, fringilla blandit leo. Curabitur a consequat purus, sed consequat ligula. - Nam vel blandit sem, ac mattis nisi. Aenean vel consequat ipsum. - Suspendisse sed ipsum porta, tincidunt urna vitae, semper arcu. - Cras vitae mollis augue. - Duis vestibulum at diam eu sollicitudin. 
 Is there a way to get org-mode to display plain list indentation with more depth, similar to what org-indent-indentation-per-leveldoes for headings?
 Thanks!

                    <span>Hi All,
 ​
 Apologies for the question. I have tried searching about this problem, but posts I found do not seem to be the exact same issue.
 ​
 https://preview.redd.it/lurdquh8r3b71.png?width&#x3D;733&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;a3c5f764e216a873f2473dee877aafb9dec36bbb
 The screenshot above shows that I am unable to use any of my linters from python even though they have been installed in my environment, which I use conda.el to manage.
 When I run M-: (executable-find &quot;flake8&quot;), it actually does show the flake8 executable from the correct anaconda environment. I am thus unsure why flycheck is unable to find any of the executables from my linters. 
 ​
 Any help would be greatly appreciated, thanks!

                    <span>I am trying to make a package that generates a type specimen for a font. In short:
  
Prompt user for a font family (e.g. from font-family-list)
 Open temp buffer into which I generate strings, in the font, in various sizes
  
I can do this easily enough for ASCII characters by doing
 (insert (propertize &quot;Lorem ipsum&quot; &#x27;face &#x60;(:family ,font))) 
 And this does work for non-ASCII characters under emacs -Q.
 However for my personal config I have customized the default fontset to use various fonts according to charset or script:
 (set-fontset-font t &#x27;han &quot;MyCjkFont&quot;) 
 In the presence of this customization I find that no matter what I do, MyCjkFont is always used for characters in han. I&#x27;ve tried making custom fontsets, playing with faces, etc., but nothing has worked.
 The type specimen should be ephemeral and self-contained, so I don&#x27;t want to modify the default fontset when generating it (doing so would affect all other windows/buffers, and the changes would persist after killing the specimen).
 Is there a way to do this?

                    <span>Hi there, I have practiced Scala in leetcode for very simple problem, merged two sorted list. And try using Scala, Python and Rust. It surprise me that Scala is way slower and consume more memory than Python! 
 runtime and memory usage of various programming language
 At first, I have implemented the recursive (652 ms) and changed to imperative one to squeeze its performance (464 ms). But its performance still lower than python anyway. Below is the code that I wrote in Scala in imperative style. (Python code is written almost exactly the same)
 // class ListNode(_x: Int &#x3D; 0, _next: ListNode &#x3D; null) { // var next: ListNode &#x3D; _next // var x: Int &#x3D; _x // } def mergeTwoLists(l1: ListNode, l2: ListNode): ListNode &#x3D; { var ll1 &#x3D; l1 var ll2 &#x3D; l2 var result &#x3D; ListNode(0) var cur_res &#x3D; result while (ll1 !&#x3D; null || ll2 !&#x3D; null) { if (ll1 &#x3D;&#x3D; null) { cur_res.next &#x3D; ll2 ll2 &#x3D; null } else if (ll2 &#x3D;&#x3D; null) { cur_res.next &#x3D; ll1 ll1 &#x3D; null } else if (ll1.x &gt; ll2.x) { cur_res.next &#x3D; ListNode(ll2.x) ll2 &#x3D; ll2.next } else { cur_res.next &#x3D; ListNode(ll1.x) ll1 &#x3D; ll1.next } cur_res &#x3D; cur_res.next } return result.next } 
 What is the cause of this? Or Scala is actually slower than Python?

                    <span>As part of my Tweag fellowship, I developed dingo,
a Python package to analyze metabolic networks. dingo provides three methods
that complement the openCOBRA project. The main
advantage of dingo is the efficient implementation
of new sampling algorithms that generate steady states of metabolic networks.
In this post, I’ll explain what this all means and even discuss how
we can use this tool to discover new COVID-19 treatments.
Also check out the audio interview with Apostolos about dingo on the Compositional podcast!
Metabolic networks and COVID-19
Every moment, in every cell of our body, thousands of chemical reactions are
taking place. In cells infected with a virus, some of these reactions benefit
the virus by producing molecules—metabolites—that are critical for making new

                    <span>Does anyone use a zettelkasten for their day-to-day work? For example, taking notes on meetings and the like?
I&#x27;m curious. In my role I find my reading notes often come in handy because I am asked to articulate a position or make some recommendation on something, but I think it would feel strange to start to have a mass of notes on the internal workings of my employer. I wonder if this is something people do, or if they keep it more for personal projects (or for those spaces where the personal and professional overlap).</span>

                    <span>Hello everyone,
 TL;DR: How to get M-. and M-, to work in geiser / guile the way they work for emacs lisp?
 I hope I chose the right community to ask this. Feel free to tell me if I didn&#x27;t, and suggest where to ask otherwise. I am an aspiring lisp / scheme hacker. One thing that I would really get into is gnu guix, the distro which is powered by the guile programming language. 
 So far, all my attempts to combine emacs and geiser whilst hacking guix have gone suboptimally. The main thing that doesn&#x27;t work for me is the ability to jump to a symbol&#x27;s definition using M-. or M-,. This is what I have used browsing emacs lisp code, and I feel this is instrumental to learning the language and how stuff works when you kinda know the basics, but not more than that.
 Thus, I would love to know how I would have to set guile and geiser up so that I will be able to use that most useful function.
 Maybe I am missing something super obvious here that I have not mentioned. Please, if this is the case, feel free to point me to it!
 Have a good day, fellows!

                    <span>Hi all, just wanted to share a thing I made for creating nicer org ids to link to.
 The good thing about org ids is that they allow linking to headlines even if you move things around (when you split off a headline into a new file, say). The bad thing is the ids are UUIDs meaning they contain no information whatsoever on what they’re actually for. This is annoying when you’re editing a link (IMHO).
 So I made something that creates human readable links. This turns out to be a bit involved, as generating UUIDs is stuck somewhere deep inside another function you really don’t want to mess with (separation of concerns apparently is not a thing in org-id code?).
 What it does is when you store a link ( C-c l) it checks whether there already is an ID property. If there isn’t, it creates a new on…</span>

                    <span>I&#x27;ve written something that I wish existed when I was at the beginning of exploring emacs: a full breakdown of how I program in emacs (vue, react, python,etc), how I use org-mode to organize my todos and time tracking, and how I do basic IDE stuff like search and replace, window management, etc in emacs. I&#x27;ve also included installation and configuration instructions for everything I do in emacs. 
 According to my clock-table, this apparently took me 24 hours and 39 minutes to write lol. We&#x27;re in lockdown here in Taiwan so there&#x27;s shit else to do. 
 Anyway here&#x27;s the link
 I don&#x27;t have any kind of ads or tracking on my blog, I don&#x27;t know really what my objective is for maintaining it but I feel a compulsion to do so and it feels productive to write blogposts, so I&#x27;m not going to question it further /shrug

                    <span>I&#x27;m attempting to use tramp to edit files on the raspberry pi, how do I get it to work? I&#x27;m typing C-x C-f &#x27;/ssh:rootUsername@ip:/&#x27;, but the second I type the final slash, emacs freezes until I press C-g. What could I be doing wrong? I should add I&#x27;ve shared ssh keys, which works flawlessly in the terminal.

 Edit: fix was found here: https://blog.karssen.org/2016/03/02/fixing-emacs-tramp-mode-when-using-zsh/

 needed to use it on the local and remote shell (which both use zsh)!

gist
  
I recently made a post about deriving GADTs with DerivingVia and it got me thinking if I could implement generic definitions without so much boilerplate. The standard way of defining such a generic instance with GHC.Generics is to define a type class
 class GBinaryPut f where gput :: f t -&gt; Put 
 with an instance for each of the polynomial functor building blocks
 instance GBinaryPut V1 where gput _ &#x3D; pure () instance GBinaryPut U1 where gput U1 &#x3D; pure () instance (GBinaryPut a, GBinaryPut b) &#x3D;&gt; GBinaryPut (a :*: b) where gput (x :*: y) &#x3D; gput x  gput y instance GBinaryPut a &#x3D;&gt; GBinaryPut (M1 i c a) where gput &#x3D; gput . unM1 instance Binary a &#x3D;&gt; GBinaryPut (K1 i a) where gput &#x3D; put . unK1 
 So I thought if there was a nicer way of writing this. generics-sop alread…</span>

                    <span>Essentially, a friend of mine was like &quot;How do you even read a file in a purely functional language?&quot;
 So I sat down with him and wrote a program that is essentially the cat tool without all the bloat like --help and stuff: take filename in, read the file, print it out. And that program literally takes two lines of Haskell code. It came out so concise without me even trying that I just had to share it with you.
 import System.Environment (getArgs) main &#x3D; getArgs &gt;&gt;&#x3D; (readFile . head) &gt;&gt;&#x3D; putStrLn 
 It&#x27;s actually just one line of useful code if you exclude the import statement. Show me a language that can do it more elegantly! I&#x27;ll wait...

                    <span>Today I was writing some code with newtypes. I was writing code with the whole unwrap-modify-wrap pattern.
 ​
 newtype Foo &#x3D; Foo { unFoo :: Char } myFunc &#x3D; Foo . doSomething . unFoo 
 I had another newtype. Pretty soon I had single lines with multiple wrappings and unwrappings. E.g.:
 newtype Bar &#x3D; Bar { unBar :: String } somePolymorphicFunc :: Int -&gt; a -&gt; [a] -&gt; [a] modify (Bar . somePolymorphicFunc x (unFoo y) . unBar) 
 I didn&#x27;t like this line. Then it hit me: dealing with newtypes was supposed to be a solved problem. Instead I could write:
 ​
 modify (coerce somePolymorphicFunc x y) 
 And it would magically work, right?
 ​
 Wrong. While GHC could tell I wanted to turn somePolymorphicFunc into an Int -&gt; Bar -&gt; Foo -&gt; Foo, it didn&#x27;t know what type to coerce it from. I&#x27;d have to write.

                    <span>As I continue to dig into continuations I wondered if I could add shift and reset to LogicT. The immediate problem I ran into is that LogicT uses a forall r. internally and so even though you can write shift and reset, you can&#x27;t actually use the lambda you get from calling shift.
 So the first thing I did was to change LogicT to expose r:
 newtype LogicT r m a &#x3D; LogicT { unLogicT :: (a -&gt; m r -&gt; m r) -&gt; m r -&gt; m r} 
 Then I quickly copied over a bunch of the definitions in Control.Monad.Logic no problem. I had to generalize the types of course to add r but it was trivial to do. There&#x27;s a few things I haven&#x27;t converted yet like msplit, but I don&#x27;t expect to run into any issues.
 I ended up with these shift/reset operators:
 resetT :: MonadFail m &#x3D;&gt; LogicT r m r -&gt; LogicT r&#x27; m r resetT &#x3D; lif…</span>

                    <span>Heya all.
 I have a long history as a software developer, both in commercial environments and in academic research labs (mostly C, Scheme/LISP, Python, some Java). Back in 2013 I got into Spark and Scala working for a startup and kind of burned out by 2015. I decided to try new things and bought a farm and spent the last 5-6 years growing food, working outside etc. However, I find myself wanting to go back and at least pick up contracts/gigs to make some additional income, invest more into my retirement etc.
 It has been 6 years since I looked at Scala and I know things have changed since.
 A few questions: 1) what is the easiest/best way to get back in the game and refresh/catch up on everything that happened in the language? and 2) will anyone even consider me after a multi-year unrelated gap in my resume? When I &quot;retired&quot;, I was at the senior level but obviously do not expect to get back at that level (no ego here). What is the best way to approach this - where do I look, how do I approach potential employers?
 Thanks!

                    <span>Often I find I&#x27;m working in a window that I find too short, and I want to delete the window(s) above it so that it can be vertically maximized. Dos anyone have a good way of doing this? I know there are many window management packages out there, but I have not found this particular functionality &amp; I will be honest, I have tons of &#x60;(use-package)&#x60; declarations in my startup that I don&#x27;t really understand; I&#x27;d like to avoid adding more of them!

                    <span>I just started doing journals after learning Emacs and Org for a week, and I&#x27;ve settled on a style that works for me as someone with ADHD. I&#x27;d like to be able to start a new weekly journal with the same style as I&#x27;ve made myself, just to save some work and keep things consistent. I know I&#x27;d have to edit my .emacs for this, and the syntax mostly makes sense to me, but I have no idea where to start. Any help is appreciated, thank you!
 The template I&#x27;d like to set, with the dates automatically set for the week each time:

                    <span>I didn&#x27;t have much luck trying to debug the issue, so I would like to ask if also somebody else encountered it.
 Sometimes when I want to reply to an email in mu4e, the whole Emacs freezes and I need to kill it. I don&#x27;t know what triggers it but it is 100% reproducible on certain emails. For the rest, everything works fine.
 Do you have some suggestions, please?

                    <span>I used to use neotree, and recently switched to treemacs. I like treemacs find. It seems to be the new thing people are using. Spacemacs seems to have shifted to it by default. BUT there&#x27;s one big flaw IMHO: With neotree, the file tree for the project that I was currently in appeared; with treemacs, a whole set of projects appear other than the one that I am working in. This adds extra noise and in some cases is just inconvenient because I have to worry about adding/removing projects.
 Is there any way to get treemacs to behave a bit more like neotree?

                    <span>Hello! I often create keyboard macros to (for example) run capitalize-region over org/outline headings, and I was wondering if anyone knows of a way to generalise this class of tasks. 2 possible solutions might be:
 (1.) A (with-visible-region ...) macro, which &quot;maps&quot; its body over visible portions of the current region.
 Or (2.) A &quot;Narrow to visible portion(s) of region&quot; - I have no idea if narrowed buffers can show multiple subsets of a buffer, but I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ve seen some occur-like modes do this and keep the selections editable.
 I&#x27;d prefer the first solution, and it&#x27;s probably easy to implement, but thought I&#x27;d ask about prior art first :) always good to learn new tricks.

                    <span>Hello!
 I am trying to use dap-mode for debugging c/cpp/rust. I cannot find any way to break on abort.
 It should be possible to add a breakpoint at abort() but I cannot figure out how to add this breakpoint without going to the stdlib.h file and adding the breakpoint there.
 My config for dap-mode
 ;; Debug Adapter Protocol through dap-mode (use-package dap-mode :ensure t :config ;; On a new system need to call &#x60;dap-gdb-lldb-setup&#x60; to setup the ;; vscode extension automagically (require &#x27;dap-gdb-lldb) ;; Bind &#x60;C-c l d&#x60; to &#x60;dap-hydra&#x60; for easy access (general-define-key :keymaps &#x27;lsp-mode-map :prefix lsp-keymap-prefix &quot;d&quot; &#x27;(dap-hydra t :wk &quot;debugger&quot;))) 
 Thanks in advance :)

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been committing myself to use org mode more. One thing I&#x27;d like to do is integrate diagrams for some of the systems I&#x27;m responsible for and for personal coding projects. 
 I&#x27;ve been considering using LucidChart as the diagram editor, but I&#x27;m open to other suggestions as well. 
 Overall, how do you render both PNGs and asci-text style diagrams in org mode blocks and Github READMEs?

                    <span>I&#x27;m storing my tags files in the .git folder for each Git repository, using a variant of this method, with the tags file at the path .git/etags. I would like Emacs to automatically locate and use the tags file, and it should be local to the buffer, because I will probably have files from different repositories open at once.
 This is what I came up with:
 (add-hook &#x27;find-file-hook (lambda () (let* ((tagspath &quot;.git/etags&quot;) (git-root (locate-dominating-file (buffer-file-name) tagspath))) (if git-root (visit-tags-table (expand-file-name tagspath git-root) 1))))) 
 I&#x27;m very new to Emacs (started using it around a week ago), so I figured there must be a better way to do this. Any ideas/suggestions?

                    <span>Hi! This post is mostly to share my joy from making something cool and useful for myself. I started with emacs about a year ago, and have been kinda stuck in a beginner state since then. I&#x27;m a math teacher, not a programmer, and emacs is a little side hobby that I haven&#x27;t spent enough time really learning, in order to reap the benefits of being able to make it do whatever I want. But this last week I put in some time, and I learned a lot, and now I have a cool thing, and I feel like I&#x27;m finally on the road to emacs wizardry.
 Here&#x27;s the problem I want to solve: I have a lot of students, and there are a ton of things I want to remember about each one of them. For example, Bobbo has missed a lot of class the last few weeks, he told me his mom is sick, and I gave him an extension for an assig…</span>

                    <span>I want to run an app in a Docker container, but detached. This causes getLine to throw an EOF exception, since the terminal detaches. That is, if I understand this thread correctly https://github.com/haskell/text/issues/258.
 My app connects to RabbitMQ, and then waits to keep the connection running. Is there a way to wait, that is not dependent on the stdin?

                    <span>I have often wished that I could subscribe to RSS feeds that notify me when new books are published about a certain topic or by a certain author. I recently implemented the idea in the article system of my personal website and created an index of Haskell books.
 https://www.extrema.is/articles/haskell-books
 The index provides a simple UI for browsing by tag, and each book page has basic information and links. By subscribing to the following RSS feed, you get a notification when a new book is added to the index.
 https://www.extrema.is/articles/tag/index:haskell-books.rss
 This is a humble first implementation, but I am posting here in case others find it useful.

                    <span>Subtitle: There is no royal road to Haskell.
 I was looking at a paper talking about pretty printing from Swierstra and Chitil and I thought I would just copy the code and run it
 import Prelude hiding (()) import Data.List (intersperse) type Indent &#x3D; Int -- zero or positive type Width &#x3D; Int -- positive type Layout &#x3D; String class Doc d where text :: String -&gt; d line :: d group :: d -&gt; d () :: d -&gt; d -&gt; d nest :: Indent -&gt; d -&gt; d pretty :: Width -&gt; d -&gt; Layout nil :: d nil &#x3D; text &quot;&quot; prettyIO :: Doc d &#x3D;&gt; Width -&gt; d -&gt; IO () prettyIO w d &#x3D; putStrLn (pretty w d) toDoc :: Doc d &#x3D;&gt; [Int ] -&gt; d toDoc &#x3D; (text &quot;[&quot;) . foldr () (text &quot;]&quot;) . intersperse (group (text &quot;,&quot;  line)) . map (text . show) 
 But of course there was no Doc data type to be found, and the required functions aren&#x27;t flesh…</span>

                    <span>I&#x27;m sure this has been brought up and answered in the past, but I&#x27;m having trouble searching and finding a solution.
 I&#x27;d like to be able to paste a conversation from Slack into an Org document and have it include the formatting from Slack. At a minimum, I&#x27;d like links to work, but it&#x27;d be great if all of the text formatting pasted properly into Org as well.
 Does anyone know of a solution for this?
 Thanks

                    <span>Hi, sorry for the noob question. I have a document with a numbered list like this: 
 ​
 https://preview.redd.it/zoa6kdgausa71.png?width&#x3D;1872&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;1580037bf5221e979af64f7a9f26eafdb7bafa49
 As you can see on the left, its numbered correctly (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). but on the latex doc its (1, 1, 1, 1), is there a way to have the proper numbering while exporting?

                    <span>Hi, I&#x27;m struggling with configuration of metals for emacs on my new laptop with ubuntu that I use at work. I&#x27;ve installed metals via coursier, but when I open a Scala project and use some lsp-metals command Emacs says it&#x27;s not a metals workspace. I use the same emacs config I use on my private Arch PC where everything works fine. Got any thoughts what might be a problem?

                    <span>I am a newbie in Machine Learning Engineer field from Thailand and only have to deal with python and its machine learning package in my profession like pyspark and sk-learn. I would like to expand my skill set by doing side project on the AIoT fields (raspberry pi, backend and frontend) with another programming language which have higher performance.
 At first, I think Rust is the interesting choice as raspberry pi has limited resources and very fun to code.
 But, I am more interested in the new announced Scala 3 since it is the language being used in many of the data science fields. It has Scala.js which can be implemented on frontend. And it is very fun to code in functional style.
 However, in Thailand, the Scala jobs is nearly non-existent.
  
But what about Scala popularity in other countries?
 Any thought on the Scala 3 full stack?
 If Scala is not popular, I would like to hear the reason too.
 And what about Rust popularity in other countries?
  
Thanks in advance for your opinion everyone!

 For those who haven&#x27;t used it yet, ScalablyTyped is a converter that provides an SBT plugin to convert typescript definition to usable ScalaJS types. It is definitely one of the most important projects to the ScalaJS ecosystem, and looks to me as if it&#x27;s maintained by a single person right now. 
 Hopefully this can get some more awareness out for this awesome project and people can drop some thanks toward the author (who I am not).

                    <span>Hello Everyone. I&#x27;m using Emacs everywhere - on my linux laptop and work mac laptop, and whenever I get a chance I&#x27;ll use my large monitor for better screen real estate. I&#x27;m determined to use one init.el file, rather than maintaining several.
 I find I need to adjust the default font anytime I switch machines or screen sizes. On the Mac, I want Emacs to use Menlo, but on Linux I want FiraCode. When I&#x27;m not plugged into the monitor, I want size 11, but I need it the font at size 14 on large resolutions (i.e., greater than 1600).
 I&#x27;m just starting to learn elisp, so I get into trouble pretty quickly. I was hoping to craft something like the following, but also taking into account (string-equal system-type &quot;darwin&quot;). and swapping FiraCode for Menlo in that situation.
 ;; set the font size based on resolution (if (&gt; (x-display-pixel-width) 1600) (add-to-list &#x27;initial-frame-alist &#x27;(font . &quot;Fira Code-11&quot;)) (add-to-list &#x27;default-frame-alist &#x27;(font . &quot;Fira Code-14&quot;))) 
 Then, it occurred to me that I&#x27;m not unique in my situation, and I should just ask if anyone else has Elisp that handles this situation. Will you Emacs wizards share Elisp where you handle this sort of thing?
 In the meantime, I&#x27;m off to find a good Elisp tutorial so I won&#x27;t need to ask for this kind of help in the future. Much appreciated.

                    <span>Hi all, is there a variable or config I can set in emacs-dashboard that will use relative file paths? Right now I have both a windows and a linux emacs I&#x27;m trying to learn/use org-mode for and the Windows recentf file that&#x27;s storing the recent files to display uses absolute paths and it&#x27;s linked via a pcloud directory so it ruins the recents on my linux homedirectoy mirror.

                    <span>I want to make emacs packages like those great peoples have made like
 https://github.com/abo-abo/hydra/
 https://github.com/dengste/minimap
 https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile
 https://github.com/Fuco1/smartparens
 https://github.com/magnars/multiple-cursors.el
 evil mode
 ​
 I also want to make something new for emacs.
 But i dont know how to start and not only start,
 I dont know how to make these projects production based. 
 I&#x27;m doing solely for community purpose to like emacs.
 I need your help.
 ​
 ​
 If you have made any emacs popular packages,
 would you please give me your story how you made it? 
 What resources did you followed to master it?
 Please provide a detail, which sites did you gone , which did you followed , 
 while learning to make packages and learn.
 ​
 ​
 I&#x27;m asking this because when i learn books on emacs, I would only know basic instead of making some project based practical extension, I will be stuck like i&#x27; here learning python and not making anything. 
 ​
 PLEASE HELP
 Thank you

                    <span>Hello everyone!
 I&#x27;m pretty new to Haskell itself and its development ecosystem. I&#x27;m trying to setup a Haskell Language Server for Neovim 0.5 (with native LSP support). Previously I was using CoC and HLS that I installed via ghcup and it worked just fine. Now with new version of Neovim I stopped using CoC and trying to make HLS work with native LSP. I have no idea on how to make my already installed HLS work together with native LSP, so I tried to install HLS via lspinstall plugin, but I always get the same error:
 ghcide compiled against GHC 8.10.5 but currently using 8.10.4 This is unsupported, ghcide must be compiled with the same GHC version as the project.
 I checked a version of &#x60;ghc&#x60; (with ghc -v) on my machine the output is:
 The Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compilation System, version 8.10.5
 I also tried to create a new project with stack new ... to check if that issue persists there and it does.
 Does anybody have similar issues?
 If anybody could share his way of configuring Neovim LSP + HLS that would be great!
 Thanks in advance!

                    <span>Played around with a nice TH tutorial posted here not a long ago.
 I&#x27;ve just copy-pasted relevant code snippets from the article - definitions for relevant generateTupleBoilerplate, generateTupleClass and generateTupleInstance - here is the source. Then in the main module used it for generating 62(current limit) type classes for tuples and their instances - source.
 My question: is that normal for such simple program GHC consumes really huge memory ~1.2 GiB at compilation, while full web-application project based on Servant takes about 400 MiB at max? Talking about RSS memory footprint, tested with GHC 9.0.1 . Either loading in ghci REPL or compiling with ghc -O makes no difference.
 Is this a known issue with TH extension or template-haskell package &amp; its dependencies?

                    <span>Let&#x27;s say I want to build a Set with do-notation, ala []
 bars :: Set Bar basz :: Set Baz foos :: Set Foo foos &#x3D; do bar  (a -&gt; b) -&gt; Set a -&gt; Set b fmap &#x3D; Set.map return &#x3D; Set.singleton ma &gt;&gt;&#x3D; mf &#x3D; Set.unions $ Set.map mf ma 
 And this makes everything work! Very cool, QualifiedDo doing QualifiedDo things. However, it&#x27;s clear that foo doesn&#x27;t require the full power of a monad. ApplicativeDo, here we come. Turn it on, implement some bindings
 pure &#x3D; Set.singleton ma  mb &#x3D; ma &gt;&gt;&#x3D; \f -&gt; Set.map f mb 
 and....bummer
 • Could not deduce (Ord (Baz -&gt; Foo)) arising from a do statement (maybe you haven&#x27;t applied a function to enough arguments?) 
 which unfortunately makes total sense. ApplicativeDo desugars into
 foos &#x3D; (\bar baz -&gt; mkFoo bar baz)  bars  bazs 
 which is trying to use fmap to make an intermediate Set (Baz -&gt; Foo). However, I cannot see a theoretical reason this could not desugar into this instead
 foos &#x3D; liftA2 mkFoo bars bazs 
 given a binding
 liftA2 :: Ord c&#x3D;&gt; (a -&gt; b -&gt; c) -&gt; Set a -&gt; Set b -&gt; Set c liftA2 f as bs &#x3D; Set.map (uncurry f) (Set.cartesianProduct as bs) 
 So it seems like what I want to do is not unsound, but is not possible given how ApplicativeDo works. Am I wrong? If I am, what can I do? If not, has this limitation of ApplicativeDo been discussed anywhere else? Thanks!

                    <span>Let&#x27;s say we have a custom object that uses BlazeClientBuilder. I want to create a Resource out of that custom type, meanwhile properly acquiring and releasing BlazeClientBuilder. How can I do that? I know BlazeClientBuilder has its own Resource implementation, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to have an access to the respective phases.

                    <span>Reading Christian Tietze&#x27;s and Sascha Fast&#x27;s blog posts on the importance of tracking inspired me to track how many Zettels I create.
I figured that keeping a list of Zettels created daily would be useless without a workflow to integrate it in. So, I watched Brian Crain&#x27;s presentation on optimizing productivity, which was cited in one of the blog posts from the Zettelkasten blog. Also, I read this article from the Quantified Self website that I found along the way.
I decided that I want to do something similar to Brian Crain. From tracking how many pomodori he completed, he gained the ability to achieve two things: notice a standard for his good days/weeks/months/quarters/years, and compare how well he did with how well he is doing. I want to achieve the same from tracking how many Zettels I create.
From looking at his setup, I&#x27;d have to track the following:
Total from a year
Total from the first to the fourth quarters
Monthly average
Weekly average
Number of weeks in which I get my weekly average or above it
Daily average
Number of days in which I get my daily average or above it
He tracked more, but this is all I could understand from his presentation and slides.
My problem is setting up an user interface to manage all of this in a way that is simple and allows me to get every item easily. Brian Crain didn&#x27;t talk much about his setup. Also, I have zero knowledge in using spreadsheets. So the question is: How do I achieve what I want to accomplish?
Really appreciate any help you can give me.</span>

 Unicode CJK text (top) converted to PS file (bottom)
 Here is my next iteration on basic WYSIWYG printing in GNU Emacs for CJK Unicode text. Now you can print CJK Unicode text using TrueType fonts (Google&#x27;s Noto Serif CJK font in the image) .
  
Run M-x ps-print-buffer-with-faces to send output to printer.
 Run C-u M-x ps-print-buffer-with-faces to send output to file (PS format).

                    <span>org-attach, for some reason, splits the ID into two parts before creating the path for your attachments:
 #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no (org-attach-dir-from-id &quot;748ec54d-b969-4383-bfd7-1812f2315b84&quot;) #+end_src #+RESULTS: : /home/user/org/.attach/74/8ec54d-b969-4383-bfd7-1812f2315b84 
 Instead of something like this:
 /home/user/org/.attach/748ec54d-b969-4383-bfd7-1812f2315b84 
 Is this the standard behavior or am I experiencing a bug? If this is the standard behavior, is there a reason behind it?
 EDIT:
 I found the function responsible for it and it seems intentional:
 (defun org-attach-id-uuid-folder-format (id) &quot;Translate an UUID ID into a folder-path. Default format for how Org translates ID properties to a path for attachments. Useful if ID is generated with UUID.&quot; (format &quot;%s/%s&quot; (substring id 0 2) (substring id 2))) 
 But I&#x27;m still not sure why it is designed this way. Is there a special meaning to the first 2 characters of a UUID?

 When I started this journey I did not find much material on this topic so this is my reference guide after 1 month of experiments. The coolest part is obviously running emacs on it and connecting it with UNIX tooling.
 Hope you enjoy the read: https://www.lucacambiaghi.com/posts/ipad-main-computer.html

                    <span>I am switching to Programmer&#x27;s Dvorak and don&#x27;t yet have an ortholinear keyboard. The biggest pain point so far is that C-x is really annoying to reach, since it&#x27;s what was C-b on QWERTY. This means that many of my most frequent commands, such as C-x C-s, are a real stretch (QWERTY C-b C-;). How have any of the esteemed Dvorak emacsers reading this made peace with these C-x problems?

                    <span>Is there a function in lsp-mode, or ccls directly to find the compilation command associated with the file (if any) in the current buffer? If not, would another package (rtags, ede-compdb, irony-cdb) help query the compilation database without needing to use the rest of the package? The main use case is to plug it into other tools such as rmsbolt and templight that &quot;compile&quot; code to provide additional information.
 ccls-specific: Can the ccls cache for the current project be queried to obtain a list of all the files currently cached/indexed? If so, can it provide the compilation command associated with each of those files? This would help tremendously with header files in C++ or C.

                    <span>Hi all,
 After reading a lot of posts here and on other place in www I started using Caps and Return long-press as Ctrl. It&#x27;s really nice to have two Ctrl on my Mac without disrupting Caps and Return key. I am using Karabiner BTW to do it.
 This creates a new problem for me where if I press Ctrl with my pinky then it is really awkward to press save and close shortcuts (C-x C-s or C-x C-c). When Ctrl was in corner it was natural to use index and middle finger for those shortcuts but with Caps as Ctrl it feels a bit of stretch to use middle finger for s and index finger for x. That loweing the finger is also not very comfortable.
 Where am I going wrong with my finger placement?

                    <span>I&#x27;m looking for a library for dealing with times and dates far in the past ~1200-1650 A.D.
 I&#x27;m familiar with time and hodatime, but they&#x27;re not really what I&#x27;m looking for.
 I&#x27;d like support for inputting/outputting Julian calendar and Muslim calendar dates, but that&#x27;s not strictly speaking necessary.

                    <span>I&#x27;m a new comer to PureScript, Haskell and other functional programming languages.
 I&#x27;m reading TaPL and want to implement a parser for the untyped lambda calculus in Part I.
 I want to parse the source code with its context which records the names of variables. In Parsec, the parser library in Haskell, there is a parameter u standing for the user-defined state type. On the other hand, there is no such parameter in Parser in purescript-parsing.
 Should I rewrite a parser library with states, or is there a good method to join states with parsers?

 First pair in Scala 3 with the NotGiven feature: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;HQojyuZK-Uo with the written form: https://blog.rockthejvm.com/anti-givens/
 And the second pair in Scala 2 (and early versions of Scala 3.x with implicits), which is much more general (and more dangerous): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;m9LH0hvahcQ with the written form: https://blog.rockthejvm.com/anti-implicits/

                    <span>Crazy question, but is there any way I can pipe the output from ansi-term directly into org mode to then format it on the fly into a table?
 I ask this because I often have to look at logs for work, and though &#x27;CSV-Mode&#x27; has helped for some logs, its not that great on an actual client&#x27;s backend system (CentOS).
 Would love to hear some thoughts on this because so far I&#x27;ve been using &#x27;Line-Mode&#x27; in ansi-term to just copy and paste, make tables on the fly with &#x27;C-c |&#x27; but thought maybe this could be done a bit easier and more direct INSIDE my org mode doc notes.
 ​
 Thanks!

                    <span>When I open a remote shell and try to type anything, there is a super long pause (10-15 sec) before autocomplete shows up. I tried disabling company-shell and company, and things return to normal when both are disabled.
 What&#x27;s going on that&#x27;s making it so slow?

                    <span>I use mu4e with Outlook email for work, and was informed that we would be moving mandatorily to Duo two-factor authentication.
 Apparently Duo is incompatible with IMAP, so I am considering my options.
 I wanted to check whether anyone has crossed this hurdle successfully and has any advice---thank you!

                    <span>I&#x27;m trying to make a switch back to linux after quite a long time away (from before switching to emacs).
 Most stuff just worked but I have a few issues. Specifically right now the thing that is bugging me is different behavior for end-of-buffer. 
 On Mac OS I can jump to the end (or beginning) of a buffer with no issue. On linux the command works and appears to be the same (looked up via C-h k) but in addition to the jump it defines a region in the process. 
 It&#x27;s giving me the behavior that&#x27;s I&#x27;d get on my old machine if I set the mark then jumped. 
 If there&#x27;s a setting somewhere I&#x27;m not seeing it... any ideas?

                    <span>I&#x27;ve found all-the-icons-install-fonts to be ineffective under MacOS 11.2.3.
 I see emacs successfully installing font files under home and running fc-cache:
 $ ls -al ~/Library/Fonts/ ... -rw-r--r--@ 1 user staff 44732 Jul 8 21:06 all-the-icons.ttf -rw-r--r--@ 1 user staff 489672 Jul 8 21:06 file-icons.ttf -rw-r--r--@ 1 user staff 152796 Jul 8 21:06 fontawesome.ttf -rw-r--r--@ 1 user staff 128180 Jul 8 21:06 material-design-icons.ttf -rw-r--r--@ 1 user staff 52544 Jul 8 21:06 octicons.ttf -rw-r--r--@ 1 user staff 99564 Jul 8 21:06 weathericons.ttf 
 However, at runtime, those fonts are not picked up and garbled international characters are shown instead of the icons.
 The solution I found was to forcefully copy all these ttf files into /Library/Fonts(i.e., the system-wide font directory).
 Once in the system wide Fonts directory, emacs successfully picks up fonts with no troubles.
 Please advise if you know a cleaner solution.

                    <span>I wonder what happened to abo-abo, the author of ivy and swiper.
 Since 2015 he made at least one contribution on github, but since beginning of June there seems to be no activity. While this is usual for some users like me, it looks unusual for Oleh.
 I hope he is doing well.

                    <span>I&#x27;m hoping this is a simple started project b/c my ELisp is a bit basic. If I&#x27;m biting off more than I can chew, please let me know. I&#x27;ve written a linear algebra library in Elisp so from a straight coding point of view I&#x27;m okay, but I&#x27;m not very verse in how to interact with the Emacs ecosystem.
 What I&#x27;d like to do is to write simplified version of the ob-clojure. One that doesn&#x27;t depend on running CIDER. The current integration with CIDER seems to be a legacy requirement from when Clojure didn&#x27;t come with a REPL.
 I&#x27;m currently use Octave in a literate mode and it&#x27;s pretty great. I can make plots in-line to my notes and then export it all to HTML. ex: https://geokon-gh.github.io/rocks/orbital.html . With Clojure the equivalent is a bit problematic b/c the core language is very bare so you need to use libraries and this is all managed typically through a deps.edn central config file (or in ob-clojure&#x27;s case, lein). So that suddenly is not very REPL-y and orthogonal to the literal workflow.
 Fortunately this seems to be something you can get around now a days withadd-lib https://insideclojure.org/2018/05/04/add-lib/
 The idea would be to launch an inferior clj process with something like
 clj -Sdeps &quot;{:deps {org.clojure/tools.deps.alpha {:mvn/version \&quot;0.11.935\&quot;}}}&quot; 
 Then you can in a literate way, add libraries on the fly and do the normal literate workflow like in Octave.
 I found a template for how to write a new language support https://code.orgmode.org/bzg/worg/raw/master/org-contrib/babel/ob-template.el
 It seems relatively straightforward - but I&#x27;m unclear on how to launch a clj inferior mode and pipe things in/out of it. Is there some canonical way to do that? (I&#x27;m okay if this only works on Linux)
 Any just general tips and suggestions would be welcome :) and if this is all a bit more complicated than I make it out to be, please let me know. I don&#x27;t want to have to sink a month into this

                    <span>Howdy all!
 I wrote a WAV editor (GUI application) in Haskell which targets long-form narration audio. I&#x27;m releasing a public beta for it and thought I&#x27;d share here.
 It weighs in at ~9kloc and uses the SDL2 gaming lib for graphics and audio playback. The architecture uses a hybrid of OOP and functional techniques: the Model-View-Presenter pattern with FRP (via netwire) driving the UI interactivity.
 The codebase isn&#x27;t super polished and I&#x27;ve yet to write tests, so there&#x27;s bound to be cruft, but any feedback would be appreciated -- do let me know if I did anything exceedingly stupid (besides not writing tests yet, that is)!
 Resources:
  
osabe.app (consumer site)
 dev blog
 code repo
 @osabe_app on Twitter for release announcements, etc.
 @paul_schnapp on Twitter for dev discussion
  
There are a few things I could use some help with if anyone has the time and expertise:
  
There appears to be a slow memory leak with unevaluated thunks that I can&#x27;t nail down (I think somewhere in the Presenter, though possibly the Model)
 I&#x27;m having trouble nicely packaging the app with all the libs it needs on Mac

                    <span>I&#x27;m working on the effectful library and I&#x27;ve encountered that function of such shape is helpful for lifting monadic actions where m r shows in invariant position (e.g. like the unmask callback within mask).
 Hoogle search returns no results.
 The exact signature looks like this:
 withLiftH :: IOE :&gt; es &#x3D;&gt; ((forall a b localEs. (IO a -&gt; IO b) -&gt; Eff localEs a -&gt; Eff localEs b) -&gt; Eff es r) -&gt; Eff es r 
 withLiftH is a working name, but perhaps there is a better name for this function?
 EDIT: Never mind, I realized this function is too permissive and will subtly break when misused with multiple threads (e.g. because you can happily use it to lift forkIO) considering the internal representation of Eff. My previous idea was a bit more complicated, but it&#x27;ll work reliably.
 I thought I could make the API a bit nicer, but this just won&#x27;t do.

                    <span>Let&#x27;s cut to the chase, I have been working with Javascript, Python and recently elixir. I found Elixir incredibly fun, easy to understand and much less verbose than using javascript. Recently I found watched escape from the ivory tower on the Haskell website and was more than intrigued. My concern is that, given that I only have limited time to dedicate to studying after work, should I work focus on Haskell or Elixir. Personally I would love to learn Haskell, but I want to make sure I learn something I will use, otherwise I won&#x27;t improve at it.

                    <span>Hello org-community,
 does anyone have a workaround/fix for the following issue:
 When exporting a document via the latex-backend footnotes inside of verse-blocks are not resolved correctly:
 #+begin_verse lorem ipsum dolor sit amet[fn::This is a footnote] #+end_verse 
 results in the .tex file as
 \begin{verse} Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet\footnotemark \end{verse} \footnotetext[]{This is a footnote} 
 This has the irritating result that in the pdf the footnote is numbered with whatever  is given by the automatic export.
 The expected result would be (at least I think so)
 \begin{verse} Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet\footnotemark \end{verse} \footnotetext{This is a footnote} 
 At the moment I&#x27;m stuck with deleting every [] argument – which works, but is obviously tedious.
 About the document: It is written in a report/book class, so numbering starts anew, when a new chapter is begun. otherwise it probably would stay unnoticed.
 ​
 Thank you for your help!

 P.S.: User of Doom-emacs. But that shouldn&#x27;t matter.

                    <span>Greetings fellow orgonians,
 I&#x27;m trying to figure out if it&#x27;s possible to use org mode to represent repeating calendar events. In typical calendars, repeating events can be specified with rrules. However, while I see that org mode has repeaters, I haven&#x27;t figured out how to do several things that I can do with rrules.
 Examples:
 (1) repeat on the last day of every month
 (2) repeat on every 1st and 15th day of every month
 (3) repeat every Mon, Wed, Fri
 ​
 Is it possible to encode these repeat patterns in org mode? If so, how?
 If not, is there some extension package which enriches org mode with more sophisticated datetime patterns?
 Thanks in advance for any info you can offer!

                    <span>My personal keybindings, installed at Emacs start-up as a global minor mode, are numerous and a disorganized mess. That Time Has Come to refactor while preserving the muscle memory of my existing bindings. 
 I&#x27;m aware of bind-key.el and general.el. Bind-key is sweet, especially for the tight integration with use-package, but I think I need something with a bit more beef, like general.el, not least for its concept of layers, something I crudely reinvented in my own system. 
 I&#x27;m also considering -- seriously! -- the native menu system in Emacs. I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s so disliked. It&#x27;s essentially a visual leader-key framework built rather elegantly from keymaps. No need for which-key.el or transient.el for prompting and discoverability. You can even use it with a mouse of course. I figure that I can&#x27;t go wrong sticking with a framework already built into Emacs.
 An essential requirement for me: I code in Org Babel. I already structure my keybinding code with Org outlines and tagging to make it all easily navigable. This approach I need to keep. 
 Am I overlooking any packages? I&#x27;m facing a year of work. Naturally I must start off right. BTW, I&#x27;ve never used Vim and I am not interested in going down the pure Evil route as in Spacemacs, super-impressive though it is. Kudos to the Spacemacs folks, who have won so many converts to Emacs just as Magit and Org have. 
 I put my fate into the hands of r/emacs.

                    <span>I want to insert a link to a local file via a relative path so that the link still works on other computers my emacs project is synced with. 
 C-c C-l gives a list of options for inserting a link, and three of the options are &quot;file&quot;, &quot;file+sys&quot;, and &quot;file+emacs&quot;. Can anyone explain the differences between these three link types and which would be most portable?
 Thanks!

                    <span>I just concluded the first phase of work on a voice-control mode, serenade-mode. There&#x27;s not yet a demo video, but you can check out Serenade&#x27;s homepage to see what Serenade is capable of, it&#x27;s pretty impressive stuff. I&#x27;m hoping to get some feedback/code review on this since it&#x27;s my first mode, before I begin a Spacemacs layer that will extend it (I&#x27;m a Spacemacs/evil user, and outside that it hasn&#x27;t really been tested). Also, if anybody has suggestions or wants to contribute, that would be great!

                    <span>I use gnus, and I&#x27;ve been learning about org-capture. I like what I&#x27;ve seen several people do, which is to create a capture template for responding to emails. Since this will only ever be invoked from a buffer where you are viewing an email, the template can include clever things, like a link to the email you want to reply to. There is a good example here.
 It seems to me the obvious thing to do is to make this whole process as seamless as possible, and just make the TODO entry a link to a response---the template should include an org link which, when activated, opens a reply message to the original message, just as if I had pressed r in gnus.
 The &#x27;just as if...&#x27; is the tricky bit. I make extensive use of posting styles, and keep all of my email config in gnus.el, which is only initialised when gnus is loaded. I want all this to apply properly when I follow the link, even if I don&#x27;t happen to have opened gnus directly yet in that session (obviously, the link will still have to trigger loading gnus.el). I think this rules out a simply mailto link.
 Even if it didn&#x27;t, I&#x27;m not sure if mailto links can do responses. Standard responses, as written in gnus and pretty much everything else, are generated from the original email (to the original sender, subject should be Re: original subject and so on).
 I know that org links can include arbitrary elisp. Perhaps the answer is a function (a preexisting one, or a wrapper around such), and clever use of some of the org capture expandos?
 How might I do this? Any ideas would be great. TIA!

                    <span>I created a script to allow me to run multiple Emacsen on Mac. I basically create another folder in/Applications like Emacs1.app and link most things in from Emacs.app. I use a different icon for each Emacs so I can tell them apart. I like this arrangement because I can have only related files open in each Emacs or have different searches or find buffers in different Emacs apps. This of course can’t use emacsclient so you don’t get any boost starting Emacs but I don’t care since I leave them running for days or weeks. If anybody wants this script I can share it. I got the different icons from the Homebrew Emacs Plus project. If everyone thinks this is a stupid idea forget I said anything.

                    <span>buttondown.email is a newsletter service and is basically a better substack, there is some glitchyness (I think its only 1 dude working on it) but it is pretty great from my experience. However it only supports markdown. Thankfully it has a API (unlike substack) and Ive developed a solution that allows you to post any org-mode file you have.
 first make and save this python script I made (and probably put it into your PATH) and make it executable (chmod u+x org-buttondown.py) and install necessary dependencies (python-frontmatter and pandoc)

 I have run across a number laborious text editing operations recently that I thought could be solved elegantly with map and reduce concepts from functional programming. Does something like this already exist or is there a better way than what I am thinking?
 Task 1: 
 I like to write / edit in outline form - one bullet per sentence. A common task is to take a specific paragraph of text and split it by sentence into a bulleted list. 
 Task 2: 
 Conversely, the oposite task is to take a bulleted list at certain indentation level and collapse it back to a paragraph. 
 Task 3: 
 Consider that you want to extract all URLs from a buffer and concatenate them into list (one url per line)
 ​
 It occurs to me that the first two tasks could be solved efficiently if there was a flexible ma…</span>

                    <span>Hey Everyone, 
 I&#x27;ve been using emacs for 2 months now, like it a lot. I&#x27;m still trying to figure out the best way of navigating around, and this question is very vague. 
 I mainly do embedded linux work. And it kind of seems to me like there are two approaches to navigating to files as you work on a project. 
 The first approach is that you open a terminal, and move around with cd. When you find a file you want to edit you open up emacs for that particular file, then close emacs when you are done editing. 
 The the second approach is that you just open emacs, and navigate using dired or going to recently opened buffers, never closing emacs. I might also have a terminal open to try running the code.
 It seems to me that emacs lends itself more to the second approach, and perhaps vim is more suited for the first? No idea if that is true, but I&#x27;ve kind of settled into the second approach. I also have just been using the emacs GUI which I also imagine also lends itself to the second approach. 
 I&#x27;m curious how other people have their workflow setup. Anyone else run emacs in a GUI along side a terminal, or is that just weird? 
 Thanks, 
 -Hunter

                    <span>I wrote a recursive function that conceptually ought to work even though there&#x27;s no explicit base case. Specifically, successive elements of a finite data structure depend on (what should be) prior elements. 
 It type-checks and compiles, but when I try to run it in GHCI, it hangs for ~10s, throws a *** Exception: stack overflow, and then several seconds later GHCI is killed.
 There are a lot of things that could be undermining my assumptions.
 I understand that debugging these kinds of things is difficult in Haskell (for exactly the reasons good recursion is easy to do); I&#x27;m only on my first day with this problem. Are there normal strategies or tools for homing in on the cause?

                    <span>I have this simple type of Boolean expressions:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; data BoolExp a &#x3D; BSelect a | BNot (BoolExp a) | BAnd [BoolExp a] | BOr [(BoolExp a)]
 instance Show a &#x3D;&gt; Show (BoolExp a) where show (BSelect a) &#x3D; show a show (BNot a) &#x3D; &quot;! &quot; ++ pwrap (show a) show (BAnd as) &#x3D; intercalate &quot; &amp; &quot; ( (pwrap . show)  as) show (BOr as) &#x3D; intercalate &quot; | &quot; ( (pwrap . show)  as)
 pwrap p &#x3D; &quot;(&quot; ++ p ++ &quot;)&quot; &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 My goal is to be able to parse them. I have written this code:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; import Text.Parsec import Text.Parsec.String import qualified Text.Parsec.Token as P import Text.Parsec.Language (emptyDef) import qualified Data.ByteString as B
 import Regex.Types
 lexer &#x3D; P.makeTokenParser emptyDef
 parens &#x3D; P.parens lexer braces &#x3D; P.braces lexer symbol &#x3D; P.symbol lexer natural &#x3D; P.natural lexer
 pSelect :: Integral a &#x3D;&gt; Parser (BoolExp a) pSelect &#x3D; BSelect  fromIntegral  natural
 pAnd :: Parser (BoolExp a) -&gt; Parser (BoolExp a) pAnd prsr &#x3D; BAnd  prsr sepBy1 (symbol &quot;&amp;&quot;)
 pOr :: Parser (BoolExp a) -&gt; Parser (BoolExp a) pOr prsr &#x3D; BOr  prsr sepBy1 (symbol &quot;|&quot;)
 pNot :: Parser (BoolExp a) -&gt; Parser (BoolExp a) pNot prsr &#x3D; BNot  ((symbol &quot;!&quot;) *&gt; prsr)
 pBool :: Integral a &#x3D;&gt; Parser (BoolExp a) pBool &#x3D; try (pNot pBool)  try (pOr pBool)  try (pAnd pBool)  try (parens pBool)  pSelect &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 I think the grammar I am trying to go for is self explanatory based on the code. However, this goes into a loop for most expressions, even parse pBool &quot;&quot; &quot;! 12&quot;. How can I fix this?

                    <span>Using kind-generics /u/Syrak was able to implement a generic implementation of TestEquality which can be used to derive instances for GADTs. It is not commonly known that this is even possible.
 This is what the TestEquality typeclass looks like, witnessing the equality of arguments:
 type TestEquality :: (k -&gt; Type) -&gt; Constraint class TestEquality f where testEquality :: f a -&gt; f b -&gt; Maybe (a :~: b) 
 By giving a kind-generic instance to Generically1 we are able to derive TestEquality A via Generically1 A, assuming GenericK Wit and GenericK SOrdering instances!

 How can I use newtype to wrap a existed data type in haskell? 
 As I read on https://kowainik.github.io/posts/haskell-mini-patterns#evidence, they can wrap sort function to SortedList. They are using newtype and where can they use smart constructors? 
 Thanks in advance!

                    <span>I find imenu very helpful for quickly jumping back and forth between defuns in buffers containing lots of function definitions. However, when this command is invoked in an org-mode buffer, the relevant units cease to be defuns and become org headings instead. This makes sense in most cases, but when the org buffer is visiting a literate configuration file, it would be nice if imenu behaved as it normally does in programming modes. Example:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; * Section one
 +begin_src emacs-lisp :results silent
 (defun function-one () &quot;This is not a useful function.&quot;)
 +end_src
  
Section two
  
+begin_src emacs-lisp :results silent
 (defun function-two () &quot;This is not a useful function, either.&quot;)
 +end_src
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 When invoked here, I would like imenu to let me choose between function-one and function-two rather than between * Section one and * Section two.
 Is there a way to modify imenu so that it behaves as I&#x27;m describing? Alternatively, is there a similar command or package that provides this sort of functionality?

                    <span>Good day everyone!
 I&#x27;ve always been using scalamock with scalatest only, but now I&#x27;d like to optimize my tests by rewriting long running sequential scalatest suites to uTest. I&#x27;m using default scalatest MockFactory for my suite. I know that it&#x27;s supposed to work with scalatest only and I&#x27;ve seen in scalamock guide that you can implement your own MockFactoryBase and it should somehow work, but I didn&#x27;t really work for me(maybe I just understood guid wrong). 
 I create separate instance of the mock in every test context
 test(&quot;blah blah&quot;) {val myMock &#x3D; mock[TraitToMock] ...}
 Also my project is written using cats-effect, so I&#x27;m running tests also with it&#x27;s IO 
 And in process I faced multiple issues such as:
 java.util.ConcurrentModificationException: mutation occurred during iteration
 It seems it&#x27;s because in UnorderedHandler(which is used in my tests) handle method they&#x27;re using synchronization, but in parent Handler class operations with handlers are not synchronized.
 https://preview.redd.it/7sflfd9ud0a71.png?width&#x3D;1448&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;8eae336304b348946886066c1214c950229c0b71
 https://preview.redd.it/0nglptufe0a71.png?width&#x3D;1334&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;0db3228a4f760d921e495a122ef8c6350364d995
 Wrapping this methods in synchronization helps and tests don&#x27;t fail. But it seems like this fix is not the best solution.
 If I&#x27;m not getting exception listed above, I get like intersection of mock contexts, mocks handle each other expectations. Something like that
 https://preview.redd.it/8wsgaq0ai0a71.png?width&#x3D;3426&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;16b8b9df369e699b5aac7679518fab8cd3b2cc36
 So maybe someone knows how to make scalamock work with utest properly? Maybe I missed something important or overcomplicate things and much easier solution exists? 
 Thanks in advance!

                    <span>Hi,
 I am not a full-time developer/coder. But I have been coding for the last ~17 years.
 I have mainly used java. For almost a decade I did not even use a build tool other than ANT and used Netbeans. Then I shifted to maven.
 Now I want to shift to Scala 3. That requires changing the build tool also.
 I don&#x27;t have a problem when it comes to Scala. Somehow I am not still comfortable with the build tool. I feel I would prefer either mill or Maven, over SBT. Mill because it is said to be faster than SBT and seems more powerful. Maven because it seems to provide the maximum support amongst all build tools in the JVM ecosystem. For example, the Gluonvm plugin works fine on maven, the Gradle plugin is still a mess, and I am not even sure about the status of this in SBT or mill.
 Q1) Do you think it is good to use maven to work with Scala while I captch up and become more familiar with the scala ecosystem. Is it even possible? Workable? Sane?
 My requirements are simple - simple maven projects, quarkus, javafx, gluovm (with graalvm build support). I have some legacy java code I wish to maintain, this is impoart for time being. So if I can universally use the same build tool for java also, it would be nice. 
 Note: Wire (a mobile messaging app) seems to be experimenting with scala and JavaFx, and their build tools seem to be maven: https://github.com/makingthematrix/scalaonandroid/tree/main/HelloFXML3 
 tagging /u/makingthematrix 
 Q2) If not maven, then SBT or Mill, which one fits the above more. My personal bias is more towards Mill, but it has a much smaller ecosystem, so I wonder if it will provide anything close to out of box support for Gluonvm for example.
 ​
 Thanks a tonne

                    <span>The design of a library like linear-base, Tweag’s standard library for Haskell’s
linear types, requires many choices.
One of these choices for linear-base is what a linear Traversable
type class should look like.
One way I use to approach such problems
is to implement instances for the types in GHC.Generics.
GHC.Generics provides a way to implement datatype-generic functions by translating a datatype to and from
a limited set of primitive datatypes representing sums, products, constants, etc.
Therefore, a type class implemented for this set can be given an
instance at a large class of algebraic datatypes.
So this is a nice way to apply structural reasoning to a problem.
The problem
Here is the signature of fmap in linear-base, as it applies, for instance, to lists:

                    <span>Move the Preference setting &quot;Highlight search terms in the editor&quot; to the menu bar. Like the Preference setting &quot;Show image previews in editor.&quot; This will expose it to having a keyboard shortcut. This will make it quick to remove highlighting like this. In this example, I searched for I Need A Frogs Tongue (Don&#x27;t ask.). This is probably a dramatic example, but I daily run into overzealous highlighting, or maybe I should say overzealous searching on my part.
I understand this is meant to be helpful, and sometimes it is. When it is, it is indispensable. When it&#x27;s not, it is an eyesore making it hard to read the zettel.
Will the new MMD editor have this same behavior?</span>

                    <span>Hey all,
I built a small tool for myself and wanted to share it with you  

Context:
Up until recently I sent those to myself in Telegram where it creates a nice preview image of the link, which makes it a lot easier to remember what the link was about.
Solution:
Let me know what you think (maybe I am also the only one who had this kind of problem)


You can find it at link-previews.stephanbogner.de
FYI: It&#x27;s also on ProductHunt

                    <span>I installed which-key today to discover available key bindings. Problem is, if I type C-x, which key shows some bindings in the mini buffer, which often does not fit there, and it shows 1/3 (page 1 of 3). But how do I get to page 2 or 3? If I click on the mini buffer or click on the scroll bar of mini buffer, or type anything else, the mini buffer disappears! What to do?
 Update: After further observation, I noticed two things:
  
I was wrongly using the next page command. I should have been using &#x27;C-h n C-h n&#x27; to get to third page of which-key popup window instead of &#x27;C-h n n&#x27;
 
However, if I use C-h, when the which-key popup window opens up now with available key binding information, it has now two pages, and I cannot use &#x27;C-h n&#x27; to get to the 2nd page. As soon as I type C-h, emacs interprets it as me invoking C-h C-h and reacts accordingly. How do I solve this case?

                    <span>I am using use-package and I am trying to defer the loading of some packages from my init.el. If I understand correctly, this requires that I specify the commands that are to be autoloaded in a :commands block. For some modes, I have found that this is easy and it works. However, for some modes like geiser, I&#x27;ve tried specifying the obvious entry points (e.g. geiser, run-geiser, and geiser-repl) but portions of geiser are still loading and being shown in the features variable. Is there a way to determine what is causing these features to be loaded? I have tried with :defer set both to t and nil with no effect. Perhaps one complication is that geiser already defines some autoload functions (none of which should be called during initialization, I think) and I am not sure how those interact with :commands and :defer.

                    <span>Hi! I&#x27;ve been recently playing with org-web-tools and Elisp in general. I&#x27;m completely a Elisp noob and that&#x27;s why I hope to get more information here. 
 ​
 I&#x27;m trying to to use org-capture to create a custom template (not for ORG mode). What I&#x27;d like to have is following:
 * [[%site-title|site-url]] 
 I&#x27;ve found this function which will create an ORG link using org-web-tools:
 ;; https://blog.lazkani.io/posts/text-editors/bookmark-with-org-capture/ (defun org-web-tools-insert-link-for-clipboard-url () &quot;Extend &#x3D;org-web-tools-inster-link-for-url&#x3D; to take URL from clipboard or kill-ring&quot; (interactive) (org-web-tools--org-link-for-url (org-web-tools--get-first-url))) 
 That function I can use in my org-capture templates like this:
  (&quot;b&quot; &quot;Bookmark (Clipboard)&quot; entry (file+headline &quot;~/work/sync/org/bookmarks.org&quot; &quot;Bookmarks&quot;) &quot;** %(org-web-tools-insert-link-for-clipboard-url)\n:PROPERTIES:\n:TIMESTAMP: %t\n:END:\n%?&quot; :prepend t) 
 However how can I modify org-web-tools-insert-link-for-clipboard-url to create a new string like I&#x27;ve mentioned above. The function should return 
 * [[%site-title|s%site-url]] 
 for a given URL in the clipboard. Thanks in advance.

                    <span>In the past previous years, I have tried variety of ways to boost emacs start up time.
  
server + emacsclient
 use-package to defer package loading
 change GC threshold to large value in init.el
 manipulate pdump
 native-comp
  
So far I was able to load most packages without defer in 1s. I was pretty happy.
 Until today, I saw a startup summary function from https://github.com/daviwil/emacs-from-scratch/
 (message &quot;*** Emacs loaded in %s with %d garbage collections.&quot; (format &quot;%.2f seconds&quot; (float-time (time-subtract after-init-time before-init-time))) gcs-done) 
 Then it reports
 *** Emacs loaded in 0.84 seconds with 40 garbage collections. 
 The 40 GCs don&#x27;t quite make sense since I have changed my GC threshold early on in init.el
 Then I tried the following in my early-init.el
 (setq gc-cons-threshold 8000000) ;; ~8MB 
 The number improves to
 *** Emacs loaded in 0.48 seconds with 5 garbage collections. 
 For an example, loading evil changes from
 Loading package evil...done (0.125s) 
 to
 Loading package evil...done (0.064s) 
 Of course, you can further increase GC threshold, but it won&#x27;t make too much impact.
 ​
 So, I finally find a good use case for early-init.el . And here sharing with here. It would be interesting to see if it works for other fellows.

 Literally the first line:
 &quot;slimhtml is now part of Org, included in GNU Emacs, future bug reports or contributions should be sent to Org directly. &quot; 
 First of all I am emacs noob.
 ​
 I cant find it anywhere, its not in org-export-backends, its not in org export dispatch menu.

                    <span>Not sure if this is possible or not, but I vaguely remember having seen it done in a literate config a while ago.
 E.g. I have something like the table below. Would it be possible to run through it to :bind the keybings or something similar?
 | Key name | Operation | |----------------+--------------------------------| | ~M-~ | Move between windows | | ~M-x ~ | Swap buffer between windows | | ~C-~~ | Next window (key above TAB) | | ~C-TAB~ | Cycle through buffers with IVY | | ~C-x k~ | Kill THIS buffer | | ~C-x +~ | Balance the sizes of windows | 
 I&#x27;m quite unfamiliar with org-mode still, so apologies if this is something obvious or if I&#x27;m explaining things poorly.

                    <span>In the first or second episode in the web series Silicon Valley, Richard Henricks and Jared Dunn interview Dinesh regarding his skills, where he mentions &quot;I Write Sleek, Performant, Low Overhead, Higher-Order functions that will run on anything&quot;. 
 This sentence made me interested in scala. 
 I know it is just a series and it is not necessary that it will have a relation with the real world, but, it just makes me curious.
 So, can anyone explain the relevance of the sentence in the real world?

                    <span>In the excitement around Scala 3, I&#x27;m curious to get a sense of what the norms are (or likely to be) for backend web development at your company (for those who use Scala at work). Or simply - what would you recommend?
 From what I&#x27;ve explored just messing around, Play, Scalatra, Jooby, Vert.x. Thinking of a FastAPI/Flask/Falcon equivalent ideally.
 How do you find Java interop generally? Is it as simple as using a Java library from Scala?
 In a similar vein, what&#x27;s your preferred database interaction library? (I Love SLQAlchemy Core in Python, and Dapper in .NET).
 I&#x27;m also very very curious, coming from Python originally, how you think the migration from 2.x to 3.x will go. (Especially in terms of timeline). Python 2 to 3 was long and a bit painful, but from everything I&#x27;ve read it should be a faster and more comfortable transition for Scala.
 Lastly - it seems SBT is still the tool of choice? Are build times still tricky even with Scala 3? Is it worth hanging around for those to improve, or looking into Mill, or trying to get Gradle to play nice?
 My goal is to dive in and get familiar with the Scala world, but also, evaluate it for use at work.
 Warm thanks!

                    <span>Hi All, so i am reading the red book, part 4 about the effects &amp; I/O. So after reading most of the chapters. I think I got an understanding of IO monad, please comment about it to solidify my understanding .
 So an IO Monad provides methods to execute side effects. so i can use those provided methods for sequencing computations, that depend on side effect ( reading data / writing data ) . More like a effects interface / type class.
 ​
 Thank You
